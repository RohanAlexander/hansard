The mea'sure introduced in the New Zealand Legislature by Mr Hindmarsh copies the provision which has, in some cases, given . so much satisfaction, and, in other cases, some little dissatisfaction in connection with elections in Australia. Through the courtesy of Mr receive full praise and credit from the Holman, I am able to read a quotation from one great journalist, who, amongst his brethren, stood out, like Himalaya, so high did he stand, and so revered is his memory now wherever the English tongue is spoken. I allude to the late Sir James Knowles, who created and carried to splendid success, the Nineteenth Century, which is now known as the Nineteenth Century and After. In Mr Wilfrid Ward's Ten Personal Studies, on page 75, there is the followingMore than a quarter of a century's experience has sufficiently tested the practical efficacy of the principle upon which The Nineteenth Century was founded, of free public discussion by writers invariably signing their own names ! The success which has attended, and continues to attend, the faithfu l adherence to this principle, proves that it is not only right, but acceptable, and warrants the hope that it may extend its influence over periodical literature until unsigned contributions become quite exceptional. No man can make an anonymous speech with his tongue, and no brave man should desire to make one with his pen ; but, having the courage of his opinions, should be ready to face personally all the consequences of all his utterances. Anonymous letters are everywhere justly discredited in private life, and the tone of public life would be raised in proportion to the disappearance uf their equivalent-anonymou s articles -fro m public controversy. In so far as The Nineteenth Century and After has helped to further that good end, it may claim for the Writers, whose names are recorded in the following catalogue, that they have rendered a public serviceKnowles considered this to be the greatest achievement of his literary life. As one who has borne the brunt and turmoil of over a score of years of political life, I may say that many a time. I have seen the keen energies and brilliant brains of a member of the fourth estate sink under the pressure of long hours, and, frequently, of not too-well-paid work. I know of no profession where the stress of mental labour is so severe as in that of the ordinary literary hack on any of our great daily newspapers ; I think he would be the last to seek to have his profession severed from present day ethics. A leader-writer of to-day is the only one, I think, who follows the [102]2 sophism of writing on either side of a question at the command of another; and this is only done because journalism is under the shadow of secrecy. If a leader-writer of well-known critical powers and wide experience were to throw his whole energy and determination into his work, and to append his name to his writings, he would public, and would become fairly well known, even as the politician, thus making the bridge between journalism and politics much easier than it is to-day -Ask any ordinary man in the street who writes the splendid articles that appear in the daily press of Melbourne, and he is, in all but a few cases, unable to say. Those who care to make inquiries can learn, perhaps, that a splendid article in the Age on jamin Hoare, or, it may be, written by Mr Schuler, or Mr Pratt; and if those articles were signed by the writers they would carry much more weight than they do when cloaked with the editorial "" We."" This is one reason why the French Ministry contains more journalists than perhaps the Ministry of any other European country. There are five or six journalists in the French Ministry-M . Messiney, who is Minister of Marine; M. Cailloux, Minister of Justice; M. Cruppi, Minister of Foreign Affairs; M. Steeg, Minister of Public Works, Post Office, and Telephones; and M. Couyba, Minister of Agriculture. M. Steeg is the correspondent of four newspapers, and M . Couyba is president of the Society of Authors. Our own Parliament is not destitute of members of the fourth estate. On this side of the House we have the honourable member for New England, the honourable member for Capricornia, the honourable member for Bourke, the honourable member for Werriwa, the honourable member for Cook, and the honourable member for Macquarie. On the other side we have the honourable member for Ballarat, whose name must appeal at once to those who have read some of his splendidworks. I well remember the fine series of articles he wrote years ago on the irrigation of India; and I may say that those articles would not hold the place they do to-day if they had not been written under or over the name of the honourable member.

We tency in a writer of newspaper articles would bring him praise and credit. The public often, by the repetition of headlines, dictated by their advertisement columns. have their opinions formed and moulded. If the public read in one newspaper to-day a splendid article advocating the adoption of a Protective policy for the Commonwealth, and in the course of a few months saw in another journal an equally strong article by the same writer in favour of a Free Trade policy they would know precisely what value to place upon these contributions, and, consequently, would not be misled. In France, where a distinction is made between contributors, leaderwriters, and the pro|3rietors of newspapers, The visit of that company is of so recent it is not singular for a journalist who has won his laurels, who has established a reputation as a man of knowledge, but who has been badly treated, to be taken up by a wealthy individual who is prepared to entrust him with the conduct of a new newspaper. Journalists are certainly the leaders of thought, but to-day the newspapers which employ them alone secure the credit attaching to their contributions. I would like to see journalists known as well as politicians and professors are known. A leader-writer of recognised consistency and character would then lend weight to the newspaper which employed him. brilliant article pulverizing a Government, a politician, or an opponent, has one wished that he knew its author in order that he might clasp him by the hand? My experience of men who have won their spurs in the literary world is that they are well worth knowing. times compelled to write for newspapers which might be purchased, but in saying that I am not alluding to any of our daily journals. grim old man and stern who used to own the Age, and who passed away some time ago, could not be bought at any price. Nor do I think that anybody could buy the young man who owns that journal to-day, and who recently exhibited such conspicuous bravery in an encounter with an armed ruffian. I have too great a respect for the Argus to imagine that it could be purchased. But in other countries newspapers have been bought and leaderwriters have been required to use their brains to further an object against which their consciences rebelled. It is, therefore, One of the within the realm of reason that a great know, too, that the proprietors of some journals frequently adopt a policy which is In this connection I propose to quote the remarks of the Attorney-General of New South Wales, who saidThe theatrical criticism was written to the order of the proprietors, and the proprietors were guided by the advertising columns as to what they should sav. He had to write to order. The first requirement of the public was that these men should be allowed to say what was in their own minds, and not to be subordinated to others. He never saw anything so dishonest in his life as the criticism of the Melba Opera Company. a date that it must be within the memory of all honourable members. The Jingo war scares, which are worked up in Europe today, and especially in England, are written for the purpose of increasing the sales of certain newspapers. Everybody knows that if a newspaper possesses a large circulation it is sure to attract a large number of advertisements. I recollect twenty-five years ago when the Le Petit Journal of France used to charge £ 2 per single line for its advertisements, which is equivalent to fifty francs. It had a circulation of just about 1,000,000 and was read by close upon How often when one has read a 5,000,000 people. The South African war was engineered by newspapers which were pulled by the moneyed strings which dominated that country.

If there is one circumstance which sheds lustre on the British flag it is the grant of selfI know that the government, which has since been made by the Imperial authorities to the South' African States.

At that time the challenge was easily given by the practised duellist. Anonymity in those days was, therefore, necessary. But it is not so now. To-day we could put the practised duellist in gaol even on the slightest threat, as my honourable friend will agree. The politician takes his political life in his hands. When he stands upon the public platform he has not the shield of anonymity. But the man who writes behind that shield too frequently puts into articles pin-pricks which are a dishonour to him and to the profession which he follows. The public should know our newspaper writers, because they are the guides of popular opinion. How much grander would journalists appear if they were known to be consistent in the objects and ideals which they advocate! The members of the parliamentary staffs of great newspapers are specialists. No politician, at all events in his early months of apprenticeship, can possibly hope to know as much as these brilliant specialists. many of these writers cannot give expression to their own convictions. Why? Because their bread and butter are at stake. But they would be very much more revered if their names were known to the public. money. an additional ^15,000 annually is being paid to the pressmen employed in Melbourne since the establishment of the Australian Journalists Association, and that they have to work only eight hours a day instead of an unlimited number ofhours, proves that if they were known to the public they would receive an even higher wage. Do the brilliant writers who sign their articles in our periodicals to-day receive a less salary because their names are known ? If the honourable member will take the trouble to inquire^ he will find that the rates In an article published on the 26th July, now being paid to them are much higher than they were when they wrote under the clonk of anonymity. The public are not given the honest views of journalists, but the views of the proprietors who pay them. I have already referred to the question of Protection and Free Trade, and I ask what would be thought of any man who on a public platform would advocate Free Trade to-day and Protection to-morrow. nalists are doing to-day under the existing system, but if they had to sign their names to their articles they would gradually secure the support of the public by writing honestly what they believe, and would not be compelled as they are now to do what their consciences do not approve. The publication of the names of writers would compel consistency on their part, otherwise the public would not continue to accept their guidance. The politician's best armour is consistency, and a contempt for sordid considerations. The lawyer who gave incorrect advice on a question of law would soon find himself in difficulties. He must not enunciate in Court what he knows to be bad law, and he dare not say to a jury, "" In my opinion such a man is innocent,"" or the presiding Judge would pull him up with a round turn. But the journalist is to-day at liberty to write what he really does not believe in such a way as to lead to the impression that he does believe it. If our journalists are to rise to the position to which their great average abiliYet we know that ties entitle them, I know of nothing which will help them better than the adoption of the course I suggest. overlooks the fact that the abolition of the ballot might be advocated on the same principle. tleman is aware that voting by ballot was adopted as a means of protecting the weak against the strong, and for the prevention of bribery and corruption. I should gladly welcome the time when every man and woman might register their votes openly and untrammelled by any pressure which might be exercised by wealth and power. I am, thanks to the Sydney Bulletin, in a position to make a few quotations in support of what I have said. I shall conclude with these, because I have already spoken longer than I intended 1912, the Bulletin deals with this subject in the following cogent termsFirst of all, the Tory press claims that all its articles are virtually signed already, because the publisher puts his name to the whole paper, including the lost dog advertisement, and the announcement of Jane Smith's marriage to Samuel Hogg, and takes the whole nominal",23,Definition Of Newspapers Signed Articles And Reports

That plea is palpably unconvincing, because everybody knows that the publisher's signature in this connection is bogus. I have seen a publisher standing at the Bar of this House, though every member of it knew that he had had nothing whatever to do with the writing of the article which was complained of. Although he Was fined, it was well known that he would not have to pay the fine. The writer of the article and the owner of the newspaper went scot-free, and it was pitiable to notice the futility of Parliament attempting to secure justice by the punishment of an innocent man. The Bulletin article continuesThe average publisher does not help to keep lies and misrepresentations out of the paper. He is not ashamed-no r is he expected to be ashamed -whe n they get in, for he probably would not know a literary lie if he saw it. . . . Then the Tory press advances a second plea, which is that papers are truthful, reliable, and accurate, even without the guarantee which would be afforded if writers had personally to carry tbe obloquy attaching to gross ignorance or gross misrepresentation. selected at random : How many hundreds of times have the Sydney morning papers said, or implied, that the concession of the Federal Capital to New South Wales was the only condition on which that State could be induced to join the Commonwealth? done so but for that. able member will deny this statement Who would imagine from that tale that New South Wales gave a majority for Federation at the first referendum, leaving the site of the Capital an open question; that the affirmative Vote was many thousands in excess of the 50,000 Which New South Wales had agreed with the other States should be a sufficient minimum, but that faith was broken, and the acceptance annulled by a gang of liars and traitors in the Legislature of the day, and that it was by this act of repudiation that the whole question was reopened, and possession of the Capital secured? That is history. The Bulletin would not have dared to print that statement if it had not been true, because the facts were readily availableAgain, there is the question of the diverse railway systems. South Australia and Victoria agreed to adopt the 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge and, New South Wales then stood out for the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge. When South Australia and Victoria had built many miles of railway on the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, New South Wales went back to the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. It should not be forgotten that ""the Sydney Bulletin depends upon the people of New South Wales more than upon those of any other State for support. The article continuesThen, again, who does not remember the six hatters lie? Who can say who wrote that lie? AndI ask honourable members to consider how mean and feeble the writer of it woul d appear if his name had been attached to itThen, again, there is the Petriana perjury, and the famous Ananias of the early Federation days about how the other States were living on revenue contributed by New South Wales. . . . And there appeared in a very prominent organ an impassioned article about the unbrotherliness of Victorians in levying a crushing duty on New South Wales coal. The proprietors of that newspaper knew or should have known that there was no duty upon coal levied by Victoria. Yet that lie was sent throughout New South Wales with a certain object. How contemptible the writer of it would have appeared if he had been obliged to attach his name to it. Let a few cases be But a sort of remedy lies in making the literary or the literary incapable who writes this sort of thing to put his name to it , and thus carry his own disgrace in public. This has been tried in a small way. The reason why the Labour party begins to believe in signed journalism all round is that it has made a casual experiment with the system, and has found it pay so far as things have gone. Under the existing law, all political articles published during a Federal election campaign must be signed. Straightway there disappeared out of the Tory press the free-love lie, the bursled-home-anddisruption-of-the-marriage lie, the wholesaleconfiscation lie-in fact, all the best and largest and most garish anti-Labour lies. I wish to see the journalist rise high. I have felt the misery of losing a man whom I esteemed a friend, and with whom I had eaten, drunk, and smoked. I found that when the opportunity came for some petty little paragraph, a stab in the back was given to me; but I regret the loss of the friendship. The bonorable member for Balaclava stigmatised as false and untrue a paragraph in a weekly journal reflecting on the party to which I belong, and its writer would never have dared to pen it had he known that it would have to be signed with his name. If the motion is carried, it will be for the Government to prevent any newspaper, no matter how strong and powerful, from taking advantage of the benefits of our postal system, unless it complies with the conditions I have laid down.

Many persons think that hope that it will not be imagined, because I found it necessary to take certain action concerning two or three journalists, which was disastrous for them, that I am actuated by spleen in regard to the journalistic profession. About seventeen years of my life was spent at the printing trade, several of them in a newspaper office, and I know what the work of journalists is. I agree with the honourable member for.

I am proud of having quite a number of If I was in error friends on the press, but that does not blind me to the faults of the press of the Whatever the office in which present day. There has been an extraordinary change in the status of journalists during the past tweny-five years. I re ; member the time when a newspaper proprietor was an individual who was proud of his journal, and extremely jealous of its and his reputation. He would have scorned to do some of the things that are done by the large journals which are owned, not by individuals, but by bodies of shareholders. The battles of freedom of speech, thought, and the press have been fought and won, and the time has come when we should restrict the licence that has grown out of the liberty of the press. During the past 100 years the freedom of the press has developed into license, and at that license the motion aims. I cannot, in the limited time at my disposal, deal with this matter as fully as I should like. T will give honourable members a sample of the class of literature that members of Parliament have to endure. It is the kind of writing which, if published in the press, ought to be accompanied by the name of the writer. I do not believe that if a law of the kind now advocated were established we should have anything like the number Moreover, under the Post and of slanderous articles and paragraphs which have been appearing.

It will be observed that the statement that there is no brutality, no drunkenness, no bad language, is accompanied by the qualification ""at least very little."" That is, apparently, intended to indicate that there was some brutality, some drunkenness, and some bad language. Here is another sentenceThe Dutch Commodore was much impressed. His remark about the Ministers was :"" Though they are not gentlemen, they try their best to be genuine imitations."" I do not believe that the Dutch Commodore made any remark of the kind. But the writer of the article says that the Commodore made use of such an observation, and this journal containing the statement is circulated amongst the farmers throughout Victoria, and, possibly, in other States also. I appeal to honourable members whether it is not a fair thing that the wretched man who wrote this, and who probably accepted the hospitality of the Labour Government at the function to receive the Dutch Commodore and his officers, should not have been compelled to 1 put his name to his statement? In my opinion, the change now advocated would .be a very fine thing for the journalistic profession in Australia.

At previous elections we have had leading articles without number in those journals. There was never a by-election but the gentlemen in the editorial chairs allowed their columns to be filled with articles abusing the Labour party. I think that the time has arrived when the editor of a morning journal should be deprived of a little of the halo which surrounds him. He struts about with a fine air of thinking a great deal of himself He is spoken of with bated breath. People approach him as a great Eastern military commander might expect a subordinate to approach, taking three steps, and then saluting, taking another three steps and saluting again, and finally retiring from the "" Royal"" presence backwards. It is time that the extraordinary reputation that the editor of a newspaper has-that reputation for wisdom which sometimes he never possesses-wa s known for what it is worth.

I find, for instance, that the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, and who spoke with great eloquence about the genius, but forgot the philanthropy, of an Argus reporter who had managed to condense into thirty lines a long speech made by him, failed to tell us that he is, in some way, I think, connected vvith what I would describe as the cleverest Labour weekly in Australia-the Brisbane Worker. enjoys the occasional services of my distinthe whole of the Government of Queensguished friend, and I hope that he is not going, in this respect, to hide his light under a bushel.

Let us take, for instance, an article appearing iii the Brisbane Worker of 22nd inst. I asked to be supplied with the latest issue of that paper, and I presume that this is the latest procurable. In this copy of the Brisbane Worker, clever and forcible as it is, we find language that we should be that is wanted astonished to discover in the daily press I have which my honourable friends opposite would forbid from criticising their actions.

I think we can safely agree that there is something a great deal worse than mere ill-mannered and unfair attempts at ridicule such as that drawn attention to by the honourable member, and published in the paper called The Farmer. I think we all deplore those manifestations, wherever they occur; but what we shall deplore a great deal more is any attack upon the probity, honour, and reputation, not only of individual members, but of the great institutions to which we in this House belong.

There is this to be said for Labour journalism: that it ought to be able to afford to do without this sort of spurious stuff. In the first place, these newspapers are not voluntarily contributed to by every person who takes them. Every man, for instance, who joins the Australian Workers Union, has to pay a subscription to get the Worker, whether he wants to buy it or not.

There is one thing more I would like to say in connection with the proposition, and that is in relation to the references which have been made by my honourable friends to the recent Werriwa election. They gloried in the fact that the daily press of Australia took no part in the election. But I think that able gentlemen opposite may pretend to be it is ideas which ought to count in coming to a conclusion in politics, and I trust the common sense of the people well enough to believe that they will properly weigh what is put before them, regardless of the source from which it comes. Honourable gentlemen opposite say that, on that occasion, the daily press was silent. So it was; but did the Act stop their press from slinging mud at our candidate ? It seems to me that this proposal to compel the signing of articles will operate to their tremendous advantage electorally, if , for this reason only, that they appear to be able to find in their own ranks persons who do not mind what they subscribe their names to; whereas it is very hard to find persons associated with this side of politics who will subscribe their names to anything which is not fair. statement perfectly true.

When I got leave to continue my remarks on the 2nd of this month I was dealing with the replies of the Minister of Trade and Customs to certain questions asked by the honourable member for Maranoa ou the 16th July. 1 am particularly anxious that these questions and answers should appear together in Hansard, and for that reason I desire to quote them now. Th« honourable member for Maranoa asked the Minister of Trade and CustomsIs be aware that a large proportion of Australian butter sent to London is purchased for blending purposes, and that moisture is incorporated in the process of blending?

It does not follow that higher prices are being received because of the dryness of the butter.

185,Mr Sinclair,"Not necessarily. Ataiticle in other parts-of the world. 1 can assure honourable members that to impose upon our producers a limitation of moisture contents below the maximum allowed by the London Board of Trade must handicap them seriously without any benefit to the consumers in the Motherland or elsewhere. The distribution of our butter is in the hands of people who see that, as supplied to their customers, it contains the maximum amount of moisture permitted by the Board of Trade. In the circumstances, I clo not see why we should be asked to take moisture out of our butter in order that tbe distributors of it may be allowed to put it in again. As one who has had vast experience of the butter industry, and a knowledge of those engaged in it, I can assure the Minister that there is no desire to increase tlie moisture contents of butter. What we ask is that we should not be penalized if , by accident or from any other reason, n few samples of our butter may exceed 15 per cent, of moisture. I am satisfied that if we were allowed to increase the maximum moisture contents to 16 per cent., that would not lead to any increase whatever in the average moisture contents of our butter. The difficulty is that if butter when manufactured contains l 5 i P cent, of moisture, in order to er comply with the demand of the Minister, and reduce its moisture contents by .5 per cent.., the manufacturer is put to a loss of no less than 5 per cent. It is, therefore, a very serious matter to the industry. The Minister has said that the moisture contents of butter exported years ago was lower than it is at tlie present time. I can quite believe that the .average percentage of moisture many advantages. One advantage is that it in the samples tested until quite recently was lower than the average at the present time, but I am sure that, with the assistance of better cooling appliances, our butter is now a drier butter, on the whole, than that whicli was produced years ago. The conclusion arrived at that we are increasing the percentage of moisture is not a correct one. The fact is that a greater number of samples are now being tested, and that butter which shows the greater percentage of free moisture is not the most moist butter. The Minister referred to moisture as "" free moisture."" dairying industry, different meanings are attached to this term. What is understood in the trade as "" free moisture "" is moisture which will flow away, and may be easily observed A buyer entering a merchant's shop to purchase a box of butter puts the trier into it, and if beads of moisture show on the back of the trier he condemns the article, because it shows free moisture. But that is no proof whatever that there is more moisture in the sample than there is in butter which does not show the moisture freely in that way. It is no indication that the butter is water-logged. Butter containing over 16 per cent, of moisture might not show it on the trier. Butter which may be said to be worked up to a putty contains quite as much moisture as butter which shows moisture freely. I have nothing further to say since the Minister has decided to leave this matter for the House to determine. I hope that honourable members will give an-unprejudiced vote on the motion, and will not be led away by any idea that this is a cry from the middleman, or that the consumer is going to be victimized. It is simply a demand from those engaged in a very important industry that they shall be given fair play and justice, and shall be put on the same mark as other butter producers of the world. If that is allowed to us, we shall be quite satisfied. We do not ask for anything more. -In supporting this motion, I may say that I am sure that the attitude taken up by the Minister is .not due to any desire to do anything detrimental to an industry of so much importance and offering so much scope for further development as does the dairying industry. I am satisfied that the Minister, and every responsible person in the community, is anxious to assist our primary industries as far as possible, and the dairying industry in particular, as it can claim very is practically a small man's industry. In most cases it is carried on, not by large capitalists, but by small men. It is an industry, also, in connection with which, so far as his holding will allow, the small man may increase his income to a very respectable extent. Honourable members are aware that the dairying industry in Australia has already grown to considerable proportions, and has materially assisted in the development of the country. It has made possible the occupation of lands all over this great country which, owing to their hilly characUnfortunately, even in the ter and other features, were a few years ago considered inaccessible or unprofitablefor general agriculture. A very large number of people are now engaged in the industry, which has been developed chiefly by the energy of farmers who, by a system of co-operative action in the manufacture o£",33,Moisture In Butter
186,Mr John Thomson (Cowper) [4.47].,"the article, and largely, also, in its sale and distribution, and without Government assistance, have done much to put themselves in the way of making a decent living. They have developed the country, and their success has created a demand for land which, a few years ago, would not be .considered as very suitable for occupation. The dairying industry has greatly inCreased the value of land which before its -establishment was so regarded. ing to the last figures obtainablethose for 1911 show the development iof the industry-we exported in that year 101,730,176 lbs. of butter, for which was received £4,637,472--the obtained for the butter being io*d. per ib. This large return has greatly assisted settlemakers were getting used to the regulation, ment and development; and I am sure that the Minister does not desire to handicap those who are doing so much for themselves and for the country, without assistance from any one. I thought that the recent High Court decision regarding the grading and grade-marking of butter would have rendered the motion unnecessary, it being held that the law does not authorize the Government to grade or grade-mark. But the Minister has taken up the position that that finding does not affect the legality of the regulation respecting moisture. Grading is done in accordance witli a scale, uncler which butter obtaining from 95 to 100 points is marked ""Superfine"" ; that obtaining between 90 and 94 points "" First Grade""; that between 83 and 87 points, "" Pure Butter""; that between 75 and 82 points, "" Second Grade ""; and that under 75 points, "" Pastry Butter."" are given in this way : For flavour and aroma, 50; for texture, including body, grain, and moisture, 30; for condition, colour, sorting, and packing, 20. It seems to me that the High Court having determined that the Government has no authority to fix a standard regarding moisture; but, as the Minister adheres to his regulation, the House must give a decision on the question. It is understood that the requirement that butter shall not contain more than 15 per cent, of moisture is a limitation, not a standard; but we object to a regulation which places us at a disadvantage in our competition with the butter-makers of other countries. I have shown that the success of our dairying industry depends upon the sale of the butter in foreign markets. The local consumption of butter is, comparatively speaking, so small that, if we had Mr John Thomson. only the local market, the industry would be crippled. In sending abroad, we have to compete with the butter-makers of America, Germany, Denmark, England, New Zealand, the Argentine, Siberia, and other countries; and we object to being' handicapped in that competition. If the London consumers of butter are satisfied to buy from foreign producers an article containing 16 per cent, of moisture, AustraAccordlian butter-makers ought to be allowed to export to Great Britain butter of that standard. I understand the Minister to say that he is prepared to allow a limitation to 15^ per cent, of moisture; that average price vvas allowed last season. we did not fine those whose butter contained 15J per cent, of moisture, as we did not wish to be too hard on them. that the reason for the regulation is that Mr Lockyer, in his report, spoke of the moisture in butter as adulteration; but the honourable member for Moreton, and others who are experts, say that water is not introduced to adulterate the butter in any way, or to give short weight. It is used to get rid of the casein, or butter-milk. I have been informed that to adhere to the standard set by the Minister means a considerable increase in the cost of manufacture, because it requires the butter to be worked over a second time. Not only is the cost of manufacture increased, but the butter is exposed for a longer time than is The points nqpv\, ..necessary to a comparatively high TCDipjrature. The butter-makers desire that"" they shall not be placed at a disadvantage in their competition with foreign butter-makers, and that their costs of manufacture shall not be increased. A good deal of difficulty has been experienced in ascertaining the quantity of moisture in butter. I shall be able to show, from correspondence, that even the experts differ in opinion as to the quantity of moisture contained in a given sample. The first letter which I shall quote deals with an examination made by the Manning River Co-operative Dairy Company Limited, Jones Island, New South Wales. I addressed the following letter to the Minister of Trade and Customs on 19th January, 1911Sir, I am requested by the manager of Manning River Co-operative Dairying Company Limited, Jones Island, New South Wales, to draw your",34,Moisture In Butter

The whole of these samples were taken from one worker f u l l of butter, after being worked six minutes.

I have here the report of the Local Government Board of Great Britain for 1910-n, which arrived only a fortnight ago. In it we have the statementTwenty thousand seven hundred and forty-two samples of butter, were examined during the year, and 1,048, or 5.1 per cent., were condemned. In London and the eighteen largest provincial towns, taken together, the percentage was 6.5, and, in the rest of the country, 4.0. By the Sale of Butter Regulations 1902, it is provided that "" where the proportion of water 11 a sample of butter exceeds 16 per cent., it shall be presumed for the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts 1875 to 1899, until the contrary is proved, that the butter is not genuine, by reason of the excessive amount of water therein."" It is well known that good butter can be manufactured with 10 or 12 per cent, of water, and, therefore, the regulations do nol press heavily on manufacturers. tinuesPublic analysts, however, constantly represent that the percentage of water found in butter is steadily rising. The analyst for Denbighshire writes :"" Formerly the amount seldom exceeded 12 per cent., and was frequently less; but now a large number of the samples are only just within the limit of 16 per cent."" The analyst for the County of Northampton reports that the number of samples of butter closely approximating to the maximum quantity allowed by the regulations is decidedly on the increase. This tendency of working to the limit is not confined to English-made butter, for the report of the Government Chemist for the year ended 31st March, igio, states :"" Four samples of butter from France, three .from Australia, two from Holland, and one from Belgium were found to contain water in excess of the legal limit, and proceedings were taken against the importers.

I believe that my legal friend opposite would be delighted to defend a man, if the sample were taken from the warehouse. could plead that a certain stuff was not in the state in which it was intended to be sold, and I believe that that rule applies to butter, too. The quotation continuesSome local autliorities appear not to realize the seriousness of the offence of introducing into butter a quantity of unnecessary water, and charging the price of butter for it. A sample taken in Canterbury was found to contain 23.87 per cent, of water, 7.87 per cent, in excess of the is never a glut here. If there is a surplus limit, and about twice as much as that found in well-made butter. taken in this case, the town council stating that the quantity of water in excess was too small to warrant proceedings. for we have observed lhat successful proceedings have been taken in regard to samples where the limit of 16 per cent, has been exceeded by 1 or 2 per cent. That extract is taken from fhe latest publication of the Board which deals with cases of adulteration in Great Britain. They say that good butter can be made down to a limit of 10 or 12 per cent, of water.

The great argument of those who oppose the fixing of the limit at 15 per cent, is that if we compel Australian producers to make a dry butter-that is to work up to within z per cent, of the Unfit place. It goes without saying, I presume, that buyers if they were adulterators would pay a higher price for the drier butter than they would pay for butter which was more moist. It stands to reason, I think, that they would be prepared to pay a better price for the better article. member proceed on the assumption, that if we could put a better quality of butter on the London market we would always get a better price?

288,Mr Tudor,"I am not going to enterpower to fix the standard of moisture in butter at 15 per cent, when butter containing 16 per cent, of moisture is admitted into Great. Britain ?"" that is, that I think we have the power, and I believe that if we sanction the presence of 16 per cent, of moisture in butter exported to the Old Country, and if a successful prosecution were launched there against the Australian article on account of excessive moisture in it, the injury that would be done to our trade would not be compensated for by the advantage which our manufacturers would derive from being permitted to put the increased percentage of moisture into our butter. That is the consideration which influenced me in the action which I took, and, if the honourable member for Kooyong had remained in office, he would probably have taken a similar view. that our butter picks up an additional 1 per cent, of moisture on its way to England? the departmental officers do not properly inspect the shipments. upon being landed in Great Britain, contains a bigger percentage of moisture than it contained on leaving here. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred it is lighter when it reaches the Mother Country. weight. effective, a margin of 16 per cent, of moisture would render our Australian butter secure from prosecutions in England? sible to analyze every box of butter which is despatched to Great Britain. In busy months of the year, such as December and Jai uary, 14,000,000 lbs. or 15,000,000 lbs. cf butter are despatched Ihither. That being so, it is obviously impassible to analyze every box, unless we a e prepared to r hold up the shipments. It is quite possible that there is not even a sample taken out of every churning for analysis, although an endeavour is made to do that. But honourable members who are in the business know that when the rush comes along, the vessels cannot wait, and, consequently, some shipments or churnings may slip through without inspection. As a matter of fact, butter is.on the ship, although it may not have left port, before its analysis is made known. I do not think that can be avoided, although we endeavour to My reply to avoid it. If our butter manufacturers lay themselves out to manufacture an article containing the maximum amount of moisture permitted under the Act, it is quite possible that some consignments may slip through which contain more than that maximum, and that a prosecution may be instituted in England which will injure the name of our Australian butter. If such a prosecution were successful, our competitors would use that fact for all it was worth to the detriment and serious injury of our industry. That is the reason why I fixed the maximum amount of moisture permitted in Australian butter intended for export at 1 per cent, lower than the maximum amount allowed in England. Our 15 per cent, standard was that which was in vogue in Victoria at the time. New South Wales has since adopted the same standard. The average moisture in Victorian butter exported in 1906-7 was 13.9, in 1907-8 it was 13.6, and in 1908-9 it was 13.7. Practically, therefore, it ranged between 13.6 and 13.9. show that there is no need for the Minister to interfere at all ? Mr W. H . IRVINE -What conclusion does the Minister draw from thosefigures? ceeded the limit of 16 per cent., which was then allowed, because prosecutions were instituted in respect of Australian butter for being what was termed "" water-logged.""

Very few countries have established standards in connection with butter sold within their own borders. Victoria and New South Wales are thc only countries which have adopted the 15 per cent, standard. The standard fixed in Germany mark the quantity of moisture allowed in per cent. Mr W. H . IRVINE -The question is not has .never reached 14 per cent., even The effect of the new regulations, which have to prevent a few manufacturers from submitting for export close up to the 16 per cent, closer touch with the composition of their products. The lower temperature necessary in order to get the moisture in butter within the standard assists in recovering more butter-fat in the churning, and this compensates for the extra trouble taken. High churning temperatures allow a loss of butter-fat in churning. The average moisture contents of all butter analyzed during 1910-11 season was 13.8 per cent. The average of all butters analyzed this year was 13.9 per cent. So that, instead of the average moisture content being lower, it is . 1 , or one-tenth, per cent, higher under this regulation than it was the year before, and, instead of the dairy farmers suffering in consequence an enormous loss, it has meant no loss to them at all.

You cannot interfere with a huge industry of the country because a few idealists say you ought. There must be some more prominent necessity than that. These gentlemen are well enough in their way, and I am not saying a word against them. They do right in keeping ideals high and pure. But it is another thing when you have to meet the open competition of the world with our products oversea. Then your ideals must go as far as you can take them without destroying your industry and enterprise. Sir New South Wales and Victoria fixed 15 per cent. friend points to our internal consumption, which is a very small modicum of the whole production of butter. He should look at the competition which has to be met abroad, and at the disabilities which are being imposed upon our farmers as to more than two-thirds of their product. I have already pointed out that in Denmark, whose butter realizes the highest price in the world, the standard is lower than ours. mark is about 11 or 12 per cent. honourable member see that all that that means is that these standards are not necessary ? That is what the argument amounts to, if you push it home. It is, I think, a factI have seen it dehaving satisfied themselves on the other monstrated more than once-that a cheap inferior will always work to the disadvantage of a dearer better. That can be seen in the coal trade. One of the greatest troubles is to deal with the inferior coal that is produced cheaply, and is sold in competition with dearer and better coal. The great problem is to get hold of the producers of the inferior coal, and get them into the Vend, so as to stop the crippling competition. suggests that we should make our standard higher and stricter in London, without in any way being able to control, by so much as a hair's breadth, the competition of other parts of the world, where producers do not have to subscribe to our standards. If it be necessary for the public health, make your standards up to the point where the requirements of the public health have been satisfied. But when you have done that, I see no necessity for deliberately crippling our farmers in competition with other butter producers in the markets of the world. We already labour under disabilities. We have higher wages and freights to pay than have our competitors, and we have disadvantages of many kinds. It is true that we enjoy some advantages in the matter of climate and in other directions. The dairy farmers in Denmark, for instance, have to hand-feed their stock for half the year, but our great distance from the markets of theOld World and the expensive freights we have to pay are in themselves a sufficient handicap, without the imposition of these disabilities as to standard which the Minister is introducing. has not been uttered when the Minister quotes the laboratory experts. Without undervaluing in any way the expert's opinions tory expert. gentleman has quoted a number of experts of one sort or other; but he must take a reasonable business and practical view of this matter. When he has satisfied the requirements of public health, he must give the business instinct of the community its fair and full valuation. If our farmers could be made to believe that by reducing the moisture contents of butter they would secure bigger prices oversea, I am sure they would reduce the percentage if it were possible to do so on a commercial basis. That being so, the Government, and higher ground, as they had a perfect right to do, should listen to the plea of business men who have to face world-wide competition under adverse conditions, and listen to them to the fullest possible extent. Would it be a good thing if , for instance, we did not export any of our fruit, save that of first quality? But what should we do with the fruit of second gradewholesome and cheaper fruit which appeals Here my honourable friend to people who cannot buy the best?

IRVINE (Flinders) [6.26]. -This motion, which declares that the standard fixed by the Minister is detrimental to the best interests of the dairying industry of the Commonwealth, and which is supported, I think, by most honourable members who are intimately acquainted with the practical work of the dairying industry, will, I feel sure, receive the full consideration of the House before a division is taken upon it. The greater part of the Minister's speech, so far as I could follow him, was directed to an attempt to prove that it was necessary to fix a maximum in reference to the free moisture contents of butter. any of us will deny that the adoption of some maximum was necessary, but that is not the question which we have to consider. The question is, whether, having regard to the fact that the Governments of Denmark and other countries whose butter is placed upon the European market hare adopted a 16 per cent, maximum, we ought to handicap our butter producers in competition with these persons on the same market, and place upon them an additional embargo. by the Minister seemed to me to be a remarkable one. It was based upon the In view of the fact that in some of the States a 15 per cent, standard has been adopted. The honourable gentleman asserted that since the butter factories found it necessary to But how can he, manufacture all their butter for export, as well as for local Consumption, without any distinction, it was therefore necessary for them, in fact, to observe the regulation as to moisture contents prescribed by the State Governments. Was not that the honourable gentleman's argument? the standard were increased to 16 per cent., the Victorian Government would imfrom 15 per cent, to 16 per cent. We should have the same demand as was made in regard to the use of boric acid. Mr W. H .

369,Mr Harper (Mernda) [7.45],"I takestatement of the actual position of the finances from the stand-point of an outsider labouring under the difficulty of discovering the facts in the voluminous papers laid before Parliament in such an unceremonious fashion. I tried on that occasion to inform the House, as far as possible, of the actual position, and sought based upon the instructions which he must for explanations with regard to it. I dealt with the past and the present, and to-night I propose to say a few words about the future. I must call attention to the very extraordinary position in which we are placed by the fact that enormous undertakings, involving great expenditure, have been entered into by the Government without consulting Parliament, either before they incurred the obligations or after they had done so. I specially wish to deal with what is, perhaps, the greatest single undertaking which the Commonwealth may have in hand tor a long time, and certainly the biggest thing we have yet had to deal with, and that is the establishment of a Fleet for The position which they have taken up is naval defence. 'Let honourable members cast their minds back to the history of this hold that they cannot accept the scheme business. In 1907 there was a Conference in England, and, as a result of the Conference, in 1909 a Fleet Unit was arranged to be supplied. Ships were ordered, and a very eminent Admiral was invited to come to this country to advise the Government generally as to a scheme of complete defence which would enable us Australians to feel that we were in a safe position, so far as we could be, from naval attack. That gentleman came here, and remained for a considerable number of months. It is twenty years. If honourable members will nearly two years since he began his duties. read his report attentively, they will find He departed after submitting a report to the Government, but in no way, except incidentally, have the Government, at any rate to this House, made an explanation of their attitude towards his report. They have accepted it, they say, and, so far, the ships have been ordered, and have come. They have accepted the scheme, and have led the country to believe this to miral Henderson's scheme when we will be the case. I think it was their duty to have brought the report before Parliament, to explain what they meant to do regarding it, and say whether they intended to carry it out in its integrity, or in any respect to depart from it. They ought to have done that, I think, out of consideration for the House. Much has happened in Europe since this Fleet Unit was agreed upon to make people anxious, and surely it was a question of l£r. Harper. supreme importance for this Parliament to have had the opportunity of deciding whether they would have a Fleet earlier than was projected and provided for according to the report of Admiral Henderson. Because, so far as its financial and general arrangements are concerned, it is clearly have received from the Government that they meant to contribute from the revenue for the cost of construction, that they did not mean to create a Fleet at once, but to create it over a period of years. He drew the report in accordance with the evident request that had been made to him that he should adopt that principle. I do not intend to discuss the matter now, because I may have an opportunity to make some remarks when the item in the Estimates comes before us. But it does seem to me that it is, to say the least of it, signally disrespectful to Parliament that the Government have never laid before it, in a fair and reasonable and comprehensive way, a huge transaction involving possibly the very preservation of the Commonwealth. that they have accepted the scheme, but I and omit fulfilling the most important part of it. I think, sir, that you will agree with me that finding the money according to the scheme is as important as any other part of it could possibly be. I wish to draw the attention of the House to-night to the fact that the Government are not so finding the money according to the scheme. Admiral Henderson drafted a.scheme which was to extend over that positively, until after 1918, we will not have anything beyond this Unit, which is only a very small portion of the complete Fleet which he says is necessary for our defence. We shall have only that up to 1918, nothing more ; and the pfonle of this country may imagine that we shall have an effective Fleet in accordance with Adreally not have anything of the kind. On page 8 of his report, he saysIn order to obtain the necessary efficiency with a minimum of cost, continuity of policy is essential, and the development of the Commonwealth Naval Force must proceed on definite lines, with a definite goal in view, so that each step taken will advance the completion of the whole. That is a reasonable proposition, and the report is constructed on that plan. Although it will take a long time to complete 4he Fleet-muc h longer than 1 imagined we should be in a partially defenceless posi-tion-still , we have the announcement that the Government have adopted the report. I shall show, however, that, so far as the -finances are concerned, the Government ""have not fulfilled that part of their obligation. Under the scheme, an annual sum was to be apportioned according to a schedule which is shown in appendix G of the report. If we look through this schedule, we see that it has been carefully considered to meet the conditions imposed -on Admiral Henderson by the Government's scheme for contributing from the revenue for the construction of a Fleet. He groups -the expenditure in four separate periods; the first of seven years, and three of five years each. For the first period, £3,000,000 -a year has to be provided to meet expenditure as it arises; ,£4,000,000 a year for the second period; ,£4,500,000 a year for the third period; and j f t j , 000,000 a year for the fourth period. One cannot fail to see that, unless these financial conditions are fulfilled, we shall drift into a position which may be exceedingly dangerous. This money ought to be taken out of revenue and put aside in the Trust Fund, as provided by law; and, as the Government have shown their eagerness to put other sums into Trust Accounts, they might be expected to do so in the case of the Navy. The scheme begins with the year J9ir-i2, for which there should have been put aside ,£3,000,000. however, as Parliament, out of the savings made before, had put aside more than £""3,000,000, it was not necessary to raise that question in the year 1911-12; but for the current year 1912-13, there ought to be a similar amount of £3,000,000 put aside; and that has not been done. Certain votes have been passed, mainly for ships, with a certain amount for works. These, however, total a sum considerably short of the provision that should have been made. When I was speaking on the Budget, I mentioned that apparently this provision had not been made, and that something like £2,500,000 was required. basing it merely on what I saw had been provided for ships and works; but, since then, I have had an opportunity to look into the expenditure for manning and ordinary expenses, and I find that the amount short for this year is not £2,500,000, but £1,114,407. I may here read, for the information of honourable members, a short table showing the naval expenditure since this new scheme was started1900-10 1910-11 l.)l L-I2. 1012-13. Total.

The increase in the cost of manning is owing to the additional ships. Towards the expenditure for 1912-13 there is a sum of £1,196,829 applicable from the Trust Fund, and £997,428 to be provided from revenue. According to Admiral Henderson's naval defence scheme, ,£3,000,000 for 1911-12, and £3,000,000 for 1912-13, should have been set apart. These sums have not been set apart; but the expenditure to date, as shown in the table, including the estimate for 1912-13, is £4,885,883, which leaves a sum of £1,114,407 which should have been provided in this year's appropriations for the Inasmuch, Trust Fund, in order to comply with the condition that £?6,000,000 should be made available in the years 1911-12 and 1912-13. I think that honourable members on botli sides of the House ought to give their attention to this matter, because, as Admiral Henderson points out, harbour works are as necessary as ships. If we had no docks and harbors, with means of repairing ships when required, the ships would be of little use to us if we were attacked. Consequently, the Admiral points out more than once in his report, the absolute necessity for pushing on with the land works in the early years, as he says, in order that acI made that statement, commodation may be provided for the ships as they come into being and aie added to the Fleet. gance of the Government? gance; I am pointing out facts to which honourable members ought to give their attention.

But although the Government have the ships-onl y about ,£1,000,000 is required to complete the purchase of the Unitthey have done almost nothing to provide the necessary land works. We are told that it is necessary to have two squadrons to protect Australia, one stationed at Fremantle, where an immense amount of work is required to provide the necessary accommodation for the vessels, and the other at Sydney and Westernport. Barracks are needed for the men, and all sorts of works require to be undertaken. If we get the ships without this necessary accommodation, they will be of very little use when occasion arises, and the people may wake up one day and find that they have been living in a fool's paradise. ber thinks that we ought to provide the works first? what Admiral Henderson says; and it is only a reasonable thing. honourable member had a horse, he would require a stable to put him in. that to provide warships costing about £ 5,000,00 0 without furnishing the necessary accommodation for them, is not a prudent procedure. Yet that is what is being done. The total amount which has been expended, and is intended to be spent this year, upon naval works is, approximately, about £ 2 7 0 , 0 0 0 . These great works ought to have been pushed on long ere this. As a matter of fact, less than .£65,000 has already been expended, and a further sum of £ 2 0 8 , 0 0 0 is to be spent during the current financial year. But, unless greater expedition is exhibited than has been displayed hitherto, we shall find, at the end of the year, that this money has not been appropriated, and thus we shall get still further behind. The position, I think, is a very serious one. In any case, the Government should have put this money aside. But they have not done fhat. Had they done so, this year, instead of having a balanced ledger-the y balance the ledger in a somewhat peculiar way, because if they have an excess of, say, £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0, and there is nothing upon which to spend it, they place it to the credit of the Trust Fund-the y would have had a deficit of ,£1,114,407. What will happen when, instead of an excess, they have a we can easily imagine. vernment had accepted tbe whole of Admiral Henderson's scheme? It is easy to talk about accepting a scheme, and to put in a little word or two qualifying that acceptance. But the public believe that the scheme recommended by Admiral Henderson is being carried out. However, I will meet the honourable member for Bass on that point. It is a curious thing that one has to dig through Hansard to discover anything in regard to this great scheme, which is to cost the country nearly £100,000,000 . One has to dig through Hansard, in order to get any allusion to it at all. However, I have obtained several references to it . The first was the statement by the Minister of Defence, which I read on a former occasion. Then, on the 16th July of the present year, the honourable member for Cowper asked the Prime Minister, upon notice(1) Have the Government adopted the scheme of naval defence contained in Admiral HenderI f the son's report; if so, when and where ? (2) Do the Government propose submitting that scheme for the opinion of Parliament; if The honourable member must see so, when; if not, for what reason ? These were very plain questions, to which the Prime Minister repliedThe answers to the honourable members questions are(1) The Government have accepted the general lines of ihe scheme my honourable friends opposite would say. The answer of the Prime Minister reads(1) The Government have accepted the general lines of the scheme of naval defence laid down by Admiral Henderson.

The Government have led everybody, including the Admiralty authorities, to believe-and we are receiving great credit in the British press for the magnificent patriotism we are exhibiting in establishing a Navy and paying for it out of revenue-that we are carrying out Admiral Henderson's scheme in its entirety.

This matter will certainly come up another time. Jt is possible that at the end of the year the Government may be able to balance the accounts again, because they may not spend, during the financial year, all the money which has been appropriated. But I advise honourable members, when the next Budget is being delivered, to insist upon a list of the unexpended votes, and see to what extent the estimates of expenditure have been realized. It may be discovered that so-called savings are not savings at all, sion requires. We have got some ships, but inoney not expended for the purposes for which it was appropriated. I put that -caveat in now, because some honourable members may later on say, "" The honourable member said there would be a deficiency, and there is no deficiency."" Everything depends upon how the money appropriated by Parliament is spent. So far as I can make out, every shilling that could be spent last year was spent, in the Post and Telegraph Department particularly. I think that about £1,000,000 was appropriated for that Department, and the whole of the amount appropriated was expended, and about £ 1 2 in addition. that it should be expended. ing the necessity for the expenditure. To meet the expenditure this year, 1912-13, to -which I have referred, every shilling put aside in the Trust Fund for the Navy, old age pensions, and for other purposes, will 'be absorbed. Next year, instead of having over £2,000,000 in the Trust Fund to fall back upon, as we have this year, we shall have nothing, and we shall have to -find .£3,000,000 for the Navy, if we are -going to carry out the scheme. If we are [^3] not going to carry out the scheme, of course we shall not need to find the money. If we are going to carry it out, it must be agreed that the most necessary part of it is the finding of the money. Without the money we cannot have the Fleet or the I am works. The finding of the money is a part of the scheme, and it is the primary duty of the Government, and of Parliament, to say how we are to get the money. millionaires ? the honourable member for Capricornia, I may say that, so far, the whole of the money that has been put into the Fleet has come from the land tax, and not a shilling from any other source. I do not know where to find the millionaires the honourable member talks of, but those whom he probably refers to as millionaires have done pretty well in paying for the Fleet up to date. No doubt they will continue to contribute their quota. I ask honourable members, in all seriousness, whether they cbnsider that Parliament and the Government are justified in going on in this way, without any plan of finance, looking only to the moment, and bringing up a vote as occathey make a brave show, and we are invited to believe that the works can wait. I have compiled a f r o forma estimate of what I think will be the position next year. Although a section of the press has described the honourable members for Ballarat, Flinders, and myself as a set of pessimists, there is no pessimism about me. I believe in this country, if it be only properly governed. Government is largely a matter of finance, and if we have reckless finance we shall have disaster brought upon the country, no matter how productive it may be. There may be a loss of prestige to the country, and enormous individual loss to great masses of the people. Unwise expenditure, reckless finance, and ignorant procedure may bring the fairest and greatest country into a very parlous condition indeed. I am taking the scheme as the Government imposed it upon Admiral Henderson. I do not believe they had any right to do that without consulting Parliament, but they did it, and it is not a borrowing scheme. WhatI am contending is that having caused a scheme to be devised based upon annual payments of fixed sumsfrom the Treasury, on the plea that they are not going to borrow, they do not",51,Naval Exi En Iutuke

These matters are important, because this country cannot afford to play ducks and drakes with our financial position. We cannot afford to go on spending money as we are doing. I say that, as prudent men, we should look the position in the face, making provision for contingencies. Otherwise, as we are going on, some day we shall find ourselves in a very difficult position. We shall probably find that we have to reduce public works, and stop our defence expenditure, which may be very disastrous, as well as throwing thousands of people out of work. That has happened before. We have seen the same sort of thing in my time on more than one occasion. Labour rule. titude of the boomster. He is never going to do anything wrong. I remember talking to a friend of mine about a man who had made a large amount of money, and occupied an important position. My friend amused me very much by saying, "" Oh, yes, he is a big man now; he went into the boom when he was not worth a shilling, and in a short time he won't be worth a shilling again."" The booming habit is easily acquired. I am afraid our friends have acquired it, and they may find that the usual results will follow. I want to say a word or two before I sit down in regard to the Trust Fund. The way this Trust Fund is established and worked in some instances tends to the deception of Parliament. say that that is done intentionally, but it has that effect. I will give an instance from last year. In addition to the expenditure in the Post and Telegraph Department of nearly ,£1,000,000, £600,000 was put into the Trust Fund for future expenditure. There was a schedule to the Act. The Act was general in its terms, and the ,£600,000 passed from the purview of Parliament. What happened? In the same year in which that sum was passed into the Trust Fund ,£187,000 was spent, and ^£430,000 was left for expenditure, which is intended to be spent this year, in addition to £1,000,000 voted by Parliament. Consequently, whilst we have before us Estimates showing an expenditure of ,£1,000,000, we are really spending, for the year 1912-13, £1,400,000. Whilst This had been done with we must have the Trust Fund, I consider that it should be carefully watched, and that the Treasurer should submit to the House, in reference to every one of the Trust Accounts, a full statement showing how the money has been spent. Honourable members will recollect that in the"" course of my speech on the Address-in-ReplyI referred to a certain transaction, which led to the extraordinary statement that the Auditor-General had made a mistake. I went into the matter carefully, believing that it was a most serious thing that the Auditor-General, to whom we must all look, and in whom we must all have confidence-and I , personally, have confidence in him-shoul d make a mistake of the kind. I find, on looking into the matter, that there is very great reason for mistakes occurring, because, since this Government have been in office, the papers in respect of each financial year have not reached the Auditor-General until ten months after the close of the year. The mistake made by the Auditor-General was the result of his anxiety to try to bring certain figures up to date, and so to make up for the stale character of the report .which he was to furnish. I find that, in his ninth report, issued on 30th June, 1910, the Auditor-General statesThe statement of the Honourable the Treasurer relating to the accounts for the year 1909-10 was received by me, complete, this 10th day of March, 1911. The late receipt of the statement and accounts made it impossible for my report to be prepared and presented to Parliament prior to the close of the recent session As had previously been doneI do not My previous eight annual reports had been submitted for the information of Parliament in the first instance. On this occasion, however, the report had to be sent by him to the Treasurer, and was published as a supplement to the Government Gazette.

Let me state the facts of cial yearwhen the statement of the Treasury balances Mitchell's cement works, and about onewas signed by the Treasurer. . . . The late receipt of the Treasury accounts, and Minister. the consequent delay in the presentation of this report, has rendered much of the subject-matter of the latter of less public interest than it might otherwise have possessed. various accounts has, therefore, been brought up to a later date than 30th June, 1911, the end of the period with which the report is required to deal. It was in bringing this report up to date that the mistake to which I called attention was made. now to ventilate, as a grievance, a matter arising out of a question which I put to the Minister of Trade and Customs this afternoon, and the answer which he gave. The question is of considerable importance, because it affects the relations and the actions of the Minister in regard to certain men who were on strike. The answer given by the honourable gentleman was most unsatisfactory, because, whilst the question was specific, the reply was entirely general. In the first place, I asked the MinisterIs it a fact that he, under dale of 14th August, It leads me to challenge the answer given gave to some twenty or more men, who are on strike at Mitchell's cement works, special letters of recommendation to provide them with employment at the Westernport naval base, such recommendations being handed to the men and addressed to the Secretary, Navy Office, Lonsdale-street, Melbourne? The question could not have been more specific. The answer given to it wasIt is true I have given many letters of renot."" commendation to deserving men wanting emwere each provided with a written recomployment, nnd these, very probably, include mendation from a Minister of the Crown to the men referred to.

Were they desired to get into Government emthese deserving men wanting employment? ployment. I put that as a reasonable outand their positions were available to them if they chose to return to work. The master have been honourable to themselves, and would have taken them out of the ranks of the case. There are fifty men on strike at half of these received letters from the. them all personally? Information as to ral answer to my question that it is impossible for me to say, but it would be a very questionable practice for the Minister to have letters of this kind drafted in blank. I give him credit, however, for not issuing recommendations to men whom he does not know. Mr Mitchell has agreed to abide by the decision of a Wages Board, and, during this week, two meetings of the strikers have been held to decide if steps should be taken for the creation of such a Board. Its establishment would mean their immediate return to work. There would be no occasion for them to lose a penny in respect of wages if they had a Wanes Board. Two meetings were held to decide if they would ask for a Wages Board, but at each meeting those who wanted to go back to work were out-voted. There was a majority of one against having a Wages Board on each occasion. Why was this? by the Minister to my last question, which wasAre the said recommendations conducing to the continuance of the stoppage of the local manufacture of cement, in the interest of the imported article? The reply of the Minister was, "" Certainly As a number of these fifty men employees in another Government Departcome of the action of the Minister in giving these letters of recommendation.

WhatI refer to is the steady and mysterious increase in the general cost of living to the masses of the people, particularly during the last twelve months. If this great Commonwealth had been visited by a famine, or by flood, or by some far-reaching catastrophe which had devastated it and destroyed its wealth, we might very rightly look there for the causes. But, instead of that, the statistics, which are supplied by our competent authorities, go to show that the general production of wealth for the past three years has never been excelled in the history of the Commonwealth, which, in this regard, surpasses any civilized community of modern times. Whilst it is true that there have been losses from drought in some parts of the Commonwealth, those losses and the drought conditions .have not been nearly so serious as was the case in 1902-3. At that time the drought was general throughout the Commonwealth, and the loss of stock and crops was very severe indeed, but the result, in the matter of increased prices and increased cost of living, did not reach anything near .the high point which is being experienced at the present time. Thus we have the extraordinary position that, with a vast and rapidly increasing production of wealth, excelling any previous experience, we have house rents, and the general cost of living, steadily mounting, sky-wards every day. There is no effect without a cause; and certainly the effect, as seen in the general life of our community, is that of a scarcity. I am not, I think, making an undue demand on the belief of honourable members when I say that that scarcity, .viewed in the light of our very large production,, is not a real, but an artificial scarcity, created by some means or other; and that, when we come to look for the cause, we are certainly justified in assuming that it is in the monopolistic control over the great forces which are intermediary between the producer and the .consumer. 1 It will be generally admitted by all thoughtful students of modern tendencies, that America is far excellence the great home of the trust; and the combine. bad as Australia. agree with the honourable gentleman. America is a very much bigger country than Australia, and all things there are on a> very big. scale; and the trust is one of the u biggest now dominating the community.. America naturally lends itself to these greatj combinations. It is the home of the practical application of the Protectionist's policy, which secures to its great wealthy' people, in the persons of their manufac' turers and commercial men, the homemarket; and there is a lack of legislation' to regulate the Protection. There are no means by which the benefits enjoyed by the commercial and manufacturing interests can be extended to the worker or to the consumer; and, unlike Australia, America has not engaged in State enterprises to anything like the extent we have. Transport and other means of communication are great necessities of modern civilization; and in. America. the railways telegraphs, tele: phones, and so forth, instead of being in the hands of the Government to be conducted for the benefit of the people, are farmed out, and, under franchises, become the property of private persons who are "" out"" for gain. To such an extent have trusts grown in America, and so baneful are their effects on the community generally, and particularly on the poorer people, that they are engaging the attention of leadingeconomic thinkers, and legislators, and pro-, minent men in the church. The pronouncements that are being made are clear and. definite in the condemnation of the operations of these combinations. I regret to say that, in Australia, our Church folk, who -should be the leaders of the higher thought and better living, do not seem to give that serious attention to this phase of modern development that it warrants. .1 find, from a recent publication, that, in America, the Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in their quadriennial r address to the General Conference, touch on the social injustices noticeable in that country. They sayWe live in an age in which the vast enterprises essential to the progress of the world require the association of men of large means under corporate management. Out of this necessity have grown serious charges and consequent resistance. Organized capital stands indicted at the bar of public judgment for the gravest crimes against the common welfare... Among the counts in that .indictment are such as these:': "" 1. Conspiring to advance prices on the staple commodities indispensable to the life, well-being, and progress of the people i . Resorting' to adulteration of foods, fabrics, and materials in order to increase profits already excessive. 3.

But the monopoly is of such a character that the intermediate men are not allowed to deal with us. This is not merely a question of our status in the English market, and of the unfair opposition that we have to meet. It has now become a question of the extent to which Australia is to be menaced in her home market by these great trusts. would invite the attention of honourable members to an article which was published in the Age a little while ago. That article readsEvidence is available which proves that for years Messrs. Swift and Company, one of the leading firms in the Trust, have had representatives at Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne, who have made trial purchases of Australian beef and mutton. Further, it is known that representatives of the Trust have three times travelled Instead of having to fight the Meat Trust ire through all the known Australian cattle nnd sheep country, examining the principal freezing works, selecting sites for new freezing works, and even negotiating with some of the biggest exporters and retailers in the trade, for the transfer of their business to the Trust.

I to an intimation that recently appeared in the press of the formation of a company in Queensland. We were informed that an Australian Meat Export Company Limited, with a capital of £200,000, divided into 200,000 shares of £ 1 each, was in course of formation.

One remarkable effect of the operation of trusts and combines in America is that they gradually close in upon competition outside their own sphere. They gradually eliminate competition, so that, according to Ripley and other eminent authorities, in connection with some lines in America from 60 per cent, to 95 per cent, of. the consumption is controlled by the trusts to the detriment of the consuming public, as indicated by this pronouncement on the part of the representatives of the Churches, in the matter of cost, and also in causes at work to justify the increase. The the matter of adulteration and the sale of an inferior article. I should like to point to the increase which is taking place in the cost of living in the Commonwealth. It is a matter, of very serious complaint that in all the great centres of population house rents have gone up at an alarming rate. This has been more particularly noticeable as affecting houses in the slum areas, occushow that it was a good investment. This pied by the poorer classes of people. The toiling men and women of the community; who are living on the verge of subsistence, are being penalized in this way. Houses which heretofore were considered amply paid for by a rental of 7s. 6d. or ios. per week have had their rentals increased to ios., 12s., and 15s. per week. It is also noticeable that the rentals of the houses occupied by the wealthier portion of the community have not risen in anything like the same ratio as those of houses in the slum area. This in the land of ample spaces, not in a country where the areas available for habitation are limited and overcrowded, as in the Old World. Not long since, there was a controversy in New South Wales respecting the"" cost of living, and the Secretary of Public Works made acomparison based on the tenders of firms of contractors. The manager of Messrs. McHwraith and Company Limited, however, said that the Minister's list of current prices was twelve months behind the times, and that since it In an article appearing in the Worker, of 30th May, a writer estimates what this had cost the country. In regard to oatmeal, of which 75,000 cwt. had been imported, the increase amounted to £125,000. On 225,000 tons of sugar, the increase was £785,000; on 485,000 cwt. of rice, £48,500; on 79,420,000 lbs. of jam, £55,125; on 2,392,000 lbs. of coffee, £19,950; on 20,886,000 lbs. of condensed milk. £65,100; on 12,309,000 lbs. of raisins and sultanas, £51,200; and on 8,390,000 lbs. of sago and tapioca, £7,500; the increases totalling £1,157,400. Those increases were on the wholesale prices; and no one engaged in business would think it unreasonable to say that the retail prices were at least 25 per cent, more, making the cost of the general rise in prices to the community ,£1,460,000; and this, not in a time of scarcity, or with marvellous thing is that.the increase began just after the referenda. It is said that £100,000 was spent in New South Wales in defeating the Government's proposals. I know that, in my district, every weakkneed Labour man who was prepared to actively canvass against the proposals found work and pay; and if the campaign cost our wealthy syndicates, and importers £100,000, the figures which I have given is the policy of America; and, in connection with the Sugar Commission's inquiry, we see another repetition of the American methods. The price of sugar, it must be remembered, rose £ 3 a ton after the referenda. Mr Ripley, in his great book on Trusts and Combines, shows that it is a common thing in America for cute men who could not hold their positions and carry out their great business transactions if they were not brainy men, to suddenly suffer from paralysis of the memory when brought before, investigating tribunals.

Therefore, there is all the greater necessity why we should have the power, if we have it not already; and if we have it, I maintain that we are committing a criminal act against the people who sent us here if we do not use it in gripping these great trusts and combines at this early stage of their career, in order that we may prevent the people of Australia from experiencing the pains and penalties ' that are being inflicted upon people elsewhere. ' WhatI would suggest to the Government is this: Commissions investigating other subjects, but this question of the increase of prices during the last twelve months, the increase of rent, and the operation of trusts, and their attempts to get a footing in Australia, ought to be inquired into. should appoint some competent person to investigate them. Either they should appoint Mr Knibbs, our very able Statistician, or the head of the Customs and Excise Department, as.to inform the House to what extent the rise in the cost of living is due to natural causes, and to what extent it is due to, monopolies operating against the best interests of the people. ment should then devise some means of C rotecting the people against these comines, that seem to have ho soul, and are practically established for the purpose of acting outside of the region of law, of ethics, of right feeling, and of right action between man and man. heartily congratulate the honourable member who has just resumed his seat on having travelled far. afield in search of grievances. He went out to sea, and for a considerable time stayed there. He went When the Comto America for precedents, and came back to suggest in most eloquent terms tbe need for expert inquiry. I agree, after listenI ask the honourable ing carefully to his remarks, that it would be well if we did get some expert adviser, to help us in this matter. The honourable member talked of the operation of trusts in America, and he very properly divided the history of their peculiar operations under the headings of law and profits. The profits went to the trusts, and the law What we have been getting here went for the trusts; and I think that the trusts "" got at "" both just as much as they wanted to do. But as far as Australia is concerned we are in a somewhat happier position than the United States, because if you care to look at the history of trusts in the United States you will find that almost every great trust depends for its enormous income upon some right over transportation, some pull that it has over the means of transport. For instance, the Standard Oil Trust controls the oilways, and the carriage of oil, and controls interests in railway companies also, whereby it has managed to secure to itself a monopoly of freight which has broken up all competition. In Australia. I am thankful to say that no person can I know that we have have any monopoly in transportation, unless indeed the Government of any State gives a right of monopoly in transportation to,some particular competitor in a particular"" business; just as at the present, time it seems to me that the Government is prepared to give a monopoly of labour I suggest that the Government to one type of labour in the Australian Commonwealth.

I rose more particularly to deal with a few instances of Government mismanagement, but have The Governbeen led away by my honourable friend, and must deal with the increased cost of living. It seems to me that this increased cost of living in Australia is a matter that calls for the closest and most competent investigation that we can give it .

Further, I trust that when my honourable friends' appointees go into this question of the increased cost of living, they will face it squarely, and ascertain how much of the increase is due to the operation of Tariffs, how much of it is due to the operations of trusts and combines, how much again is due to the lack of confidence in this community at present, and how much is due to the artificial raising of the wages of the community. Take the last subject first: It is worthy of consideration. Wages are raised in a particular industry. That means that the employer passes on the increased cost of his industry to the general consumer. whose wages are increased a few shillings a week is engaged in the making of boots. When he starts to buy the necessaries of life he finds that similar increases of wages have been granted to every other person who has been making other articles which he has to wear and eat, and everything else, even to the house in which he lives. The result of all these various increases in the cost of labour is that the unfortunate maker of boots finds first that the house in which he lives, owing to the cost of building having gone up, is a great deal more expensive than it used to be, and he finds the same thing in regard to all the necessaries of life. have been built twenty years or more?. to them also.

It that Wages Boards have been similarly is a law of human nature that is operating; operating with regard to every other in the control of this particular type of: labourer employed in producing all the property. articles which he has to eat and to clothehimself with. The result is that his wagesare of less value to him than they were before they were increased. When all is said and done, wages are only valuable for what they will buy, and if a mangets an increase of a few shillings a week in wages, and finds that their purchasing, power is a great many shillings less than was the case previously, he is worse off than he was before this all-round rise in the cost of living took place. argument, it would appear that the higher the wages the worse it is for the working man. Let us assume that a man old days, when the honourable member used to talk Free Trade, he would have known that competition was the one thing that actually assessed value. If you increase 1 the competition for labour, you actually increase its rewards without increasing the cost of living. Unfortunately, in this, country to-day we have not the competitionfor labour that used to exist. In Souths America some of the richest countries in the world, potentially, have been held back for centuries because of the lawless nature of their inhabitants. In this country competition for labour is not what it ought ta be, not because there are bandits in the country, but because, rightly or wrongly, Capital, in the abstract, imagines that all the bandits in the country are banded toI wish to deal now with the question of rent, to which the honourable member for Maribyrnong has referred. more persons applying for Houses in our",62,Naval Exi En Iutuke

I think that a great many of the objections which are .urged to the establishment of a Capital of Australia in its own Territory will disappear so soon as it is realized that an act of economy may be effected, by utilizing that Capital, through the saving of ground rent, which must be paid for Government offices in this city in competition with the big population here gathered. But in the Federal area, undoubtedly mistakes are occurring, undoubtedly there is a lack of organization, in fact, there seems to be no general organization, such as would be initiated under private control if anything on so big a scale were being established. I think that, for a time, the whole show was under the control of a clerk of works-a n excellent man, but overloaded with too many responsibilities, with too many conflicting authorities cast upon him, without an opportunity of honouring anything. They have improved that lately, but the result of a lack of organization, the result of not having some person directly responsible, and living constantly on the spot, is to be found in the curious mistakes which constantly occur, and which, in their rectification, entail a considerable amount of unnecessary expense.

We have freedom of trade in theory between State and State; but, if we look into the railway freights and rates, I think that we shall come to the conclusion that there is something to be done in the way of removing what I must describe as unfair competition. I am grateful to the Attorney-General for being kind enough to -be present for a few moments this evening, when 1 desire to bring under the notice of .the House, and the Government, some matters of interest. My attention has been called to the subsidies given by various States to the shipping companies, and the detrimental effect of those subsidies in some States. Speaking off-hand, I am inclined to' think that these subsidies are unconstitutional; and it is just as well to devote a little time to their consideration, putting aside the -question whether we are to have a one year's Budget, or a ten years' Budget. Rightly or wrongly, Adelaide flour for many years ; held a very high value, not only in the Australian markets, but in the markets abroad. I do not say that other States are not to compete, or that the quality of their I went from the stables to flour may not have improved; but when we find that the South Australian flour is ceasing to have the hold that it had in the past, it is fair to inquire as to the cause. My attention has been called to this matter in my own State by the following newspaper extractI refer now to the flour export trade of Australia, in which our own State has, until recent years, held the premier position, but from which unfair and unfederal tactics of her companions in the Federal Union. Subsidies are now being paid by a number of the States, and if these are not checked by Commonwealth intervention, or by the adoption of a State policy here, similar to those existing elsewhere, disaster must inevitably overtake an industry in which employment is found for a great number of our people, and in which, also, the interests of agriculturists and others are seriously involved, quite apart from the question of manufacture. The (Hindmarsh) subsidy system was inaugurated by Victoria in 1007, when an arrangement was made with the Currie line of steamers for a five-weekly service to Java and Singapore, for which the company was paid £2,000 per annum. In the folWhen lowing year New South Wales followed Victoria's lead by subsidizing Burns, Philp, and Company's boats'for a service to the East, at a higher sum than was paid by her neighbouring State to the Currie line; and, later on, QueensPrior to that time, there had land took a hand in the business by granting a subsidy to steamers trading to Manila and Hongkong. Encouraged by the action of the eastern States, Western Australia has gone one better, by the purchase of three large steamers, the first of which is now in commission, and the others on passage to Fremantle. These boats are to carry Western Australian produce exclusively, and Premier Scaddan last week definitely stated that he intended to br'ng the trade of Singapore down to Fremantle, and was determined that the State's products, particularly flour, should be carried to Java with advantage to the manufacturer through the facilities in possession of the Government by their State-owned vessels. On the day following this announcement, a deputation of millers and merchants waited on the Premier, asking for a further concession in regard to other markets, particularly South African, and the promise was obtained that in this direction also the Government would afford assistance by subsidizing a service, if the ordinary means of communication were insufficient for the proper development of the trade of Western Australia. Within the past few weeks, New Soulh Wales has made a further move by granting a subsidy of £2,095 P c r annum to the E. and A. line for a service to Shanghai; and this is the most objectionable arrangement of all, being distinctly preferential, a3 it discriminates between the shipper from New South Wales and those from any other State. This, briefly, is the history of the subsidy system in Australia, and it is interesting to_ note the effect it has had upon the trade of this State, for, when the figures submitted below are carefully examined, oie can come to no other conclusion thanthat our flour export trade",66,Naval Exi En Iutuke

It was in 1907 that Victoria began the subsidy system, and, in the five years which have elapsed, the trade has grown rapidly, owing to a large increase ia consumption, but in this expansion South Australia's share has considerably diminished, and the following figures will show the direction in which ihe trade has moved, for it will be seen that our exports during 1911-12 are nearly 6,000 tons short of the quantity we shipped in 1906, when the total requirements of Java were over one-third less than they are to-day :N.S.W.

The Government of Western Australia are quite within their rights in doing what they can to develop the resources of their own State, although I do not doubt that they will refuse to accept freights from any neighbouring State. But the position of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, is quite different.

I have taken it up because 1 have noticed how i i has been working for a considerable time in that State. I do not think it is fair, that this Parliament should say that all the relief it can give to South Australia is to suggest that she should herself subsidize a line of steamers and retaliate upon her neighbours. That certainly was not one of the objects of the Federal compact.. Under existing conditions, my State is not getting a fair deal. I"" direct the attention of the Government to the matter, to which there may be an opportunity later to refer. I am verygrateful, in the meantime, to the Attorney-General for his promise to look into it. journed. House adjourned at 10.37 P' m",68,Exports To Java
