Sir WILLIAMIRVINE agree with that view. I think that the pledge was made subject to any overriding necessity of the Commonwealth. Minister. he will state his view when the time comes. Had it been otherwise, this Parliament would have deliberately surrendered an essential function. It might have to face an emergency at any moment. The attitude I took up was this. I saidI agree with the Leader of the Opposition when he says that we ought to give thc assurance-and we do by passing this Bill give the assurance-to the States that we contemplate nothing within the horizon of practical politics, to use ""the language of the Leader of the Opposition, which will be likely to induce us to alter the terms of this measure. That is the strongest declaration of intention that we can make. But I. decline to go further than that, and to consider that there can be anything in the nature of a pledge binding the conscience of any inember of this House with regard to what may be the case should the ultimate necessities of the Commonwealth require a change. I understand that that view was generally assented to at the time, but I may be wrong. sure itself.

Parliament is not a treaty. Is*it suggested that Acts under which municipalities are subsidized cannot be repealed or amended -without breach of faith by State Legislatures? The view that I now put forward is that which I expressed when the matter was originally under discussion. To take any other attitude is to assert that this Parliament then surrendered its freedom of action at a time of most serious responsibility, such as a crisis of the kind with which we are now faced. ment says that an agreement shall continue for ten years, I think that that constitutes a binding promise.

The primary obligation of leading in, and insisting upon, that economy lies upon the Prime Minister of Australia. by setting an example to the States. we must not wait. The finances of Australia are one concern; those of the States cannot be divorced from those of the Commonwealth. To attempt -such a divorce means ruin. In finance divided responsibility means no responsibility. That is what has led to all the trouble, aud it may lead to infinitely more trouble. Not only is a determined effort, led by this Parliament, necessary to effect drastic and complete reforms in the finances of both the States and the Commonwealth I do not for the purposes of tlie war, it is necessary also to secure our position after the war. When peace is concluded we shall be in vested with new rights and new responsibilities, such as no community of our size has ever yet enjoyed. At the end of a successful war, not only shall we be intrusted with the development of the whole of Australia, but we shall also be charged with the policing and tlie care of huge interests, outside Australia, in the Southern Ocean. If we are to be in a position not merely to do what is necessary to win the war, but also to take upon ourselves, and support worthily, the burden of a noble heritage, such as has never yet fallen to a people of our size-the development of the great country that we now hold and the care of many surrounding-",24,Setup

It is because of tbese considerations that I pay special attention to the use of the word "" economy"" by honourable members opposite. Both the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Flinders have urged that economy must be exercised.' economy is desirable, and that the man who lives in a frugal way, even in time of plenty, is a better citizen than is a spendt h r if t . A certain expenditure, however, is necessary for the upkeep of every community. There is, no doubt, a certain amount of waste going on. I was very much impressed by some figures given recently by Mr Chiozza Money, a member of the British House of Conimons, who is also a member of the Finance Committee appointed by the British Government to carry out the work of financial organization in the United Kingdom. Discussing the habits of the Britisli people, Mr Chiozza Money, in the March number of the Fortnightly Beview, mentions the fact that in respect of a few luxurieshe does not include all luxuriesthe people of the United Kingdom spend at the rate of £350,000,000 per annum, and he makes the comment that a nation that can spend. £350,000,000 per annum, on luxuries should not find it very difficult to find £500,000,000 to carry on a big war. the necessity of every member of the community contributing his or her quota to the upkeep of the country, I hope we shall always remember that out of £15,000,000 raised by Customs and Excise duties, no less than £12,500,000 comes out of the pockets of the poorer people of the community. It is well for us, when dealing, at a time like the present, with the finances of the country, to consider how these people have been contributing to the maintenance of government in the years gone by. wealth they possess, the poorer sections of the community are already contributing, and have been contributing year after year, very handsomely indeed to the revenue of the Commonwealth. Surely the proportion I have mentioned is more than a f a i r contribution on their part to the governmental expenses of the country. Another point which must not be overlooked is that the working classes have to buy in small quantities, and, therefore, as a rule, have to contribute to the profits of all engaged in industry.. It is they who deal chiefly with the retail man. I think I may safely say that the richest men in the community live at wholesale rates. It is the poorest, and We are all agreed that not the richest, section of the community that pays the biggest price for the goods it consumes. The wealthy section of the community is prepared to pay big prices for luxuries, but in respect of their general livin g requirements they purchase at wholesale rates. in the household of the squatter or the big farmer, as well as the food required for their employees, are purchased at wholesale rates. honourable member was referring to the wealthy people living in our cities. apply to them.

Excluding luxuries, such as motor cars, they are able to huy what they want for less than it costs the poor man who has to make his purchases in small quantities. Thus the poorer classes are not only paying more than two-thirds of the Customs and Excise taxation, but they have to pay more than the rich for the goods they require. Y e t In proportion to the another consideration is the fact that, as a rule, the workers have the largest families. As every one knows, the man with a large family to feed and clothe contributes more to the cost of the upkeep of government than does the man with a small f a m i l y; and I hope that, in connection with any new taxation that may be imposed, there will be not",25,Setup

Alreadyi n some of the States the number of a man's family is taken into account in the imposition of taxation, and I think that such a principle might well be introduced into the Commonwealth scheme of taxation. The consideration is one that cannot be ignored when taxation is being imposed. If we are going to place additional taxation on the man who already finds it difficult to provide for his wife and family, we shall do a very serious in j u r y to the most deserving members of the community, and I , for one, shall not be prepared to tolerate such a thing for any length of time. A great economic question is involved in the consideration of tliis measure. It has always been said that the heaviest burden should be placed on the strongest shoulders. The weaker portions of our community must be protected by the stronger, and in respect of taxation the biggest burden should be borne by those best able financially to hear it .

We have, in final analysis, one security With my right honourable and one responsibility. There were for Swan, I had differences in the -per capita liability of the States. Speaking from memory, Victoria owed in 1898 about £ 4 2 per head, and South Australia about £ 6 9 , and there was an average per capita in somewhat remote in retrodebtedness for all the States of approxiif I point out that many of mately £ 5 2 .

In order to show that the quoting, some of the appeals Convention was not asleep in regard to this matter, and as many of the younger debts generation of politicians do not know what took place at the Convention, I may be permitted to give the text of an amendment I moved. On clause 98 I moved an amendment which, if carried, would but put forward have added to the clause these wordsalternative solutions by Existing public debts of the States shall be taken over by the Commonwealth at the date of its establishment, and the interest thereon shall be a charge on the Consolidated Fund. Each State shall indemnify the Commonwealth",28,Setup
34,Mr Glynn,"T h a t is so, and I havein respect of the amount by which its debts exceed thc average amount of tlie debts of all the States, after such debts have, for the purpose of ascertaining their relative values, been reduced to and expressed in a debt of the average currency and rate of interest of the debts of all the States. The Commonwealth shall be deemed to be indebte'd to a State in the amount so ascertained by which the reduced debt of the State is less than the average amount of the reduced debts of all the States. The debts of the States being extended over different terms, and carrying different rates of interest, it was necessary to express in terms of one common stock the relative indebtedness of the States and having equated all the stocks under one denomination, we were to take the average and fix the credits and debits accordingly. I have more than once suggested in this House that that method be adopted and a limitation placed on the borrowing powers of the States. There are various logical ways of prescribing how that limitation could be imposed, b u t this is not the time for debating that matter. agree with the honourable member for Flinders that there are times when there taking, and it is better not to wart unti l the emergency has arrived to arouse us from our slumbers and lethargy and to awaken, when the best of the opportunity has passed, to the necessity for prescience and economy. Speaking on the Budget, on the 21st August, 19.12, I saidNations, like men, occasionally take stock. They must endeavour to ascertain the proportion between tlieir effective resources and their responsibilities-to what extent they can meet without any undue disturbance of their normal social and industrial conditions the calls that an emergency may at anj' time make, which must, of course, with becoming fortitude, be fncetl. Were it not for the continued change we are undergoing in international relations, I personally should not be much disquieted by the perceptible fastness of thc financial pace. But we must remember that we are part of an Empire, the stability of which directlj' touches at least one-fifth of the human racenn Empire so colossal in its proportions, and so vast in its extent, that there is, perhaps, scarcely a moment of our lives when it does not touch or afreet the enterprises or ambitions of some otlier country or people. I proceeded to show that there were clouds on the horizon, the significance of which we should take some notice of. Referring to the delusions that arose, both at Home and in Australia, from the fact [192] that at the moment our .prosperity was exceptional, I saidImperial prosperity is exceptional; and the same may be said about our own. Should war arise, then, the test of our capacity to meet our responsibilities will be applied. War, we know, is always wasteful; and, ou one side at least, is generally wanton. At the same time, we are proud to feel that the Empire makes for peace; but tlie maintenance of peace depends on conditions and circumstances which we ourselves cannot prescribe or control. Even if the issue of peace or war did lie with the Imperial choice, we must recognise the fact that, at any time, the incapacity, haste, blundering, or petulance of a Foreign Minister may precipitate a crisis big with the fate of nations. t ""We have to j u s t i fy our position sometimes in order to avoid any possible idea that we were insensible of the financial problems and possibilities that were before us. May I refer with the greatest possible respect to one or two opinions expressed by the honourable member for Flinders?

I shall show the pace at which it does lend money to other nations, and, commercially speaking, it is perhaps the most prosperous country in the world. That circumstance may not be conclusive. It is a fact, also, that Australia's prosperity and progress have been greatest since we began to borrow internally. Turning to the figures issued by the Board of Tradef o r the last decade, we find that the proportion of our indebtedness which is local has been substantially increased during the last ten years. It is somewhat significant that when that canon of financial prudence which the honourable member for Flinders has laid down was not applied, our prosperity seemed to be most on the increase. T f we look at the apparent aggregated wealth, in the for m of bank deposits, we find that there is a large surplus always awaiting an outlet, far more than thc banks can apply profitably, aud I cannot see that the applying of our own capital to the development of our own resources, and preventing the expansion of that drain by way of interest to the outside world, which has been in progress for the last for t y years, does not give a ""balance of advantage in our favour.",29,Setup

I do not know what stand I would have taken up had I not been bound at the time by a sort of corporate conscience to believe that the B ill brought down for the purT h a t is the point. So pose of altering the Constitution in that regard was the last word in political wisdom. Personally, I am not altogether sorry that the power to meet a great emergency by keeping back, or not extending, the 25s. per head, which is given to us by the Constitution, was conferred upon us by the better judgment of the electors of Australia. If we only reprobigger mistake now by going back on the other alternative on which the electors acted, which was that there was to be an assurance t h a t for a further experimental period of ten years the States were to receive from 'the Commonwealth a per capita payment of 25s. per annum-the very payment which the electors did not wish to see embodied in the Constitution. Thoughi t may be necessary in a great national crisis to call up every available revenue that we have, I say that unless there is an overpowering sense of necessity We should not do so. would not be a party to repudiating a solemn compact with the States? The be no misunderstanding. I say that we should not break what tlie States have regarded as a kind of contractual obligation. Though we have the power to repeal it , the understanding was that, though the Constitution was not to be amended in order to insert in it a -per capita payment of 25s. as a fixed provision, at least the payment of the same amount per head to the States should continue for au experimental period of ten years. We should therefore Sir WILLIAMIRVINE The whole point is whether it was a contract. a contract; but we should not settle questions of general policy by the mere text or test of an ordinary agreement.

41,Mr Glynn,"I know that it. was not in history and the necessity for exceptional expedients. To realize the extant of the obligations ""we may have to face is almost impossible. When we think of the territorial extent of the war-from Switzerland to the Atlantic at Ostend, from Ostend to the Baltic, from the Baltio across half of Europe to Boumania, and from the eastern frontier of Austria across to the Italia Irredenta; when we consider also-what appeals to us more directly-the conflict in the Dardanelles, stretching from the iEgean Sea to the Bosphorus, in regions of immortal memories, which our own brave boys have crowned-vre must realize that the war is one of the most colossal in history. When tested by the number of nations engaged, by the wastage in life and energy, by its effect on commerical relationships, and by its far-reaching moral and racial possibilities,' we realize that there' has never been so vast a struggle since the world experienced the meddlesomeness, the passions, and the heroic ardour of mankind. But while recognising the tremendous responsibilities before us, there, are one or two matters to which one can draw attention as showing what, as time goes on, will 'be our cauacity to hear these obligations. I may begin' by mentioning the change in the burden of a nation's debt as its population and prosperity increase. I am .speaking as one who has never been an advocate of a borrowing policy. In 1902, when Sir George Turner brought in his first extraordinary BUI for borrowing £571,000, of which about £220,000 was. to go to works in New South Wales-all States receiving their shares of the expenditure-that Customs, after the Commonwealth had taken under £1,200,000 more than it had received in the previous yeaT. So obsessed were the' people of Australia with the idea of borrowing that it became as a sort of reflex action on the part of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth to ask for a loan whether he needed it or not. I do not think that Sir George Turner was enthusiastic over his loan proposal, biit as he was a Minister, he was driven to it in that corporate sense that"" sometimes drives people in a direction contrary to that in which their own personal wishes Would guide them. However, I am glad -to say that we threw out that Bill or [192]-2 resolution, my vote helping that decision. Let us take the position of the TJnited Kingdom during the last fifty years. There has been a marked development, which we can compare with the position of a young community like ours with the potentialities and powers of development which we possess. Until 1846, unfortunately, there was not much change in the conditions of the United Kingdom. Factory legislation was blocked on all hands. There were extraordinary ideas about trade, aud as to what prosperity consisted of. Thanks to Sir Robert Feel, and others, a new era began about 1850, brought a'bout by the relaxation of the grip that existed in regard to external commerce, and hy paying more attention to the condition of the masses by meanB of beneficent factory and social legislation. The results were, perhaps, greater than were hoped for' by those who had given attention to political matters in the preceding generation The national debt of the United Kingdom fifty years ago .<*s £821,000,000, or £28 per head. To show that increased population and increased prosperity .gradually diminish the .burden of a .national debt, that of the United Kingdom on the 23rd April, 1913, was £661,000,000,, or only £14 per head. During the fifty years the decline in the indebtedness per head was from £28 to £14. On the 31st March the national debt of the United Kingdom, owing-to the war, had increased by £458,000,000. The Budget statement of Mr Lloyd George showed that the total indebtedness was £1,165,802,000, but it is encouraging to know that the British Chancellor had been reducing it at the State received through the rate of about £12,000,000 per year. The Liberal Government in Great Britain, its one-fourth, .as provided during their term of office, struck off by the Braddon section, about redemption £107,000,000 of the national debt. I am not speaking as an advocate of borrowing, but because I think the people ought to be shown that there is a light in which borrowing in a great national crisis such as this should he viewed, enabling them to look with the brighter outlook which I am sure is in store for Australia at the obligations which are now so willingly recognised by those who have the means at their disposal to pay; because 'these obligations, if the development of Australia is equal to the magnificence of. its resources, should be more lightly borne in the future, always assuming that we do not abuse our powers of borrowing OF taxation by extravagance. Let me take the position of the TJnited Kingdom. The £2,700,000,000, and the national debt was £900,000,000, or equal to a mortgage pressure of 33 per cent. That was at a period when the Napoleonic wars were concluding, and some people, according to their means, were paying up to two-thirds of their incomes in order to meet the obligations imposed by those wars. The value of property in the TJnited Kingdom in 1909 was £14,000,000,000, and the national debt at that time was £754,000,000, or a mortgage pressure of only 5 per cent. If the figures of 1913 are taken, when the national debt was £707,000,000, and the accumulations are assumed to have increased at the rate they have been doing during the last ten years, the pressure would be only 4 per cent, on the capital resources of the United Kingdom. A comparison of the indebtedness of the United Kingdom with that of the other belligerent nations shows that Great Britain stands in the strongest poeition. I do not propose to give all the figures. On the 31st December, 1915, the national debt of Prance will probably be £2,253,000,000, while that of G-reat Britain is set down at £1,587,000,000. us look at the resources of the TJnited Kinsrdom. The British investments during the six years from 1906 to 1011 were £829,000,000. I refer to foreign investments and ship earnings, which are always taken into account as external investments. These had been proceeding at the rate of £2,500,000 a day up to the beginning of the war, when this form of investment was practically stopped. It is in these tremendous resources that are now entirely devoted to the purpose of enabling the people of Great Britain to meet their loan necessities, and the call for revenue to meet annual expenditure, that we see the source of the fortitude and ease with which, happily, the Imperial Government have met their obligations. investments of British capital amount to £4,000,000,000. semi-public ' investments the people of . Great Britain earn £200,000,000 a year in interest. In his Budget speech Lloyd George mentions that the well-to-do, as he calls them, have £4,000,000,000 invested in . property value in 1812 was foreign and Colonial securities. The investments of the Imperial Government are not very large. They were summed up in the Budget, aud consist of Suez Canal shares, among other things; but the State property of Great Britain is insignificant compared with the property of individuals. Then there are annual savings amounting to £300,000,000 or £400,000,000. member know what sums have been lent to Austria and to Germany? formation here. As much as 95 per cent, of the £200,000,000 earned by external investments come from couutries not affected by the operations of the war. Germany's foreign investments, however, are ' mostly in countries affected by the war. Many other facts of that kind, when summed up, show the tremendous financial strength, and consequently great borrowing power, of the Imperial Government of Great Britain. Since the war, the trade of Great Britain has diminished by £170,000,000; but her foreign trade still amounts to £1,223,269,000. I am glad that our Passing on, let proposed loan is to be made the subject of an appeal to the general public. In the first instance, the Imperial Government was niggardly in its recognition of the small investor. There were 100,000 applications for the loan floated in November, £700,000,000 being tendered to cover a loan of £350,000,000. In the case of the first German loan, which was for £2a3 036,445, 75 per cent, of the ap; plications were for less than £100 worth of stock. The'loan was mentioned at the time as a magnificent .expression of the grit of Germany, and of the German capacity to meet internal obligations. In connection with the German loan, which was issued in, I think, February last, there were 2,691,060 applications, and of these 1,694,359 .were for sums of £50 and under, and over 911,000 for sums of between £50 and £500. That was another splendid example of the spirit of the people of Germany with which we have to contend. The last Imperial loan showed that when a similar abroad of appeal was made to the people of Great Britain the response wascommensurate, and I believe that the same thing will happen here.

45,Mr Glynn,"I haye not that inissue, I think that no harm can be done by dwelling on the necessity for caution. The States which are at war seem to have reached the limits of that borrowing which is done under the guise of a note issue. L e t us consider the position of the Bix great national banks. In March last, the Bank of England had increased. its note issue, including the Treasury notes, by £43,500,000, as compared with the issue of March-, 1914; the Bank of France had increased its issue by £212,000,000; the issue of the Imperial Bank of Germany £157,000,000; that of the Bank of Bussia by £150,000,000; and that of the Austro-Hungary Bank by £89,000,000, the £262,000,000, .to £1,253,000,000. gold reserves of these banks, we shall see how cautious they have all been. The Bank of England had a gold reserve against Bank and Treasury notes of 117 per cent.; the Bank of France, a gold reserve of 38 per cent.; the Imperial Bank of Germany, a gold reserve of 46 per cent.; the Bank of Bussia, a gold reserve of 50 per cent.; and the AustroHungary Bank, a gold reserve of 45 per cent., the gold reserve in every case being greater than ours, which is about 33 per cent. banks have increased by £149,000,000, and their note currency by about £652,000,000. Let us see what they say about theset matters at Home. Lloyd George, in that part of his Budget speech which was headed *' The Paper Bridge, "" Tefers to the note borrowing of Germany, and saysThere is, first of all, a paper bridge-wha t is known as dilution of thc currency. Disguise it as they will, there are many girders in the' .German financial bridge which are made of paper, and no amount of paint and varnish wiU hide the fact. It is an easy and very tempting'method. You appear to get over -your difficulties in the simplest way, and it is very difficult for any one to point out the way you are going wrong for some time. Looking at it most carefully, it is simply an indirect method of levying taxes upon the income of the people. You water the currency, and the prices go up. . A country that bas no foreign trade, which is the case in Germany, can do it . A' country which has still got a great international trade cannot do it. -vanish, and there would be a rise in the price of provisions which would be fatal to any Phancellor of thc Exchequer. Therefore, that ia a course which would be fatal for a Chancellor of the Exchequer to pursue in order to get over his difficulties in 'meeting the deficiency. It ' is as well that we should bear in min d in regard to our financing the trend of. Imperial opinion. ber say why there has been such an increase of the note issues of Germany and France compared with that of England? Isi t due to the greater use of cheques in England? cent, of the financial currency of the city had been increased by of London consists of cheques and bills of exchange, less than 1 per cent, consists of gold, and about 1 per cent, consists of notes. The Scotch' note currency is about total increase being about 10 or 12 per cent.

As regards the imposition of income tax, I would urge caution upon the Treasurer in fixing the scale. The income' taxation of the State Governments brings in £2,881,055 a year, my figures being for the year ended 30th June, 1914'. Holman has increased the income taxation of New South Wales by about £1,000,000, and the State direct taxation is now about £4,000,000. have are not absolutely reliable for the purposes of comparison. If you take Mr Lloyd George's speech of the 5th March, you w ill see that the yield of the British income tax,, the rate of which has been doubled, is now £59,279,000, but the yield of the previous year, which I take fro m other sources/ was £47,249,000, so that the doubling of the rate has not greatly increased the return. There has been very heavy pressure on some classes, without corresponding benefit to the Treasury. The war supertax brings in about £10,000,000. It is paid by 26,000 persons, about 15,000 of whom were new taxpayers after the war budget was framed. The increased pressure upon Gold would individuals has been great, but the in -, creased return to the Treasury has been comparatively small.

They must therefore find some better means than a blind increasing of rates, without oare and discrimination. I agree with the honourable members for Parramatta, Flinders, and Swan that we should have had a comprehensive survey of the whole position before being asked to decide as to the taxation to be imposed, and the manner of imposition. We should have the opinion of financiers, or Treasury officials, as to the comparative effect of various expedients posal now before the House. some truth say that, unfortunatelv, once a proposal is Drought before the Housei t cannot be altered. The only opportunity an honourable member has of compassing his desire is by speaking before those private meetings are held of which we hear so much, and which make the House the mere register of unalterable opinions. economy is being, made a leading plank of the platform. appealed to the people to economize, but I am afraid that very often if you do not spend you embarrass other persons. It is extravagance that we ought to avoid; parsimony and meanness, restriction in the wrong direction, .would strike at those whom we wish to assist. The subject is one ih regard to whioh many opinions are held to which expression is not always given. Another matter to whioh I should like to make reference is the spirit with which the German people are meeting appeals made to them. In sneaking on the last German Loan Bill, Dr. Delbruck, the Vice-President of the Prussian State Department, mentioned that this was not only a war of nations and of armies, bnt of people against people; and the sooner we recognise that the better. He saidThe war upon which we are now engaged is .altogether different from those of former centuries. Then the Army went forth; the people at home sent their good wishes after them, and rejoiced in thiir victories. To-day England's attempt to starve us out has made* this war a war of people against people-nay , of man against man-so that every one, no matter wliether he be in the field or at home, under arms or at work, without distinction of age OT sex, must devote his whole being to the simple service of war. Every one of ns must from morn till night direct every activity by the one question-no w to injure the enemy ana serve onr country. than that. fit hy the words of our enemy. Immense sacrifices are being made in Germany. I read the other day that the people there are actually obsessed with the idea that the world is against them, and wrongly against them; that there is a sort of religious opinion abroad that has welded the nation into one united whole. spirit is the only thing we have to fear. ences, if we keep abreast of the occasion, I think we have very little to fear. L et us not listen to the voice of Belial, thespiritTo vice industrious, but to nobler deeds Timorous and slothful, who with words cloth'd in reason's garb Counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloth. Not peace : nor, with Mammon, ""live to ourselves only "" ; but rather, purging our minds of every sordid desire and unmanly apprehension; hearken to the imperative accents of conscience and of country; to the silent eloquence of our surroundings and. the still, small voice within us which speaks of personal honour and patrioticduty, and tells us that most of the prestige and blessings we enjoy are derived! from our fellow citizens or from our forbearsa moral and material heritagethat we must hand down untarnished and undiminished to the long line of generations who, in surroundings so preciousand endearing, are to succeed us upon'the boards. diBCUssion of this measure naturally opens up a vista of the financial relationship of the Commonwealth and State Governments, and of the whole financial position. The Commonwealth aud State Governments, having joint powers in regard tb the taxation of the same sources of wealth, are certainly acting in a most irregular manner. The honourable member for Flinders dealt very effectively with this aspect of the situation, and one cannot but endorse his fear as to what the consequences may be.

Nbmin-ally we may be the guardian of the State finances, but in fact we have absolutely no control over them. The State Governments are sovereign within their own sphere, and instead of approaching them with the air of dictators, as has been done, I am sorry to say, in some cases, by M in isters, Ave should meet them as equals with propositions to be discussed. ;thus reasoning together Ave might arrive at a satisfactory solution of the problem of hoAV the joint finances of the whole country should be conducted. It is the height of absurdity tliat Governments that are in no way acting in concert -should be levying upon the same people, -and draAvingi n tlie same way upon the -same sources of Avealth. This system has -continued too long. -even been able to bring about the consolidation of the State debts. A proposal for tbeir consolidation was carried, but I understand that, owing to limitations Avhich the State Governments insisted aipon maintaining, in respect qf their right to borrow independently of the -CommonAvealth, the proposition fel l through, and the motion has never been put into effect. If it is necessary that the Constitution should be amended, in -order tliat a better nnancial arrangement may be arrived at, then such an -amendment should have been included in the other proposals Avhich have -been submitted by this Government, and which it is proposed to place before the people. Finance is admittedly one -of the most difficult questions Avith Avhich Ave have to deal, but, apparently, the more immediate troubles under which we labour-the questions of the determination of industrial conditions, the -control of monopolies, and like subjectshave obscured every other consideration. I take the view that behind all these there -still remains the great financial problem which threatens to, and undoubtedly will, -swamp us if the several separate Governments of the Commonwealth and the States are to continue, each in their own way, heedless of all other considerations. We have to recognise that the States, Avithin their respective spheres, are sovereign powers, and that the Commonwealth Parliament cannot do as it pleases with them. It is open to us, of course, to act independently of them, and to go to the extent of discontinuing the present payment to the States of 25s. per head of the population; bu t I do not say that that should be done. An y such action would still further estrange the States, and the estrangement between the State and Commonwealth Governments is already too marked. There appears to be, on the part of the Government of the Commonwealth, a tendency to emphasize By its supremacy, although, in fact, it has no real supremacy. The sovereign States, in their respective spheres, are just as dominant as Ave are in our sphere of government. As a matter of fact, their sphere is wider than our own, since a l l that is not specifically conveyed toils by the Commonwealth Constitution remains within their control. In these circumstances, therefore, there should be ou the part of our leaders We have not yet a sense of the fitness of things in approaching the State Governments. There has been displayed too much bitterness, and this bitterness is being fanned even now. The State Governments should have been approached before this loan proposal was brought forward. There should have been consultations between the Commonwealth and State Governments, and a decision, as far as possible unanimous, arrived at in regard to it . If we are going to exercise our presumed authority, and, as the Prime Minister suggested this afternoon, to look to the people to give us the power to do that which we cannot do now, then we should at once submit, with our other referenda proposals, a Bill to give us the poAver that we seek. called in the bankers of the States, b u t not the State Governments. in the face to the responsible State Governments exercising sovereign power within their own jurisdiction. We cannot afford to do anything of the kind. We cannot afford to permit ill-feeling to be engendered and fostered by the continuous ignoring of the State Governments. I take the view that some form of unification in respect of finance must be brought about very shortly, b u t we are not likely to secure it by acting as we have been doing, unless we succeed in winning the people to our side on an appeal to them by way of referendum, and to do that in the face of the opposition of the State Governments would be no",35,Setup

60,Mr Carr,"That in itself Avas a slapeasy task. It is for the Commonwealth to give a lead in this matter. If the Commonwealth Government, by virtue of its position, claims to be supreme, it should justify its claim by displaying that strength to concede, which, to my mind, is the hall-mark of superiority. Commonwealth Government is giving no evidence of such strength. AlthoughI support the Government, I say, unhesitatingly, that one of its weak spots is that it has not sufficiently considered the importance of the States. It has not treated with the State Governments with the object of bringing about, by common consent, a better system of finance, and of doing away with the present system under which each helps itself at will to this and that source of the wealth of the country. The responsibility of guardianship of the States, as suggested by the honourable member for Flinders, seems to me to be a responsibility without power. The Commonwealth is not in a position to act as the guardian of the States, and, that being so, I object to the assumption of that responsibility. The obligation, apparently, is all on our side. To put on the screw, as has been hinted at, by actually foreclosing as a mortgagee would do, because, to some extent, we have them in our power as debtors, would simply be to make confusion worse confounded, and to add insult to injury. Such a thing could not be tolerated for one moment. If one State became bankrupt, it would be to the discredit of the whole Commonwealth, and to talk of putting on the screw in that way is to suggest that which could not be given a moment's consideration. advance with a view to a compromise, such as that to which a sovereign State is entitled, should at once be made. longer we delay the more Australia will suffer. Coming to the war expenditure, I would point out that, whilst it is easy tc vote supplies, and whilst war supplies must be voted, their expenditure has not been as carefully guarded as it should havo been. Contracts have been let here, there, and everywhere under .1 system th.it has resulted in the Government being called upon to pay for many of its requirements far more than it has any need to do. If attention had been given to certiiia information that has been placed at the disposal of the Government at different times-and by myself amongst Mr Carr. ' others-larg e sums could have been saved. I make this statement here because it is useless to mention it elsewhere. In respect of certain contracts which have been let, 100 per cent, more has been paid for goods than need have been paid for them. The ThatI am in a position to prove. because of the union label condition in the contracts. whatever to do with any such consideration. When mentioning this matter I had in mind certain imported lines, with the facts relating to which I am familiar. One line indented by a keen business man ac a cost of 22s. 6d. per gross was bought by the Defence Department at prices running up to 46s. per gross. The expenditure in respect of this one item ran into thousands of pounds. In another caseand there are quite a number of themthe Department Avere paying 15s. per dozen for a certain article which I advised them could be landed here by the Government and supplied to the troops at a cost of 7s. per dozen. This advice was not acted upon. If the responsible authorities would only make inquiries from some of our keen commercial men, they would be put in the way of obtaining goods at first cost, instead of having to purchase them, even by tender, from rings of com.mercial men who will not cut against each other, but who will command their own jjrice whatever it may be. This sort of thing is still going on. I am in a position to show that, in respect of some of the requirements of the Department a saving of 100 per cent, could be effected. On the other hand, an OlTicialdom, however, is such that it cannot be overcome. One appeals to the Minister, who, in turn, appeals to his The officers, and is informed by them that what is suggested cannot be done. No intelligent, thoughtful interest is displayed in the business affairs of the country. No keen desire is shown to avoid unnccessarv expenditure of the kind I have just indicated. I recognise that Ministers are more or less at the behest of their officials under the present system of government, which, on the one hand, secures an evanescent responsibility to the Minister, and, on the other, permanence of control to the officers.

Although 4hey have advanced ';£10,000,000 to the Government Avithout interest, that docs not by any means exhaust their resources, and if they are approached in a friendly way I have no doubt that they will be ahle to do much to assure the success of this loan. I have gone to some trouble to get figures relating to the operations of the private banks, and I find that their assets on the 30th June, 1914, Avere £176,000,000. At the same time, their liabilities were £168,000,000. A very important matter in connection Avith the liabilities and assets of these private banks is that the banks have been gradually, but continuously, reducing the sums they had £6,000,000 in 1900 to £4,500,000 in 1914. That seems to indicate a very serious position. Surely our production is worth fostering. Surely our production ought to be a field of financial enterprise sound enough to encourage the banks to increase their advances rather than decrease them, and the position is one which I think needs attention. If the Government showed sympathy tOAvards the producing interests, I haA'e not much doubt that Ave should largely increase production, and so restore the confidence of the banks in this type of investment. Deposits not bearing interest-the ordinary trading accounts-in the private banks increased from 1914. The deposits bearing interest-and these deposits Avill undoubtedly provide a proportion of this war loan-hav e increased from £61,000,000 in 1905 to £93,500,000 in 3914. During the same period the deposits in the Savings Banks increasedfrom £35,500,000 to £83,500,000; and the total of interest-bearing deposits in all banks increased to no less , than £177,000,000 last year. That,is a very serious position for a young country like this to be in. With all the possibilities we have for the investment of money, the fact that we have £177,000,000 probably £180,000,000^-locked up at 3 to 3£ per cent, interest shows that there is something wrong somewhere. To my mind, this is due to an absence of confidence; and the principal thing that we can do at the present moment to make With the private this loan a success, not only so far as issues, and to establish a feeling of confidence iu Australian finance, is to do all that can be done to show that we",37,Setup

I am sorry to say that the Commonwealth Government raised this £6,500,000, as it had raised the £18,000,000, without parliamentary authority; but I hope that what I might, perhaps, call our precipitate act will be condoned under the circumstances.

Last year we financed about £4,000,000 odd for public works, and we may expect to have to finance a considerable amount of that expenditure again this year, though not all of it . Perhaps the right honourable gentleman can tell us how he is going to finance this £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 for public works this year. WhatI mean is that it seems somewhat unsatisfactory to be voting-loan proposals piece-meal in this way. ing B ill . we have heard much lately about the necessity for organizing our finances and putting them on a war basis. We have had many homiliesI have delivered one myself-o n the necessity for retrenchment and economy-for drawing in sail, and utilizing every pound we can lay our hands on for war purposes, and war purposes alone, while minimizing our expenditure in many other directions. confess I was surprised at the range that t h e ' debate took this afternoon. seemed to me that we were not merely debating our own loan proposals, but actually the whole range and scale of our constitutional powers, particularly as they affect finance. There is no use disguising the fact that the whole crux of the Constitution centres on the question of financial control. before we can point the finger at the States, either warningly or in any minatory way, we ought to resolutely set our own house in order. The best thing we can do for the States, and to the States, is to set them an excellent example. If we are responsible, as has been allegedand there is no doubt that in the eyes of the world Australia is held to its responsibility as associated with the Federal Parliament, and that in that high sense the statement is true-if we are responsible for the whole financial credit of Australia, then the best thing we can do is to set an example in economy and rigidly review our own position. I d o n ot think we can say anything to the StatesI presume that this loan stands unti l we have begun to do that. But are we getting the best out of the Federal .compact at the present time? Why should the Commonwealth stand over the States and tell them what they must do perforce ; or why should the States, on the other hand, criticise the Federal Government and tell them what they must almost not do?

I do not care how we re-arrange our machinery, we can never make the Commonwealth absolutely independent of the States, or make the States absolutely independent, of the Commonwealth. It is the very essence of Federation that each should subscribe to its own limitations. Federation begins with the recognition of the limitations of the Commonwealth; therefore there is in a Federal system of government, perhaps more than in any other system, a greater call for the display of the Federal spirit, altogether apart from the mere cold machinery of it . I admit freely and frankl y that there has been extravagance, wild extravagance; but can any honourable member say that we are to change all this by a mere alteration of machinery! Extravagance is a personal matter; it is not an impersonal matter, to be affected by machinery, as such. By machinery we may make extravagance easier or a little more difficult, but whatever the machinery may be, there will always be extravagance if the machinery is operated by extravagant people with extravagant notions, who seek to spend money for political and other purposes merely to put it round and make themselves popular in doing so. No machinery that I know of can stop Governments from doing this, and that is precisely what has been done in Australia in late years. Mr J. H .

Now that we are dealing with national rather than political matters, may I say that it was the greatest regret of my life that the Commonwealth Government had to do this. It was my ambition, as Treasurer, to finance our war expenditure without asking the Imperial Government for a penny.

However anxious we may be to arrive at some system of borrowing that will be mutually satisfactory to the States and the Commonwealth, the fact should not be overlooked that this is a specific motion to authorize the raising .of money to carry on the war. It is, in fact, a motion to validate that which has already been done. The Prime Minister has informed the Committee tliat, acting in the interests of the Commonwealth, he borrowed this £6,500,000 on the best terms possible, taking into consideration the circumstances of the time as occasioned by the war itself. I do not think it is wise, therefore, for us to discuss in -connection with this motion the question of whether or not the States have been consulted, more especially as the States were actually consulted by both parties in this Parliament some ten months ago, and that an agreement was then entered into with respect to future borrowing. The Commonwealth, at that time, was solicitous for the welfare of the States during the war crisis, and, consequently, took steps to provide for them. A sum of £18,000,000 was made available, and under the agreement then arrived at, there was a definite arrangement with respect to all borrowing up to the end of the present year. In view of that fact, and the fact that this Parliament is charged with the conduct of the warand this, to my mind, is a most important point-the States surely will take no exception to this proposal. ment, and not the Parliament of the States, has to find the funds necessary for defence purposes, and surely, in view of the agreement that has been arrived at, the States would not insist upon being consulted with respect to this particular transaction. Tot r y to make it appear that they should have been consulted, and that they have been overlooked in some way, is hardly to meet the position fairly. The Commonwealth Government is charged with the great responsibility of finding the money necessary to enable us to carry on the war, and I think every honourable member will agree that, having regard to all the circumstances, the acT h e information is tion taken by the Treasurer was the correct one. That being so, why should I am referring to there be any complaint, some months later, in regard to the question of conT h a t is another matsulting the States? There is certainly some room for an endeavour to arrive at an agreement with the Statesi n respect to future borrowing in the interests of both the States and the Commonwealth, and in such a way as to protect the taxpayers as a whole. I rose only to point out that it would be regrettable if it should go forth that there is any difference of opinion as to whether or not the States have received fair treatment. An y fair minded man, I think, will admit that the States have received reasonable consideration at the hands of both parties in this Parliament. Our defence expenditure is very heavy. If it were necessary to consult the States regarding this £6,500,000 it would be equally necessary to ask them whether they were agreeable to our floating the proposed loan of £20,000,000 to enable us to prosecute the war. gested that. £6,500,000 is for war purposes. The Prime Minister made it clear that he asked for £10,000,000, and that the British Government stated that, as £3,500,000 of that sum was for public works, we should ask only for £6,500,000. gesting that there should be a conference with the Statesi n regard to this £6,500,000. is the inference to be drawn from the honourable member's remarks regarding that sum?

A t the present time, as I think honourable members will agree, all the in dications are that we are in for a prolonged and strenuous war period, and we can only regard the future with a certain amount of trepidation. shall have to borrow this year, next year, and possibly the year after that. And I would urge that the States should get into their minds, clearly and definitely, the impossibility of borrowing money from the Commonwealth for the purpose of carrying on their public works at the same rate that they have been borrowing in the past. The Commonwealth is not in a position to lend the money, and we have not illimit able sources of taxation. We may raise a certain amount of loan money, b u t if we go beyond that we may do a good deal more damage than many people imagine. I would like to say, in regard to the LoanB ill that we have just passed, that if the money comes in when the Treasurer is not absolutely in need of it , the wisest course will be for him, instead of withdrawing the money from the commercial community, to leave it in the hands of the institutions in which it is deposited, so that it may be available for commercial use. If we draw indefinitely large sums of money out of the ordinary channels of commerce, the result will be that men will be unable to extend their busiuesses, and that there will be a large number of men out of work. That situation stares us in the face as clearly as daylight. Unless we are particularly caref u l in the expenditure of the huge sums of money that are now being raised, we shall bring financial disaster upon this country.

The wisest policy would be for the States to curtail tlieir expenditure. We cannot possibly curtail our war expenditure. We may prevent extravagances in particular directions, and I hope we shall do that ; b u t we are now creating a national debt exactly on the same lines as the national debts of the older countries in the w o r l d ; we are blowing the money away in powder and shot. We shall have no asset to show for it . The money that has been borrowed in the past by the States has been mostly spent upon public works. The Commonwealth is not doing that. tory we shall acquire in the Pacific? that will be worth to us, but I . would like to urge upon the Government the necessity of making provision for sinking funds. I take it that no provision has been made in connection with the repayment of this money to the British Government for a sinking fund . is a clause dealing with trust funds provided by the Commonwealth, which reads as follows: A separate account sliall be kept in the Treasury, to be called the Trust Fund Account, of all moneys that shall be placed to the credit of that fund, under such separate heads as may be directed by the Treasurer. Another clause in that Act states that no money shall be paid out of that fun d except by the authority of Parliament. I think it was the honourable member for Bourke who said last night that trust funds were piled up by an economical Treasurer for the benefit of the first Treasurer who came along short of cash and made an appeal to Parliament.

189,Mr Joseph Cook,"Exactly, andto the financial position that they haye not been consulted; but the situation is developing in such a way that, if something is not done, both the Commonwealth and the States will suffer, and there will be resultant distress throughout the country. This is almost wholly due to the changed aspect that has come over the financial situation during the last few months. When the war broke out, the States were the only borrowers on the market. The Commonwealth did not publicly borrow: there was no necessity for it to do so. The States had access to the London market. Almost immediately after the outbreak of war, the London market was closed to the States, and an arrangement had to be made by the Commonwealth Government to raise the necessary loans in London, so that the Commonwealth could arrange such accommodation to the States as would enable them to carry on their loan works for the current year. When the Commonwealth went on the London market, the States had then access to the local market for loans beyond those which had been arranged for from the Commonwealth, and they had agreed not to raise loans in London while the Commonwealth was acting in Englandi n their behalf.

MrJ . H .

AgainI say that such a desire, expressed by the British Government at a time like arrangement was this, is tantamount to closing the London market against Australia, because AusI n some cases the tralia would never except as the very last extremity approach the London marketin the face of such an appeal. For all practical purposes, the London market in the way described is closed to Australia. The Commonwealth, with its huge commitments, both immediate and in prospect, is' compelled to raise large sums of loan money or credits. The London market being closed, an appeal is being made to the Australian market. The Commonwealth now comes into direct competition with the States.

A great deal of the trouble to which the honourable member for Cook has just referred-the continued loan expenditure of the various States and of ourselves-is due to a cardinal misapprehension as to the future loan position. after the war broke out, some of the Premiers showed very considerable apprehension; and I think the Premier of New South Wales showed a keener apprehension than any of the others.

Belgium will have to be rebuilt, industries will have to be restarted, machinery recreated, and the torn fragments of some of tlie greatest industrial nations of the world, so to speak, k n it together by the little remaining capital.

The Commonwealth election of 1910 was fought on the question of the wisdom of borrowing £3,500,000, which the Liberals proposed to do; and the party which came into power as the result of that election was a non-borrowing party, which stated that it would only borrow when the country was in peril, or facing some unforeseen disaster. members opposite ought to give credit to the people of Australia for the wisdom and foresight displayed on that occasion, by putting into power a party which would not allow fche National Government to enter on a borrowing policy. Borrowing is proposed now only under circumstances which compel it, and when the people of Australia are prepared to make extraordinary sacrifices in order to carry on the war. The people have placed the present party in power to carry on the war, and when for that purpose a Commonwealth loan has to be placed on the local money market, we are in a fortunate position in that we have not had to appeal to that market before, seeing that so far we have been able to obtain money from the Imperial Government. I am afraid that the loan that we propose to raise will not cover the expenditure, and we have also to see whether the State Governments will go on the Australian money market and offer higher rates of interest. However, I do not think that they will do so. I think that they will see the wisdom of acting conjointly with the Federal Government. ""When they arc driven to extremes they will find no better godfathers than the Federal Government. All the prognostications of our friends opposite-especiall y of the Leader of the Opposition-wil l be found to be wrong. I am quite satisfied that the States will appeal to the Labour Government which is in power in the Commonwealth, and that conjointly we shall be able to tide over difficulties such as have never occurred before in the history of Australia, and which I hope will not arise again. I hope that honourable members will take an optimistic view. In proportion to her population, Australia is the greatest producing country in the world.

Mr Knibbs informed me that our production was £230,000,000. gentleman's figures' are correct.

On tlie 1st JulyI offered some friendly suggestions to the Minister for the Navy, who was then Assistant Minister of Defence, as to the advisability of increasing the staff of the Central Administration to cope with the work of the Defence Department, or of re-allotting the work of the officers of the Department, so that delays such as those to which I drew attention might not recur. I instanced a case in which the money for a motor ambulance was sent from Sydney on the 8th or 9th February, and was not used by the Defence Department unti l the 30th March-that is, not until seven weeks had elapsed-and that information had come motor ambulances, shall I order at once? from the f r o n t that this ambulance was badly needed.

There are two ways in which we have been making use of money for ambuthat that happened to be Easter week. lances. First, by cabling money to England for an ambulance to be made there, and to be attached either to an Australian unit or to the British Army; secondly, to place the order in Australia, and attach the ambulance to a unit here. In the case mentioned by Mr Kelly communications passed in order to find out the views of the donor, and also with Tggard to the class of ambulance required. There wns no undue delay. By the courtesy of the Minister for .the Navy, I have obtained the papers in this case. The first of them, which is dated the 8th February, 1915, is a letter from Colonel Wallace, Commandant, to the Secretary of the Defence Department, and shows that the statement of the Minister was wholly incorrect, its concluding words beingThe donors have been suitably thanked, and they desire that this ambulance be made in England. From the file I find that, on the 12th March, some five weeks after the d r a f t was received in the central office, it was discovered that it was made payable to the New South Wales Commandant, and was returned to him f o i his endorsement, and to be paid iuto a Sydney account. On the 24th March, the Department was notified that the money had been paid in as in structed. I was given to understand by a letter which I received from the Department that, on the 30th March, the money was p u t into use, but I find from the file that on that date the Department of External Affairs was asked to send a cable to the High Commissioner stating that donations had been received for motor ambulances, of which a list was given, and the words "" letter following "" (vere added.

The reply made by the Prime Minister was as followsOnly one answer can be given to questions duties on the necessaries of life. like this.

Tn the Melbourne Age of 21st inst., under the heading of "" Price of Butter,"" there appeared the following statement: Because the Commonwealth Government On the 8th instant I asked the have refused to remove the Customs duty on butter, the New South Wales State Government, which is about to become an importer, decided in Cabinet to increase the price of butter by 3d., the amount of the duty A subsequent Executive meeting was held, fixing the price of butter at Is. lOd. per lb.

240,Mr W. Elliotjohnson,"If the postponement of the Tariff means that there.is to be collected a large amount of Customs revenue from the masses of tlie people in regard to foodstuffs, because of a temporary shortage on account of the war or seasonable conditions, I can only say that I regret very much that sanction is be in 5 given to the postponement of the consideration of the Tariff. I have' objected to this Parliament being closed until the great issues upon which we were elected are dealt with. In making that protest, and in putting forward this plea, I am sorry to say I have not received any support. But I have played my part, and if this Parliament adjourns without dealing with tliese matters, then I shall have no responsibility for it . I can only express the bread. than would have been necessary hope-and it is almost hoping against hope-that we shall have an early opportunity of considering the position of the people of Australia in regard to their supply of foodstuffs generally. It has been decided since the date on for such a stocktaking shall be made. The result has not yet been communicated to the House, and what policy is to follow upon it we cannot say. I trust, however, that these matters will be speedily dealt with, and that we shall be given an opportunity to deal with the issues raised with the best information that we have at our disposal, so that we shall be able to say that, having regard to the powers and opportunities we possess, the very best possible has been done for the people. I refer to one particular aspect of the question raised by the honourable member for Cook? In regard to butter, Victoria has undoubtedly experienced a worse season than New South Wales; yet there is not the same shortage in Victoria that there is in the other State. Why? Because the Government of New' South Wales, in its wisdom, thought f it to fix the price of butter at -a level which did not permit producers to put it upon the market. They could only produce and sell at a loss, and no persons are mad enough to do that. So that the condition of things complained of by the honourable member for Cook has been brought about by the foolish policy of Government interference. Practically the same thing has happened in Victoria regarding wheat. Mr J. H . CATTS God only knows what the people would have done had there not been Government interference 1 any knowledge at all, the Government foolishly interfered with the price of wheat, with the result that the persons who otherwise would have imported wheat to meet the Australian demand were afraid to import, lest Government action might land them in a large loss. The consequence was that there did appear to be a shortage of wheat in Australia; yet not t ill the price of wheat had advanced in all"" parts of the world did the Government import supplies, so that the community has had to pay considerably more for its had there been no Government interference. Mr J. H . CATTS -I s that the Liberal Government in Victoria? ring to the Liberal Government of VicwhichI submitted my motion toria, which in this regard has been just a national stocktaking that as mad as the Labour Government of New South Wales. farmer of imported wheat than to the local farmer. how foolish it is for a Government, which has neither body to be kicked nor soul to be damned, to act in matters it does not understand. ^Action taken with the object of reducing the cost of living has actually had tlie effect of increasing it . The price of bags also is important, if only in its bearing upon the price of wheat. A majority of the members of this House are opposed to the retention of the Tariff duty on bags; yet, in spite of that, we cannot get the duty removed. What is to be done? I certainly am of opinion that where a majority of members are in favour of the removal of a certain item in the Tariff, its removal ought to be assured; and in this respect, just as my honourable friend has put forward a plea for the consumer, I submit a plea on behalf of the producer, who must be handled tenderly if maximum production is to be secured and the best interests of the consumer served. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.35 p.m.",60,Labour Council Of New South Wales
