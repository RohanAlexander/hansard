0,"House Of Representatives* Took The Chair At 2.30 A.m., And Read Prayers. I Desire To Make A Short Statement On A Matter Of Urgent Public Importance. (Leave Granted.) As Honourable Members Are Aware, New South Wales Is At Present In A Desperate Plight By Reason Of The Drought There. This Morning I Received The Following Telegram And Letter From The Secretary .To The Producers' Associations' Central Council Of New South Wales, Which I Shall Read:","TelegramProducers AssociationsCentral Council, by deputation, has urged State Government secure supplies fodder for starving stock, reports show fodder available other States, but shipping unprocurable.

1,Mr Speaker (Hon. W. Elliot Johnson),,19,Wales
2,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper) [2.31],"tor Agriculture yesterday, and strongly urged that supplies of fodder should be secured from the other States for the purpose of feeding starving stock, as practically the whole of New South Wales is in a desperate position through the long-continued drought. The Minister was entirely sympathetic and the Government has already been endeavouring to secure supplies of fodder and to assist farmers and small graziers in their extreme need, but the chief difficulty has been found to be that of securing the necessary shipping space for fodder supplies from Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth. Reports show that shippers do not like carrying chaff and other fodder, as other cargo is more payable, and I am informed that only three steamers have lifted supplies from Adelaide this year, with the exception of one or two very small consignments, notwithstanding that large siipplies are in store at Port Adelaide, and cutters are anxious to operate if shipping space can be secured. Captain Dunn, the Minister for Agriculture, stated that he had several times communicated with the Pederal Government urging that some of the Commonwealth steamers should at once be made available for carriage of fodder, but that no reply has been received. I am informed that, from Geelong to Winchelsea, and from Geelong to Maroona, the stations are piled high with fodder awaiting transport. If this fodder could be made available in New South ""Wales, immediately, thousands of head of stock might be saved. I urge the Government to at once give eflect to the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Select Committee which is inquiring into the Sea Carriage of Goods, and which has suggested that the Government should make its own ships available to relieve the distress. shows that while stock is starving in New -South Wales and elsewhere, fodder stocks are congested in other States, because of tbe shortage of shipping. [2.33] I would like permission to make a statement supplementing that of the honourable member for Cowper. like to make a statement, too. unusual and irregular. I think that it has never happened before that a private member has risen at the beginning of a sitting and asked leave of the House to make a statement. make statements is usually granted by courtesy to Ministers when they desire to make important announcements concerning |some special matter of public policy or concern, but it is an innovation for a private member to request leave to make statements. However, such leave having been granted to one private member, I cannot do less than ask the House whether it will give the same privilege to another private member who asks for it. Still, I must point out that this procedure leaves it open to every private member to ask for leave, and, thus, the way would be open to set the rules of debate at naught. Of course, should any one member object, his single objection would be fatal. I ask the House if it is their pleasure that the honourable member for Hume have leave to make a statement? (Leave granted). the honourable member for Cowper rose, I was considering what course to take to bring this matter before the House. I have here facts and figures relating to it which I have been considering for some time, and when in Sydney, at the end of last week, I saw there the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture, and he put before me facts that I considered so serious that I intended to move the adjournment to-morrow to allow them to be discussed. I had to leave the matter over until to-morrow, because, to-day, I was engaged on the Public Works Committee. I am very pleased that the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) has called attention to the position, and am grateful to honourable members for having given me the opportunity to add to his Evidence remarks. I shall not abuse the privilege by speaking at any length. I wish to emphasize the fact that the position in New South Wales is desperate, but the State Minister for Agriculture tells me that if they could obtain the services of three Commonwealth steamers to carry fodder to New South Wales, the State would be saved. They have already purchased fodder, but it is lying in Western Australia and South Australia. Western Australia awaiting transport. stand that that is so. I am not exaggerating one iota when I say that I know perPermission to sonally of hundreds of families that will have to leave their holdings, and will be practically ruined, if the Commonwealth steamers cannot be obtained for the transporting of this produce.

8,Mr Parker Moloney,"I underof New South Wales are citizens of the Commonwealth, and I have a suggestion to make which goes a little further than the asking for the use of three Commonwealth steamers. I am interested in this matter, not only because I am the representative of a New South Wales constituency, but also because I am a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, and know that the whole Commonwealth will suffer if thousands of families in New South Wales are ruined. I submit my suggestion for what it is worth, and I sinfodder to New South Wales; and could cerely hope that the Prime Minister will, under the circumstances, give it sympathetic consideration. Wales Government is endeavouring to raise a loan of £2,000,000. only is to be spent in the country and £1,000,000 in the city. posal is to spend £1,000,000 in the country on relieving the farmers, and £1,000,000 on the construction of silos, so the whole of it is for the country. If , in addition to lending the necessary vessels, the Commonwealth Government could see its way to give some financial assistance to New South Wales, here is the opportunity. It could assist the State by subscribing to this loan, and-by so doing give an impetus to private subscription. If the Commonwealth Government invested £100,000 in the loan, it would draw the attention of the people of New South Wales, and the whole of Australia, to the fact that the whole Commonwealth, and not merely New South Wales, is concerned in the present position of affairs, and that that position is very serious. Those who are able to subscribe to the loan would probably do so if they knew that the Commonwealth Government was investing in it, and that would make-the loan a success. I should have liked the Acting Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) to be here; but, as the subject is of tbe utmost importance, I take the earliest opportunity to call attention to it. I know of places in New South Wales which show the desperate straits to which people are being put, inasmuch as they are collecting manure, putting it through a sieve, and making it fit for feeding starving stock. Long ago they have cut their trees down, and in some places the ground is as bare as the floor of this chamber-veritabl e dust heaps, with not a vestige of vegetation. From all over New South Wales,-1 get a bundle of letters every day describing the state of affairs, and the conditions are so heart breaking that I cannot find words to describe them. I do not wish to abuse the privilege extended to me by making a long statement, but things are so serious that something must be done at once. If three ships could be provided straight way,there would be means of bringing financial assistance be given to the sufferers who are losing their stock in thouThe New South sands, much good would be done, and the Commonwealth should not shirk this duty, ister and Attorney-General) [2.43] -(B y leave) I wish that the honourable member who has raised this question had given me some notice. A matter that Concerns the welfare and even the life and death of so many persons if we are to believe the honourable member, and I do believe him-is surely one that calls for notice to the responsible Minister, or other mouthpiece of the Government, in order that he may inform his mind and come down to the House with all the facts at his disposal. This lack of notice has been observable once or twice; honourable members have moved the formal adjournment of the House, and have not even thought fit to give the Minister concerned notice of their intention. Government Whip. notice, I can only speak generally, and on the spur of the moment. Yesterday, I think, and on one day last week, this matter was raised by honourable members, not in relation to fodder, but in relation to coal; and I then said that I would do whatever was possible to make Commonwealth vessels . available. I said then that I believed-and I believe now-that four Commonwealth vessels are engaged in work that may be called coastal work. I also said, what is very obvious, that the Commonwealth vessels are scattered all over the waters that surround the earth. Those vessels have their engagements when they come to these shores; and, therefore, it is not by merely waving one's hand that one makes",20,Wales

I did not need ,-what the honourable member for Hume .{ Mr Parker Moloney) has said to make ime appreciate to the f u ll the lamentable state in which a great deal of this Commonwealth finds itself, particularly in the States of Queensland and New South Wales. It is the .duty of the Common. wealth to do all things within its power to come to the assistance of .those who, unless they are assisted by us, or unless nature sends rain, -are utterly undone; indeed, rain would not save them now, and we must have fodder. However, I can say by way of direct reply, that I shall see Mr Eva as soon as I am able to do so this afternoon. I shall .ascertain what vessels of our fleet in Australian waters are available, whether they are laden with inward or outward cargo. Of course, those laden with outward cargo are not available-vessel s outside o.ur own waters are not available-bu t we shall see what are. I give the House the assuranoe that I .shall not .allow ordinary obstacles to .stand in the road of making vessels available for the purpose. Just one word about the suggestion of the honourable member for Hume that we should contribute to the loan which is. being raised in the State of New South 'Wales. That is a matter of quite a different kind; and I can only say that, while the Government will give it every -consideration at the earliest possible moment, I must not, by any word of mine, 'be held to commit the Government in that direction. . <on) I think it only right to say, at this juncture, that I hope this is the last time we shall have such a procedure as this adopted in the House. The course taken is contrary altogether to our own established procedure, and contrary to all my reading of the practice of Parliament. I , therefore, do not propose to take it as a precedent for the .adoption of a similar course in the future; and honourable members, no doubt, see tbe Teason. While it is usual to accord the Prime Minister, or a Minister in charge of some important matter, the opportunity to make a statement, by leave of the House, as a courteous concession, I hav.e never, so far as -my memory serves, in this or any other Parliament, known the courtesy to be sought by, or. granted to., any private member, except, perhaps, the Leader of the Opposition, who., on some occasions, has asked, and been granted, leave of the .House to make a statement in reply to one already made. Mr .MAHWT -This matter is urgent. The result of the procedure that has been adopted to-day is to involve the House in an irregular debate, with no question before the Chair. Any extremely urgent matter may be dealt with on a motion for the formal adjournment of the House; and then, of course, there is a question before the Chair. The matter that has now been brought under notice could have been raised and debated on the very first Order of the Day, namely, Supply. I only call the attention ,of the House to this breach of our ordinary procedure, and on the House the responsibility rests: I express the hope thai such a course will not be resorted to on any other occasion. . .

18,Mr Poynton,"The honorableundertake to do all that is possible to have the matter attended to. tion in connection with the coal difficulty, not only in the interests of this State, but of others as well. What is the exact position of the Coal Board to-day? Willi t be possible for householders in this State, at any rate, to secure household coal this winter ? honourable member had let me know that it was his intention to ask this question, for this reason: while he is clamouringand rightly so-for more coal for householders, other people are clamouring for coal for essential industries. I -can only repeat what I have said so often before, namely, that the coal is not here. If any honourable member can suggest or deVise means of getting more coal to go round, it will be a much more practical procedure for them to furnish the Government with their propositions rather than be asking all the time which section of. the community is to get the little coal that is available. Honourable members see every day what is taking place in other States. Tasmania wants coal. The Premier of that State has even gone the length of suggesting what we ought to do to give Tasmania coal; and the same kind of thing has occurred in South Australia. I am now proposing to let the State authorities carry out their own ideas to see if they can do any better than we have been able to do. get over the trouble. Become Socialists, and have your own fleet of steamers travelling around the coasts, just as you have your own trains running around them. wind blows in from the west, we have to wait until it passes over. However, now that the sirocco has subsided, I wish to say that I desire most heartily to answer favourably all the questions put to me in this direction. We are doing the best we can. We have to solve the question of giving people a full ton of coal when there is only half a ton at our disposal. That states the case in a nutshell. The problem is to get more coal. I do not think it helps matters to do what some of our journals are doing this morning, namely, to abuse men who have given their whole time and talents to this problem without fee or reward, and who have toiled with a devotion which I have raTely seen equalled. All they get is the abuse of some of the press. of the press. agree; they do take notice. That is why I speak as I do. The conduct of this section of the press transgresses every rule of fairness, and I hope it will stop. I may say, in conclusion, that I hope soon to confer with the State Premiers in the hope that we may solve the coal problem and arrange something mutually satisfactory.

Have any arrangements been made with the Commonwealth Treasury in the matter of this loan being exempt from Federal income taxation? ing of the matter except what I bave seen in the press. Certainly, no arrangements have been made with the Commonwealth Government. Indeed, no arrangement of the kind indicated is possible. The New South Wales Government has acted entirely on its own initiative, and what steps it proposes to take to relieve subscribers from Federal income tax I do not pretend to know. I take it that it is going to pay the Federal income tax for its subscribers. At any rate, I know nothing to the contrary. Prime Minister come to any decision regarding the moratorium ?

What reasonable economies are possible in connection with the printing of such books? ' 7. Have any reports been made by departmental telephone managers in any States in connection with the economies for printing sucb books? 8. Will the Department have printed, for the information of members, any reports on the savings there effected? orable member's questions are as f o l low : 1 and 2. Mr (now Sir Eobert) Anderson's report was made in July, 1915. I became Postmaster-General in February, 1020, so that the duty of dealing with that report did not de-"" volve upon me, and conditions have entirely changed in the meanwhile. The recommendation in the report dealt with the wiping out of a deficit of £501,456, which it was proposed to meet by decreasing staff in the first year to the extent of f120,000, and increasing rates, &c, to the extent of £384,000. From a perusal of the departmental balance-sheets for the past two years, it will be seen that that deficit has been converted by the Department into a surplus of £387,381 for 1917-1918, and £524,644 for 1918-1919, notwithstanding an increase of over £1,000,000 in salaries under awards of the Arbitration Court during the period 19151919. Viewing the above figures, and taking into account the increase of 38 per cent, in the revenue, and the large increase in the business, of the Department, it will be apparent that Sir Eobert Anderson must have based his suggestion for a permanent reduction of the staff on erroneous information. So far bulk of their estimated savings appears to me to be arrived at on what I regard as a wrong basis. However, their principal recommendation is that the Department be managed by a Commission, and obviously action by the Government on that question must precede any steps in regard to matters of detail. 3. Inquiries are being made. 4. No revenue is received from advertisements, as advertisements are not printed in the telephone lists, excepting for repatriation purposes. 5. The question of advertising in the telephone list has been considered from time to time by the Department, and tenders were invited for the rights to advertise in the publication referred to; but the offers received were so unremunerative that it was decided not to proceed with the matter. 0.

70,Mr Brennan (Batman) [3.18],"lodged in certain cases against the payment of the gratuity to the soldiers, in order to secure the rights of the dependants. The Act makes provision to enable 'the prescribed authority to withhold in certain cases the gratuity from the persons directly concerned in the interests of the dependants. Recently, the public were warned in the press that it was idle to lodge caveats for other purposes than those relating to dependants. When the parent measure was under consideration, I had thought of. bringing under the notice of the Prime Minister certain cases, which the great bulk of the returned soldiers would be only too ready to recognise. I refer to some soldiers who have, in a very discreditable way, broken faith with other persons-in many cases, indigent female relatives of returned soldiers. One case I have particularly in mind is that of a mother whose son was killed at the Front, and who has been absolutely defrauded by a returned soldier. He affected to purchase a business from her, and paid a small portion of the amount due. He then resold the business, pocketed the entire proceeds, and eleared out, leaving the wronged woman with only a small proportion of the money that was due to her. When reading the original BillI was impressed with the view that apparently the prescribed authority would be qualified to consider cases of that kind, rights. If a man has been defrauded by and to decide not to pay over the gratuity to any man who obviously, to say the least, had a very low standard of morals. After reading the statement in the press, however, I have come to the conclusion that the prescribed authority is not going to exercise any discretion of that kind, -but will pay over the money to the soldier himself, except in those cases in which it is expressly empowered to hold back the gratuity in the interests of the dependants. that the prescribed authority would, before acting, require some evidence by the aggrieved person, but I should be very brought some hard cases under notice, surprised to learn that that body would and I am pleased to know that that will not exercise its authority in proper cases. be its effect. Clearly, it has discretionary power. the Prime Minister say that. I read the Bill carefully, and I was glad to observe that it contained safeguards which pre( Mr Atkinson) -I s it the pleasure of vented the soldier from having a legal right to the gratuity. The gratuity is not payable to the next of kin, nor is the prescribed authority bound by the terms of a soldier's will. All those provisions, 1 take it, were inserted to enable the prescribed authority to see that substantial justice was done in the distribution of gratuities. I hope that the prescribed authority will realize the obligation upon it to see that no person who has been guilty of clearly dishonest practices shall get from the Government money which, on moral and every other ground, belongs to some one else. understood the position, the prescribed authority was to have power in certain cases to withhold the payment of the gratuity from a soldier, and give it to a wife whom he had deserted, or to some one dependent on him whom it was his duty to supnort, and whom he was not supporting. I am surprised at the suggestion that the prescribed authority shall determine the rights of different persons in the payment of gratuity moneys. I quite agree that a person whom the soldier is morally bound to support, and whom he has not supported, should under parliamentary sanction receive the gratuity; 'but. I am not prepared to place the soldier in a different position from other members of the community in regard to ordinary civil another who has money in a bank, he cannot make good his rights without invoking the assistance of the law, and any -person having claims on a soldier should assert them through the proper channels. The suggestion that the prescribed authority should settle such matters is one of the most dangerous that I have heard.

The Government should now be prepared to go further in this matter, and to' intimate to the Imperial authorities that it will not sit down quietly and allow this young Australian soldier and inventor to be robbed of the fruits of his labour. He rendered good service both in the firing line and as an inventor of war-like weapons. No t only did he fight in the trenches, but he gave to Great Britain and the Allies a weapon which effectively smashed the Hindenburg line. I strongly appeal now for justice in his behalf. Priday week I moved the adiournment of this House to discuss the urgent matter of the continuation of the Wheat Pool. On that occasion I made a statement which has since been replied to by the Prime Minister through the medium of the press. I thought Mr Hughes would have taken the opportunity to make a statement in this chamber, and that he would have given to honourable members direct some indication of the intentions of the Government respecting the continuation or otherwise of the Wheat Pool. however, that the Prime Minister's statement was made to the press and not to this House, and seeing, further, that I have learned that many who read the Prime Minister's remarks appear to have understood that they were made here, I desire to correct that false impression. I wish now to reply to the various statements of the Prime Minister on that occasion. He availed himself of the privi lege of going right through the various minutes of the Australian Wheat Board, and of quoting from them rather freely. I propose, also, to quote' from those minutes. Pirst, I draw attention to the cable message of the Prime Minister in connection with the first sale of 500,000 tons. A t the meeting of the Wheat Board, held on 30th June, and extending to 2nd July, 1919, Mr Pitt, the manager, read the following telegram from the Prime Minister: I have been continuously pressing on with negotiations for sale of wheat. With improved shipping facilities our chances are improving. As you know, we have recently sold considerable quantities to Europe, including some 100,000 tons to Greece, at very good prices. Italy wants to buy, but asks for credit. I am consulting Campion, and have had .him over Paris to advise me on this. It asked the Prime Minister some is possible we may be able to dispose of considerable quantities Italy if we can arrange financial terms satisfactory to us as well as to them. The price will be quite all right. Britain: I am seeing the Royal Commission this morning. It may be possible to sell 500,000 tons. What is lowest price the Board is prepared to accept? Snch a sale would help us financially in London just now. Eeply urgent. To that, MrP it t replied as follows: Your telegram 24th June. Bussell is calling with all haste meeting Australian Wheat Board. Expect to be able cable you Monday what you require. There was no mistake in the minds of the members of the Wheat Board, and that fact is manifested by the following discussion, which occurred at the meeting of (Echuca) [3.53] -Last the Board on 30th June:Senator Bussell (Chairman) -Now, what about this 500,000 to Britain? The usual practice has 'been for us to state the minimum on which Mr Hughes may conduct negotiations, but I do not know of a case in which he has not succeeded in getting a bit more. It is necessary to give a definite expression in that regard. This definitely establishes that Mr Hughes only sought authority to sell the 500,000 tons. In the matter of price, the Board fixed a minimum, on the understanding, of course, that the Prime Minister would Seeing, endeavour to secure a better figure. I might say at this stage that Mr Hughes' reply to my statements when I moved the adjournment of this House is very in genious. By his quotations from the minutes of the Board he has naturally made his case look as good as possible. I might say that I am now about to endeavour to do the same. members infers, then, that his case is going to be ingenious, too 1 able member will be more honest than the Prime Minister. honourable member has any righ t to say that. to stick to the minutes.

The quotations which I .am now making reveal that Mr Baxteri t also They dispose :of Mr Hughes' statement that this point had not been brought before .the Wheat Board, and that the subject had not been criticised.

Meanwhile, Mr Hughes had sold the 500,000 tons, and, without authority, another 500,0.00 tons. Moreover, he had given Commenting upon the matter an option over a third parcel .of 50.0,000 tons, .at 5s. 6d. per bushel. Not only had he done that, but he had given the option without requiring payment of any portion of the total price. I said .then that this was bad business, and I 'say it to-day ; and so it was..

A t the request of the W h e a t B o a r d a Conference of State Premiers and M in is t e r s was h e l d on 9 t h and 10th J a n u a r y , 1920, in order t h a t t h e Statesm i g h t f u r n is h estimates of t h e i r requirements of w h e a t supplies u n t i l t h e new crop, 1920-21, should have come in a t the end of t h e year. t h e local position t h e B o a r d w h i c h , by tbe w a y , is the selling m e d i u m on behalf of the A u s t r a l i a n wheat f a r m e r h a d been w it h h o l d in g sales. I emphasize t b a t . acc o r d i ng to our c o n s t it u t i o n , t h e B o a r d Drummond. He represents the buyers and had been called in to being to sell wheat. H o w e v e r , h a v in g regard to A u s t r a l i a ' s h o m e requirements we h a d w it h h e l d w h e at from sale w h e n it could have been disposed of a t v e r v p r of it a b l e prices. A t a meeting of t h e W h e a t B o a r d the f o l l o w in g resolution was c a r r i e d : That the Australian Wheat Board hold sufficient stocks to meet Commonwealth requirements for local consumption, each State to declare forthwith its proportion of such requirements, and to undertake to purchase same under the scheme method of payment from time to time in force. The n arose t h e question of local price. The Conference could not f i x t h e price. It s members were t h e r e as buyers, w h i l e t h e m a t t e r of selling was in t h e hands of t h e W h e a t B o a r d . I shall quote from t h e r e p o r t of t h e discussion w h i c h to o k place a t t h e Conference: Mr Ashford (New South Wales) -It was discussed and agreed upon that, subject to the approval of the Governments in each State, 6s. 6d. should be the price. minutes seem to sustain your point. would not support anything over 6s. 6d. per bushel, and that, on the other hand, Mr McGibbon w ill want something higher. That w ill equalize it . We might as well finalize it to-day. Mr Hughes.^I wonld like to hear MrH ill . at 6s. 6d. When 6s. 6d. was fixed at the last meeting, there was no understanding that it was to cover a period of six, nine, or twelve months. Mr Oman (Victoria) -We really tried for 7s. for home consumption. would come here to-day to buy, and the Board; would fix the price. meeting, the farmers' 'representatives held a meeting and decided to ask for 7s. per bushel. Eventually they gave way, and agreed to 6s. 6d. at the meeting of the Board. agree that it would be permanent for a year. MrO m a n then moved the f o l l o w in g m o t i o n :That the price for local consumption be 6s.. 6d. per bushel, with a carrying charge of l d . per bushel per month to cover interest,, carrying, &c. I said, a f t e r a l e n g t h y discussionAccording to a document placed before the Board at tlie last meeting, it was stated that On account of the existing price for overseas wheat was 8s. per bushel; now we propose to sell it at (is. 6d. Mr Giles and I would probably support a motion at 7s., plus the carrying charge mentioned by Mr Oman. Anything below that we w ill oppose. I can sympathize with Mr. sellers. Mr Giles and I are otherwise. We represent the farmers. I have been in. communication with growers a ll over the State, and there wonld be trouble if the price was fixed below 7s. Thereupon I m o v e d That the price of wheat for local consumption be 7s. per bushel, plus a carrying charge of l d . per bushel per month. L a t e r on , MrO m a n s a i d I think the 6s. 6d., plus l d . per bushel per' month carrying charge, gives the farmer a good return, and one which could not be exceeded if we took the world's parity into consideration. I do not agree that, if there is only enough wheat in a. State to serve the State's requirements or only a small surplus, the people should be compelled to take the world's parity always. The cost of production shonld be taken into consideration. . . . There would have been no difficulty if we had not increased the price at the last meeting from 5s. 6d. to 6s. 6d. Having established 6s. 6d. you would like to give as much as possible to the farmers. All the sales are pooled. It matters not'which State supplies the wheat to New South Wales or Queensland. I would urge a fixed rate, and not one which is going to bit the consumer every, time. I am as keen as any man to act as fair as possible.

In New South ""Wales, Queensland, and Tasmania we are at your mercy. There is no denying it. I claim that the farmers, as a whole, are men prepared to do a fair thing, and I think Mr Oman's suggestion, worked out in' detail, is a fair thing. I consider the whole of the farmers of Australia would be satisfied that they were getting a fair deal. wheat at 6s. 6d. per bushel, I will not be a party to it. I say it is an unreasonable thing to expect, more especially when one considers the conditions under which the wheat waa grown this year. I venture to say the farmers need eveTy penny of it, and the fact that so many farmers have applied for seed wheat advances shows the necessitous conditions of the farmers of the State.

Senator BussellI do not care what it is as long as you make it clear. of 6d. per bushel between the two. There seems to be some difference of opinion as to whether ld. per bushel per month is a sumcient or an exorbitant charge. If you are not going to take the world's parity, you had better fix it for the whole year. As far as I am concerned, I am prepared to split the difference, and make it a flat rate of 7s. 3d. per bushel, and would be prepared to move that. and all charges to come out of that. a high price if we held the wheat. However, as a compromise, we are prepared to give them tlie benefit of the doubt. Tlie price of 7s. 3d. was decided upon by the Australian Wheat Board. be seen that I contended in the first place for 7s. 6d., and stood practically alone, and that I had to agree to 7s. 3d. as a matter of compromise. On a Board of this hind one could not have his own way. resumed, I saidWe have had four of the best years in the history of Australia in regard to wheat-growing, but, notwithstanding that fact, the area sown to wheat is decreasing every year. That would seem to'indicate that the farmers are not doing well out of wheat-growing. We have been' selling wheat at under the cost of production for some time. Now we have a chance of getting somewhere near a fair thing. We are not asking for Ss. 6d. or 10s. We are not arbitrary at 7s. 3d., and will keep the wheat for the whole of the consumers of the ComMr Hill. Budget [REPRESENTATIVES.! (1919-20). monwealth for twelve months. That is a fair price, and much lower than wheat can be had at anywhere to-day. If consumers are entitled to grumble, it is at the profits made by the millers and the bakers. The Prime Minister saidI am not going to argue the point. I agree with Mr Drummond when he says, "" We would be getting into deep water if we go beyond 6s. 6d."" After a lengthy discussion, in which the Prime Minister suggested that he should obtain an option over 10,000,000 bushels of British Government wheat stored here, to which Mr Oman and I objected on the ground that it would depress the local market and create a very bad impression in the minds of the, farmers, seeing that the price would show a big profit to the Imperial Government and a corresponding loss to the Pool brought about by this unauthorized sale, the following discussion took placeis that we should postpone it if you are not in to any increase in the price of bread until we have exhausted every means of preventing it . There is a way of preventing it. We have tried that. Government will take all wheat for seed at 7s. 6d. per bushel. wheat. stacks fit for seed.

There may be a reason why it should go up to 7s. or 7s. 3d. in New South Wales. I am quite sure you do not realize what an outcry there It will would be if we put the price of wheat up to 7s. 3d. It would have been better if you had put it up to the 7s3d. at the last meeting. within the last two months at high rates with a view of holding it for local consumption.

It put us in a very good position for a good clean up. In my opinion, if you get back 10,000,000 -bushels of British wheat, you will reduce our chance of obtaining a good clean up, and we would not be able to get the good price we are now getting from Japan for inferior wheat.

Expectation of drawing alternative supply from South Russia entirely dispelled, whilst Indian export still doubtful. Tonnage already allotted to load very large part of wheat still remaining to be shipped from Australia, and further tonnage arranged load balance as quickly as possible. In these circumstances, and as United Kingdom by far largest customer for Australian wheat, Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies regret unable to agree to forego any of their wheat supplies already purchased in Australia, and feel that they are justified in asking that orders to be completed other outside markets should be temporarily sacrificed by Australia rather than United Kingdom; case would be different if there were an actual shortage wheat Australia for local requirements, but not gathered from your telegram that such shortage likely to exist, if necessary action taken by Commonwealth to guard against undue export other destinations. H a v in g considered thi s cable, the w o r l d ' s wheat p o s it i o n , and prices, the members of the A u s t r a l i a n W h e a t B o a r d h a d decided t h a t the price should be increased to 7s. 9d. per bushel. A t the Conference of the 2 9 t h J a n u a r y , MrO m a n saidThe cable has given us the information we want, and I take it, it w ill be for the members of the Board to determine the price at which they are prepared to sell the wheat they hold on behalf of the people. I felt last week that we were offering the wheat at a cut rate. You took a different view and cabled to London. The reply confirms the view we held, viz., that there was a strong market. I w ill not be a party to selling on a low parity. We are selling to-day at 8s. 10id., and, personally, I am of the opinion that the price should now be somewhere in the vicinity of 8s. However, there is a slight concession on that. I am not prepared to give under 7s. 9d. per bushel. Your cables, fortunately for the producers, strengthen me. I take it , it w ill be for this Conference to determine the price, and I say that if the whole of the States are prepared to buy at a fixed rate, you should not withhold your consent. We have information now that there is no wheat No cable was received in available from Argentine, India, or Russia. If they cannot look for wheat there, how can our customers look for wheat there? The reW h e n the Consult is that we can write our own ticket. We see oats selling for 6s. 6d. per bushel of 40 lbs. We are entitled to put wheat on a parity with other grains. An equitable thing has to be done. I am quite convinced the price should not be less than 7s. 9d. per bushel, and I am not prepared to take less. Inferior wheat can be sold to-day for 8s. 10id. per bushel. Mr Hughest h e n saidThat is a matter you' must please yourself about. The only thing I want to point out is that the question in dispute is not the sale of wheat oversea. You can get whatever price you can. If you can get 200s. per bushel, so much the better. The point is, at what price are you Australian farmers going to sell the wheat to your own people? As for the Japanese, charge as much as you like. Mr Hughes argued t h a t t h e c o n s t it u t i o n of t h e A u s t r a l i a n W h e a t B o a r d obliged it to get L o n d o n p a r it y . Members of t h e B o a r d disagreed, a r g u in g t h a t the B o a r d should sell t h e whea t elsewhere, and a t much higher prices. However, the B o a r d had n o desire to oversell a t these h i g h prices, and thus leave our own people short. But it d i d insist u p o n gett in g w h a t it considered to be something l i k e a reasonably f a i r price, a l t h o u g h thab price was not nearly as h i g h as could have been obtained for overseas ship.ment. Mr Hughes refused to entertain the price of 7s. 9d. fixed by the Board, but postponed the meeting, and meanwhile cabled to London with a view to finding, if possible, London parity. The TEMPORARY ( Mr Atkinson) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. member desires to speak at this stage, I shall take my second half hour now. The Australian Wheat Board assembled on 29th January. Sir point of order. Is the honourable member in order in reading his speech? The TEMPORARYCHAIRMAN understand that the honourable member is merely reading extracts from some report or document. but so that there can be no dispute, and in order to reach finality, I am quoting as nearly as possible from the minutes of the Australian Wheat Board, from which the Prime Miuister also quoted, and which cannot be said to be wrong. I may add that I have also taken the precaution to advise all the gentlemen whose names I am using that it was my intention to do so. Sir Board a public body? Minister may call it , b u t I .presume that what the Prime Minister can read I can read. that, but I doubt whether this procedure is wise on the part of either the honourable member or the Prime Minister. quoted from the minutes of the Australian Wheat Board, I have no option but to do the same. I might make a statement, and then the Prime Minister might pick out certain minutes which would make my case appear absurd. The statement issued .to the press by the Prime Minister is one of the most ingenious I have ever read. I doubt whether the honourable gentleman saw the statement before it was issued to the press; I am inclined to think that two otber .gentlemen drew it up, and made it public. W it h the multiplicity of duties he has to perform, it is almost impossible for the Prime Minister to go into all these matters. I have already said that the Prime Minister cabled to London with a view to ascertaining, if possible, the London parity. I heard Senator Russell say, at a meeting of the Chamber of Agriculture at Bendigo, that there was no such thing as London parity. But when it suited the Prime Minister he tried to establish Board was of opinion that at that time it would be difficult ' to establish. If no other honourable Evidently he did establish it to his own satisfaction. The Australian Wheat Board re-assembled on 29th January, when neither the Prime Minister nor Senator Russell was present, both being fair to say that the meeting was hurriedly convened because the delegates from the I various States, who had been in Melbourne from the 9th to the 29th January, were in a hurry to return to their homes. They decided to take the matter into I could tell my own tale, their own hand's, to buy the wheat, and fix the price, regardless of whether or not the Prime Minister consented. A t that meeting Mr Oman saidI have been trying to find out what the London parity is. I have ascertained certain values in other countries. Further, to these quotations in London you have to add £,50,000,000, and divide it by 240,000,000 bushels of wheat, which is 4s. 2d. above the quotation in London. I have ascertained that the present price of wheat in the following Pacific Coast, 9s. 5d., plus 23 per cent, exI do not know what the change. Argentine, 9s., f.o.b., plus 13 per cent, exchange. Chicago, 9s. Cd., rail. Atlantic Coast, 10s., f.o.b., plus 23 per cent, exchange. India, 8s. 6d. The quantities of wheat that can be absorbed As the Prime Minister without, going to Britain areBushels. South Africa .. . . 6,000,000 East 7,500,000 Egypt 5,000,000 18,500,000 The person from whom I ascertained the figures states that he is satisfied that the 18,500,000 bushels is worth 10s. per bushel here, f.o.b. The exchange rate would be practically 2s. 6d. Taking those prices, plus the £30,000,000 and exchange, their wheat is costing 13s. per bushel. Deduct from that 4s., leaves it at 9s., true value. I think we have reached a stage when we will have to make up our minds whether we are going to submit to the Prime' Minister deciding for the Wheat Board. I am satisfied the Victorian Government will not accept that position.",35,Budget And Estimates

123,Mr Hill,"Mr Colebatch saidThe constitution the Prime Minister quoted from makes the Australian Wheat Board the exclusive authority for fixing this price. You cannot go behind that. If the Australian Wheat Board fixes the price, it is not possible for the Prime Minister to go behind tliat. We suggested a price of 7s. 3d. in the first place, and be refused to agree. After a fortnight, the course of events made us submit 7s. 9d., and he refused to agree to that. In regard to the course adopted of consulting the British Government, that was not unanimously approved of by the Wheat Conference, but we had to take it. You have all had more experience on the Wlieat Board than I have, but I consider the proper course for us now to take is to fix the price, and communicate our decision to the Prime Minister, and leave it at that. I then saidI think we would be perfectly in order in carrying a resolution now re-afflrining our decision -that the price for local consumption be 7s. Od'. per bushel, and pass it onto the' Prime Minister, and throwthe responsibility on him. A f t e r further discussion, I saidI f you come in, and make it a unanimous vote, I am prepared to agree to the foregoing oi the Id.. Mr Ashford said-rI am prepared to say publicly that no doubt to-day, taking the wheat there is, it is really below the price wheat eould be sold outside The price was finally fixed by the Australian Wheat Board at 7s. 8d. per bushel, and the decision conveyed to the Prime Minister, who, at that stage, was unable to be present, owing to a Cabinet meeting. ment of the price, it was agreed by the BoardThat the price of 7s. 8d. per bushel, as agreed upon, should operate not later than 1st February. We felt so uncertain as to whether the Prime Minister would acquiesce in the decision we had made that we resolved that in the event of the right honourable gentleman not making .the announcement by noon on the 31st January, Mr Oman was to do so in behalf of the Board. However, the following statement by the Prime Minister appeared in the press on 31st January: After several conferences of the Ministers representing the various State Governments, and the representatives of the growers, it has been decided to increase the price of wheat for local consumption from 6s. 6d. to 7s. 8d., this rate to operate forthwith, and for the remainder of the current season-that is to say, until the end of the year. The avid demand throughout the world for wheat, in view of the leanness of the present year's crop, has created a very difficult position in Australia. Tliere remains within Australia only sufficient unsold wheat for twelve months' supply, after providing for normal exports of flour. It is recognised that it would be most unwise tooversell wheat and run the risk of subsequently having to import an inferior quality of wheat at much higher prices. As is well known, the New South Wales harvest was almost a failure, and that State will have to purchase from the other States an amount of not less than 12,000,000 bushels. The difficulty of the position which confronted the conference wa""s accentuated by inquiries that have been made by various countries to purchase wheat at substantially higher prices than have ruled recently. After considering all those factors, 7s. 8d. was fixed upon to meet the altered conditions. In compliance with the policy set before the people of Australia at the recent elections of paying to the farmers the local equivalent of the Londonparity on all export surplus, it was felt that large quantities of wheat should not be held with storage and interest, charges accumulating, while refusing such tempting offers. To any one who had inside knowledge of what had happened, at the meetings of. the Board, the last paragraph in the Prime Minister's announcement was laughable in the extreme. In bringing this matter before the House so often, I have no desire to be vindictive towards the Prime Minister. I am quite prepared to concede to h i m any credit that is his due, bnt on behalf of the wheat-growers of Australia. I have tried for some months to get a pronouncement from the Prime Minister as to what he proposes to do in regard to the continuation of the PoolI n regard to the announcefor this year. That was my object in moving the adjournment of the House last week. The Prime Minister said to> members -of the Board, when they met him in conference, that, owing to the harsh criticism which had been levelled* at the Pool, he would not decide immediately one way or the other. Very much of the criticism which has been levelled at the administration of the Pool has been justified. I have never levelled criticism at the Pool itself, and have always given credit to those who conceived the idea of it , because it was a first-class conception. But on many occasions the administration of it has been bad, and the Prime Minister has been one of the offenders. Criticism has been levelled not wholly and solely at the Prime Minister, but at all and sundry who have been'responsible for this bad administration. I do not know whether the right honourable gentleman intends to persist in his silence. I have tried by every means in my power to obtain a statement from him. faced with a guarantee of 5s. per bushel and abnormal shipping conditions. the Pools are to be wound up, the employees of the State Wheat Commissions and of the Australian Wheat Board should be informed, so that they may have an opportunity to look for other billets. Then, again, we do not want to p u t on the market at the last moment the huge quantities of iron, timber, hessian, and other dunnage of which it will be necessary to dispose if the Pool is not to be continued. We should know at the earliest moment what is to be done, so that the interests of the growers may be safe1 guarded. The Prime Minister stated at Bendigo that his wish was to help the producers, b u t he is the only man who is preventing the continuation of the Pool for another year. We do not ask for a compulsory Poolf o r all time. What we wish for is tbe continuation of the Pool, under existing conditions, for this year only, and I think that we have a right to ask for that. answer. righ t to abuse to your heart's content the man wbo has done everything you want. A Minister is not a doormat. I am getting some of this kind of criticism in regard to the coal distribution. ter looks for it pretty often. subject. I was told that I would get "" slops "" when the Prime Minister dealt with me, but I am here to do my duty, and to speak the truth so far as I can, and I am not to be deterred by his threats or frowns. I understand that the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Poster) is to present to the right honourable gentleman a petition against the continuation! of the Pool which comes from the farmers of Crystal brook, South Australia. I have here a telegram, dated 18th March, and signed by L . O'Loughlin, which saysLargely attended meeting of farmers at Crj'stal brook, in centre wheat-growing areas, last night carried resolutions, with only two against, as follows :That the Wheat Pool be continued, and guarantee of Commonwealth Government of 5s. bushel for wheat of 1920-21 harvest be accepted, as owing to disorganized state of world's markets and evident shipping combines only ImWe are perial Government, through influence of Commonwealth Government, can be relied on to make satisfactory sales of wheat and freight If arrangements for export of same. That before there is any reversion to private trading, a referendum of wheat-growers be taken, as we consider no change from present method should be made without their approval. I understand from the Victorian Ministerf o r Agriculture that the Victorian Government is favorable to the continuation of the Poolf o r another year, and the Australian Wheat Board, after discussing the subject on the 11th, 12th, and 13th February, carried the following resolution :That in view of the uncertainty of the shipping position and the guarantee of an advance of 5s. per bushel at railway stations, this Board recommends to the Commonwealth and State Governments that an immediate announcement should be made that the Pool witli its machinery will be continued for the receival and disposal of the 1920-21 harvest. Surely, when men who thoroughly understand the wheat position, including the Ministers who represent on the Wheat Board the wheat-growing States, see the need for continuing the Poolf or another twelve months, the Prime Minister should treat our request courteously, and if he does not intend to continue the Pool, should say so, in order that other arrangements may be made.

142,Mr Gregory,"We ought to be toldthat I think-indeed , I am almost certain -the Tariff w ill he amongst the first business when we meet again that statement. ticularly to speak in regard to taxation.. We know that further taxation will be necessary; but the incidence of taxation is -decidedly and grossly unfair. When we heard the statements made to-day in regard to the drought in New South Wales and Queensland, we realized how disastrous the conditions of Australia are at the present time. Those men who, probably, are being ruined in their endeavours to find fodder may be receiving notices from the Income Tax Department demanding taxation on profits made the year before, and, it may be, 75 per cent, as war-time profits tax made the year before that. As soon as possible, the House should insist upon the appointment of a Finance Committee. Public Accounts Committee does not deal with financial measures submitted to this House. mitted to a Finance Committee; and the members of it ought to be selected from' those who have had special financial training, and who shotild take evidence in regard to the incidence of taxation. have mentioned before to honourable members. L e t us, for instance,, imagine two men who arel e f t £1.0,000 each; one has a love of the bush, and immediately on receipt of his money goes out into the Never-Never, and takes all the risks of drought, fire, and flood. He spends, his £10,000 in developing his property, and, possibly, borrows another £10,000' for the same purpose. Prior to the war, that man never made a sixpence of profit. may say that I am citing special cases which have come under my notice. Every year prior to the war that, man showed' an absolute loss. of the war he showed a book profit, not a cash profit"", of £ 1 , 2 0 0 ; and in the next year, with £20,000 invested, he showed a book profit of £4,800. In spite of this, however, every year prior to the war he had been losing from £500 to £ 8 0 0 , and there was always a risk that the next year he might lose every penny through drought. This man was called upon to pay land and income tax, and £2,750 in war-time profits tax; while his neighbour, who had probably been making £15,000 a year in tbe same industry, but wdio had a pre-war standard to that, amount, was not called upon to pay sixpence. Now, let us take the case of the other man, with £10,000,. However, I rose parwho declines to expose himself toany risk or responsibility, but puts his money out on mortgage, and is sure of an income of anything up to £700 a year for life. In addition, such a. man may start as a commission agent or broker, and, whilst the pastoralist or grazier has been making £4,800 a year, this other man may have made £20,000 or £40,000 in commissions. Yet this latter man does not pay a penny in war-time profits tax, because he made his money with his brains. It is a. scandal that there should be such a measure on our statute-book, because, under its provisions a man who develops this country and produces wealth, may have to sell his property in order to pav taxation. A l though, under our taxation measures, the It is a pity the Commissioner has power to giveconcessions in case of drought or' heavy losses,, such, concessions are not made. However,. Such measures s'hould be subI shall not go into details, for I shall have another opportunity of dealing w i th taxation matters. I may say, however, that. the. Government have not yet appointed a Board, as provided by our law, to whicli appeals can be made in cases, Letme cite cases that I where taxpayers axe hot satisfied w it h the decisions of the Commissioner. There is another taxation matterto which I should like to refer. When we passed the Entertainments TaxA c t , I am certain t h a t honourable members thought it was for the purpose of making liable those who carried on amusements as a business. When I was travelling in the back country, some 300 miles from the city, in Western Australia, I had many I complaints in regard to claims for payment of the amusement tax by fire brigades, churches, or soldiers' entertainments committees, on the ground that In the first year they had promoted entertainments for admission to which a .charge was made. have to pay the tax, though they have to obtain permission to hold the entertainments. I found that the Catholic priest had been summoned for holding an entertainment without a permit, and notices had been sent out to the people, including Roads Boards, to the effect that they must not let their halls for entertainments u n t i l",40,Joseph Cook Th E Honourable Bias There I F The Arsenal Was To Be

All these cases to which I am alluding show the absurdities of the administration, which is particularly stupid in the case of hamlets with a population of 100 or 150, who certainly cannot be accused of making large profits on the entertainments they promote. There is no necessity for the restrictions on people outback who do not promote amusements for profit ; and I hope an amendment w i ll be made in the Act restricting the application of the tax.

If the honourable member thinks it right to go behind the backs of Ministers in such Decases, I do not agree with him. I now desire to refer to the expenditure of the Defence Department, which is increasing since the end of the war. I do not desire to cast any reflections, but it is essential for Parliament to come to an early decision in regard to our Defence policy, so that the Department may be able to carry on its work on definite lines. Large sums are being expended on the erection of buildings for the housing of material which is coming from the Old Country. Although the greater portion of. war equipment was purchased in the early stages of the war, I hope that the Government will insist as far as possible on no new purchases being made to increase the stores that are comingi n . These stores, I suppose, mu6t be worth some millions of pounds, and the housing for them cannot cost less than £300,000. at Liverpool ? I find the Taxation lized for the purpose to which I am re' ferring. The Public Works Committee visited Liverpool on Saturday afternoon, and, in 'my opinion, it would not be possible to care for the equipment without I do. the erection of the proposed buildings I do, not, because I there. However that may be, the Government should do all it possibly can to reduoe the quantity of goods .being sent out, and to insist that no new material shall be manufactured. I believe it is' I do not go to see the intention of the Department to spend something like £40,000 in building a laboratory. That will be in conjunction It is not political with the construction of an arsenal. I have always held that the Government. It is a class of in should have control, as far as possible, of tlie manufacture of all its war material, and that everything should be of the very best quality.

A t any rate, I am not tied in my politics to the one little corner of Australia bounded by the Pederal Capital site. member is so aggrieved at my criticism of various matters associated with Canberra, and with proposed expenditures in the Federal Territory, that he can do no other than endeavour to make tlie whole of this debate a burlesque. I was remarking that a big sum of money had been spent upon the construction of an aerodrome at Point Cook. Now, I understand the Defence Department is considering the purchase of land at Geelong for the construction of an aerodrome. Apparently, some one has blundered in having advised the outlay of such a large amount at Point Cook. If the Government is going to spend between £40,000 and £50,000 upon a laboratory in connection with an arsenal the sooner this House is advised upon its policy in this matter, and in respect to the amount of money proposed to be expended, and concerning the site on which the laboratory is to be erected, the better. the Federal Territory. Tuggeranong site has been rejected. 1' was altogether too stupid a proposition. I think I am safe in saying that it has been definitely decided that the construction of an arsenal .there is not to be proceeded with. In various directions we have witnessed a great deal of useless expenditure on the part of the Defence Department, and it should be for this House to say whether the Defence Department shall have exemption from the investigation of its proposed works by the Public Works Committee. Another matter to which I desire to refer has regard to the policy of the United States Government in the direction of assisting production. that we shall have a considerable influx of population from the Old Country in the near future. We should be able to favourably settle very large numbers. We do not want them brought into the cities, however, but to be placed successfully on the land. A t the beginning of the entry of the United States into the war, the Government of that Republic made a grant of some £7,000,000 annually for savthe construction of roads through the various States. It did so on the assumption that the building of good roads would tend to increase settlement, and to decrease the cost of living. The Commonwealth Government might well conThe honourable sider the matter of granting assistance in the construction' of main roads through the various Australian States. In future, much greater prosperity will be due to the construction of good roads than to the building of railways. W it h the aid of -the oil tractor, men on the land will be able to go out further from railway communication than bas been possible hitherto. The policy of the Government of the United States of America has specially . appealed to me. I know, of course, that this is not the time to look to the Commonwealth Treasury for the disbursement of large sums of money. Y e t this matter of State-wide road construction is one which might well be considered if the Government is really anxious to establish a greater population in country districts. regret to have to listen to the remarks of the previous speaker concerning the Federal Capital. I think tbe time has come when this House should decide once for a l l to complete the construction of the Capital and hasten to meet in Parliament there. once for all to stop the whole thing ? been done years ago before this Parliament was formed. But seeing that the various States, including ' Victoria-fro m which the greater part of the present opposition to Canberra emanates-agree d that the Capital should be constructed in New South Wales, it is f a i r now to ask that the terms of that promise shall be honoured.

I do not think New South Wales has been treated at all fairly in the matter of the Pederal Capital. Capital in Sydney. New South Wales are not anxious for that. The Constitution is quite emphatic upon the point. The honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory), who represents a Western Australian constituency, will, no doubt, recollect that a former distinguished representative of another Western Australian divisionI refer to the late Lord Forrest-pleade d hard that, a certain promise having been made to Western Australia contingent upon her coming into the Federation, that promise should be made good by tbe Federal Parliament authorizing the construction of the transcontinental railway. doing there? Such an undertaking, however, was not part and parcel of the Federal Constitution. that which Mr Deakin had said was a promise. In the interests of the Commonwealth, the Canberra project should be brought to fruition. The Constitution provided that New South Wales should furnish a grant of land upon which to lay out the site of the Federal Capital. New South Wales granted, not merely the 100 square miles implied in her bargain, but 900 square miles. New South Wales gave 900 square miles. elaborate residences have been provided [94] Wales gave was the Crown land within that area. to give was an area of not less than 100 square miles. New South Wales presented the Commonwealth with all the Crown lands on an area of 900 square miles; and then she furnished a port so that the Pederal Capital should not be dependent on Sydney. Further, she gave to the Commonwealth rights in respect to the railway running from Canberra to Jervis Bay. Next, the point was raised that there was no power supply for tbe Pederal Capital, whereupon the New South Wales Government signified its willingness to allow the Commonwealth to utilize the waters of the Snowy River to that end. The latest argument for delay is that there is no money available. In reply to that, New South Wales will find the money if the Federal authorities cannot do so. All the preliminary work at Canberra has been done. A water supply has been provided; the electric power is there; brick-works have been established; roads have been made; a railway has been constructed into the territory; administrative buildings have been reared; and it is time now to go ahead with the completion of the great design. I might say that while the Federal authorities have provided oflice and residential buildings for administrative officers and clerks, they have so far furnished no residences of any kind for the working men engaged in the Territory. Numbers of them are still living in the bag "" humpies"" which were put together ten years ago or more. Duntroon are all provided for there.

Or woman in receipt of an old-age pension is obliged to go into a benevolent institution, 13s. out of the pensioni of 15s. per week is paid to the State Government, the odd 2s. going to the pensioner for pocket money, being spent mostly on tobacco in the case of the man, or on such comforts as tea, peppermints, and a little tobacco in the case of the woman. However, 2s. payments are so small that the Department often allows them to accumulate from month to month. Sometimes it is five or six months before a payment is made. In one case one old anaui had his payments postponed so long that'he ultimately drew £ 2 or £ 2 6s. at one time. Another serious matter is the fact that inmates of these institutions who cannot get out because they have no homes to. go to, so that they may qualify for the payment of the old-age pension, do not receive the allowance of 2s. per -week. . referring to those people who went to the institutions prior to the passage of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. «dl inmates wbo had not the pension before they entered the institution. If a -person applies for an old-age pension, he is often told that it cannot be granted to 'him because he w ill be better cared for by entering the institution. Where persons already in an institution can go to some place where they can board while qualifying for the old-age pension, it is the general practice for the application forms to be filled up in the institution, and then the inmates go outside for about a month and get their applications granted. Subsequently they return to the homes, and are able to draw the allowance of 2s. per week. Those who have no quarters outside the institutions where they can board pending an application for a pensi.on, and inmates of hospitals who cannot get out of the institutions ""because of infirmities, do not get this assistance from the Federal Government. prevent the States people the 2s. ? amount be paid to some and not to others ? tem only some old persons in these instituI f a man tions draw the allowance of 2s.; others do not. orable member's statement they are getting it fraudulently by leaving the institutions for a week or two, and then returning to them. appointed by the Commonwealth Government for the purpose grants their applications for pensions they are entitled to the allowance. To persons who are bedridden in an institution an allowance of Is. or 2s. per week is of very great i m portance. Because of the diseases fro m which they suffer they frequently require the attention of other inmates, and the allowance enables them to pay for this attention. Without the allowance they very often have to go without the attention. Inmates are certainly provided with three meals a day, but they get none of those little comforts, such as tea or tobacco, if they are not able to purchase them. Those patients who draw the allowance of 2s. per week can do this, but others can get nothing, and they feel it an injustice. They cannot grasp why there should be this difference between one inmate and No . It applies to another. Both are inmates of the same institution, yet one draws 2s. per week from the Commonwealth, and the other draws nothing. In my opinion, they ought all to be placed on the same footing. Eveni f we are not paying the States the 13s. for those inmates who do not draw the 2s. per week, I . think we ought to make these old men and women this small allowance, which would go such a long way towards comforting them in bheir last days.

Ever since the Department was taken over by the Commonwealth, the various State systems have been maintained, and in each State the Department is controlled by a Deputy Postmaster-General, almost as if it were a water-tight compartment, with no connection with other States. Because of tliat, we have such anomalies as places like Murwillumbah, on the Tweed, which is less than 100 miles from Brisbane, being controlled by the Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney, which is several hundred miles distant; and the Riverina being administered from Sydney instead of from Melbourne, to which it is a great deal closer. The Deputy Postmaster-General, being so remote from these places, is unable to give personal attention to their requirements, or to acquire an intimate knowledge of the needs that a certain telephone of the people.

The Ministry should inform the Committee when they will be able to promulgate a defence policy for Australia, and to give Australian taxpayers some idea of what burdens they are to bear in respect of defence, in addition to the burdens already imposed upon them by the recent war, and the carrying out of the repatriation, war pension, and many other pledges given to our returned men and the people generally. Delayi n this matter is dangerous. Department in recent years has naturally been one of our biggest spending governmental agencies, and accordingto forecasts it is likely to remain a very big spending Department. The taxpayers should know as early as possible where they stand. This is a matter of interest to honourable members on all sides. I have yet to learn that the defence policy of Australia is a party question. TheM in istry should lose no t i m e , in announcing their policy. It w ill then be for the Parliament to say whether it approves or disapproves of a big expenditure in connection with naval and military matters. Following up the remarks made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), which I entirely endorse, I should like to know whether a statement can be made on behalf of the Government regarding a proposed expenditure of over £40,000 in connection w it h the erection of a laboratory which will be part and parcel of the Commonwealth Arsenal. I am not sure of my facts, but I believe that the ultimate expenditure upon that work will amount to many hundreds of thousands of pounds, and I am givea to understand that something like £48,000 is to be expended on the construction of the laboratory. We should have more in formation on the subject before such a work is entered upon. It will be remembered that the first vote which Parliament was asked to approve in connection w it h , the establishment of the Acetate of Lime Factory was £40,000. I u the following year that total was increased to £80,000, and the ultimate expenditure upon the Factory was something like £100,000.

There are many suggestions of danger in certain quarters, b u t it appears to me that for many years to It is not from any lack come the world will be free from the possibility of a great and appalling war such as that through which we have just passed. So far from seeing danger on any horizon, I look around and see nothing but a general desire on the part of all people to settle down once more to the arts of peace rather than take up the sword again. One of the most important duties of the Government is to see that the jingoistic persons in Australia, who are by no means few, and certainly are not lacking.in aggressiveness, are kept within some reasonsuspended from 6.29 to S p.m. able restraint. Not long ago I read an article in an Australian magazine which in the most pointed manner indicated the intention of a certain friendly Power, which was named, to take aggressive action against Australia at the earliest possible moment in regard to the Northern Territory. The certainty of that aggressive action was indicated as if the writer were entirely in the counsels of the statesmen of that country. Many years ago I pointed There has been a good deal of more out in this House the danger to ourselves of adopting an attitude towards other nations indicative of either fear or antagonism. I trust the Government w ill realize that the policy we ought to endeavour to follow was indicated very clearly and emphatically a little while ago by that eminent British authority, Admiral Henderson.

Apparently, if we do these things tve are, in his opinion, doing the best for Australia, aud all our schemes with regard to the A r m y and Navy may be considered more or less futile, unless we first and foremost adopt a policv that will add as rapidly as possible to the mere handful of people who now hold this continent. Without that safeguard of increased population our condition is indeed dangerous, and I should be glad to hear from the Government that, along with a policy of reasonable prudence in matters of defence, they have also determined to embark upon & thoroughly eomprahensive scheme by which we may add to our numbers from those portions of the Empire of our own k it h and k in the settlers we desire. The Defence Department will be a .spending Department on a very large scale. It will have a great tendency to spend, but I am not satisfied that the gentleman who is in: control of the Department is likely to meet the requirements of the country and Parliament in effectively controlling that expenditure. 1 have.no desire to go back into ancient history, but the record of the present Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) is not one which gives me confidence for the future. Earlyi n the war I pointed out that he would probably f a i r short in many regards, and, undoubtedly, my fears in. that direction.have been more than justified by the course of events. We have had one condemnatory report after another from Commissions which probably no Minister other than Senator Pearce would have taken without resigning his position, but he has not done so. I remind some of the Ministers who are sitting on the Treasury bench at the present time, that the opinion of the old Liberal party with regard to the necessity for bringing the control of the Defence Department into this House, was expressed some time ago in no unqualified language, and' I say. without hesitation, now that, in. the critical position of our finances, when there is such necessity for maintaining a strong control Over the military I have on record a saying authorities, the time has arrived when, the Minister responsible for the Deand partment should be in this House. I feel sure that if the change were He declares brought about it would give a certain amount of confidence to the people of the country in regard to the control of that Department not felt at the present time. I have no wish to detain the Committee, nor any desire to go into details in regard to these matters, but I maintain that the Government must seriously consider the position in respect to defence in the immediate future, must announce its policy in that respect and in regard to the control of that policy; or otherwise they will be in a very dangerous position as regards their continuance on the Treasury bench. Monaro) [8.13] I join with others in criticising the Defence_ Department, because there is great need for it . The Department has drifte d and drifted, and yet nothing has been done. One of the main contentions before the war was that, as a rule, the gentlemen running the Defence Department were notgood commercial men, and, consequently, became rather extravagant in their methods. In my opinion, the same system ruled during t h e ' w a r ; but the conflict in which we were engaged was so terrible, and the issues were so great, that it was impossible to criticise harshly the people who were fighting for us. Therefore, although we knew that horrible mistakes were being made, commercially and financially, we were all prepared to submit to them, and thank God that the men who were fighting for us did not also make terrible mistakes. The valorous deeds of those men at the Pront excused all the blunders made by'those, who. were running the Department financially. But now the war is over we are entitled to apply some little criticism in regard to the way in whicli the affairs of the Department have been administered. We cannot ignore the fact that there is grave dissatisfaction throughout the country on the part of both the public and the permanent soldiers. During the war we promised to do everything for the soldiers. What have we done ? It is true that in respect, of repatriation we have treated ""them as well as we can afford to do*. But -to-day there are men in tlie permanent forces who are not receiving a living.wage, When we established Duntroon College,",53,Department Of Defence
221,Mr Austin Chapman (Eden,"one of our proudest boasts was that we were creating a democratic college, which would be open to the poor man's son as well as to the rich man's son. A t that time there were three or four cadets applying for every vacancy; to-day there is not an average of one cadet for every two vacancies. people are commencing to realize that poor men cannot afford to send their sons into the Defence Forces because the Government are not paying a living wage. As a matter of fact, the salaries paid to the permanent men are lower than in any other military service in the Empire. A comparison between the salaries paid to the permanent men in the Australian Army and those paid in the Canadian, Indian, New Zealand, and B ritish Armies would show the Commonwealth to disadvantage. That is a sure method of creat-. ing in Australia a military clique, for it will place the control of tlie Defence Forces entirely in the hands of those wbo have means independent of their Government pay. The war has proved that such ai policy is a mistake; it has shown that .all the brains are not possessed by the moneyed classes. did well at the war and he is entitled to consideration. There is a feeling amongst certain people, in the community against paying the Defence Force well, but I maintain that unless we have a well-paid and well-satisfied military force we cannot expect to live in peace and security. officers. and General SirI a n Hamilton and others have declared that the Duntroon men were worth their weight in gold at the F r o n t ; their casualty list proves their dauntless courage. leaving theJDepartment to-day? cause it is held -by the Department that they contracted to remain in the Department for twelve years, and that a state of war with Austria and Turkey still exists, and that, therefore, they cannot resign unless something is done. As soon as the embargo is removed, the majority of these men will resign, because they are not being paid a living wage.' I make an appeal on behalf of the non-commissioned officers particularly. Some of them have given from .fifteen to twenty years' service, including four or five years of war service, and they are paid £ 4 a week, upon which they are eixpected. to maintain themselves, their wives and families. It is a scandal that the Government should be paying them less than is considered a living wage for civilians. I am surprised that the AsThat fact demonstrates that the sistant Minister( Sir Granville Ryrie) tolerates this condition of affairs for one day. As a soldier be fought with tliese men, and they not only respect him, but have the deepest affection for him. They say that those in authority have "" sold him a p u p . "" Knowing him as I do, I am certain that when he is convinced that they have "" sold him a p u p , "" he will make them sorry for their action. I asked him a question in the House a few days ago concerning non-commissioned officers at Duntroon who are not being paid a living wage, and I quoted concrete facts. 'The answer I received-and my little experience tells me whence it came -wa s that the information I sought was not available at that time; a fortnight has elapsed, and, apparently, the authorities have not yet been able to ascertain The poor man's son whether some of the men at Duntroon are being paid less than a living wage. We were promised that these men would receive an increase in salary; they have not had one for years, although the cost of living has increased so much that they are hard put to it to struggle through at all. their salaries have been decreased T h a t is so, them are receiving less to-day than they were before the alleged increase was eanted. When I first mentioned this matter in the House, the Department promptly gave the men a bonus, and it later issued a regulation to the effect that those who did not like the new rate of pay could take the old rate. That regulation indiN o , becates the character of the alleged increase ; if it were genuine, the men would certainly not think of taking the old rate. It is unfortunate that the Defence Department cannot tell us what some of the men are being paid to-day. I assert, without fear of contradiction, that many of them are being paid less to-day than before the so-called increase was paid, and in 'the case of some of them it is not enough ta keep body and soul together. Of course, this remark does not apply to men who have other means. 1 am surprised that the Defence",54,Department Of Defence

Ninety per cent, of the permanent soldiers and officers are returned soldiers, and surely to God wa ought to pay them a living wage, if nothing more. Is the Royal Duntroon College, the graduates of which received such high commendation from Generals Birdwood and Hamilton, and others, and who rendered such splendid service during the war, to be made the preserve of the sons of the rich ? Men of means can afford to send their sons there to learn the military profession, but that profession will be beyond the reach of the poor man's son. That is the reason why to-day there are not sufficient cadets for the positions that are vacant. This Committee ought to be told who is responsible for the new rate of pay, which means hardship to a great number of men in the lower grades. Some of the men in the higher positions have received increases, although I assert that many of them are insufficiently paid. parative list of salaries, and I shall take another opportunity of placing it before honourable members and the public, For the time being, I ask the Assistant Minister to disprove my assertion that under the new arrangement many officers and men who are doing the bulk of the work, as the men in the lower grades generally do, are suffering a reduction of pay instead of being given an increase. These men are moved from place to place, and they cannot make permanent homes for themselves. I am hopeful that the Assistant Minister will rectify this grievance, because he is not a sham soldier; he has the welfare of the soldiers at heart, and they, in turn, have the utmost confidence in him. I urge him not to besmirch his high reputation, at the commencement of his Ministerial career, by sponsoring this Unfortunately, we canscandalous arrangement. If . as I understand, a sum of £20.000 or £30,000 is being absorbed in increases of salaries, where is the money going ? Is it fair to It is"" said that some of give all the increases to the higher-paid -officers ? Some of them have been given increases equal to £ 2 or £ 3 a week and The Minister could others have had their salaries raised by hundreds of pounds. I have every confidence that the Assistant Minister will do the right thing; but I urge him not to allow himself to be bamboozled by the That should not be so; men who have evolved this scheme. Let him look into the matter thoroughly, especially as to the starting of increases at proper times. If £30,000 is being made available for increases, why not distribute it on a percentage basis? I remember the Assistant Minister saying, before he went to the war, that the permanent soldier ought to be able to look forward to a superannuation to provide for his future. Now is the time to carry out that idea. I believe that this scheme of increases was framed on the basis of a superannuation fund. The increases might be considered reasonable if the soldiers knew that they were to get also a generous scheme of superannuation. Why has the superannuation proposal been dropped ? Have the Government decided that it shall not be part of their policy, and that tlie returned soldiers in the permanent Forces are not to have any provision made for their old age? If the people were consulted, they would I have an interesting comdeclare that they desired the soldiers to be paid fairly, and that provision should be made for their old age.' Of course, they would have to contribute something to their superannuation, as all others have to do. I do not attack the higher-paid officers as a class, because many of them are, in my opinion, underpaid, and their splendid services during the. war entitle them to every consideration. But it is unfair that those officers should receive substantial increases while those drawing much less pay should have their salaries reduced, or be given no consideration. I appeal to the Minister who in this chamber represents the Minister for Defence to apply his own practical knowledge to the administration, and not let it be governed by theorists. thing that could happen in regard to military men would be the creation in their minds of a feeling of dissatisfaction their treatment. Soldiers cannot strike for better conditions as carpenters or bricklayers or other artisans can. we must insist that they must be treated fairly and well. No man with a grain of common sense would send his son at the present time to Duntroon College unless he could provide him with an income, because at the present rate of pay a young officer after he has passed his examinations can hardly pay for what is necessary to maintain the Old Country of rich men to put their sons into the Army, on' all classes for our officers. of the brightest boys that went from the College to the war were the sons of poor men. I appeal to the Assistant uot to destroy the splendid wh ich he has generally inspired. could be better than that the men in the lower grades of the Service should feel that in their Minister they have an officer possessing practical knowledge, 'determined that justice shall be done to tbem. newly in charge of a big Department at a disadvantage, but I appeal to the Minister not to allow himself bamboozled, but to look into matters for himself, so that right may be done. he does this, he will deserve the thanks of the soldiers, and will give the country what it needs-a Our soldiers have proved themselves to tir? the best in the world, and we should see that they are not dissatisfied. the present permanent men who will be the nucleus of any army that we may raise, should there be trouble future. who is responsible for the terrible misfire in regard' to the raising of soldiers' pay. round, and many names are mentioned, but I shall not repeat either. fair to blame an officer in this chamber, because he cannot defend himself and his ' Minister general terms.

It was my privilege to accompany a deputation to the Assistant Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Ryrie) in reference to one of the Government Factories. During the war, those Factories were working, not only f u l l time, but, in some cases, every hour of the day. The Harness and.

The explanation is very simple. This year all the permanent personnel is coming back from the war, and tlie old positions are being resumed. While the men were away, their salaries, and the expense of their maintenance, were paid at the other end of the world, and came out of the war vote; and this alone accounts for one large item. Then there is another item this year, which is resuming for the first time, namely, the Special School of Instruction; and the two items together account for nearly the whole of tlie increases.

249,Sir Joseph Cook,"The principle laidfrom 40 per cent, to 80 per cent. The complaint of these men is largely due to the fact that the war bonus has been, knocked off. They had been receiving it for some years, and had come to regard it as part of their ordinary pay. W it h the re-adjustment, although in some cases they receive 80 per cent, more than they did in 1914, they are paid less than they received during the war, and they, therefore, complain that instead of getting a rise they have been some cases to a deduction. ing regard to the fact that the Treasurer has not at his disposal an in exhaustible f u n d , the Government have done everything possible to arrive at a satisfactory solution of this very difficult question. The Minister for Defence and I are discussing a scheme under which something further may be given to married men with families, in the Permanent Forces, and that, with the supers annuation scheme which will certainly be brought in , ought to satisfy the Permannent Forces for the time being. would appear from the statement made by the Assistant Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Ryrie), that there is little reasoa to complain of the new schedule that has been prepared, and that it is as equitable as might reasonably be expected of it . I have here, however, a comparative statement which I desire to nut before the honourable gentleman and the Committee, with the object of showing that justice has not been done to at least one branch of the Permanent Forces. I refer to the Royal Australian Engineers, and particularly to the pay of non-commissioned officers and others occupying subordinate positions in that arm of the service. This statement shows that commissioned officers have been granted increases of actual value to them. The old rate of pay for colonels was from £650 to £725 per annum; the new rate is £800 per annum. The old rates of pay for lieutenant-colonels were from £576 to £625 per annum; the new rates are from £635 to £750 per annum. The old rates for majors were from £475 to £ 5 5 0 per annum; the new rates are from £550 to £650 per annum. Captains under the old rates received from £375 to £450 per annum; under the new rates they receive from £400 to £ 5 2 5 per annum. Lieutenants under the old rates received from £250 to £350 per annum; under the new rates they receive from £250 to £375 per annum. Quartermasters under the old rate were paid from £300 to £400 per annum; under the new rate they receive from £325 to £450 per annum. It will thus be seen that an actual increase has been granted to commissioned officers. In the case of those occupying subordinate positions, in some instances there has been an ' actual decrease. Havable gentleman the figures. supply him with names. sergeants received 10s. per diem, plus rations, which were valued in South Australia at Is. 6d. per diem. T h a t amount was drawn in lieu of rations, making a total of £4 0s. 6d. per week, plus a free issue of uniform . Under the new rate they receive 72s. per week, with a deduction of 2s. 6d. per week for uniform . There waa no such deduction under theold rate. ' In the case of married men It a bonus of 6s. per week is also granted. Married men, if in receipt of higher pay under the old rate, may retain it . Thus a married man gets no increase, and a single man suffers a reduction. Sir GRANVILLERYRIE A number of married men receive an increase under the new rate. go into this matter. I am told that it is not w it h in the knowledge of the Ministerf o r Defence that the new scheme works out in this way-that the scheme as presented to h i m was deceptive, and made it impossible for h i m to deal w i th the situation on its merits. I want the Ministerto recognise that this matter requires his personal attention. He should see that be is placed in possession of the actual facts by his responsible officers. In the case of corporals, the old rate of pay was Is. per diem less than that received by sergeants; that is to say, they received £3 13s. 6d. per week and a free issue of uniform . Under the new rate they receive 67s. per week, with a deduction of 2s. 6d. per week for uniform . That deduction was not made under the old system.

The honourable pleased to hand this list to the Minister, so that he may see for himself that there is some justification for the complaint T h a t is so. I am voicing.

The new rates are as follow: Single man, 60s. per week, less a deduction of 2s. 6d. per week for uniform, less 10s. per week for rations, and less 2s. 6d. per week for quarters; married man, 60s. per week, plus a bonus of 6s. per week, less a deduction of 2s. 6d. per week for uniform. The comparison is as follows : A single man received an increase of from 3s. to 6s. 6d. per week according to length of service. A married man received an increase of from4s. per week for a man A l t h o u g h peace has with less than two years' service to 6d'. per week for a man w i th over six years' service.

270,Mr Corser ( W I D E ' B A Y ) [9.181,"Ito a matter of great importance to the future of Australia,-the need for the encouragement of rifle clubs. During last year tliere was a, reduction of 50 per cent, in the effective grants to rifle clubs. We are fortunate in having in this House a Minister representing the Defence Department who has had practical experience at the Front, and I think he will admit that the men who went from Australia who had previously been members of rifle clubs turned out to be the very best material for warfare. In many in stances 60 per cent, of tbe members of the clubs in the Wide Bay electorate, and elsewhere, enlisted, and in the case of one or two of the clubs in Wide Bay, all the members except two went on active service. I am sure we recognise that the return we got from the past expenditure on rifle clubs has been a hundredfold. Not only were members of rifle clubs who enlisted effective fighters, but, as they were also able to instruct others who had not the same knowledge of their weapons, they thus assisted to make the whole force a very much better fighting machine. I sincerely trust that the Minister will see that on the next Estimates provision will be made for the payment of a 10s. effective grant to rifle clubs, so that in case trouble arises in the future we shall have a capable and effective force here, ready ancl able to defend this country of ours. Proposed vote agreed to. Divisions 83 to 101 (Navy), £1,536,924, agreed to. Proposed vote (Divisions 100 to 115), £583,011 . is one matter of considerable importance to which I wish to draw attention. I would have mentioned the subject some time ago but for the fact that the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) has been away ill , and I was anxious that he should hear what I had to say,because I believe it is something upon which no single Minister can give a decision, but which must go before the Cabinet as a whole. I refer to the basis upon which the Customs authorities calculate for Customs purposes in the payment of duty the value of goods bought in the currency of any other nation. time the high cost of livin g is one of the most burning and vital questions we have confronting us.' We are also very much inclined to protest how much we owe to our Alliesi n the late war, and how much we are willing to do to assist them to once more regain their position in the world. But what we are doing in regard to the administration of our CustomsA c t is a little startling to ' any one .who is not aware of what is the actual position. There are a few facts I wish to bring under the notice of honourable members, because I do not think they realize what is happening, or they would not in dorse it or approve of it . B y our administration of the Customs Act we are actually rendering it almost impossible for France and Italy, probably our two greatest Alliesi n the late war, to trade in Australia, and are driving the whole of our overseas trade into the bands of neutral countries, or countries whioh made tbe smallest sacrifices on behalf of the Allies during the war. There are many people who are Protectionists, and there are many wbo are Free Traders, but I do 'not think that any of them believe that a preference other than the deliberate and considered preference given by this Parliament to GreatB r it a in should be extended to any country under ourT a r if f. The startling position to-day is that we are giving a most extraordinary preference to certain countries to the detriment of others. of exchange. the period of the war certain countries had to completely cut off their exports. They had their commercial and indust r i a l centres ravaged and overrun, and, for the time being, the whole of tbeir trade ceased. The result after the war '.has been that the world's exchange is absolutely against those countries, and their currency in the world's market is hopelessly depreciated. On the other hand, countries which continued to trade during the period of the war became the great exporters of the world. Gold flowed to them, and their currency is now at a great premium in the world's markets. We all know that that is the position to-day, but sometimes we forget that it is only recently it has come about. E x A t the present changes the world over were maintained artificially during the war. Take the case of GreatB r it a in , where we have seen the value of the sovereign come down to 3.35 dollars as against the par value",62,Granville Ryrie S O That They Available For Duty The Whole Or Any Part
271,Mr Bruce (Flinders) [9.22],There,63,Department Op Trade And Customs
272,Mr Tudoe,That is under the rates,63,Department Op Trade And Customs
273,Mr Brtjce,"That is so. Duringof 4.85 dollars. That has only happened since the Armistice and since the artificial safeguards that were taken to maintain exchange were removed. We never got below 4.70 dollars or 4.75 dollars during the war. The result of the removal of the artificial safeguards has been that we have had extraordinary variations of exchange which prior to' the war did not exist. In pre-war days the franc might have varied from 24 francs to possibly 25.50 the £ 1 sterling, but that would have been an enormous variation. It was the same with other exchanges, and so it continued during the war. But to-day the position is completely altered. ordinary economic laws coming into force, we have seen variations in the franc up to 60 francs to the £ 1 sterling. These variations bring about most extraordinary results in the payment of Customs duties, for the reasons that the Customs Department here always operate upon the basis of the par value of exchange and take no notice whatever of the value of exchange at the time when the goods were purchased. Before giving actual instances of what has happened, I would like to give a very simple illustration, from which honorahle members w ill have no difficulty in seeing what is done. If a person goes to any country and buys £100 worth of goods, and the invoice comes through to Australia as £100, the Customs authorities look at the date the invoice bears, and look up the rate of exchange on that date If the goods were bought in Prance they proceed to turn the £100 into francs at the rate of exchange on the date the invoice bears, and if at that date the rate of exchange was 50 francs to tbe £1 sterling, they say, "" The £100 is 5,000 francs."" Having turned the sovereign into francs at the rate of exchange at the date of purchase, they then proceed to bring it back into sovereigns on the pre-war or par basis of exchange, namely, 25 francs to the sovereign. The result is that, although the purchaser has paid £100, and only £100, for the goods, when he goes to the Customs authorities and tenders his duty, which, we w ill say. for the sake of argument, is £25, they say to him , "" No ; we will not accept that. The duty is £50, because these goods cost you £ 2 0 0 . "" That is rather a startling practice, but it is taking place every day. It is unjust, and everybody is protesting and trying to demonstrate tbe injustice, but can get no remedy. Apart from the fact that it is making Australian people pay more than they should pay by reason of the fact that the goods are being loaded with duties that ought not to be paid, and which Parliament never authorized, I take the broader point of view that we are by this action penalizing nations that, in the francs to war, were our friends and Allies, and throwing the trade into the hands of neutrals who did not helD us at all. or Allies who helped us very little. I shall relate to the House what happens in connection with £100 worth The of goods purchased in Prance, Italy, and America respectively. Take, firstly, £100 worth of goods purchased in Prance. Say the exchange of the day is, as it has been for some time past, 50 francs to the £ 1 . That means that 5,000 francs have been paid for the goods. When the goods land here, the £100 is first converted into 5,000 francs, and then reconverted at 25 francs to the -£1, that being the par value. That gives a value of £200. Assuming the duty to be 25 per cent., the importer pays £ 5 0 to tlie Customs Department upon goods that had cost him £ 1 0 0 . Take now the case of £100 worth of goods purchased in Italy. The exchange is, as it has been for some time, 75 lire to the £ 1 . That £100 is immediately converted into 7,500 lire. That is reconverted at par value25 lire-whic h means that the importer is said to have paid £300 for the goods, and, at a duty of 25 per cent., he pays to the Customs Department £ 7 5 on goods that cost him£100 . In regard to America, assuming the exchange to be §4 to the £ 1 , although it has been as low as $3.35, the £100 is converted into $400. That is 'reconvened at $4.85 to the £ 1 , the par value, which gives a result of £ 8 2 10s. The importer is then held to have paid £ 8 2 10s. for the goods for which he actually paid£ 1 0 0 , and at a duty of 25 per cent., he pays to the Customs Department between £ 2 0 and £ 2 1 . Therefore, on £100 worth of goods subject to a 25 per cent, duty, France would pay duty to the extent of £50. Italy to the extent of £ 7 5 , and America to the extent of £ 2 0 . fatted pig."" . -; ^; _",63,Department Op Trade And Customs

Japan is getting a marked preference as against France and Italy. This system of calculating exchange is -excellent, and, indeed, is the only possible one, under normal conditions. We cannot expect the Customs Department to recalculate every fractional difference in exDepartment could convert francs or dolchange for every invoice, simply because the importer says that he paid exchange on a basis of between, say, 24.50 francs ancl 25.50 francs, but to-day it is a question, not of a fractional difference in the rate of exchange, but of an absolute prohibition of imports frcmi tbe countries of two of our Allies. ment altered' the procedure those who had imported and paid the rates under the old system would be placed at a disadvantage in comparison with the man who imported under the altered conditiqns. event of such an alteration probably there would be few firms that would leave on hand more goods for whioh they had paid too much than, would the firm with which : \ f am connected. But I should not; mind that in the least. Everybody would have to get out of the trouble as best he could. My point is that the present system is an We must remember that, during iniquity. We are penalizing the very nations that we should be trying to help, not only for sentimental reasons, 'but,because it would be for the benefit of the America, Japan, and other whole world if we could get trade back into its normal channels and the exchange of the world adjusted. The point which w ill be raised is very obvious. The Customs Department, faced with a position like this, would say that it could not calculate the rate of exchange on every single Yet, because of the system invoice and alter it . A t first sight that appears to be a. good argument, but unfortunately the Department is doing that very thing to-day. I pointed out that in respect of importations, expressed in sterling value, the Department is finding not the slightest difficulty in looking up the rate of exchange on the date of the invoice so that it may first convert it prior to reconversion at par value. There is no reason at all why the Customs Department should not operate on the basis of the rate of exchange at the date on which the goods were invoiced, which shows the I have not worked them home consumption value. Therefore, I say there would be no difficulty whatever in altering the present system if it were considered just and righ t to do so. I personally can see no reason why, in order to avoid any real difficulty for the Customs Department, it should not require that all goods that have been purchased inforeign countries should be in voiced in foreign currency. On receipt of the invoice in. Australia the Customs lars into sterling value at the rate of exchange obtaining on the date of the in voice, which could be found by reference to the records. It would then have the actual value of the goods in the country of origin converted into sterling value at the actual rate of exchange applying at the date on which they were invoiced. We should realize that a system such as this, which works such hopeless injustice and borders on an iniquity, must in evitably lead to efforts at evasion. That is very undesirable. Whilst the Customs authorities may think they know everything that is to be known, I personally have grave doubts that, when the incentive is as great as it is in this case, dishonest traders will not devise -means of defeating the Department.

I may mention that one of the biggest business men in Melbourne, whose name I am not prepared to give the Committee, called ab the Customs House, and, as a result of an interview, went away apparently satisfied that the Department was dealing with this matter in the only way in which it could be dealt with. mined that it will not go into the matter ? to preface my remarks with the statement that, no doubt, the honourable member's speech would receive the consideration that it warranted, and I paid great attention to it because of the experience he has had in the world of commerce. I have made it a rule of my life not fo ,rise after 10 o'clock at night, but it is not yet 10 o'clock. I consider myself fortunate in having heard the speech of the honourable member for Plinders, and. the reply of the Minister. Evidently the Cabinet has not given this matter f u l l consideration. The Department seems to fal l back on the reading of a provision in the CustomsA c t passed many years ago, without giving proper consideration to the condition of exchange during bhe last three of four years. The Minister spoke of a line of soap which in 1913 was sold in Paris for 120 francs, but which now costs 160 francs in Paris. B ut it is to be borne in mind that when measured in British or Australian money the franc is now worth only half what it was in 1913. There is an aspect of the case which, apparently, has not yet occurred to the Ministry -as a whole, and that is tlie effect of the depreciation of the money in those continental countries allied to us, which have suffered so much from the war, and the consequent disadvantages under which they are placed as compared with other .countries. There has been an enormous depreciation of the currency of France and Italy, and an 'enormous appreciation in the currency of the United States of America. Because of the sacrifices made in the war by France and Italy, those countries are very much embarrassed financially, while the currency of the United States has appreciated. The goods of which the Honourable Minister spoke, which before tlie war cost 120 francs, equivalent to £ 4 15s. in British sovereigns, now cost 160 francs in* British paper money. But these francs are worth only half the value in English money that they were before; therefore, the price of this particular product, measured by English or Australian money, has fallen from: £ 4 15s. to £ 3 4s., or to two-thirds of its former value. That is due to the fact that the francs now go 50 to the £ 1 , whereas before the war tbey were 25 to the £ 1 . The Acting Ministerf o r Customs( Mr. Laird Smith) now seems to say that, because of this, we must impose a higher duty upon French goods. the home consumption value of the goods. tralian money, this conversion is made on the basis of 50 francs, as compared w i th 25 francs previously.",66,Department Op Trade And Customs

Unhappily for the people there, they advocated and obtained a railway, and because there is a train only every other day the mails are carried only every other day. Every day there is a motor service from Tamworth to these towns, but mail matter is not carried by them. A great number of similar instances might be given, and I have no doubt that, like myself, other country representatives receive a lot of correspondence in connection with postal matters, and are considerably embarrassed owing to the fact that they are unable to give any satisfaction or relief, and are helpless to do anything to improve matters. I am convinced, from a conversation I had with the Postmaster General, that his anxiety is to make this Department, not revenue-producing, but one by means of which the benefits of the Post Office may be enjoyed in more or less remote places.

315,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime M i nwelcome and interrupt the business of the country as little as possible if we adjourn during the visits of His Royal Highness the Prince to the State of Victoria and the State of New South Wales, and ask Mr Speaker t.o summon members to meet; again by a special call. Such an arrangement, I think, w ill suit the case, because I am not at all clear as to the date which covers the period I have indicated, and it is desirable that this House should meet a little earlier than the Senate, in order to get through some business for the Senate to deal with. Of course, if arrangements are made for the presentation of an address to the Prince of Wales nextweek, the House will meet for that purpose, but that is a matter which Mr President and Mr Speaker control, and with which I , as head of the Government, have nothing to do. Subject to that proviso, I propose that tbe House should rise on Friday to enable honourable members to participate in the welcome to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales while he is in Victoria and New South Wales, and the House of Representatives will afterwards be called together again by Mr Speaker, and tlie Senate by the President of the Senate. In reply to the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory), who has asked when the consideration of the Tariff will be begun, I wish to say that it w ill be considered as soon after the resumption as possible. I cannot fix a definite datf. Th'e honourable member for of the extension When the honourable member raised tbe point some weeks ago, I told him that I turned a very sympathetic ear to his request, but I have sinoe gone into the matter most carefully with the Solicitor General and gleaned the facts. last session of the last Parliament a Bill was passed terminating the existing moratorium. gradually to diminish until it fully terminated in June of this year. I am the last in the world to turn an ear to those who suffer from the periodical visitations of drought to which this country is, unfortunately, am most anxious to strain a point do what the honourable member but the more I looked into the matter the more it became apparent that to do what I wished would create a most undesirable position. Mr Hughes. regulations were introduced to deal with war conditions. The war has ceased, and the conditions to which the honourable member has referred are due to drought. Happily for Australia, those conditions do not extend over the whole of the Continent, although unfortunately they have affected a very largo number of our fellow citizens. The moratorium cannot be made to apply to certain classes of persons. If we were to apply it to all who owe money on a mortgage, to the just and to the unjust, to those who have been stricken by drought, and to those who merely wish to avoid their obligations, tbe matter would be a very wide one. I do not profess to be able to cover it in the few remarks which' I am about to make. This is an obligation which appears in its essence to belong to the States. Many mortgages have been dealt w i th since the moratorium expired. Some"", no doubt, have not been dealt with. Speakingf o r myself, I would say that the unhappy condition to which some of our fellow-citizens have been reduced is a matter for State assistance. But I would rather that, if the Commonwealth had to do anything, it should be by setting aside <a sum of money so that it could be applied for the particular purpose which the honourable member has in mind; that is to say, for the relief of those who have been stricken by drought, and who have heavy obligations which they are unable to meet. I shall bring Franklin the matter in all its bearings before Cabinet. The Government w ill give it most of the moratorium. careful consideration, and the honourable member w ill believe me when I say we shall do everything in our power to help those who have been affected by the drought. However, I feel, after very careful consideration, that it would cause In the endless confusion, and do f a r more harm . than good, if we were to revive the moraThat is to say, its scope was torium, nine-tenths of which has already 'expired. MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) [10.44]. unsympathetic I thank the Prime Minister for the in formation which he has made available. The position which I have taken up is subject, and I that this is not a drought matter at a l l ; to it is simply an aftermath of the war. I wishes, do not intend to discuss the point now, for this reason: I had arranged with the Acting Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) that during the consideration of the Estimates The moratorium I would test the feeling of the House upon",70,Adjournment Of Parliament Tarif F
316,( Mr Mcwilliams) Has Raised The Question,"the subject by moving for the reduction of one item. A t the request of the Minister, however, I allowed the Estimates to pass to-night, since it was desired that they should go before the Senate without delay; but 1 did so on the understanding that when the House was considering Supply to-morrow I would then test the feeling of honourable members. I do not intend, therefore, to enter into debate, but the statement of the Prime Minister that attention would be given to the matter does not meet the object of thousands of persons who, by direct representation, or by medium of tbeir own representatives, have urged me to plead for the extension of the moratorium. I shall take action to-morrow, in no sense as a party move. The Government will acquit me of any such purpose for the reason that I made this offer, which I consider distinctly fair, that if the Government would extend the operation of the Act until Parliament had re-assembled, I would not move in the matter during the present stage of the session. 1 shall show tomorrow how this House was misled into curtailing the scope of the Act by a deliberate statement that if we extended it beyond six months it would not be held valid by the High Court, and thus we would loee everything by reason of the fact that the War Precautions Kegulations had expired. Nevertheless, about six months after that statement was made, the War Precautions Regulations were still in force. I will take the opportunity to-morrow to demonstrate, by reference to Hansard, that it was that assurance, and that alone, which induced the majority of honourable members to take the action which they did. I desire to emphasize that ray contemplated action in testing the feeling of honourable members will be a strictly non-party move. The homes of the people are far too sacred to be made the plaything of anv one party ; and I feel sure that, no matter what the decision may be, no honourable member will seek to make any political capital out of it . the honourable member to ascertain in the meantime whether we have the constitutional power to do what he proposes 1 able members that six months after the utterance of the statement to which I have just alluded, the War Precautions Regulations were put into force in connection with the engineers' strike. If the position was sufficiently Btrong to enable them to be enforced in connection with that crisis, it is idle .now to say that we have not the power to proceed as I propose.
