We were very well looked after. There were some full-time people there but there were reservists as well. They have a lot of talent indeed, and the job that they do is very important to this country. The program reiterated to me the importance of our defence services and the respect that I have for the men and women that wear our uniform, whether they are serving in NORFORCE or other parts of the world. I know that as a government, from the Prime Minister and the defence minister through to the other ministers as well as the parliamentary secretaries, we have an ongoing commitment to our Defence Force. It is a commitment that is shared by the opposition and I would like to put on the record my absolute appreciation of these people. House adjourned at 8.00 pm The following notices were given: Mr Albanese to move: That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for works in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 11 August 2009, namely: Parliament Drive one way road upgrade. Dr Kelly to move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Villawood Immigration Detention Facility, Sydney, NSW. Mr Swan to present a Bill for an Act relating to the subscription by Australia for additional shares in the capital stock of the Asian Development Bank, and for related purposes. Wednesday, 12 August 2009 ----Calare Electorate: Water Parkes Shire Council water bills to 600-odd farmers in my electorate for water they are not getting. The Lachlan River users are on zero allocation yet face being charged for water licences. The government stands to make more than $2¼ million if the charges go ahead. Nowhere else do you hear of someone being charged for nothing. When will the Rudd government intervene in this unbelievable situation and tell its state Labor mates to stop slugging drought ravaged farmers for something they cannot deliver? This is the fourth year in a row that farmers have experienced zero water allocations. Since 2002 there have been six years of no water allocation. The license fees have been raised twice, so we know that the government can do it. A major dam in my electorate, Wyangala Dam, is at 6.9 per cent capacity. Based on that, it will be a long time before general security river water users are given access to any water, yet they are still being asked to pay up. We need the fees to be suspended or waived until there is water available. The Prime Minister, Minister Burke and Minister Wong must act on this blatant cash grab and pull their state mates into line. I would like to bring to the attention of the House a situation facing the Parkes Shire Council in my electorate. The Parkes shire was one of the hardest hit councils with its investment portfolio in the wake of the financial crisis. They have written off one investment worth $2.8 million and, based on current valuation, face a devaluation of $10 million in portfolio investments. The council has a very serious situation with regard to its airport runway. Two million dollars is urgently needed for work to rebuild that runway because the subpavement is failing, making it difficult for heavy aircraft. Council cannot afford the $2 million needed for the work, and we need to know what help might be available for them. Several months ago council put an application in for grant money through the jobs fund but are yet to hear anything. This is an important regional airport both for Parkes and for nearby regional centres such as Forbes and Condobolin. Last year some 35,000 passengers used this airport. Blair Electorate: Amberley Community Engagement Forum Engagement Forum terms of reference. Present were: Air Marshal Mark Binskin AM, the Chief of Air Force; Air Commodore Chris ‘Noddy’ Sawade, the senior Australian Defence Force officer of RAAF Base Amberley; Mayor Paul Pisasale; and me. We all signed the terms of reference. The Amberley Community Engagement Forum is something I have advocated for a long time. It is important to cement the close working relationship and the close relationship between the city of Ipswich, which celebrates its sesquicentenary next year, and RAAF Base Amberley. Ipswich has had a 40-year love affair with the F111s. RAAF Base Amberley is becoming a superbase, with a $1.1 billion redevelopment that is going on right now. It looks like a construction site. RAAF Base Amberley contributes tens of millions of dollars to the Ipswich economy each year. The signing of the terms of reference symbolises the further cementing of the relationship-a reaffirmation of the marriage vow, so to speak, which is not likely to be broken for a long time to come. The Amberley Community Engagement Forum is a joint Air Force and Ipswich City Council initiative. As I said, I have been advocating this for a long time. It is a forum to help discuss issues, challenges and problems relating to the base. The F111s-the ‘flying pigs’ as they are affectionately known-are loved by the Ipswich community. In fact, we named our rugby league team the ‘Ipswich Jets’ and the Ipswich basketball team the ‘Ipswich Force’. That is the degree to which we have embraced RAAF Base Amberley. The personnel there worship in our churches, are part of our P&Cs, play in our sporting teams and, of course, play an important role in the life of the Ipswich community. The RAAF base at Amberley will soon see a major change. In March next year the first of the 24 FA18F Super Hornets will come to Ipswich. Wing Commander Glen Braz is currently in the US taking delivery of the first Super Hornet. The defence white paper recommends the purchase of 100 Joint Strike Fighters in the future. This will occur because air superiority is critical to all types of operations in the region and particularly to our defence. Having air superiority provides greater flexibility to conduct operations not just regionally but around the globe. It would be terrific, when the F111s are finally mothballed, if there could be some monument erected to recognise the contribution of the F111s to the Ipswich community.

(Time expired) Mitchell Electorate: St Gabriel’s School for Hearing Impaired Children competition! I rise this morning to speak about the remarkable efforts of one of my constituents, Mr Brian King, and his family on behalf of his daughter, Erin King, who attended St Gabriel’s School for Hearing Impaired Children within my electorate. Mr Brian King has just completed a remarkable feat: he scaled Mount McKinley in the United States as part of an attempt to raise funding for the very important expansion of the St Gabriel’s school. Mr King many years ago had an accident where a piece of industrial machinery fell on his foot and his foot had to be reconstructed, which, on reflection, makes his achievement all the more remarkable. He approached this task with a determination to do something for St Gabriel’s School for Hearing Impaired Children because it is one of those icons of my community that has delivered so much benefit to so many children for a very long time now. I commend St Gabriel’s School for Hearing Impaired Children because it is now expanding. From next year it will be accepting enrolments from children with a range of disabilities, not simply hearing impaired children. The principal, Kathy Freeman, who has recently come to the school, is continuing a very fine tradition of management of the school and is expanding the enrolment to include children with intellectual disabilities, Down syndrome and autism. It is one of those schools within our community that is very well regarded as an institution that delivers fantastic outcomes for kids. The move is part of a plan to expand a series of specialised schools and strengthen the longevity of these institutions. It is something that I of course support. I think that, from the point of view of government, we should also seek to ease the path for those institutions that operate in highly specialised areas of disability and are now looking to expand their endeavours to ensure their ongoing survival. They are doing it in a way which I find very innovative and which will continue to provide a very high level of service in many areas of disability while also branching out into some new ones. As I have mentioned in this place before, in the north-west of Sydney there is a shortage of services for children with disabilities. We are often missed in the government funding formulas, particularly at the state level, because of the apparent wealth and socio-demographics of my area. However, disadvantage still exists and is often hidden. Therefore it is left to institutions like St Gabriel’s School for Hearing Impaired children to take up the slack. It does that in an outstanding fashion and does a lot of the work that the government cannot and will not do in my area. I commend Mr King for his fundraising efforts for this fantastic school. Meals on Wheels liamentarians on all sides of politics support: Meals on Wheels. It was about this time last year that a relationship was formed between Meals on Wheels and the Australian parliament with the formation of the Meals on Wheels Parliamentary Friends Group. It was formed because members of parliament on all sides of politics in this place wanted to acknowledge the tireless contributions by those involved in Meals on Wheels, be they volunteers or the staff who support people to stay in their own homes. Like many others here, I attend many Meals on Wheels meetings throughout my electorate and on a few occasions I have had the honour of actually going out and delivering some meals in my area. I am always very humbled to see the incredible, valuable contribution made to our society by those who support others. The commitment of the staff and volunteers of Meals on Wheels to assist the elderly and isolated in the community should be recognised by the federal parliament. Next week, on 18 August, Mark Coulton, the member for Parkes, and I are hosting a Meals on Wheels Parliamentary Friends function here in Parliament House to once again recognise the contribution made by Meals on Wheels volunteers and their staff. Many MPs and senators are attending, because they recognise the contribution of Meals on Wheels in their own communities. We will also be hosting Meals on Wheels president, Mr Leon Holmes; vice-president, Mr Ron Walsh; secretary, Mr Cam Pearce; and the ACT operators of the Meals on Wheels services, which are run by the Red Cross in the ACT. There will be an overview of Meals on Wheels activities and a presentation on current and proposed research on nutrition. Following morning tea or morning coffee, Mark Coulton and I, who are the co-chairs of the group, will be visiting one of the clients of the ACT Meals on Wheels service. The meeting next week will be very informative and will allow people to reflect on the needs of the volunteers, staff and local community. All that are here, of course, and every member of the House are most welcome to attend, and I encourage them to come along. Indeed, the staple diet of Meals on Wheels will be availablescones and cream and fruit platters-to ensure that we are all well nourished. MAIN COMMITTEE",126,Constituency Statements

The elderly, ill, disabled and those who are unable to cook for themselves all benefit from the goodwill of the volunteers of Meals on Wheels. We all know that volunteers are the lifeblood of the community. Volunteers keep over 100 branches in my state of South Australia running, every day delivering 5,000 meals across the state. I understand that volunteers are always required, and I urge those who are able to think about supporting Meals on Wheels and those in the community to become volunteers. (Time expired) McMillan Electorate: Wilsons Promontory Lighthouse on Meals on Wheels. I have spoken about the splendour and beauty of my electorate of McMillan on many occasions. The purpose of my recent visit to the southernmost point of my electorate, which also happens to be the southernmost point of the mainland in Australia at Wilsons Promontory, was to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Wilsons Prom lighthouse. Along with 30 other people I braved the trek to celebrate the occasion. The lighthouse at Wilsons Promontory is fondly known as the Grand Old Lady of Light. This grand old lady has been guiding ships past the rocky promontory outcrop for the last 150 years and is one of the key navigational aids that keep Bass Strait safe even today. In a generation in which we have constant and instant access to people and places all over the world, it seems amazing that there are still areas of Australia where physical access is only by foot or helicopter, or by ship when the sea is calm. Usually the only way to get to the lightstation is to walk the 18 kilometres of track across the prom. At the end of that, you are faced with a steep descent down to sea level, only to be confronted with an even steeper walk to the rocky outcrop and the light at the station itself, which is rather confronting. AlthoughI was fortunate enough to travel part of the way by four-wheel drive, I was still not spared the last part of the journey, which had to be done by foot because of the rugged terrain. To say it was a challenge is a huge understatement. When I stood and looked up at the last haul to the lightstation itself my heart sank, but when we arrived at the top of the vista I was breathless-not from the physical but due to the breathtaking experience to be there-for there before us stood a pristine reminder of our past and of the people who overcame unbelievable obstacles to create a future for us all. The Wilsons Promontory lighthouse and its historic residence are now both heritage listed and reinforce the isolation that the residents of such stations have endured. The lighthouse was built by convict labour from 1853 through to 1859 from local granite, and the first light was lit 15 minutes before the sun set on 15 July 1859. The light was originally a series of large wicks fuelled by rapeseed oil, and the lighthouse keeper would stay awake all night in order to keep the light going. Today we have a series of parabolic reflectors with an electric globe set up in front of it. The lightstation sits 117 metres above sea level. It is powered today by solar energy and shines for 18 nautical miles. The current resident lighthouse keepers, Ailsa and Chris Richter, hosted the 150th anniversary celebrations. The Richters have a long association with lighthouses along the Victorian and Tasmanian coastlines. Ailsa held the audience enthralled as she told of some of the difficulties of living, working and raising a family in such remote locations. We can only take our hats off to those people who were there on that day-so many extra lighthouse keepers and their families. Northern Australia speak of the importance of the government’s investment in the East Kimberley, in particular in the areas around Kununurra. The importance of Northern Australia to the nation, the challenges it faces and its unique circumstances cannot be underestimated. In 2008 the Prime Minister recognised that Northern Australia needs specific attention down here in Canberra. Our government’s vision is for a Northern Australia that achieves long-term sustainable economic development for the benefit of local communities. The Australian government established the Office of Northern Australia, ONA, in March 2008 to provide that specific attention. It provides advice to the government on the sustainable development of Northern Australia. As Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia, I have stewardship of ONA. The Office of Northern Australia has a key coordination role across the Australian government and is currently working on the implementation of the $195 million East Kimberley development investment package under a national partnership agreement signed by the Prime Minister and the WA Premier, Colin Barnett, on 3 July 2009. This investment was developed in response to the unique economic and social circumstances of the East Kimberley and will contribute to nation building, provide a stimulus to the economy and address Indigenous disadvantage. This will be achieved through targeted investment in social and common use infrastructure in that region and it will complement the Western Australian government’s investment in Ord stage 2.

158,Mr Gray (Brand,"Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia) (9.45 am)-I would like toThere are 29 projects across the region, selected through a joint assessment process led by the Western Australian Minister for Regional Development and Lands, Brendon Grylls, and me. The executive director of the Office of Northern Australia, John Angley, and Andrew Dickson, Jennifer Burmester, Lyle O’Sullivan, Tracy Butcher and others in the ONA team participated in the joint assessment and were instrumental in setting up the national partnership agreement. I would like to thank them and acknowledge them for the work that they did in that area. The projects range from an upgrade of the Wyndham Memorial Swimming Pool to improvements in health, education and cultural facilities. It is a wide-ranging investment that relies on the involvement of local communities, local government, the Western Australian government and relevant Australian government agencies. A key principle for all projects is maximising Indigenous engagement and employment in each of these projects. I have directed ONA staff to make this a top priority in the implementation of the investments and I will be working directly with my Western Australian counterparts to achieve this. I am pleased to advise that on 30 JulyI announced that work on two projects out of this investment had already started: the Wyndham swimming pool and a patient transfer facility at Kununurra airport. I expect to see the implementation of more of these projects in the very near future, and Western Australian agencies are in the process of submitting project plans for the 21 projects being implemented by the state of Western Australia. It is a cooperative arrangement and a joint investment designed to improve the social well-being of people in the East Kimberley and it is being done by a team at the Office of Northern Australia whose dedication and thoughtful approach to this task I applaud and thank. (Time expired) Murray-Darling River System in my electorate of Mayo, and in particular the issue of water for the communities of Point Sturt and Hindmarsh Island. This is an issue I have raised in this place on numerous occasions. I wish to update the House on the situation and the ongoing crisis for these communities, who seek a freshwater supply and ask for their water security to be met by the state government, which is singularly failing in this area, particularly the National Party minister, Karlene Maywald, who either does not understand the issue or is simply overwhelmed by the gravity of the situation. What is happening is that Point Sturt, which is on the Lower Lakes, just near the Goolwa Channel, has been excluded from a pipeline which is being built from higher up in the Murray to supply these communities who can no longer access water from the Lower Lakes for obvious reasons-due to the shortage and the quality of the water now in the lakes. What has happened is that for some reason these communities have been left off the pipeline, even though it is only a small additional cost for the state government to include them. We have seen buck passing going on from the state minister to the federal minister, Senator Wong. I wrote to the state minister, Karlene Maywald, on 19 February this year. Six months later I was fortunate enough to get a reply, which was basically a standard letter. At the same time, members of the community down there received a very similar reply. It basically says: ‘Well, it’s a bit of bad luck. We might have a look at it. What you can do to solve the situation is pay $100,000 each to connect yourself to the SA Water main system.’ This is just ridiculous. The minister, who calls herself the Minister for Water Security, has no concept of how difficult the situation is. However, Minister Wong seems to have some sort of idea. I congratulate her on at least saying in a radio interview a couple of weeks ago that she will certainly look at this, after one of the members of the community Mr Peter Dockey rang into talkback with Senator Wong. Senator Wong has said she will have a good look at it. I think it is time that we just clarified this for these people and spent the extra, I think, $3 million to extend this pipeline to the properties on Point Sturt. There are some 35 properties. It is not an enormous amount of people but that does not matter. That is not the point. Everyone should expect to have water security. For many years these people relied on water from the Lower Lakes and through no fault of their own they can no longer do so. I think the federal government can quickly solve the situation. I urge Senator Wong, as the minister, to take the responsibility. She said she would have a look at it. I have written to her and we are hopeful in the next few days and weeks that she will be able to do so. Deakin Electorate: Springvale Underpass been many changes around the site of the new railway underpass on Springvale Road in Nunawading. It is a $140 million project jointly funded with $80 million from the federal government and $60 million from the state government. It was a key commitment made by federal Labor in the 2007 election campaign and we, in partnership with the Victorian state Labor government, are delivering on that commitment. VicRoads announced the alliance partners for the project in May and major construction works have now started on the project. The surrounding area has changed markedly in only the last month.

160,Mr Symon (Deakin) (9.51 Am),"SinceI last spoke in the House on this issue on 14 May this year there have383 pile holes required for the retaining walls of the underpass. Including the onsite project headquarters, I am informed there are around 130 people working on the project. This is a great boost to the civil construction sector in Melbourne, along with the many local businesses in Nunawading who are seeing an increase in the number of their daily customers-particularly takeaway shops, newsagents and the local KC. Because works have started at this time of the year, the timing of the construction will mean that temporary closure of the rail service between Blackburn and Mitcham can be done at the quietest time of the year-that is, over the Christmas holidays. There will still be disruption. Hopefully it is minimised to a period of around four weeks. The rail line itself should be under Springvale Road by late January 2010. And the remainder of the project will be completed by early to mid 2010. The remainder of the project includes a new Nunawading station and it will be a premium station that is staffed from first train to last. Provision is made for a third track and a third platform, both through the underpass and at the station. For those who know Nunawading station at the moment, it is a building built back in the early 1960s-very draughty, very cold and very commuter unfriendly. Also, one of the features of the Nunawading station-being a suburban station-is that it has a large amount of parking space. Whilst construction goes on not all of that is available, but once it is finished the same number of spaces will be available as there are now. Residents in the outer east have been waiting a very long time for news that something is finally being done to fix Springvale Road. This project is real and it is happening right now. It is creating jobs for our area and improving infrastructure for the residents and commuters in the federal electorate of Deakin. Not only that, but thousands of residents in the outer east and in the surrounding suburbs will also benefit from the reduction in congestion and the ease of travelling to and from work. Cowan Electorate: Greenwood Senior High School Police Ranger Unit School. This was to observe at first hand the training being undertaken and to thank those that have volunteered in the running of the unit. I have always considered that activities such as those of the police rangers are very good for the development of young people and also serve as a reminder of their community responsibilities. On the evening that I visited Greenwood Senior High SchoolI observed the rangers undertaking drill practice and then problem-solving challenges. It was clear to me that the rangers enjoyed the activities they performed and appreciated the support and efforts of the adults and peer leaders. This is the second time that I have specifically spoken in parliament about the activities and good work of a police ranger unit. AlthoughI had heard of the Greenwood unit before, in one of my previous visits to the Greenwood Senior High School, and also through people in the community, my visit originated from a visit to the WA Police’s North West Metro District Crime Prevention and Diversity Unit. I was in the unit’s office speaking with Sergeant Bob O’Sullivan when I met Tessa Morawski. Tessa, I understand, is the Neighbourhood Watch suburb manager for Koondoola, a suburb that I have also previously spoken about. Apart from her volunteering in that capacity, Tessa Morawski is also the unit coordinator-the leader of the Greenwood Police Rangers. She explained to me what the rangers were about and who were involved as adult and peer leaders. As a result of that discussion I then visited the school and the ranger unit. As part of my visit I thanked all the leaders for the work they do for the members of the unit. I also take the opportunity to acknowledge the work done and the commitment displayed in their own time by those leaders. Apart from the unit coordinator, Tessa Morawski, I would also like to acknowledge Shaun MacLeod, the assistant unit coordinator, Chief Instructor David Williams, and Instructors Michele and Shaun Coles. On that night they had a visiting instructor, Detective Constable First Class Jayd Morawski, whom I also thanked for his work with police rangers out in Kalgoorlie. It is also appropriate that I mention the police ranger peer leaders of the unit, Ranger Senior Sergeant Tom Marneweck, Ranger Sergeants Jake Pengilly, Ayndrea and Emily Grant, Ranger First Class Ryan Demarteau and Ranger Mark Reilly. It is my understanding that these leaders have been of great assistance to the adult leaders and perform their roles very well. I feel confident that they will continue to be positive influences in their schools and in their community for years to come. I hold the police rangers and their leaders in high regard and I consider the Greenwood Police Rangers to be a very good organisation, and their host school Greenwood Senior High should be very proud of them for their contributions to the community. Kingswood Electorate: Soccer Clubs Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (9.57 am)-I rise today to talk about a sport that is growing in my electoratethat is, the sport of soccer-or, as some people in the soccer clubs would like it to be known, football. There are four clubs in my electorate that are growing exponentially. I want to talk about each of those and then talk about the common issues that they are facing. Firstly, there is the Noarlunga United team, commonly known as the Bulldogs. At the moment that club has a membership of 170 juniors, 50 seniors and 30 amateurs. This club is at MAIN COMMITTEE",129,Constituency Statements
161,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (9.54 Am),"I recently visited the Police Ranger Unit at Greenwood Senior Highmaximum capacity. I was very pleased to be able to go down and briefly visit Noarlunga United on the weekend. I saw their reserve team performing very well, and I am informed that the other teams also performed very well on the weekend. The club was founded in 1968, and moved to their current location at Wilfred Taylor Reserve in 1973. The volunteers there are very proud of their club and have worked for many years to build it up. The second club in my area, and a great rival of Noarlunga United, are the Seaford Rangers. At the moment they have 16 teams training on two grounds. That is a very strong contingent. The club has a very strong family focus and was founded in the seventies. Once again, I have been lucky to visit the club and see the strong passion that both the volunteers and the players have. They have informed me that they have a big game coming up on Saturday against Enfield. If they win they will go from fourth to third and qualify for the play offs. SoI certainly wish them the very best in that game. We also, in the local area, have the South Adelaide Soccer Club known as the Panthers. They have a total of 20 teams and about 300 players. That is also a huge club. They also have the Pink Panthers, which are two junior and two senior women’s teams, encouraging women in that sport. I certainly think they do a great job in that. Finally, there is the Cove Soccer Club that has many junior teams-and they are certainly growing-as well as senior teams. They do a great job at developing their senior teams as well as their junior teams. One theme all these clubs has is that they have grown beyond their capacity. They are having to turn young people, mainly in the junior areas, away. This is a big concern when we want to get young people active and involved in their local community. We want to provide access for those people. I would urge, and I look forward to working with, these clubs to ensure that these young people do have access and are able to play the sport that they love. constituency statements has concluded. Mr Garth McEvoy Mr Craig Senger Mr Nathan Verity Debate resumed from 11 August, on motion by Mr Rudd: That the House expresses its deep regret at the deaths on 17 July 2009 of Mr Nathan Verity of Western Australia, Mr Garth McEvoy of Victoria and Mr Craig Senger of the Australian Capital Territory, and tenders its profound sympathy to the families and friends in their bereavement. Ms ANNETTE ELLIS (Canberra) (10.01 am)-It is a privilege and an honour for me to be able to participate in this very important debate in our program here this morning. We tragically heard on 17 July of this year that Mr Nathan Verity of Western Australia, Mr Garth McEvoy of Victoria and, closer to home for me, Mr Craig Senger of the ACT all perished as a result of the murderous act of what has emerged to be two suicide bombers when they attacked the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels early that morning in Jakarta. I think it is also appropriate to note that nine people in all lost their lives, including the three Australians I have mentioned, and also that Mr Scott Mirilles, an Australian, was injured. While making mention of this terrible act, we pass on our very sincere condolences to everybody-to the local Indonesians, to people of other nationalities and to the families of all of these Australians who were so tragically cut down by this terrible action. Specifically this morning I speak directly on behalf of my community of Canberra about Mr Craig Senger. Mr Craig Senger, as has been noted, was tragically the first Australian diplomat killed in a terrorist attack. He was born and educated here in Canberra. He met his wife, Kate, and married here in Canberra. I had the privilege and honour of attending last week a memorial service held here in the Great Hall of the national parliament to mourn the passing of Craig Senger. The words that were used by particularly the Minister for Trade, Simon Crean, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith, along with senior Austrade officials and others, really gave us all a description of a young man who contributed so much both professionally and personally in his tragically short life. I would like to refer to some of the comments that were made at that time with the indulgence of the chamber. Tim Harcourt from Austrade called Craig Senger a man who was a ‘joy to the world’-an official who worked tirelessly to build links between Australian businesses and overseas markets. He was an Australian who made exceptional contributions to his local community, whether he was in Canberra, Sydney, Jakarta, New Delhi, Moscow or Milan-all places where he had been. It was also said by the Minister for Trade and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that, while this was Craig’s first full-time overseas posting, they were not at all expecting it to be his last and that he had a stellar career in front of him. MAIN COMMITTEE",130,Constituency Statements
162,The Deputy Speaker (Dr Mj Washer),"In accordance with standing order 193, the time for members’He was greatly admired by his colleagues and friends. He had a sense of humour and a joie de vivre that many of us could learn a lot from. He had worked to the point of being highly regarded and he was, at the time of his death, leading the mining and resources team for Austrade for South-East Asia in Jakarta. It is interesting to also note that Craig’s career was following in the footsteps of his grandfather, Albert Senger. Albert was also a trade commissioner in the fifties. As Minister Crean said: Albert, like all of us, is part of Craig’s wider family-it’s the trade family … It was interesting for me to hear that Craig Senger had a grandfather who was so active and so regarded in his own life as a senior trade commissioner during the 1950s, in the really difficult times of establishing a new nation following the Second World War, where trade and interaction internationally was so important. From what I have heard, I know that Craig Senger really had a great deal of pride in carrying on that family tradition. The other comment I wish to make is that while we mourn the loss of the life of Craig Senger and his colleagues, when we think of his family, and I will refer to them in a moment, we must also think of his work colleagues in the embassy in Jakarta in particular. The people we have working in our embassy in Jakarta have not had an easy ride over the last few years. They have really had more than their share of tragedy in one form or another in recent years. I will not go into those details; we are all very familiar with them. But here again was another time when they were really pushed to the edge of their ability to cope with not only the loss of colleagues but also the practicalities that such an occurrence presents. I know that we would all endorse very much the continuing incredibly high professionalism that is displayed by people serving our nation overseas, through Foreign Affairs, Austrade and other agencies at any time, let alone at times like this. I want to make a point of mentioning that this morning and passing on to them, on behalf of my community, and I am sure on behalf of the parliament, our regard for the role that they take and for the challenges that they face. When they head off on an overseas posting they do not expect an easy ride, but by no means do they expect to be facing this sort of thing. It is very tragic and they really need to have our regard very high in their minds. As I said, Craig Senger married Kate here in Canberra. His mother, Joan, his sister, Cate, and his niece, Holly, I believe were in the chamber yesterday when the Prime Minister began this condolence motion. The family lives here in Canberra. To Joan and the family, and particularly to his wife, Kate, we can but send our sincere condolences, our warmest of wishes and ask them to believe that if all of the sympathy of the chamber were of any help to anyone, we would like to think it is going to help them in the knowledge that we share their grief, we pay due regard to the work that Craig and his colleagues were doing and we deplore the loss of such wonderful young professional people in such a terribly tragic way. This is just bloodthirsty murder. There is no other way of describing it. It is senseless. When you look at the families of these people, of Craig and others who have died, you just wonder about the senselessness of this type of behaviour. I know that, as a parliament, we are all joined as one in our belief and our efforts to do all in our power to ensure that this sort of behaviour internationally does not continue. I want to finish by recalling some of the comments that were made, particularly by two or three of Craig Senger’s close friends, during the memorial service last week. While I do not have their words in front of me, I certainly have in my memory the absolute joy of their friendship with Craig and their pride in him as a friend, their regard for him as someone who had a sense of humour, generosity of spirit, boundless energy, enthusiasm and dedication to his job. He sounds to me like he would have been a delight to know, and I am sorry I did not know him personally. It sounds to me like he was someone we would all have enjoyed the company of. It appears to me that no matter where you were, if you ran into Craig Senger, you ended up going to barbecues, playing cricket, playing football, working hard, dedicating yourself to the duty you have, but ensuring that you join everybody together in that. He was a bit of a pied piper in that sense. Everybody wanted to get behind Craig Senger and join him in whatever he was doing at the time. On behalf of my community and on behalf of the parliament, our deepest condolences to the Senger family and all of his friends and colleagues, and to everybody connected with Nathan Verity and Garth McEvoy as well. Please may they get strength out of the knowledge that we pay them the regard that we do. regard to these tragedies. On 17 July, bombs exploded at the JW Marriott and the Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta. At the Marriott three Australians were killed and a number of locals and other foreign nationals also lost their lives in the bombings. It is believed that there was an intention by the bombers to detonate a bomb in a hotel room, thereby driving greater numbers through the lobby of the Marriott for the main bomb blast. These events remind us yet again that there are evil, cowardly people in the world who live with no honour and no integrity. They have no regard for innocent life but are driven by reckless hate and a religious belief with which they justify their murderous work. These events remind us that, in this war, our enemies are prepared to do anything, and we must be prepared to fight them and to stop them. MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Jakarta Bombings
163,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (10.10 Am),"I would like to join with the member for Canberra in comments withI would also pay tribute to the efforts and commitment shown by the Indonesian government to fight Jemaah Islamiah. Their efforts to destroy that terrorist network have been very good, in the most challenging circumstances. We should also not forget that the President and the government of Indonesia operate in an extremely challenging environment. We must remember that Indonesia is the most populous Muslim nation in the world and that there is some support amongst the population for the operations, if not the beliefs, of the terrorist group Jemaah Islamiah. Within that context we should appreciate the great advances made by the Indonesians. AlthoughI despise the evil perpetrators of these acts of murder, my main purpose is to speak of those three Australians who died at the Marriott hotel blast. Those three Australians were Austrade official Craig Senger, mining executive Garth McEvoy and Perth businessman Nathan Verity. FirstlyI will speak of the Austrade official, Craig Senger. I understand that Craig was on his first overseas posting and fulfilling his duty of advancing Australia’s interests when he was killed by the bomb. Overseas postings do not come easily in either Austrade or Foreign Affairs, and those that do get them are people of very high ability. Hard work before and hard work during his posting defined Craig Senger as a very effective representative of Australia and Australian businesses, particularly in the mining team for the South-East Asia region. He is survived by his wife, Kate, and I offer my deepest condolences to her and his family. Garth McEvoy was an executive for the mining and construction company Thiess in Jakarta. He was for four years a Northern Territory policeman who went on to study the law and to work as a prosecutor in Darwin. He then moved into private enterprise. He is remembered by all who worked with him as being a very hard worker and dedicated to making a difference. He was, without doubt, highly regarded. He enjoyed living and working in Indonesia as a commercial manager, and he had a great affection for the people of that country. Finally, I will speak of Nathan Verity, who was from Perth. Nathan Verity was a highly capable businessman who had worked in a variety of consultancy type positions. I understand that he worked very closely with Jim Truscott, a former SAS officer whom a number of us in this place know. Jim Truscott had also carved out a business in the Asia-Pacific region in crisis and risk management, and worked with Nathan Verity on those projects. Nathan Verity, however, branched out even more widely, moving also into recruitment. It is clear that he was very well regarded and had the sort of personality with which he could get on with anyone. There is something particularly tragic about the death of a parent of young children. Nathan Verity was married to Vanessa and was a father to five-year-old Chris. The particular tragedy I refer to is both the fact that Nathan will never see his son grow up and also that Chris will not have his dad around to do all the great dad things that we enjoy with our children, and that is a very great tragedy. Some people say that these terrorists undertake their murderous attacks because of economic privation, Western oppression, Western action in Iraq or Afghanistan or because of other nebulous faults or grievances, which individually or together remain nothing more than whitewash over the truth. These terrorists are evil incarnate. They are brutal murderers without remorse or compassion. They live without honour, integrity or a sense of morality. They cannot be reasoned with and they cannot be negotiated with. They call themselves by different names, being Jemaah Islamiah in this case, but they are the same whether they be Hezbollah, Hamas, the Taliban, al-Qaeda or someone else. Regardless of what their name is, they live and kill with the same lack of humanity. They can be dealt with in only one way-by force. This will very likely be a fight and a war that will span generations. We should be ready and never lose our resolve to protect ourselves, our values and our way of life. Debate (on motion by Mr Hayes) adjourned. Private Benjamin Ranaudo Debate resumed from 11 August, on motion by Mr Rudd: That the House record its deep regret at the death on 18 July 2009 of Private Benjamin Ranaudo while serving with the second Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force in Afghanistan and place on record its appreciation of his service to the country and tender its profound sympathy to his family and friends in their bereavement. Ranaudo, a proud member of Townsville’s 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, who was tragically killed in action on 18 July 2009 while serving with the second Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force in Afghanistan. I believe there is no greater sacrifice than to give one’s life in the service of one’s country. Like all Australians, I am deeply saddened by the loss of Private Ranaudo, who fought so bravely on behalf of a grateful nation. At only 22 years of age, Private Ranaudo showed a maturity far beyond his years and upheld the values and ethos of the Australian Defence Force to the last. Private Ranaudo was awarded the Australian Service Medal with clasp East Timor. He was posthumously awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with clasp ICAT, the Afghanistan Medal, the Australian Defence MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Jakarta Bombings
164,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (10.16 Am),"I rise today to support this motion of condolence for Private BenjaminMedal, the NATO ISAF Medal, the East Timor Solidarity Medal and the Infantry Combat Badge. While Benjamin’s death reminds us all of the dangers of military life and the fragility of our own being, his actions will ensure that his memory will live on in the hearts of his family and friends. May I say I believe that that memory will be as strong as the character he demonstrated while soldiering in the worse of environments. Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, Chief of the Defence Force, described Private Ranaudo as: … a professional soldier who served enthusiastically and with distinction. His career record speaks to a young man, very well trained, with an extraordinary array of completed courses. Benjamin was clearly dedicated to his career as a soldier and committed to the profession of arms. He died ensuring that terrorist groups do not have Afghanistan as a base from which they can plan and mount attacks. I stand here today to give my condolences to Private Ranaudo’s family and to pay tribute to the service and, ultimately, the life given by their courageous son. I say to them that I hope they can take comfort in knowing that the thoughts and prayers of all Australians are with them during these very difficult times. I recently had the honour of meeting Private Ranaudo’s family and expressing these sentiments personally. This occurred at the repatriation service for Private Ranaudo, which was held in Melbourne on 26 July 2009. I was truly humbled to stand with Private Ranaudo’s mother, Jennifer; his father, Angelo; his stepfather, Terry; his sisters, Hayley and Melissa; his brothers, Phillip and Terry; and his girlfriend, Haylee, as their son, brother and friend was returned to Australian soil. As I stood on the runway at Avalon Airport and witnessed the return of a soldier, son and friend I felt a mixture of relief as this fine young man returned home and absolute sadness as I watched Private Ranaudo’s family try to come to terms with their sudden and devastating loss. Along with the Minister for Defence, Senator John Faulkner, I stood behind the family as the rear door of the C17 dropped. I shared their grief, for there was the casket carrying Private Benjamin Ranaudo covered in his flag, the Australian flag. The cargo bay of the C17 was partitioned off by a huge Australian flag proudly showing the stars of the Southern Cross. I said to Terry that that flag is Private Ranaudo and that, ‘every time you see an Australian flag it should remind you of Benjamin’. It should remind you of his commitment, his courage and his sacrifice. But most of all it should remind you that we as a nation honour our fallen heroes. AlthoughI was deeply saddened on the day, I can honestly say that the loss fell by Private Ranaudo’s family, although unmeasurable, would easily surpass that of an entire nation. Yet the entire nation stands with Private Ranaudo’s family in paying their respects for the service he gave to his nation and, ultimately, the sacrifice he made in the name of all Australians. There was a profound sense of loss that day, but as tragic as the event was for the entire family of Private Ranaudo, I would like to reassure them, as well as his friends and comrades, that his death was not in vain; in fact, it was honourable. History will remind us that his name sits alongside those of fallen brothers from years gone by. One of the things that moved me at the repatriation service was a poem on the order of service, and I would like to repeat it to you. It was written by Private Gary McMahon, 6 RAR, Vietnam. It reads: We would do anything for a mate, anything except leave him on the battlefield. We shared our last drops of water, or our last cigarette. We patrolled together, we slept together, we laughed together, we fought together. We even died together. I would also like to take this opportunity to pass on my appreciation and support to Private Paul Warren, the soldier injured in the same bomb blast that took Private Ranaudo’s life. It is my understanding that Private Warren has now arrived back in Australia, after receiving medical care in Germany, and that he is undergoing rehabilitation following his injuries, which include the loss of his right leg above the knee. Private Warren is another dedicated soldier who has put his life on the line every time he has stepped outside the confines of the base. Although he was lucky to survive the bomb blast, his life has been forever changed. Now is an appropriate time to pause, to take a moment to reflect on those soldiers who have been injured in the line of duty and who now live with the daily reminder of the hardships of war. In our enduring effort in Afghanistan, there is no doubt that improvised explosive devices are the most sinister threat facing our troops. They are indiscriminate, difficult to detect and deadly. When they do not kill, they maim horribly and leave the victim permanently disabled. Those terrorist groups that employ improvised explosive devices are desperate, cowardly and will as easily target product civilians as they do armed soldiers. We were reminded of these dangerous conditions as recently as last week, when Australian troops encountered four roadside bomb attacks in just two days, ultimately resulting in the wounding of three soldiers. But the advantage that our soldiers have-in addition to their excellent training, discipline and world-class equipment-is the support they can expect from their families, their friends, their colleagues and their nation in their time of greatest need. I am reassured at this point by reading that Private Warren is getting the support he needs from his family, his mates and his fellow soldiers. I believe that his recovery can in no small part be attributed to the supportive environment he now finds himself in. I would like to wish Private Warren a speedy recovery and, further, to thank his family, MAIN COMMITTEE friends and colleagues for the support and time they have given freely to help Private Warren recover from his injuries. As I stand here in this parliament and mark the loss of our eleventh Australian soldier to be killed during operations in Afghanistan, it is fitting to ask all Australians, without regard to their political persuasion or ideological beliefs, to continue to support our troops. Our soldiers serve in some of the most dangerous and unforgiving environments, and while they are sent into harm’s way by the government of the day, they themselves have elected to give their lives in support of a nation they dearly love. It is for this latter reason that all Australians should get behind our troops and offer their support and heartfelt appreciation for the often thankless job they undertake on a daily basis. In calling for the support of all Australians, I wish to acknowledge the great level of admiration and appreciation that is already present in our community. This was shown during the welcome home parade that was held in Darwin last Saturday for some 1,200 troops returning from Afghanistan, Iraq and East Timor. Again, I was fortunate enough to represent the opposition at this parade alongside the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, Greg Combet. I witnessed the support our troops received. You only needed to look down the main street of Darwin, which was lined with people standing shoulder to shoulder and layers deep, to truly appreciate the community’s gratitude for the troops’ service. Indeed, the pride of the nation was on show as these returned troops marched down the street with their heads held high, to the unrelenting sound of applause. Each and every soldier marched proudly. Their eyes steely on the long, hard fight yet, at the same time, filled with an almost palpable sense of pride and accomplishment. They marched proudly, having returned from war, but they also marched knowing that some of their mates had not returned. One of those who did not return with his comrades was Corporal Mathew Hopkins, who was killed in action on 16 March 2009. Corporal Hopkins was a member of the Darwin based 7th Battalion. To mark his loss, and as a reminder that we never forget, a riderless horse with boots facing rear formed part of the welcome home parade. After the parade I had the opportunity to meet again with Corporal Hopkins’s wife, Victoria, and their growing son, Alexander. Although the pain of the loss was still clearly evident, again I was humbled to see the amount of support afforded by those close to the family and, to quote Victoria, to Alex from his ‘army uncles’ as they supported him there. I would like to conclude today by reiterating the words of Lieutenant General Ken Gillespie, Chief of Army, who said: Private Ranaudo died while serving his nation, and his sacrifice will never be forgotten. This loss is felt heavily by the wider defence community, and particularly by members of the Australian Army. Lieutenant General Gillespie’s remarks ring true in my heart and the hearts of all serving and retired ADF members. Indeed, Private Ranaudo’s death will not have been in vain as long as we continue to show resolve in securing Afghanistan free from violence, terrorism and extreme ideologies. These sad times give us an opportunity to reflect on the peril that our serving men and women face every day while serving in places like Afghanistan. It also gives us time to thank those men and women for their hard work and sacrifice. Private Ranaudo made the ultimate sacrifice for his country, a sacrifice that will not be forgotten and one that time will prove to be in the interests of his beloved country. To Private Ranaudo, I say: thank you for your sacrifice and bravery. I join with a mournful nation in expressing my condolences to his family. Private Ranaudo has joined the ranks of those who have given their lives in Afghanistan: Sergeant Andrew Russell, Trooper David Pearce, Sergeant Matthew Locke, Private Luke Worsely, Lance Corporal Jason Marks, Signaller Sean McCarthy, Lieutenant Michael Fussell, Private Gregory Michael Sher, Corporal Mathew Hopkins, Sergeant Brett Till and Private Benjamin Ranaudo. It was a local Vietnam veteran, Brian Ferguson, who reminded me of the role of the soldier. He gave me this poem to read out today: Remember this: It’s the soldier, not the preacher, who gives us freedom of religion. It’s the soldier, not the poet, who gives us freedom of speech. It’s the soldier, not the reporter, who gives us freedom of the press. It’s the soldier, not the union organiser who gives us freedom to demonstrate. It’s the soldier, not the lawyer, who gives us the right to a fair trial. It’s the soldier, not the politician, who gives us the right to vote. MAIN COMMITTEE It’s the soldier, who salutes the flag, who serves under the flag and whose coffin is draped by the flag who allows the protestor to burn the flag. It is the soldier who makes all of this possible, day after day after day. Minister for Climate Change) (10.28 am)-I rise also to speak about the tragic death of Private Benjamin Ranaudo, killed in action on 18 July this year. Private Ranaudo died while deployed on Operation Slipper, serving Australia in Afghanistan. I would like to extend my personal and sincere condolences to the family of Private Ranaudo-his mother Jennifer, his father Angelo, his brothers and sisters and his girlfriend, Haylee McCarthy. All of our thoughts and deep sympathies are with his family and Haylee, and with those who served with him in the Australian Defence Force, during this very difficult time. I had the honour of attending Private Ranaudo’s funeral on 31 July at Boyd Chapel at Springvale Botanical Cemetery in Melbourne. The service that paid tribute to Private Ranaudo was solemn and very moving. Benjamin Ranaudo served in the Australian Army for three years and during this time he served on active duty in East Timor before deploying to Afghanistan with the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force. Private Ranaudo deployed as a member of the Townsville based 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. He was assigned to a force protection combat team as part of the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force 2. Focused on ensuring safety, the MRTF2 has been working closely with coalition partners in Afghanistan and the Afghan National Security Forces in the lead-up to the election in Afghanistan this month. Private Ranaudo was only 22 years of age. He was tragically killed when an antipersonnel explosive device detonated during a cordon and search operation in the Baluchi Valley 25 kilometres north of Tarin Kowt. Private Ranaudo’s death is a very sad and tragic reminder of the dangers that our deployed soldiers face while serving their country in Afghanistan. It is important for us to reinforce our continued focus on our goal to restore security and stability to Afghanistan. Oruzgan Province, where we operate, is an environmentally challenging area and we are facing an enemy that is ruthless and determined. Despite these challenges, we are making progress in this theatre. We are disrupting and limiting the ability of Taliban insurgents to operate in the area and, together with the Afghan National Army, we are providing security to local civilians so that they can rebuild and move forward in a stable and secure environment. In addition to security operations against Taliban-led insurgents, the Australian Defence Force continues to make a very significant contribution to improving infrastructure and Afghan government services in Oruzgan Province. It is those goals that we as a nation must remain focused on in this time of tragedy. For us to honour those who have died in Afghanistan, we must stay very focused on the goals, the purpose of our mission in Afghanistan and our commitment to restore both stability and security to that nation. The tragic death of Private Benjamin Ranaudo brings the total number of Australian fatalities in Afghanistan to 11. At this time it is extremely important to reflect on the courage and commitment that each of them have shown in serving this country. To all those currently serving in Afghanistan, on behalf of the government in my capacity as a minister within the portfolio, I want to thank all of them for their extraordinary service and commend all of them for representing their country with such professionalism and courage. ues are and where we sit in the world. It is a story about the Australian Defence Force, its people and its families and the loyalty that they show to one another. It is a story about a garrison city, Townsville, where soldiers and their families live and work and relate to the ordinary citizens of that city. It is a story about a battalion, 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, the ‘Big Blue One’, and the ethics and the professionalism of the men and women who serve in that battalion. It is a story about a private, Ben Ranaudo, who served in the 1st Battalion, and his contribution to our country. I have been very privileged in representing the garrison city for so many years now in the Australian parliament. AndI have been very close to the Australian Defence Force and I think I understand their views and their ethics and how they work. When the news came through that Ben had lost his life in Afghanistan, my community was very visibly touched-not just ADF people but mums and dads, and kids going to high school. They all felt it. They genuinely felt the loss of this private. That is what the ADF and the families and the garrison city are about. People genuinely felt the sense of loss. Ben’s family can know and understand that that loss is felt in the community. Recently-last week-there was a story about Ben’s battalion which came to my notice. A corporal who has been a corporal for as long as anyone can remember, Corporal Renahan, sent out this excited email across the network-and I am on the email list, because I know him quite well-saying: ‘Today, would you believe, I’ve MAIN COMMITTEE",133,Condolences
165,Mr Combet (Charlton,"Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and Minister Assisting the",136,Condolences
166,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (10.33 Am),"This is a story about a country, our country Australia, and what our valbeen promoted to sergeant. I don’t believe it.’ Within a couple of hours, back came some emails. Yes, they came back from his mates in the battalion, but they also came back from General Mark Kelly and General John Caligari, senior leaders of the ADF who genuinely congratulated Reno for being promoted. But the point of the story is that that is the ADF family. You can be a person at this or that level of rank, but everybody respects each other and everybody shares in successes and of course in pain. That is our Australian Defence Force. Long may it continue. Ben knew why he was in Afghanistan. He knew that Australia and the other nations that contribute to ISAF understand that if we do not face up to terrorism it will just get worse tomorrow and next year. He did not die in vain. His family should understand that, and I think that they do. We have been very lucky, through the professionalism and training of our ADF members, that we have not lost more. Other defence forces have in fact had significantly higher casualty rates. One of the things that helps protect us is our wonderful Bushmasters. They have very much saved lives. The v-shaped design of the underneath of the vehicle deflects blasts. Because of that, you can have the front wheels blown off and ending up 100 metres away, but the people inside remain safer than they would otherwise remain. They have been a very good acquisition for the Australian Defence Force. As soon as we can get some more, they should be provided to other elements-the special operations task group, for example-who could well use Bushmasters where they have not used them previously. The IEDs that we talk about are getting more insidious. We are now seeing these terrorists make these things out of materials that you cannot detect with magnetic detectors. They are being made out of materials that are virtually undetectable. That is a very insidious development. But it just reinforces Australia’s view that we have to defeat these people and that we have to help the people of Afghanistan. I heard a statistic last night about the number of girls going to school in Afghanistan now. Before we entered, most girls were illiterate. They were not allowed to go to school. There are now some five million girls going to school in Afghanistan, which is a wonderful outcome for the people of that country. Long may that continue. Two weeks ago, Deputy Speaker Washer, you and I were in Mongolia. Mongolia is a relatively remote place, but you and I were there. We met the Prime Minister, who very proudly told us that the cabinet had just made a decision to send a battalion to Afghanistan to do their bit. Mongolia is a small country. It is only the size of Western Australia. It is relatively small. Its infrastructure is not good. But that country recognises its obligations to the world and is fulfilling those obligations. Their contribution is certainly very well and very gratefully accepted. I can assure Ben’s family that the people of Townsville, the people of the 1st Battalion and the men and women of the ADF will not forget Ben. His contribution was not in vain. We thank him for his life and we thank him for what he has done for our country and the world in helping to produce a better and more secure outcome for the world. May he rest in peace. Dr KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (10.41 am)-It is a privilege to follow my friend the member for Herbert on this condolence motion. He has the great privilege of having the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, in his electorate and I know he appreciates that great privilege. Private Ranaudo has now become a part of the wonderful story of that battalion. It has an incredibly proud history. I am very privileged myself to have been a part of that history, having served with the 1st Battalion in Somalia. I know that battalion operates, exists, trains and survives as a family. I echo the comments of the member for Herbert. They will no doubt feel this loss as a family would and treat it accordingly. They will wrap around each other to help each other, and the family, through this. They will incorporate the contribution of Private Ranaudo into the wonderful history of that battalion. Private Ranaudo was a young man, at the age of 22. He obviously had so much more to give in life. There is a famous old poem that talks about one crowded hour of glorious life being worth an age without a name. Private RanaudoI think illustrates that. It was a short life, but it was definitely a crowded hour and a glorious hour that he graced us with his presence on this planet. He was a character who was full of the joy of life. You can see that absolutely beaming out at you from the photographs of Ben. Certainly that is what his colleagues from the unit will tell you. He contributed greatly to the esprit of the battalion, and that element-the camaraderie and the mutual contribution that each member of that organic family brings to the table-is as important to the effectiveness of a battalion as the equipment with which it goes to war. Private Ranaudo was in the forefront of contributing that esprit and that effectiveness in his unit. He made a great contribution to our effort in Afghanistan as part of the Mentoring and Reconstruction Taskforce. Our focus in Afghanistan has become building local capacity to enable us to eventually depart from Afghanistan but importantly also creating the conditions for that departure in building the ability of the Afghan people and the Afghan security forces to take responsibility for their own security. Private Ranaudo helped advance that MAIN COMMITTEE cause, in bringing that capacity and security to the people of Afghanistan. We have heard reference to the fact that in three years, in his crowded time, he managed to serve in East Timor and Afghanistan. To demonstrate the initiative and drive of this individual, he was accomplished in a large number of courses. He was a self-motivated, selfstarting individual, the type of person we prize so much in the Defence Force. He lost his life on 18 July 2009 in an improvised explosive device incident in a cordon and search operation in the Baluchi Valley, which is about 25 kilometres north of Tarin Kowt. That illustrates the ongoing threat we face from IEDs, as has been mentioned. This really is a focus for this government. We are intent on leaving no stone unturned. We are intent on delivering the equipment, improving the tactics, techniques and procedures of our ADF to deal with this threat and making the operations of our troops as safe as possible. We will reach out to any country, any friend, any ally, to achieve best practice in dealing with this issue. It is now becoming a question of facing not only the technical challenge of improvised ordnance but also the more sophisticated tactics of the enemy. I was at a briefing just the other day at Headquarters Joint Operations Command where they were deconstructing the casualties the British have recently suffered. They, tragically, lost about 15 soldiers in a period of just 10 days. An initial incident involving improvised explosive devices and causing casualties was made much worse, was amplified, by the fact that the enemy, the Taliban, had factored in how the ISAF personnel would respond to that incident and had configured IED placements accordingly, which of course resulted in much more severe casualties. So we are facing a sophisticated enemy. We must compare notes and develop, as far as we possibly can, tactics, techniques and procedures to counter the methods by which the enemy employs these devices. I should also emphasise that in the same incident where Private Ranaudo lost his life we also suffered the casualty of another private soldier, Paul Warren, who has subsequently lost his right leg above the knee from that incident. Of course, Private Ranaudo lost his battle and has moved on, but the battle will continue for Private Paul Warren and his family. It will require great courage and strength for him to move forward and recreate and reconstruct his life with the disability that he now faces. I know that he has that courage and strength and he is well supported by his wonderful family. We should also remember that, on top of the 11 fatalities that we have suffered in Afghanistan, there have also been 78 wounded. We should not forget that and we should also salute the service of these individuals who are going to be living with the legacy of their service in Afghanistan for the rest of their lives. Whatever help the community and the government can provide to these individuals should be provided. We thank them for their sacrifice and service as much as we thank those who have lost their lives. I also thank the Dutch medical team in Afghanistan who rendered service to our personnel, the American medical team in Germany and, of course, and in particular, the colleagues of Private Ranaudo and Private Warren who rendered such life-saving emergency assistance on the spot of the incident. I was also deeply impressed by the fact that at the funeral of Private Ranaudo, Felix Sher, the father of Private Greg Sher, attended to render what comfort and support he could to the family of Private Ranaudo. It shows what a wonderful family they are. I continue to be incredibly impressed by the way they support our men and women in the ADF and the support they have provided to their fellow sufferers in the losses that they endure. It emphasises that, if they can maintain that strength in the face of the direct loss and suffering that they have endured, how much more so should we maintain the course, stay the course, and continue to endure in the face of these losses in order to achieve success and honour the memory of these brave soldiers. Today we will be talking about Ted Kenna. I look back at that great generation who fought in World War II, and it is interesting to note that we suffered nearly 40,000 fatalities in the course of World War II over a long period of nearly six years. That generation bore that struggle, that sacrifice and that suffering and delivered us from one of the greatest, most malevolent forces of evil the world has ever seen. Today, of course, we are confronted with a similar long-running, enduring task against a similarly malevolent and evil force. No-one should be under any misapprehension about what we face with these Islamic extremists. In no sense should their tenets, their beliefs, be tolerated by democracies around this world. They have an agenda which is absolutist and denies basic humanity and basic human rights. Fundamental tenets of gender inequity are at the source of their beliefs as well as other measures of intolerance to diversity and religious belief. It is a struggle, therefore, that we must endure and continue to fight for, because it is important for that region. There are obvious issues and implications for the whole of Central Asia in relation to Afghanistan and Pakistan’s stability, and we must stay that course. Although we focus on a security challenge that is confronting at the moment, and there is no guarantee of success, there have been improvements in the situation in Afghanistan. In Oruzgan province alone in the time that ISAF has been there, we have seen the number of children in school rising from 12,000 to 50,000. We have seen 100 health centres open. We have 100 doctors, up from two previously, and the infant mortality rate has dropped from a horrendous 36 per cent to 25 per cent. In these key areas where success will ultimately be achieved, in the MAIN COMMITTEE social, economic and political areas, some progress is being made. A whole range of areas, of course, still remain to be tackled-good governance and the rule of law, where this battle will ultimately be won. But it should be emphasised that we are not in fact facing a war on terror here; we are facing a war on ignorance. Doing as much as we can to deliver a new generation of educated Afghanis with equal opportunity will be how we ultimately achieve success in that country, and not just while our troops are there but in our ongoing engagement with them long after. In that respect, the Australian government, fully recognising that, has committed significant resources to that effort. At the last conference we committed $250 million to address those very areas, adding to commendable commitments made by the previous government in this respect. I thank Private Ranaudo for his service, for his life, for his contribution to this country. In particular now, to his surviving family, we acknowledge and salute their sacrifice and their enduring commitment to this country. We pass our condolences to them. We shall continue to provide whatever support we can to them, and all Australians should continue to recognise their ongoing suffering and provide whatever support and comfort they can bring. Ranaudo. This is not the first time that we have stood here to reflect on the life and the contribution made to this nation by a serviceman who has lost his life, and it is likely that it will not be the last. The death of Private Benjamin Ranaudo and the cause he died for is evidence that sometimes you just have to fight for what you believe in and for the freedom of others. In the days after Private Ranaudo’s death, the Chief of the Defence Force, Angus Houston, warned that the withdrawal of Australian and other coalition troops could leave the way open for the Taliban resuming control of Afghanistan, and that is a warning worth heeding. For those who did not know Private Benjamin Ranaudo, perhaps on hearing of his death there would have been no more than a passing moment of regret for most Australians. That is also a tragedy, because there should be a greater appreciation of those who lay down their lives for this nation and the causes for which Australia fights. I would like to take this opportunity to speak on two aspects of his sacrifice. Firstly, I would say that I did not know Private Ranaudo, but what I do know is that he was a son, a brother, a partner and a soldier. His life will always, of course, have its greatest meaning to his family and his friends. Ben Ranaudo cannot be replaced for his family and those who knew him. His loss will be a defining moment in the life of his family and for those closest to him. His death is an event that they will have to endure for the rest of their lives. Beyond the grief and loss that his family and friends will endure, the people of this nation should also reflect on the big issues. In Afghanistan the coalition, the Afghan national army and our troops oppose the Taliban. The Taliban are Islamic extremists and fundamentalists. They are extremists who would see the subjugation of women, extremists who would impose restrictions on Afghani society. They would withdraw democracy and impose their hardline religious law to control the people, just like they did last time they ruled Afghanistan. Their world is what most of us would consider a bad version of the Dark Ages. They would also extend their warped view of the world on to Pakistan, and they are still fighting there to achieve that right now. Their allies also seek similar control elsewhere in the world. They cannot be reasoned with, as they see negotiation as a weakness to be exploited. The reality is that these sorts of people continue only until they are stopped by someone who is prepared to fight and defeat them. When I talk of ‘someone’, I talk of young and courageous men like Private Ranaudo and the men who already have given their lives for this cause in Afghanistan. That ‘someone’ also comprises those who are still there and are out on patrol or preparing for a patrol as we speak, fighting for a cause to defend the weak and protect the liberty of the people of Afghanistan-a cause where young children will, hopefully, be able to grow up with opportunities and freedoms something like what we have in Australia. If we did not have nations prepared to fight and courageous and honourable young men like Private Ben Ranaudo then the forces of extremism and oppression would eventually dominate the whole world. That world would live under religious law, the women would be denied an education and would be forced to cover themselves completely, and there ultimately would be no democracy. It is absolutely true that if Ben Ranaudo and the soldiers of this and other coalition countries were not prepared to risk their lives then we would not have this country the way we enjoy it. That is the reason that Private Ranaudo put his life on the line and that is a cause worth fighting for. It remains my view that no number of casualties will ever be acceptable. We do not want any of our soldiers to die in Afghanistan and we did not want Ben Ranaudo to die, yet we must be prepared to continue the fight and stand by our allies in that fight. If we withdraw or take a step back then those who oppose freedom and democracy will step forward into that space. Until at last we stand in Australia, and we have no choice but to fight. As Winston Churchill once said at another time, ‘you had the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, but you will still have war.’ That is a lesson for those who think the Taliban and Islamic extremists will listen to reason. They will not listen and they are not misunderstood; they can only be fought. MAIN COMMITTEE",136,Condolences
167,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (10.52 Am),"I rise to add my comments on the life and sacrifice of Private BenI pay tribute to Private Ben Ranaudo, who made the supreme sacrifice in defence of the weak and for the cause of freedom and democracy. He was a great Australian and will never be forgotten. His life was not given in vain, and his family, I am sure, has the thanks of more than one grateful nation. Minister’s motion of condolence, a motion which, appropriately when unanimously supported, will express the House’s regret at the loss of Private Benjamin Ranaudo. Private Ranaudo gave his life while serving in Afghanistan with Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force 2. He was a member of the Townsville based 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment. As Defence Minister, I was in Townsville with the Chief of Army to send off Private Ranaudo and the men and women who make up MRTF2. That is one of the many reasons I have chosen to speak on this very important motion. Australian defence ministers face many challenges and burdens, but none is greater than the arrival of news of the loss of a member of the ADF on operations. Being part of a government decision to send young Australians into harm’s way brings a unique feeling of responsibility, but the sense of grief felt by a defence minister pales into insignificance when compared to the grief felt by the loved ones and friends of the fallen soldier. I do not believe I have had the pleasure and honour of meeting with them, but I expressed my deepest sympathy to Private Ranaudo’s mother, Jennifer, his father, Angelo, his stepfather, Terry, his partner, Haylee, and his sisters Amy and Hayley. If Private Ranaudo’s loved ones are like those of the fallen soldiers I have met then I know that they will be finding strength in the fact that he was a highly skilled and dedicated soldier but also, just as importantly, the fact that he believed in what he was doing and understood and appreciated the risks. One of the many things that stand out when you attend a military funeral is the support the fallen soldier had from his immediate family and their understanding and appreciation of his understanding of what he was doing, his belief in what he was doing and his full appreciation of the significant risks involved. Believing in what you are doing is a very, very important thing. It is important to both soldier and minister. I, like the volunteer men and women of the Australian Defence Force, believe in what we are doing in Afghanistan. We are there for at least three very important reasons. First and foremost is that we are there to protect Australia and Australians. I do not need to make the case in this place that terror born in Afghanistan directly threatens Australia and Australians. That is an incontestable fact. The second reason we are there, and it is not often talked about, is that we are there as part of an alliance commitment. On 11 September 2001, the American homeland came under attack. Rightly, ANZUS was invoked and we joined with our partners in a response to that attack, in the same way that Australians would expect our US partners to come to our aid if we found ourselves in similar circumstances. I think that is a very important point. The third reason we are there-and it goes, in many ways, to the first reason-is to build an economy in Afghanistan, to bring the people of that war-torn country out of poverty and to protect them from the worse excesses of Islamic extremism. It is important that we not only believe in why we are in Afghanistan but also believe we can achieve our objectives there. I acknowledge that there are many who do not believe we can meet with success in Afghanistan, and of course they are entitled to their view. Certainly, the challenges are enormous and at times seem insurmountable. But I disagree. Afghanistan, in my view, is a beast capable of being tamed. I certainly would not be part of a decision to maintain our troop presence in Afghanistan if I did not believe that were the case. I know that Private Ranaudo and the 10 Australians who gave their lives before him believed in our prospects of success-I should say 12 Australians, if we keep in mind, appropriately, Rifleman Nash, an Australian who died serving with British forces, and all those who have been wounded in Afghanistan. Our collective determination now must be to ensure that they did not give their lives in vain and those who have been severely wounded did not have those wounds inflicted on them in vain. We will meet with success in Afghanistan if: (1) all the parties share our determination to meet with success rather than, if you like, go through the paces as part of a NATO alliance commitment; (2) the objective is realistic, and of course the objective is to ensure that we stabilise Afghanistan, protect the democratic processes there and build the capacity of the Afghan government to enforce their own rule of law and their own security; (3) we have sufficient troops and capability; we cannot win the military campaign without sufficient troop numbers and the right capability; and (4) if we have the right strategy-a proper marrying of the military, political and capacity building efforts. When I say political, I do not just mean reconciliation within the country; I mean effectively dealing with those significant issues outside Afghanistan in places like Pakistan. It might sound like a bit of a cliche, but it is true: Afghanistan is a battle for the hearts and minds of the local people. We will meet with success in stabilising Afghanistan when the vast majority of the Afghan people believe that the economic, social and democratic model we are offering as a partnership is better than that being offered MAIN COMMITTEE",139,Condolences
168,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (10.57 Am),"Like those who have spoken before me, I rise to support the Primeby any other individual or group. They must believe that we are there for the right reasons and that is to improve their country, to raise living standards and, again, to protect them, the population, from the worse excesses of Islamic extremism. On the operational front, our troops are there simultaneously disrupting the work of the Taliban and building the capacity of both the Afghan National Army and the Afghan national police. It is very important work and it is work they are doing very, very well indeed-exceptionally well-and as members of parliament we should all, collectively, be proud of them. Today we think of Private Ranaudo and his loved ones. We also think of Private Paul Warren, who was severely wounded in the same incident. I acknowledge the presence of the Reverend Peter Rose in the gallery today. He has just left us but has been here for the majority of this debate. Reverend Peter Rose is the chaplain to the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. His presence is welcome but also reminded me of the words of a padre or minister at the funeral of Lance Corporal Jason Marks at Holsworthy Barracks. He said, I thought very astutely and quite succinctly-and they may not have been original words on his part, I am not sure, but I appreciated them, particularly coming from a person in his position-that he believed peace is worth fighting for and I agree. Unfortunately military operations are sometimes unavoidable. What we are doing in Afghanistan is very important both to the Afghan people and to the broader international community. I believe in what we are doing. I know that Private Ranaudo believed in what he was doing. I know all men and women of the Australian Defence Force who are serving there, or have served there, believe in what they are doing, and they are deserving of the highest admiration of all members of this parliament and the broader Australian community. name and the inheritance of a great example. Private Benjamin Ranaudo is indeed a great example to all Australians. It is with great pride mixed with tremendous sadness that I rise to honour another fallen warrior. Benjamin Ranaudo was farewelled by fellow diggers in Tarin Kowt in southern Afghanistan, the 11th Australian soldier killed in Afghanistan. He was killed by an improvised explosive device. He was serving in the Baluchi Valley, north of Tarin Kowt, at the time. The 22-year-old was the fifth Australian to die from an IED blast. A cortege of vehicles, including one carrying Benjamin Ranaudo’s flag-draped casket, passed between a line of diggers to carry our fallen comrade home. He was serving with the 1st Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment, a battalion I know well, having served with a sister battalion as a very young platoon commander with the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment. I know it is with great sadness that the commanding officer and the men of 1RAR farewelled one of their warriors. It is always a solemn ramp ceremony when one of our fallen men comes home, killed in battle fighting for what he believes. The regimental sergeant major, Warrant Officer Darren Murch, spoke glowingly of Private Ranaudo. He spoke of a man being a pleasure to be around and one who displayed the true qualities of an Australian soldier. We must never forget-not in this place, not in any place-that Benjamin Ranaudo fought for us. He fought for a freedom that we value and that we wish to extend. We must never forget that the battle in Afghanistan is one of the front-line battles for Western civilisation as we know it. It is a battle to rebuild a nation, to restore a democracy, to remove a safe haven from those who would seek to convert it to an extremist form of government completely incompatible with our way of life-a form of government they wish to see extended throughout the world. The battle in Afghanistan is a forward fight for our Western way of life. It is a fight we must win; it is a fight we will win. It is a battle for the hearts and minds of Afghani people, who do not want to return to an extremist Taliban rule. This is a battle for families-for mums and dads who want to live a life that they have known historically. Let us not forget that Afghani mums, too, love their kids and they want a country where their children can grow up and be educated. They want a country where little girls have the right to go to school and live in a free and fair democracy and where their children do not have to live in fear of warlords subjugating them into a slavery of fighting for a dictatorial regime and an extremist view of government. We are fighting to reconstruct a nation so that it can no longer be used as a safe haven for terrorism. The fight is a worthwhile fight. It enjoys bipartisan support across the political divide, as it should. It is a fight we will continue until it is won, in concert with our allies and partners. It is a fight that Private Benjamin Ranaudo paid the ultimate price for. He laid down his life for a fight he believed in. There is a saying attributed to George Orwell that we sleep safe in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm. If freedom is indeed the sure possession of those who alone have the courage to defend it, then may I suggest that Ben Ranaudo stands tall in our nation’s history. He joins 10 other warriors who have laid down their lives in Afghanistan, because they had the courage to defend the freedom many of us take for granted. MAIN COMMITTEE",140,Condolences
169,Mr Robert (Fadden) (11.07 Pm),"Benjamin Disraeli said that the legacy of heroes is the memory of a greatI conclude, as I so often have in this place, in the great tradition of an ancient warrior, statesman and king, Pericles, who founded the great Athenian empire 2,500 years ago and led that nation during the first two years of the Peloponnesian War. He said: What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments, but what is woven into the lives of others. When we look at Facebook and see Private Ranaudo’s partner’s comments, when we hear the accolades from peers and superiors alike; when we see the public’s reaction to another warrior, another brave ANZAC, the son of those who have gone before us, it inspires us to know that heroism remains alive. It inspires us to know that young Australian men continue to fight, that young Australian men and women continue to serve because we uphold freedom as a fundamental, sacred right in this country and we are prepared to fight to ensure that freedom remains. Private Ranaudo has indeed left behind something significant woven into the lives of others. His sacrifice has indeed touched lives, and this place will not forget that. ness that I rise to speak on Private Benjamin Ranaudo. On his first tour to Afghanistan, at the young age of 22, Private Ranaudo made the ultimate sacrifice for his nation on 18 July when he was killed by an antipersonnel explosive device. Private Ranaudo was a local Ferntree Gully boy in my electorate of La Trobe. He had been a student of both St Johns in Boronia and St Josephs College in Ferntree Gully. On the day of his funeral I spoke to his Principal, Vin Feeney, who remembers Private Ranaudo as a fantastic student and a young person who just wanted to serve his country and be a soldier. At Private Ranaudo’s funeral, which I had the great honour and privilege to attend, he was described as a loving family man and a dedicated and professional Australian soldier. I found it rather compelling and daunting that there were so many young soldiers at the funeral. It fills one with great pride to see these young men and women serving our country with such honour and dignity but, at the same time, it kind of haunts you to realise how young our men and women are when they actually join the Army to serve our great country. Private Ranaudo’s career was one of distinction. He was a member of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment based in Townsville. In Afghanistan, he was a member of the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force. His death is another very tragic reminder of the terrible dangers our troops face in Afghanistan. Our young men and women are doing a brilliant job, working under the toughest of conditions. I applaud them and thank them. They too will be feeling the immense loss of Private Ranaudo. At this point, I would like to pass on my thoughts to Private Paul Warren, who was badly injured in the same incident. We should never forget the sacrifice that Paul Warren has made for his country. Private Ranaudo demonstrated those finest of qualities that make our Australian soldiers so greatprofessionalism, bravery, mateship and sacrifice. It is clear from the statements made by Private Ranaudo’s family that he was a soldier who believed that what he was doing was the right thing to do. His family said, ‘Benjamin was a proud soldier. He believed in what he did.’ From what I heard that day, he was a soldier’s soldier. We fight terrorism because we believe in our freedoms, we believe in democracy and we believe in our liberties. Private Ranaudo sacrificed his life for these ideals and we must not allow his sacrifice to be in vain. We will continue the fight with his great sacrifice in our hearts and minds. I express my deepest condolences to the Ranaudo family-father Angelo, mother Jennifer, stepfather Terry, big sister Amy and younger sister HayleyRose-and other close family members. Also, my condolences go to Private Ranaudo’s girlfriend, Haylee, to his friends and to all those who knew him. He sounded like an amazing mate to have and a great friend when you needed someone to support you. I want to particularly say to Private Ranaudo’s parents, during this time of terrible loss, that I hope that it is of some comfort to you to know that your son has served this nation with courage and distinction and that he will never be forgotten. Indeed, he is in the hearts, minds and prayers of millions of Australians who are grateful for the sacrifice he has made. He has served this nation fighting terrorists in Afghanistan in order to ensure security in his home country and also around the globe and for that, as a nation, we will always be indebted to you.

171,Mr Morrison (Cook) (11.19 Am),"The Sutherland shire community, which I am proud to represent in thisby RSL members. Miranda RSL sub-branch President Warren Barnes was a long-time friend of Ned and his wife Marjorie and served as Ted’s aide de camp on his visits. Warren fondly recalled how Ned always took the time to meet and chat with RSL members and how he particularly enjoyed the strong sense of camaraderie which has become a hallmark of the Miranda club. Ned’s old Army unit, the 2nd/4th Battalion of 1939 to 1945, also has a connection with the shire: the Sutherland Army Reserve unit, the 4th/3rd Battalion Royal New South Wales Regiment, wears the white and green of Ted’s old battalion and continues to serve in the best spirit of diggers like Ned. The last surviving Victoria Cross winner from World War II, Ned was a national hero, though he wore that badge reluctantly and remained a humble country boy. Ned earned his Victoria Cross in Wewak, New Guinea on 15 May 1945 when he put himself in grave danger in order to save the lives of his mates. On that day, Ned singlehandedly engaged an enemy machine gun post that had pinned down his unit, all the while under direct fire from enemy soldiers. Despite the terrific danger and a seemingly hopeless situation, Ned did not flinch and instead successfully ended the threat from the Japanese, saving the lives of his mates in the process. When I was recently with my colleague and friend the member for Blaxland walking the Kokoda Track-and we think particularly of those at the moment who are in grave danger on that track, and their families-one of the things that both of us, I think, came to a completely new appreciation of was the bravery of those who fought there, particularly those who were awarded the Victoria Cross. On that occasion we were reflecting on the life of Bruce Kingsbury and today, here, we pay our respects to Ted Kenna. One of the things that the young people who were with us said as they walked that track was how much more they wanted to know about heroes like Bruce Kingsbury and heroes we read about and know of from our own shire, like Ted Kenna. I think those of us here in this place but also those who sit in state parliaments around the country have a responsibility to ensure that in our national school curricula and in our communities we tell these stories. We are the generation linking those great heroes of Australia, and it is our responsibility to ensure that the generations that follow us have the benefit of our first-hand experience of hearing their stories. SoI would encourage all of us to do that, in memory and in tribute and in honour of those such as Ted Kenna who paid a deep price for their battles-some the ultimate price. Fortunately, Ted went on to live a long and fruitful life, but his sacrifice was no less in terms of his courage on that day. It is up to us, I think, to be that linking generation, to pass on these stories and make sure that the honour that is due is given and that it does not happen just in a place like this today but that these stories live on and on. We can celebrate those stories as great stories of courage. Young people are incredibly inspired not by the horrors of war but by the qualities and purity that it brought out in these ordinary men who did incredible, extraordinary things. They are inspired to think about what is within themselves. As we walked the track with our own young people, we saw the same sorts of qualities, and seeing that gives us great hope for the future. As we remember Ted Kenna, we say thanks to Ted Kenna for a life well lived, for a service well performed and for an example well made to all the rest of us. I think we can speak volumes in celebration of all of those things. We know that weeks later, after his heroism, Ted’s fortunes changed when he was shot in the mouth. Ted was cared for by the legendary fuzzy wuzzy angels before being evacuated to Australia, where he met his future wife, who was nursing him back to health. Next month Miranda RSL will hold a special commemoration service for Ned which I will be proud to attend and which will no doubt provide a fitting tribute to a man who served his country bravely and proudly and who touched the lives of so many club members. Ted is survived by his wife, Marjorie, four children, 12 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren. I can think of no greater legacy than that. On behalf of the Sutherland shire community I thank Ted for his service to our nation and for his wonderful contribution to the Sutherland shire. Lest we forget. great Australian, a man who many years ago showed amazing courage in the face of great adversity but who also, after that time, proved, as has been said by some who have won Victoria Crosses and many who have dealt with those who have, that it is one thing to win one; it is another thing to be able to wear one in subsequent years and to do it justice. Ted Kenna was such a man. Not only did he win his Victoria Cross with a display of great valour in circumstances which could have ended in personal disaster but he then became an example to all Australians in his deportment over the years. He was an ordinary man who did extraordinary things and who lived up to the extraordinary responsibility that he had as one of Australia’s fewer than 100 Victoria Cross winners-one of only 20 from World War II. He is the last of our 20 Victoria Cross winners from World War II to pass on, and so this is the closMAIN COMMITTEE",142,Private Edward Ted Kenna Vc
172,Mr Griffin (Bruce,"Minister for Veterans’ Affairs) (11.24 am)-I again join with others to acknowledge aing of an era. There are many World War II veterans left, but Ted was the last one left who had received the Victoria Cross. Much has been said about his act of bravery on that day. I would like to focus on just a small part of that and relate it to the proceedings at his state funeral at St Patrick’s Cathedral on Thursday, 16 July. One of the speakers on that occasion was Major General Gordon Maitland. Major General Maitland is a very impressive man in his own right, and on that day he delivered an astoundingly dignified address. I note the member for Berowra is nodding and I am sure he knows Major General Maitland from his travels. Major General Maitland went through the circumstances around Ted’s winning of the Victoria Cross and his deportment since. I will focus on one element of what Major General Maitland said; I will paraphrase him because I cannot do his words justice. His point, which he illustrated so clearly, was that Ted and his men knew that in the circumstances they were in at that time, pinned down by machine gun fire, action had to be taken and someone had to take that action. Ted was the Bren gunner for that platoon, and his responsibility, given he was carrying the firepower for the platoon, was to act. As Major General Maitland said, there was never any doubt that Ted would do so, and the fact that he did so so successfully and was able to win the day and save the lives of so many of his comrades was a tremendous example of the courage that he displayed. But Ted was a modest man about his award and he was quoted around the time as saying that it was more about the mates that he served alongside. He said: … the boys at the time, it belongs as much to them as it does me. He revelled in his return after his shooting, firstly in the not well-known but outstandingly poignant love story of how he met his wife, Marjorie. She nursed him when he first came back with horrific injuries, and they then formed a lifelong partnership, which bore four children and was obviously the most important part of his life. Again, in good old-fashioned Australian style, he could always joke about it, suggesting that Marjorie had wooed him rather than the other way around. That is an Australian male talking, isn’t it! His funeral was well attended, as it should have been. It was attended by significant elements of our military, of our returned services community and of the broader community. It was a suitable testament to his exemplary service both in the military at the time and subsequently as an Australian icon. I had the privilege of meeting him only once, at the footy about 10 years ago, but I will always remember the opportunity I had to shake his hand on that occasion. He had not been well of late and the circumstances of his passing were not entirely unexpected. He left at the age of 90, having lived a very full life-a life that brought him and his family great credit and a life that, in many ways, encapsulated all that over the years has been good about the ANZAC spirit. He was a man who did great things when they were required, at a time when his mates needed him. He was a truly great Australian, a man it was my very great pleasure to meet, and a man who did great honour to his name. nursing home aged 90. Quite a few Australians died on that day, as they do almost every day, mostly of old age. On that day Ted Kenna’s death was more than just a loss to his family; it was a great loss to Australia because Ted Kenna was also known as Private Edward Kenna VC. He was one of very few men to have distinguished themselves in the field of battle at the highest level possible. While the Victoria Cross medal is emblazoned simply with the words ‘For valour’, those words somewhat understate the character of those that receive the medal. Any walk through the Australian War Memorial’s VC hall and a reading of the citations demonstrates that the men who won these medals were uncommon and displayed the highest level of personal courage in the face of certain death. Indeed, when we read Ted Kenna’s citation we must surely question how anyone survived the bullets of the enemy when standing so fully exposed to their fire. Part of his citation reads: On his own initiative and without orders Private Kenna stood up immediately in full view of the enemy less than 50 yards away and engaged the bunker, firing his Bren gun from his hip. The enemy machine gun immediately returned Kenna’s fire with such accuracy that bullets actually passed between his arms and body. Undeterred, he remained completely exposed and continued to fire at the enemy until his magazine was exhausted. Still making a target of himself, Private Kenna discarded his Bren gun and called for a rifle. Despite the intense machine gun fire, he seized the rifle and, with amazing coolness, killed the gunner with his first round. A second automatic weapon opened fire on Private Kenna from a different position and another of the enemy immediately tried to move into position behind the first machinegun, but Private Kenna remained standing and killed him with his next round. The result of Private Kenna’s magnificent bravery in the face of concentrated fire, was that the bunker was captured without further loss, and the company attack proceeded to a successful conclusion, many enemy being killed and numerous automatic weapons captured. The citation says in conclusion: MAIN COMMITTEE",143,Private Edward Ted Kenna Vc
173,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (11.30 Am),"On Wednesday, 8 July 2009, Edward (Ted) Kenna died in a GeelongThere is no doubt that the success of the company attack would have been seriously endangered and many casualties sustained but for Private Kenna’s magnificent courage and complete disregard for his own safety. His action was an outstanding example of the highest degree of bravery. The reports of witnesses that suggest that enemy bullets flew through his clothes without striking him are somewhat easy to believe, given the number of rounds fired and the fact that he was not wounded in the fight. So many of those VC citations are similar: when you hear what was done, it is difficult to believe that the soldier was not killed in the fight when you think that, by all reckoning, he should have been. Fortunately, Ted Kenna was not killed on that day, 15 May 1945, and he lived on to be an inspiration to this country. He was severely wounded three weeks later, shot in the mouth, and he spent the next year recovering. It was during that time that he met his future wife Marjorie Rushberry, whom he married in 1947. They had two sons and two daughters. At the time of his death, he was a father of four, grandfather of 12 and great-grandfather of 15. He is survived by Marjorie, his wife of 62 years. In speaking about Ted Kenna, family and friends have a consistent memory of his life. He was humble, an all round family man, and a solid and reliable friend. The view of those that knew him is very clear: men do not come much better than Ted Kenna VC. His death marks a sad time for Australia, but who he was, what he did and his commitment to this nation will never be forgotten. Dr KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (11.34 am)-What a privilege it is for us to be here today to speak in support this motion of condolence for Private Edward Kenna VC. When he passed away on 8 July, in that period there was a lot of mesmerisation in the world about the passing of Michael Jackson, but I have to confess that that certainly was not my focus. Certainly also for a number of Australians the focus was firmly on the passing of Ted Kenna. It was important for us to do so because it was one of those indelibly sad but important days in our history. It was important because Ted Kenna symbolises and illustrates so much of what is important for us to value, to honour and to emulate in this country. I heard today the member for Paterson talking about a poem which talked about various professions who owed soldiers various things. It is important for us to remember that so much of our military history is actually about people from those professions becoming soldiers to achieve those things. The history and tradition of the citizen soldier in this country is part of its proudest history. It is those people, like Ted, a plumber from country Victoria, who pick up that challenge and then go away and do incredibly extraordinary things that really tend to help us understand some of the special qualities that we should value in this country and in our society. I guess those of us who come from rural and regional Australia will readily identify those characters that we find in our country towns and communities who have so much of that spirit of sticking their hands up, volunteering and community service. That was Ted. Before he joined up in the second AIF Ted had been part of the civilian military forces. He had been a reservist. He had already been part of that contribution to his community in so many ways, including in that military respect. There was a bit of hesitation on Ted’s part when the Second World War broke out because he was a bit reluctant to take orders-which is, of course, another characteristic of Australians. The essence of that is the quality of Australians that gives rise to their ability to use their initiative, which has served us so well in so many circumstances. We have heard details of the battle that Ted was involved in-an incredible act of courage. That was just one layer of what was an incredibly difficult experience for all of our soldiers in New Guinea, given the terrain, the conditions and the diseases that they had to endure. On top of that, they had to engage in such deadly, vicious and brutal combat against an enemy that knew no bounds in its brutality-that great, malevolent evil against which they fought. He does illustrate how important it is for individuals to stand up and do that. So much of our history has depended upon these individuals who are prepared to take on these acts of courage, sometimes in the face of opposition from colleagues. Madam Deputy Speaker Moylan, you probably understand that experience. It is so important for us to honour and emulate that experience. In the battle in which he participated he also saved the lives of his colleagues. That Australian understatement was again illustrated when his colleagues turned to him and said merely, ‘Good shooting, Ted,’ when he saved their lives and resolved that situation. I talked about the evil that he fought against. It was a privilege to be, along with the member for Berowra, at the Burwood ceremony for the Sandakan incident-or atrocity-during World War II. Nothing illustrates more the evil that these soldiers were fighting against in that very episode. I mentioned earlier that had 40,000 fatalities in World War II, nearly 2,000 of those in that Sandakan incident. This certainly was an important cause for this country that these soldiers were engaged in. Not long after this incident, we know that Ted was severely injured due to an explosive bullet round into his mouth. He was told at the time that he was likely to die, and his response to that was simply, ‘Pigs!’ Nothing could illustrate the man more than that comment. There was a little personal connection for me in Ted’s subsequent history, in that, during his time in Heidelberg hospital, my grandfather was also in MAIN COMMITTEE Heidelberg hospital recovering from his severe malnutrition and conditions that he had acquired as a prisoner of the Japanese on the Burma-Thai railway. They shared that time together in Heidelberg hospital. Ted, in his laconic way, described how that was to his benefit, because, as was mentioned by the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, he met his wonderful wife, Marjorie, there. What a special woman she must have been, and still is, but particularly at that time. Ted did not receive his Victoria Cross until 1947, so there is no question of him having been a celebrity in hospital at that time, and the wounds that he suffered were terribly disfiguring. Nevertheless, Marjorie was able to see past all that and formed a relationship with Ted which was to endure for over half a century and which produced four wonderful children, 12 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. So what a special woman Marjorie is. We should also take this opportunity to pay tribute to her at this time. I mentioned that Ted was a great contributor to society in general, and that is what we should also acknowledge here-not just those moments of his great feats in battle. It is important to note that Ted received the Centenary Medal for his services to veterans-a decoration that was created in 2001 by the previous government. Ted was one of the first recipients of that medal for his services to veterans. That in itself illustrates what kind of man he was. As we know, famously, he also received the Victoria Cross. It is interesting that often that decoration subsequently becomes a cross to bear. It is funny how a soldier will go through extreme situations of tension, terror and risk to life and then we impose added expectations on them when they receive this decoration. Our expectation requires them to be role models in their subsequent life. But Ted bore all that with incredible good grace and fulfilled all the expectations that we have of our Victoria Cross holders. I conclude by pointing to the single most important thing in this. We are currently, as I mentioned earlier, engaged in a similar struggle against a malevolent evil which requires the same dedication, endurance and commitment that that great generation delivered. It is very important for us to be worthy of that great generation in our ongoing commitment and support of not only our veterans and their families but also the soldiers who continue to serve, and we must maintain our solidarity in the face of this great challenge. tralian Victoria Cross recipient of World War II, who recently passed away at the age of 90 years. He was a unique Australian. His bravery in the face of great personal danger must never be forgotten. Ted Kenna was awarded the Victoria Cross for action in Wewak, New Guinea, on 15 May 1945. When coming under heavy fire, he defeated a Japanese machine-gun crew. His action made it possible for his company’s attack to succeed. Having spent time in Wewak myself, I can only imagine the challenges that he would have faced. The tropical climate is a unique challenge in itself, but add to that an enemy in jungle warfare. Ted needs to be honoured. There is no greater act of courage than to risk your own life to save the lives of your mates. His decision to run directly into enemy fire, knowing he could face his own death at any moment, would have required extraordinary valour and courage. Edward-known as Ted-Kenna was born in Hamilton, Victoria, on 6 July 1919. After completing his education in his home town, he became a plumber. In August 1940 he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and served in the 23/21st Battalion. In June 1943 his unit was disbanded and he was assigned to the 2/4th Battalion and embarked to New Guinea in October 1944. Ted Kenna’s actions in the New Guinea campaign epitomise the ANZAC spirit. He was among the bravest of the brave in that great generation of Australians who fought to defend our freedoms in Europe, Asia and on our doorstep. As we know, the Victoria Cross is awarded for the most conspicuous bravery, a daring act of valour or selfsacrifice or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy. Today is an opportunity for us to honour Ted Kenna, his life, his courage and his commitment to his fellow soldiers. After the war, as has been mentioned today, Ted returned to Hamilton with his wife, Marjorie, and raised their four children. I can only imagine that when Marjorie was tending to Ted their relationship would have blossomed and I am sure that Marjorie saw that Ted was a unique man with a great heart. Today we see the legacy that they both left. Ted continued to salute the ANZAC tradition and regularly attended many Victoria Cross reunions in London and the annual ANZAC Day parades in Melbourne. His legacy is remembered at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, and in July 2000 he was honoured on a postage stamp as part of the commemoration of Australia’s living VC winners. I would also like to express my heartfelt condolences to his wife Marjorie and to his extended family at this difficult time. His death will be mourned and his memory honoured by all Australians. As much as we remember the passing of a great Australian today, this is an opportunity also to reflect on the contributions of all veterans who gave all to serve their country. I also want to take this opportunity to remind the House of the important and vital contribution of our veteran community in the past, in the present and of course into the future. I remain committed to ensuring that veterans will receive the care and support to which they are entitled. It is a privilege to stand here today and honour such a great Australian.

174,Mrs Markus (Greenway) (11.42 Am),"I join with my colleagues in honouring Ted Kenna VC, the last AusMinister for Climate Change) (11.47 am)-I rise also to extend my sincere condolences to the family of Australia’s last World War II Victoria Cross winner, Ted Kenna, who passed away on Wednesday, 8 July, aged 90 years. In particular, my thoughts go to his wife of 62 years, Marjorie, their sons Robert and Alan, their daughter Marlene and their 12 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren. Ted Kenna represented a very tangible link to one of the most important periods in Australian history. Only once has Australia faced a direct threat to our national sovereignty when the Japanese conquest of South-East Asia and Papua New Guinea left us vulnerable to occupation. For his courageous actions near Wewak in PNG, Ted Kenna was awarded the Victoria Cross. It took the courage, commitment and determination of men like Ted Kenna to restore peace and security to our neighbourhood. With Ted Kenna’s passing, we pause to remember the remaining World War II veterans who proudly served this country. Just touching on some of the actions of Ted Kenna which resulted in his Victoria Cross being awarded, it is important to recall that on 15 May 1945 Private Ted Kenna was a member of Alpha Company of the 2nd/4th Battalion. Their role was to clear the Japanese defenders from Wirui Mission south of Wewak air base on the northern coast of Papua New Guinea. During that mission, Ted Kenna came under heavy machine-gun fire from the Japanese. Risking his life, he stood in clear sight of the enemy and took out two or three machine-gun posts using a Bren gun fired from the hip, then one of his colleague’s rifles. In part, his Victoria Cross citation reads as follows: The result of Private Kenna’s magnificent bravery in the face of concentrated fire was that the bunker was captured without further loss, and the company attack proceeded to a successful conclusion, many enemy being killed and numerous automatic weapons captured. Just three weeks after that battle on 5 June 1945, Ted Kenna was badly wounded in action, sustaining lifethreatening wounds to his face. It was while he was recovering from this injury that he met his wife Marjorie, who was a nurse at the time. Our national values, which underpin the values our army subscribes to, could have been modelled on Ted Kenna, from what we know of his actions. He was a very modest man who rarely spoke of his deeds, yet he set an example of courage and determination that will serve to inspire future generations. Today, we have just two surviving Victoria Cross recipients, who of course represent the highest embodiment of bravery and dedication to duty: Keith Payne VC, who was awarded a Victoria Cross for his service of May 1969 during the Vietnam War, and, most recently, Trooper Mark Donaldson VC, who was awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia in January of this year for his courageous actions in Afghanistan on 2 September 2008. The courage of these men inspires current and future generations of Australians. I send my regards to the family of Ted Kenna. Kenna VC and note that it was just two days after his 90th birthday, on 8 July, that Ted passed away. Ted was a resident of Hamilton, which is in my electorate. He was widely known and highly regarded by many, many people right throughout the region and indeed, as we have heard, right throughout Australia. Ted was an amazing person. He was most unassuming, but one of those people who could display the true qualities of someone who would look after his mates. As we have heard, his act of bravery was quite remarkable. He was the Bren gunner of his platoon and when the platoon was held down, with no hesitation and no thought for his own life, he stood up in full view of the enemy and cleared the machine gun post that was holding down the platoon. When the Bren gun ran out of ammunition, he then called for and was thrown a .303, with which he continued to do the job of taking out the machine gun post. The story is remarkable in that he did not even flinch when bullets were not only passing between his arm and his body but in fact went through his shirt leaving holes in it. Ted’s valour is an extraordinary story, but, in his most unassuming way, he would never claim to have done anything more than was expected of him. It was also recorded that he was promoted temporarily from the rank of private to lance corporal, a position he was not comfortable with, and in fact he asked to return to the rank of private. As the rest of the story goes he was very badly wounded. Nonetheless his example has stood as something that is highly regarded. The thing about Ted as a remarkable Australian is that he had a very strong commitment to veterans, not only locally but right throughout Australia. In his later years he made a great effort and travelled a lot to try to assist other veterans. His other great commitment to the community in later life was to visit schools. Again, he made a great impression on many young people by talking to them in his own laconic way about some of his experiences, helping them to have a better understanding of the contribution that so many made during World War II, particularly in the Pacific theatre.

176,Mr Hawker (Wannon) (11.51 Am),"I too would like to recognise the incredible contribution of Private TedHe was always unassuming and when questioned about his experiences, as his daughter, Marlene Day, said, he was modest when he talked about his own Victoria Cross, which he was awarded for gallantry. Ms Day said: He’s always said to me that he’s proud to wear it, but he wears it for every soldier because he says everyone contributes to those sorts of things. That really encapsulates Ted. That is the way he was. He did not want to be glorified for what he did; he felt that he was just doing it to try to help his mates. There were, of course, a couple of other things about Ted. He was a very good footballer. After the war, when he recovered from his injuries, he took up football again locally, and in the 1947 grand final, in the Western Border Football League, Ted was playing for Hamilton. The scores were level in the last quarter with the siren about to ring. It is said that Ted ‘just seemed to come out of nowhere from across the ground, kicked a point and Hamilton got its premiership.’ When he was on the ground he was never backward in coming forward. In the eulogy at the state funeral, Major General Maitland told many things about the wonderful activities of Ted, but he spoke in particular of the unfailing humility that kept Ted from ever telling his story in any detail. It was a quality that sat alongside his respect for the supreme award of military bravery. Major General Maitland said, ‘He recognised the stature of being a Victoria Cross holder, but he sought no glamour, no reward. He wore it with empathy and he wore it for all of those who fought with him.’ As he said, he always reckoned he was just doing his job. I have been very fortunate to, in a very small way, be involved in helping Hamilton have a lasting tribute to Ted Kenna. Back in 1988 we arranged to get Sir William Dargie, the famous Australian portrait painter who I think won eight Archibald prizes, to agree to paint Ted Kenna’s portrait, and that now hangs in the Performing Arts Centre in Hamilton in the Ted Kenna room. So we have a lasting memory of Ted Kenna in Hamilton. I can assure colleagues that the people of Hamilton have very fond memories of Ted and the contribution he has made in so many ways, but most of all of course his remarkable bravery during World War II and the award of the Victoria Cross for that wonderful act of bravery. I, like others, would say how much our thoughts are with Marj, his wife, and with his children and grandchildren. VC, who died on 9 July 2009 aged 90-married to his beautiful wife, Marjorie, a father of four, a grandfather of 12 and a great-grandfather of 15. Future generations will ask where I was when the last surviving World War II Victoria Cross recipient died. I will say that I was here in the House speaking about a great Australian-an Australian who was part of the glorious fellowship of the Victoria Cross; a fellowship that knows no race or creed, no boundaries, no age, no nationality; a fellowship joined only by exceptional bravery and heroism; a fellowship that cannot be bought, that cannot be joined, but is only awarded and bestowed for acts so great, for acts so incredibly above what normal human beings would be capable of, that the majority of winners are awarded it posthumously. Those who have received it have done so because of what they have done in times of battle and conflict. Ted was part of the glorious fellowship of the Victoria Cross. By all accounts, and speaking to members here who knew Ted well, he was an incredibly humble man, an ANZAC of the highest order who did not like fuss being made about his achievements. To fight one day and to score that winning goal for Hamilton in a later life says so much about Ted Kenna. And so too does the manner in which he won the VC. I have always contended that you will never truly know an individual’s character until you see them under great pressure, under great stress, and there is no greater stress in life than the field of operational service and, particularly, the field of battle. Ted Kenna, with a company assault in Wewak in Papua New Guinea in 1945, with the assault being held up, stood up, with the enemy no more than 50 metres away-indeed, closer. The enemy’s fire engaged upon him, as you would expect from a target that bobs up in the jungle. Undeterred, he took a Bren gun and engaged the enemy, destroying the opponent and, when running out of ammunition, simply discarded the Bren gun and asked for a rifle while still standing, and he continued to engage, suppressing the enemy position, allowing the company to move forward, and achieving its objective. The accolades regarding Ted Kenna’s achievement speak of bullet holes in his clothing, of rounds passing between arms and body-an incredible act of bravery. I can only imaging the horrors of jungle life in 1945. I have spent a lot of time in PNG. I spent five months in the civil war in Bougainville on one of the islands of PNG, and I have walked the Kokoda Trail. I know first hand the horrors of the jungle but I know nothing of the horrors of the jungle when you are in battle: when you are being shot at; when your equipment is falling off you; when your clothes are in tatters; and when you are hungry, tired and thirsty and engaged in a bitter assault against a numerically superior enemy. This is what Ted Kenna found himself against, and his character grew. In the mettle of that fire his character shone forth in such an impressive way. MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Private Edward Ted Kenna Vc
177,Mr Robert (Fadden) (11.57 Am),"I rise to celebrate and acknowledge the great life of Edward ‘Ted’ KennaThree weeks later this Australian hero was to be shot in the jaw and would spend 10 long days walking out of that forbidding, impenetrable jungle to get back to a first-aid station. Stories recount of a rancid bandage on his face when he finally made it back to some care and first aid. I can only imagine that Ted Kenna would not have complained and would not have been a burden. I suggest he was not carried, I suggest he walked out of that jungle a severely wounded warrior. I find it extraordinarily and incredibly Australian that the first person at the hospital to touch this brave warrior was a nurse, Marjorie, who would later become his wife. The care that that involves is so incredibly Australian. There are only two surviving Australian VC recipients out of the 97 awarded: Vietnam veteran Keith Payne VC and of course our own serving digger, Mark Donaldson VC, who was awarded the Victoria Cross-the first Australian Victoria Cross-for his service in Afghanistan. It is interesting to read the citation to get a feel for the type of character that was Ted Kenna. It reads: On his own initiative and without orders Private Kenna immediately stood up in full view of the enemy less than 50 yards away and engaged the bunker, firing his Bren gun from the hip. He stood up and entrenched the enemy with machine gun fire in a bunker-no sandbags to protect Ted Kenna, just raw Australian courage. The citation continues: The enemy machine gun immediately returned Private Kenna’s fire and with such accuracy that bullets actually passed between his arms and body. This is what you would expect from an enemy with machine guns mounted, sited in a bunker, against a lone Australian standing on his feet. The citation goes on: Undeterred, he remained completely exposed and continued to fire at the enemy until his magazine was exhausted. There are 20 or 30 rounds in a Bren gun magazine. The citation continues: Still making a target of himself, Private Kenna discarded his Bren gun and called for a rifle. Despite the intense machine gun fire, he seized the rifle and, with amazing coolness, killed the gunner with his first round. Ted Kenna could shoot. A second automatic opened fire … from a different position and another enemy immediately tried to move into position behind the first machine gun, but Private Kenna remained standing and killed him with his next round. Two machine gun posts in a jungle, bunkered in and camouflaged, firing at young Ted Kenna, 26 years old, standing up in the jungle. Mr Panter, the surviving member of a dwindling 2/4th Battalion, said that when it was all over Mr Kenna had bullet holes in his pants and shirt. Mr Panter said: He told me then, and always said later, that he just had to do it. Mr Panter went on: Ned reckoned he was the person on the spot and someone had to do something and he just jumped up and without thinking did what he did. That’s what happens in war, you know: ordinary people do extraordinary things and Ned always thought of himself as just an ordinary bloke. History would suggest otherwise. It was an incredible citation for an incredibly brave Australian. In the face of an overwhelming enemy, dug in and entrenched, and against sighted automatic weapons from different positions, Ted Kenna stood up and engaged the enemy. And when the ammunition of his main weapon was extinguished he threw it aside and called for another, still standing. If we knew nothing else about Ted Kenna that alone would tell us something about his character, of his fortitude, of his mettle, of his love for family and friends, and of his care for his mates-held up in a jungle, suppressed by enemy fire. But we know so much more. Through those who knew him and loved him, through those who played footy with him, through his 15 great-grandchildren, his 12 grandchildren and his four children we know a man who was humble and who loved his country; who spent his remaining years serving his nation, going into schools, talking to kids and being the best he could be. We salute Ted Kenna-he is a great Australian. He set a great standard for the ANZAC warriors who today continue to fight for freedom in various battles around the world. Only last week I was privileged to go to East Timor to visit our soldiers there in 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, who form the basis of the international security force, and to meet the Timor Leste Defence Force and the Australian construction team. I salute the commanding officer of 2nd Battalion RAR, Lieutenant Colonel David Smith, for his leadership of his men in Timor Leste and I wish them all a safe tour. I pray that they return quickly to their loved ones, their families and their friends, as I do, likewise, for our forces currently engaged in combat in Afghanistan. Freedom alone is the privilege of those who are prepared to fight for it and defend it. With those words, can I say that Ted Kenna VC is missed. A great warrior has moved on and we shall not forget his heroism, his sacrifice and what he did for the freedom of his nation. MAIN COMMITTEE Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters Report Debate resumed. the 2007 federal election and matters related thereto includes 53 recommendations, many of which are designed to restore and protect the franchise to those entitled to exercise it ,and to modernise electoral processes. That 45 of the 53 recommendations were unanimous reflects the committee’s focus on finding ways that our democracy can work better and the cooperative way that the committee went about conducting the inquiry. Key recommendations on modernising the electoral system include: counting more of the votes cast before polling day on polling night, and facilitating electronic transactions between electors and the Australian Electoral Commission to modernise the way that the commission interacts with electors. The committee has made a number of recommendations that reinstate several long standing provisions that protect the franchise, such as restoring the seven-day enrolment period from the issue of the writs to the close of rolls for the election. Opposition members have opposed the recommendations on the basis that they weaken the integrity of the electoral roll and reward complacency. However, a careful analysis of the integrity argument put forward by opposition members reveals that it is without substance, with the Australian Electoral Commission telling the committee that in relation to false identities there has never been any evidence of widespread or organised enrolment fraud in Australia. Detailed examination by the Australian Electoral Commission reveals that relatively few cases of multiple voting are found to be deliberate attempts to vote on multiple occasions and are referred to the AFP. Only 64 cases of apparent multiple voting were referred to the Australian Federal Police arising from the 2004 election, and only 10 cases were referred following the 2007 election. These figures do not warrant disenfranchising potentially hundreds of thousands of otherwise eligible electors. In relation to prisoners, the committee has recommended that the Commonwealth Electoral Act be amended to reflect the High Court’s Roach decision that all persons serving a sentence of full-time imprisonment are ineligible to vote, reinstating the previous three-year disqualification that applied prior to 2006. The opposition members of the committee have suggested that the disqualification should be set at prisoners serving custodial sentences of one year or more, arguing that this would align the voting disqualification with the disqualification from being a member of parliament. However, a majority of the committee considers that the three-year threshold strikes a better balance. A large number of submissions were received from Australian citizens living overseas who considered that they should be extended the franchise on the basis of their Australian citizenship alone. While such a franchise does exist in a number of countries such as Italy and New Zealand, the committee considers that citizenship should not be the sole qualification for the franchise. A 21-day rule regarding living at an address underpins representation in the 150-member House of Representatives, the basis for deciding which party or parties will form the government of the day. The committee has therefore endorsed the current arrangements relating to registration and updating enrolment, as they provide an appropriate and valid form of measuring a continued interest in Australian political affairs. My personal remarks in the report relating to discontinuing the grandfathering arrangements that extend the franchise to up to 163,000 British subjects who may not be Australian citizens attracted significant comment in the media and to my electoral office. Most of the feedback was supportive of my proposal. Those who opposed discontinuing the grandfathering arrangements pointed to the broader notion of the franchise in some Western democracies, including that British subjects who were not citizens may be able to vote in UK national elections and that noncitizens enjoy the franchise in a number of countries, such as permanent residents in New Zealand. I also received some comments from British subjects who were former veterans, having fought with distinction protecting Australia and our way of life. They were unhappy that, having made significant contributions and sacrifices for our country, they would be excluded from voting should they not take out Australian citizenship. While I understand that some of these views are strongly held, I consider that Australian citizenship should be one of the key elements underpinning the franchise in Australia. With the constitutional links now broken as a result of the Australia Act, High Court judgements that British subjects are ineligible to stand for parliament and the availability of dual citizenship, I do not believe that it is too much to ask that those deciding the future of our country should be Australian citizens. I also believe that there should be an education program and that we should allow another 4½ years for this to take place so that it does not happen overnight. That will allow those people 30 years to take out Australian citizenship without losing their British citizenship. I think that is a fair compromise, because I think the alternative MAIN COMMITTEE",148,Private Edward Ted Kenna Vc
178,Mr Melham (Banks) (12.08 Pm),"by leave-the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report onthat someone who is not an Australian citizen can make the difference in an electorate and a difference as to who forms government is a far worse proposition for this country. With the national rate of enrolment of eligible young people at the 2007 election at 85 per cent, some seven percentage points below the overall eligible population, it is clear that specific efforts need to be made to encourage young people to enrol to vote. A key recommendation of the committee in this area is to facilitate electronic interactions by electors with the AEC, thereby allowing young electors who are more likely to use such a medium to update their enrolment in a timely manner. Another recommendation, aimed at increasing youth participation, is lowering the age for provisional enrolment, from 17 years to 16 years. With some states having a school-leaving age of 17 and many students completing their studies before this age, it makes sense to allow young people to enrol at this age, when they may also be undertaking civics eduction. This approach has also been adopted in the United Kingdom where 16-year-olds can register to vote, despite not being able to vote until they are aged 18. I understand and am appreciative that the committee was unanimous on this point. A complementary recommendation, to reduce the age of provisional enrolment to 16 years, is for the establishment of a schools bounty scheme that would pay schools a small amount for every completed enrolment form returned by the school. The opposition members of the committee have dissented from this recommendation, arguing that no incentive should be required as it is a legal requirement to enrol once you turn aged 18. Further, the opposition members considered that the introduction of a financial inducement to encourage enrolment, however far removed from the individual, represents a corruption of our democratic process. Compulsory enrolment does impose an obligation on individuals, but it also imposes an obligation on the government to facilitate access to our democracy. Should a schools bounty system be adopted, schools can utilise the nominal funding received to enhance civics education activities, such as student councils and participation in youth parliaments and other youth oriented representative bodies. Clearly, such a program would not corrupt our democratic process. Instead, it would provide a genuine opportunity for schools to encourage greater participation in civics education and engagement in the democratic process. In the 2007 election, around 90,000 electors made errors when numbering their House of Representatives ballot paper, resulting in their vote being ruled informal and being excluded from the count. Research by the Australian Electoral Commission, following the 2007 election, found that differences in informality rates across electoral divisions reflected possible confusion on the part of voters, due to differences between federal and state and territory voting systems; a large number of candidates, making it more difficult to number all candidates correctly; and linguistic and cultural barriers experienced by some electors from non-English speaking backgrounds. It is of concern to me that divisions in south-west Sydney continue to record the highest levels of informality. In the divisions of Blaxland and Watson, for example, almost one in 10 votes were ruled informal. In my electorate of Banks, 6.36 per cent of votes cast were ruled informal. This compares to an average informality rate in New South Wales of 4.9 per cent and a national average of 3.9 per cent. While supporting the retention of full preferential voting for House of Representatives elections, the committee has proposed that a savings provision that was included in the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which was used in all elections between 1984 and 1996, be re-instated. This would provide a safety net for electors who make a mistake in completing the numbering on a House of Representatives ballot paper by including ballot papers where there are non-consecutive numbering errors, up to the point at which the numbering errors began. According to the Australian Electoral Commission, up to 90,000 additional votes could have been included in the election count had such a savings provision for House of Representatives votes existed at the 2007 election. It is noteworthy that a similar savings provision continues to apply for electors who make mistakes when completing a Senate ballot paper below the line. Under section 270(1) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, ballot papers on which at least 90 per cent of the preferences are expressed but some preferences are marked nonconsecutively are admitted to the count. However, the preferences on the ballot paper will only be allocated and counted up until the consecutive number sequence is interrupted. So the provision is already there, but for the House of Representatives the provision was taken out. This is not in our report because at the time it was not drawn to my attention. But I am drawing it to the attention of the House now to show how it is absolute hypocrisy for the opposition to continue to oppose the reinstatement of the savings provision for the House of Representatives because it is currently there in similar form in the Senate under section 270(1) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Opposition members have argued that to support full preferential voting and a savings provision seeks to have one’s cake and eat it too, and they suggest that the adoption of optional preferential voting at the federal level should be continued. Whilst optional preferential voting is likely to see a decline in informality, a change to opMAIN COMMITTEE tional preferential voting would fundamentally change the nature of representation in the House of Representatives. It could lead to first-past-the-post and raise the prospect that candidates are elected without majority or popular support. The committee does not see that the savings provision and full preferential voting are incompatible. The continued operation of the Senate savings provision for below-the-line votes with sequential numbering errors indicates a general acceptance of the need to include protection for voters who make genuine mistakes in numbering their ballot papers. While the committee has also recommended reinstating penalty provisions to deter the advocacy of Langerstyle voting, opposition members have claimed that it is naive to pretend that some of the issues associated with advocating Langer-style voting will not return. There may be implementation issues associated with reintroducing the savings provision. However, in the committee’s view, these concerns should not be a deterrent to giving up to 90,000 more electors who try to cast a valid vote the opportunity for their vote to be counted at an election. I want to draw the attention of members of the House, the Senate and the public to table C.10 in our report-the table goes from page 385 to page 389. The table has a breakdown, electorate by electorate, on how some of these provisions impact, or could impact, in relation to voting for those House of Representatives seats. What we see is that changes to the provisional voting system from 2004 to 2007-this is on page 389-meant that 53,629 fewer voters were included in the count. Non-sequential numbering in 2004, which I just talked about, meant that 91,354 people had their votes knocked out. These are not small numbers. And in relation to British electors there are 162, 928 as of 30 September, 2008. I think the provision is that eight electorates have 2,500 and more; 62 electorates have 1,000 or more. That is the best table in the whole report. It shows the interaction and the impact of the particular provisions I have told you about. on Electoral Matters. I say at the outset how much I enjoyed the experience of working with this committee, particularly the good relationship that there is between members. I mention in particular the chair Daryl Melham, and the deputy chair Scott Morrison. I want to thank the secretariat: the secretary Steven Boyd and inquiry secretary Kai Swoboda, technical adviser Terry Rushton, research officer Margaret Atkin and administration officers Renee van der Hoek and Natasha Petrovic-and I apologise to any of those whose surnames I might have mispronounced inadvertently. Their work is reflected in the excellence of this report that we are discussing today. I also thank all the people who made submissions or gave evidence to the committee, in particular the AEC who gave a great deal of their time to help our consideration of the 2007 election. As the previous speaker, the chairman of the committee, mentioned, there has been dissent by members of the coalition on eight of the report’s 53 recommendations. They have objected to recommendations 1, 2 and 3, which are to do with ‘enabling the franchise’-in other words, enabling people to vote. The majority view is that people should not be impeded in exercising their obligation to vote. Our system should be about every person eligible to vote being encouraged, not discouraged, and being enabled to exercise, not prevented from exercising, that obligation. Recommendation 1 relates to the time the rolls close after the calling of the election. The existing legislation allows for writs to be issued on the day the election is announced, meaning that the rolls could close to new enrolments that night. That is not what happened in the 2007 election. The Prime Minister chose to wait a few days so that people had a better chance to enrol than they might otherwise have had. The former government gave themselves the opportunity to close the rolls on the day the election was announced but did not have the courage to use that opportunity. I suspect that they knew, as we all knew-and there was plenty of publicity about it at the timethat to do so was morally wrong. I quote from the dissenting report relating to this provision. The coalition members say: … these changes … greatly assisted the AEC in identifying and discounting fraudulent enrolments. I have no recollection of the AEC giving us that evidence and I note that the minority report does not cite any evidence. They go on to say that the provision ‘permits calculated fraudulent enrolments to take place’. Again, there is no citation. WhilstI am no calculated fraud, I would suspect that anybody who was calculating a fraudulent exercise against the integrity of our roll would not leave it until the last minute to do so, so I suspect that that is not valid. In their submission they say: … the number of people missing the close of rolls deadline in 2007 was 100,370 compared to 168,394 in 2004. This is as if to present the early closure of the rolls as a good thing. One hundred thousand people is more than a full electorate quota. More than one full electorate of people did not get the opportunity to vote because they missed the close of rolls. Too many people have been excluded by the large number of existing rules. Existing rules have to be changed to allow people to be included. Those of us who are elected members, those who work MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Committees
179,Mr Sullivan (Longman) (12.23 Pm),"I rise to support the majority report of the Joint Standing Committeefor us and those who work for our parties live and breathe politics and electoral requirements 24/7. The majority of the citizens in this country do not. In fact, it is unfortunate but people in this country feel voting to be something of an imposition. It is easy for us to understand, or it should be easy for us to understand, why enrolment lapses occur. Recommendation 2 goes to the provision of identification by provisional voters. According to the coalition members of the committee, proof of identity is: … an important deterrent that acts to prevent citizens from failing to maintain their enrolment or who may seek to engage in multiple voting. Pardon? I really do beg their pardon on this one. Firstly, there is no evidence-historical or since the introduction of the POI requirements before the 2007 election-that there has ever been any systematic fraudulent multiple voting. There is no evidence-quite the contrary. I refer anybody who is listening to or reading this debate to pages 16 to 22 of the report, which are titled ‘Multiple voting myth’. It is beyond me why the coalition continues to flog this dead horse. Secondly, as for a deterrent to prevent failure to maintain enrolment details, give me a break. People are not obsessed with the processes as we are. In fact, knowing that all you have to do to get a vote is turn up on the day with your drivers licence, fill out a provisional form and send it away is going to do quite the opposite. People will even allow their voting to lapse. If we tell them that that is what they have to do, that is what they will do. The authors of the dissenting report then go on to acknowledge that some voters are removed by Electoral Commission administrative error and suggest a ludicrous remedy. They suggest that if, subsequent to casting a provisional vote, the AEC determines that the person’s absence from the roll is its error, that vote should be allowed to go forward and the voter not have to turn up on a later date with his proof of identity. The question here is: how is the voter going to know that the AEC has determined that it is its error that he or she was not on the roll and decide that they do not have to turn up with their proof of identity? Just under 34,000 people were unable to provide their proof of identity on polling day. About 7,000 subsequently provided that information, as they were requested to do, within the week. Twenty-seven thousand votes cast were not counted. Again, far too many people who ought to have been able to lodge a valid vote were not counted. The safety net of the automatic inclusion of provisional votes in certain circumstances-and the chairman of the committee covered this quite well just moments ago-is rejected by the minority report. There are some 90,000 votes elsewhere, maybe, but, through this, 75,000 are perhaps those that count. One hundred and seventy-five thousand votes-100,000 too late to enrol and 75,000 provisionals not counted-are far too many Australian citizens denied the right to vote. The dissenting report concentrated largely on those provisions that make it easier for people to exercise their obligation to vote. Notably, it did not oppose recommendations 5 and 6, which make it easier for votes cast by post by people in remote parts of Australia to be included-in other words, a lessening of the provisions in that regard, which means that rural and remote Australians can have a relaxation for their votes. eases the requirements for provision of proof of identity when you are re-enrolling if removed from the roll. It seems odd that it is okay for the AEC to reinstate enrolment by checking the details they already hold but it is not okay for them to include a vote in the count by checking the details they already hold. That is rather strange. The tone of this part of the dissenting report is simply this: it is more important to be fastidious about enrolment than it is to have your vote count. I would say quite the opposite: the most important thing about voting is that the vote should count. A person who turns up on the day to cast a vote ought to be able to have that vote count. Mr Hawke interjectingis a load of craptrap. count it as unparliamentary! ommended that the schools and universities be paid a bounty, if you like, a sum of money, to ensure that young people are enrolled.

186,Mr Sullivan,"Okay. The committee chairman covered the youth enrolment procedure, where we have recadvertising processes, material into the schools and visits to the schools-to encourage youth enrolments. That is probably going to cost more and be less effective than inviting the institutions to ensure that eligible students are enrolled. The bottom line here is this: we have compulsory enrolment with the object of compulsory voting in this country. If we are going to compel citizens in this regard then the corollary is that the government is compelled to ensure that citizens can perform that compulsory act without undue difficulty. There are a couple of other issues that have been raised, but I want to go to this ludicrous suggestion that we should consider the introduction of optional preferential voting. I have had some experience of this. I was elected to the Queensland parliament under compulsory preferential voting and unelected from the Queensland parliament under the process of optional preferential voting. But it is my view that optional preferential voting is the worse of all possible voting systems, with the possible exception of plurality, which we know as ‘first past the post’. What we know today as compulsory or full preferential voting was invented in Australia, and internationally it is known as the ‘Australian ballot.’ The purpose of the Australian ballot was to ensure that a person elected enjoyed the preferential support of greater than 50 per cent of electors. On the one voting occasion it duplicates the run-off system in vogue in many parts of the world. As an elected member of this parliament I take great comfort from the fact that I have the demonstrated support of more than 50 per cent of the voters of Longman, that more people preferred me rather than my opponent as their representative. By contrast, an examination of the 2001 Queensland state election, won by a landslide by Premier Beattie, shows that 16 or 17 of the government MPs did not have that demonstrated support. After the distribution of preferences that had been allocated by voters, the total votes for those MPs was fewer than 50 per cent of the formal votes cast in their electorates. In effect, by exhausting their votes, voters are saying to the successful candidate that more than half of them prefer the other main candidate or that nobody represents them. This is a distortion. Optional preferential voting distorts the proposition that we should be electing parliamentarians and governments that enjoy majority support of electors. It certainly does not distort it to the degree that plurality or first past the post does. But evidence in my home state shows that, in each election since the introduction of optional preferential voting, an increasing number of voters are opting to ‘plump’ or to simply indicate a first preference, and in that regard optional preferential voting is slowly morphing, inevitably, into first-past-the-post voting. I do not see any large clamouring for first-past-the-post voting. In the few remaining moments allocated to me, I wish to say something about the use of technology in relation to our electoral system. I do not want to sound like I am an iconoclast, but I think it is time-sometime this century, preferably sooner-that we start to make greater use of online provisions in people’s dealings with the AEC. I undertake some online banking with one of Australia’s major banks and I am happy that my money is secure via that process because of the account number, password, secret questions and SMS provisions. I think these provisions are an excellent way of looking towards introducing online transactions, at least in a small way initially and later on to a full online voting system. the conduct of the 2007 federal election and matters related thereto is important. I want to begin by expressing my admiration for my colleague the honourable member for Banks and his judicious chairing of this committee. This excellent, extensive and, some people would say, exhaustive report on electoral matters which we are now considering is a reflection of his and the government’s leadership on this particular issue. I want to thank all other members of the committee, including the member for Longman, who just spoke, and of course the committee secretariat for their expertise and dedication in facilitating our work in so many different ways. Australia’s electoral system is virtuous, particularly when compared with systems operating in many other countries, including our great democratic ally, the United States. The US has a system of redistricting, organised by the congress, which would never be tolerated in Australia, but it leads to all kinds of distortions, even in their great democratic system. I believe we have one of the fairest, most transparent and most efficient electoral systems. The member for Longman pointed out the vacuous, non-empirical nature of the minority response to this report, and I do not want to dignify it by examining its non-evidence based prejudices. Instead, I focus on the combination in Australia of bicameralism, compulsory voting, preferential voting for the House of Representatives and proportional representation in the Senate, a system which is unique in the world. It combines the best of British Westminster heritage with the best of American federal representation, with added features of our own. Compulsory voting encourages civic participation and means that all Australians share the responsibility for choosing their government. The member for Longman pointed out the pitfalls of adopting optional preferential voting. Single member seats in the House of Representatives ensure that we usually have stable majority governments. PrefMAIN COMMITTEE",153,Committees
187,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (12.39 Pm),"The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters Report onerential voting gives all voters the ability to influence the results of their electorate. Proportional representation in the Senate gives minority parties a voice without undermining stable government. All Australians should take pride in our electoral system. This great report will reverse the damage that the previous government did to the integrity, openness and fairness of our electoral system with its unnecessary, partisan, short-sighted and foolish changes to the Electoral Act before the last federal election-changes to the Electoral Act that had never been made before any other election because they were not needed. The system was fair and the changes at the last federal election were a political manoeuvre designed to try and give them a little extra edge when they thought they were going to lose it. The changes were based on an assertion which was completely and demonstrably false that there was significant false enrolment or other electoral fraud which made it necessary to bring in measures to make it more difficult for Australians to enrol to vote. Everyone knew this was a false assertion. I knew it, the Australian Electoral Commission knew it, respected election analysts such as Professors Brian Costa and Malcolm Mackerras knew it, and I am pretty sure the former government knew it. It was a cynical falsehood put out by the former government to provide a fig leaf of justification for their self-interested manipulation of the electoral system for their partisan advantage. Let me go through again, like a parrot, the history of so called Australian electoral fraud. In the period 1990 to 2001, there were six electoral events, including a referendum, with 12 million votes cast at each of them. Altogether, 72 million votes were cast during this period. In that period the Australian Electoral Commission showed that there were 72 proven cases of electoral fraud-one case per million votes cast. That was the basis on which 100,000 Australians were disenfranchised at the last election by these terrible changes to the Electoral Act-a completely bodgie manoeuvre. The report we are debating today confirms and documents the falsity of that claim and documents the harmful effects of the changes that the Howard government made. The report quotes the AEC’s submission: It can be clearly stated in relation to false identities that there has never been any evidence of widespread or organised electoral fraud in Australia. The report shows that the Howard government changes had the effect of disenfranchising tens of thousands of Australian citizens at the 2007 election, which is exactly what I predicted and other members of the then opposition said would happen when these changes were debated in the House. More than 27,000 provisional voters were rejected because they did not comply with the new tightened requirements. The number of formal provisional votes fell from 112,000 in 2004 to 42,000 in 2007. This decrease was entirely due to the changes made by the previous government. On the basis of past experience, we believe at least 50,000 people would have been enrolled in the traditional seven-day period of grace after the calling of an election, but they were prevented from doing so. Many more were disenfranchised by being taken off the rolls by the AEC when they changed address and then were deterred from re-enrolling by the more onerous enrolment procedures. In 2004, 77,000 people were added to the rolls after the close of the rolls, because they had been incorrectly removed. In 2007 only 1,400 were able to do so. My estimate is that 100,000 Australians were thus prevented from enrolling or voting by the changes made by the previous government, about 700 per federal electorate. I believe the majority, possibly quite a large majority, of those disenfranchised people came from social groups more likely to vote Labor: first-time voters, new citizens, Indigenous Australians, people with poor or low literacy skills, itinerant workers and homeless people. That was, of course, the belief of the former government which led them to the lengths of disenfranchising their fellow Australians. It might be thought that 700 votes per federal electorate, each constituency with between 90,000 and 100,000 voters, is not a significant proportion. Need we be reminded, however, that in 2007 the honourable member for McEwen was elected by a margin of 12 votes, the honourable member for Bowman by 64 votes, the honourable member for Swan by 164 votes and the honourable member for Dickson by 217 votes. I believe that all four of these members won their seats only because of the deliberate disenfranchisement of likely Labor voters by the former government. As it turned out that was not enough to save the previous government from defeat but if the election had been closer it might have been-and that was the very plan. I might say that I find it completely incomprehensible that newspapers like the Courier Mail focus on the undemocratic role of donations and lobbying in Queensland but they are not willing to look at the bodgie results produced by the electoral changes at the last federal election in their state, particularly in two seats in their state. The former government liked to talk about electoral fraud. As this report documents, it was a bogus claim. But if there was ever a clear case of electoral fraud in Australia, if there was ever a case of Australian voters been defrauded of their right to vote, cynically and deliberately, it was the changes made to the electoral laws by the previous government. The report recommends that the changes made to the Electoral Act by the previous government MAIN COMMITTEE should be reversed. That is the policy we took to the last election and that is the policy to which we remain committed. The former Special Minister for State, Senator Faulkner, set in train a process of consultation leading up to the green paper setting out a timetable for legislation. The current minister, Senator Ludwig, is continuing with that process. We have seen the first stage of the government’s response to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2009, which is currently, again, before the Senate. Now, again, we have this brouhaha in Queensland about lobbyists and donations et cetera, but it is the Liberal Party, the coalition in the Senate, that has already blocked changes that would make donations to political parties more open and transparent, and we hear nothing from the Courier Mail. I ask the editorial staff of the Courier Mail, will you please read the debates in parliament about the donations bill? Would you please pay attention to what is actually happening in this area? The government remains committed to reversing the Howard government’s unfair and unnecessary changes to the Electoral Act, which closed the rolls immediately after the issuing of the writs and, as I repeatedly pointed out, which particularly affects younger people-deliberately so-and which required photo ID for people wishing to enrol, change their enrolment details or cast a provisional vote. The thing that I find the most outrageous and egregious about these changes is that the previous government was elected at all elections between 1996 and 2001 on the previous system. They did not claim that it was undemocratic then. The coalition were quite properly elected. Yet they invalidated the very system under which they were elected three times to try and benefit themselves at the 2007 election. All of those provisional voters who were allowed to vote in 1996, 1998 and 2001 were disenfranchised in 2007. It really is an anti-democratic outrage. The evidence set out in this report reinforces the argument that I and many others made for the repeal of those changes. I welcome the government’s continuing commitment to do this and I look forward to that commitment being translated into legislation as soon as possible. I am going to take up my full amount of time by re-emphasising some of the other figures on the so-called ‘integrity of the roll’ issue. Let me go through some of the figures that were revealed to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters by the Electoral Commissioner. There were 17,000 apparent multiple votes at the 2001 election, for instance; 15,000 of those, or 88 per cent, were an indication from responses that no further action was required. These were tracked down, and they did not need to be pursued. There were 920 people whom the AEC got no responses from. Letters were undelivered or people were not able to be found. So, at the 2001 election the AEC narrowed this down to a further 896 examples of what was thought to be multiple voting. People like the member for Sturt have railed about the integrity of the electoral roll at previous elections. Of those 896 multiple voters, 739, or 82 per cent, were elderly people who completely innocently, as a matter of confusion or because of poor comprehension, voted twice-at a mobile polling booth and then on the day. We know the kind of circumstances where this can happen without any kind of electoral fraud or malevolence by these elderly voters. This accounted for 82 per cent of the cases of multiple voting at the 2001 election, and it was roughly the same proportion at the 2004 and 2007 elections. There were only 138 cases referred to the AFP, of which five were accepted for investigation. So out of 13.6 million Australian voters we have only five proven cases of electoral fraud, which the DPP decided, at the 2001 election. We have 1.2 million Australians unenrolled. That is a much more serious issue. At the last election 90-plus per cent of Australians voted, but the proportion is dropping over the years. As members of parliament all know, the AEC is almost trained to take people off the electoral roll. But we need to have a more modern process where we use all kinds of devices, such as the internet, particularly with young people, so they are able to send their re-enrolment details back in. People do not fill out handwritten snail mail these days and send it back to the extent that old-timers like the people sitting in this room do. We have to make some kind of provision new, savvy Electoral Commissioner-and try some of these electronic means of increasing enrolment. In a compulsory voting system, we have a duty and a responsibility to ensure that the franchise is as wide as possible-not to restrict it, not to exclude voters because of possible perceptions of how they might vote at a federal election, and certainly not to do it in this blatantly bodgie kind of way where we used the system at three elections and then changed it at the last election. I am very, very pleased with this excellent, extensive, exhaustive report that the member for Banks has led the charge on. I think one of the great effects of this new government being elected will be to widen the democratic franchise to increase democratic prospects in Australia, I am very proud to add my name to support it and its recommendations.

(5) Has the Australian Government made any payment to a State or Territory government in respect of any bilateral agreement; if so, what sum was paid, and to which State or Territory government/s. Ms Plibersek-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Seven States and Territories submitted draft or final proposals for the 2008-09 financial year on or before 2 March 2009. (2) The Northern Territory submitted its proposal on 5 March 2009. Final proposals were received from New South Wales on 20 March 2009, Western Australia on 10 March 2009 and South Australia on 12 March 2009.

(2) Where in Australia can (a) Polyethylene Teraphthalate PIC 1, (b) High Density Polyethylene PIC 2, and (c) Polyvinyl Chloride or Vinyl PIC 3, be recycled. (3) If PICs 4, 5 and 6 cannot be recycled, when will they be phased out. (1) Plastics4 (Low Density Polyethylene) and 5 (Polypropylene) are collected for recycling by local government kerbside systems in most metropolitan and some regional areas across Australia. They are also accepted by some recycling depots and transfer stations. Their inclusion in kerbside recycling is a matter for local government who will generally consider the costs, benefits and practicalities of collecting these plastics in their region. Plastics4 and 5 are processed at facilities across Australia. Where plastic with a Plastics Identification Code of 6 (polystyrene) are available in commercially viable quantities, services are available for their collection and recycling. Polystyrene is also collected for recycling by some local government kerbside systems. While the majority of polystyrene collected for recycling is exported for processing, there is a plant in Mildura in Victoria which utilises recycled polystyrene to produce products including posts, bollards and stakes. (2) Plastics with a Plastics Identification Code of 1, 2 and 3 are collected for recycling by most local government kerbside systems, recycling depots and transfer stations. Processing facilities for these plastics are located across Australia. (3) Plastics with a Plastics Identification Code of 4, 5 and 6 can be recycled. Queensland: Flying Foxes (Question No. 767) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in writing, on 1 June 2009: Is the Government intending to implement a damage mitigation program to control the population of flying foxes, which are having a significant environmental and economic impact on growers of orchards and crops across Queensland (QLD); if so, when will this program begin; and if not, will he consider implementing such a program to assist QLD food producers given the QLD Government has ceased providing Damage Mitigation Permits to control the flying fox population. Ms Burke-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The Government supports the effective management of flying fox populations and their impact through contributions to research. Fruit growing levypayers may wish to propose that Horticulture Australia Limited (HAL) sponsor research into flying foxes and non-lethal control measures. HAL makes an annual industry call for proposals around September each year that address specific industry priorities. HAL funds priority research on behalf of 26 statutory levy-paying horticultural industries and other industries and organisations that make voluntary contributions (including the stonefruit and apple/pear bodies). The government matches, on a dollar for dollar basis, industry contributions (both statutory and voluntary) paid to HAL for research up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production of the industry. The on-farm agricultural production and native animal management aspects relating to flying foxes are state and territory responsibilities and associated mainly with state/territory legislation. Agencies in those jurisdictions are working with affected fruit growers to manage the extent of damage on their orchards and crops. Funding assistance through state governments is available to growers for non-lethal methods to control flying fox damage to their orchards, such as netting. In Queensland the Primary Industry Productivity Enhancement Scheme makes available low interest loads of up to $500,000, which can be repaid over a 20 year period, to establish control methods. In NSW the Special Conservation Scheme makes available loans for exclusion netting. These loans are for up to fifteen years and for 90% of the net cost of the netting up to a maximum of $150,000. Biodiversity Adjustment Scheme (Question No. 768) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, in writing, on 1 June 2009: In respect of the Biodiversity Adjustment Scheme(1) What sum of funding under this scheme has been made available to Western Australia, and for what purpose was it expended. (2) Does or did Western Australia retain any surplus from this funding; if so, what was the sum of the surplus.",179,Questions In Writing
193,Mr Garrett,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Does any agreement exist between the Commonwealth and the States for surplus funds to be transferred within a State to be used for other purposes; if so, did the Western Australian Government use any surplus funding under the scheme on other projects; if so, what are the details. Biodiversity Adjustment Scheme is a Western Australia State initiative. It is administered by the Western Australia Department of Environment and Conservation. The Australian Government does not participate in this activity. No agreement exists between the Commonwealth and the State for the Biodiversity Adjustment Scheme HMAS Sydney II (Question No. 770) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 2 June 2009: (1) How many (a) photographic images, and (b) minutes of video footage, were taken as part of the discovery and investigation into the wreck of the HMAS Sydney (II).

(c) The Finding Sydney Foundation is currently winding up its operation, having completed its objectives by locating HMAS Sydney II and HSK Kormoran and setting up a Virtual Memorial. The Finding Sydney Foundation is in discussions with an appropriate national institution to ensure that copyright for all the material, including photographs and video imagery, is assigned to an appropriate national institution, including the provision of all material to that institution. Roads: Gocup Road (Question No. 771) Mrs Hull asked the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, in writing, on 3 June 2009: (1) Who was responsible in the NSW Government for submitting the funding application to the Australian Government to upgrade Gocup Road between Gundagai and Tumut.

195,Mr Combet,The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s ques,182,Questions In Writing
196,Mr Albanese,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Australian Training and Support Team East Timor (Question No. 772) Mr Lindsay asked the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, in writing, on 4 June 2009: (1) Is he aware of the ongoing campaign for formal public recognition of the Warlike Service (WLS) of the Australian Training and Support Team East Timor (ATST-EM). (2) Did the Government direct the Department of Defence to release a DEFGRAM on 26 March 2009 announcing the recognition of WLS for the ATST-EM; if so, who was the responsible Minister or Parliamentary Secretary. (3) What protocols, processes or legal requirements must be fulfilled to have the WLS of the ATSTEM publicly recognised. (4) Will he publicly announce recognition of WLS for ATST-EM veterans who served on active service in East Timor; if not, why not. (5) Does the award of a War Service Pension (WSP) to qualifying persons depend upon the formal public recognition of active WLS. (6) Is he aware that members of the ATST-EM who have qualified for a WSP, are having their applications denied due to a lack of public recognition of active service in East Timor; if not, why not. (7) Did the Deputy Chief of Army, at any stage, order ATST-EM members to return their United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) medals; if so, why. (8) Have ATST-EM members been retrospectively awarded the UNTAET medal; if not, why not. (1) Yes. (2) No. (3) There are no protocols, processes or legal requirements that must be fulfilled to have the WLS of the ATST-EM publicly recognised. (4) No decision has been made to publicly announce recognition of WLS for ATST-EM veterans who served on active service in East Timor. (5) and (6) There is no requirement for public recognition to qualify for the award of the War Service Pension. Personnel wishing to access veterans’ entitlements associated with their service in ATST-EM can do so once Department of Veterans’ Affairs has confirmed their service with Defence. (7) I am advised that the Army understands that in 2001 an investigation was commissioned by the then Commander of the Australian Contingent – East Timor into how the Australian Training Support Team– East Timor received the UNTAET medal, as they were not assigned to the United Nations. In 2003, it is further understood that a direction was issued that the medals had been issued in error and that they be withdrawn. Action was initiated by the Army to comply with this direction. (8) The UNTAET Medal can only be authorised for issue by the Security Council of the United Nations. In July 2008, the Vice Chief of the Defence Force wrote to the United Nations Headquarters Military Adviser, Lieutenant General Chikadibia Obiakor, requesting that he, as the delegate for the award of the United Nations medals, agree to the retrospective award of the UNTAET Medal to the 205 members of the ATST-EM who served during the period 1 March 2001 to 25 July 2005. Defence was passed a response from the United Nations dated 23 December 2008 advising that the United Nations Secretariat has not approved retrospective award of the medal to ATST-EM members. There are no further avenues available to Defence to influence the award of the UNTAET Medal to ATST-EM members, although individuals may apply to the United Nations for reconsideration of their specific circumstance. Visas (Question No. 773) Mr Pyne asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 4 June 2009: In respect of the Government’s changes to the 457 Visa Program, and its announcement on 15 May 2009 that labour agreements aim to provide a flexible response to the needs of industries experiencing skills shortages: (a) what is the average length of time taken for labour agreements to be approved; (b) how is the process considered to be flexible for those employers who experience skills shortages; and (c) how many 457 visa holders are in South Australia; and of these, how many have indicated they are willing to relocate to remote areas such as Coober Pedy in pursuit of training and employment. (a) The time taken to finalise a labour agreement can vary considerably depending on the complexity of the agreement; the number and type of concessions sought, the quality of the information provided and the response times of the employer. It generally takes around four months to prepare a labour agreement, and they can be finalised in about four weeks follow-",182,Questions In Writing
197,Mr Combet,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,183,Questions In Writing
198,Mr Rudd,"I am advised that the answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:ing provision of the required documentation. In exceptional circumstances, it can take up to two years to finalise an agreement. (b) The standard Subclass 457 sponsorship arrangement allows sponsors to nominate only people with occupations that are on an occupation list approved for this program. Labour agreements provide flexibility by allowing employers experiencing skills shortages in other occupations or approved occupations who cannot meet the full requirements for the standard Subclass 457 sponsorship arrangement, to negotiate with the Commonwealth approval to nominate skilled overseas workers. (c) There were 2,950 primary visa holders in South Australia at 30 April 2009. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship does not collect data that would indicate whether a visa holder is willing to relocate to more remote areas in pursuit of training and employment. Visas (Question No. 774) Mr Pyne asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 4 June 2009: In respect of the Government’s changes to the 457 Visa Program, and its announcement on 15 May 2009 that labour agreements aim to provide a flexible response to the needs of industries experiencing skills shortages: (a) have any applications for 457 visas been refused as a result of the changes; if so, how many; (b) why is the scheme not being introduced in 2010; and (c) do transitional arrangements exist to (i) provide employers with time to arrange labour agreements, and (ii) allow 457 visa applications received prior to the changes to be processed in accordance with the requirements under the old program; if not, why not. (a) Since the announcement, there has been one nomination refused as a result of this change. (b) The scheme was introduced as part of the package of reforms to the Subclass 457 visa program. The changes are being rolled out when the legislation and systems changes can be made. This change required minor alterations and could be implemented earlier than some other changes. (c) (i) No. (ii) No. The changed arrangements require all applications not finalised on 15 May 2009 to pursue a labour agreement. Applicants who have an existing application not finalised under standard business sponsorship provisions are invited to withdraw their applications and seek a refund of the fee. The government introduced the changes to ensure that employers using the Subclass 457 visa program to access ASCO 5-7 occupations satisfy obligations on local training and employment. First Home Owners Grant Boost (Question No. 776) Mr Morrison asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 4 June 2009: In respect of her media release of 2 June 2009 relating to the numbers of Australians taking-up the First Home Owners Grant Boost: (1) For each month between 1 October 2008 and 30 April 2009, how many grants were given for (a) new construction ($21,000), and (b) existing homes ($14,000).

(b) The Exmouth Shire was granted a 30 year lease that commenced on 8 March 1993 and expires on 7 March 2023. (c) The current lease is not compliant with the Airports Act 1996 and will not be extended. If the Shire of Exmouth require a lease beyond 2023, a new compliant lease will be required. The lease will also need to address issues associated with the use of Defence infrastructure such as runway usage and the management of aircraft operations. Natural Gas (Question No. 793) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Resources and Energy, in writing, on the 23 June 2009: (1) On average, how much (a) natural gas based energy is consumed per calendar year in compressing natural gas so it can travel throughout the Australian domestic natural gas pipeline network, and (b) Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions are produced in part (a). (2) What advice has he received on how these CO2 emissions might be reduced other than by increasing the price of natural gas for consumers. Mr Martin Ferguson-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Australian pipeline network includes high pressure transmission and low pressure distribution components. The National Inventory Team, part of the Department of Climate Change, compiles emissions data for the purposes of producing the National Greenhouse Accounts. As part of this, it estimates emissions and fuel use separately for high pressure gas transmission and low pressure gas distribution networks. It advised that in 2006-07, the energy use in high pressure natural gas transmission totalled 17 PJ (resulting in 858 kilotonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions). The additional energy use in national gas production and low pressure distribution totalled 6 PJ (resulting in 320 kilotonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions). While the latter figure is not disaggregated, approximately two-thirds (4 PJ) is used in gas distribution. (2) The Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism has not provided any advice to Minister Ferguson on how these emissions might be reduced.",184,Questions In Writing

Second Sydney Airport (Question No. 814) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, in writing, on 25 June 2009: In respect of the Government’s Aviation Green Paper released in December 2008 and his associated media release of 19 June 2009: (a) has he commenced a site investigation process for a second Sydney airport, in conjunction with the New South Wales Government; (b) given that the Australian Labor Party (ALP) National Platform specifically rules out a second Sydney airport from being developed within the Sydney Basin, and the consultation draft National Platform to be considered at the 2009 ALP National Conference has removed this requirement, will the Government still consider building a second airport within the Sydney Basin; and (c) in respect of aviation policy, what is the Government’s interpretation of the Sydney Basin. The Federal Government has invited the NSW Government to participate in a joint study to assess options, identify potential sites and evaluate investment strategies for delivering additional airport capacity for Sydney. The final terms of reference for the joint study will be released later this year as part of the National Aviation White Paper. Until the findings of the joint study are delivered, the Australian Government is not going to speculate on possible sites for a second Sydney airport. Literacy Levels (Question No. 815) Mr Pyne asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 25 June 2009: (1) What evidence is there to justify claims that there are poor literacy levels among Australian school children? (2) Where is Australia placed on the most recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development comparison on the national literacy levels? Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) What evidence is there to justify claims that there are poor literacy levels among Australian school children? In 2008, the National Assessment Program– Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) commenced in Australian schools. The",186,Questions In Writing
203,Mr Albanese,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:fication of those students who have not achieved the minimum national standard for their year level and, who need further help to achieve the skills they require to continue in schooling. The data from the NAPLAN test results gives schools and systems the ability to compare their students’ achievements against national standards and with student achievement in other states and territories. It also allows the monitoring of progress over time. Results from the 2008 NAPLAN tests indicate that at the national level, across the literacy domains and year levels, on average about 80 per cent of students are above the national minimum standard, about 13 per cent are achieving at the national minimum standard and about 7 cent are below the national minimum standard. For Indigenous students at the national level, across the literacy domains and year levels, on average about 44 per cent of Indigenous students are above the national minimum standard, about 23 per cent are achieving at the national minimum standard and about 33 per cent are below the national minimum standard. The results for all year levels and domains can be found in the 2008 National Report at http://www.naplan.edu.au/. (2) Where is Australia placed on the most recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development comparison on national literacy levels? 57 countries participated in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2006 and the results were released in December 2007. Australia’s mean score for reading literacy in PISA 2006 was 513 points, above the OECD average of 492 points. This represented a statistically significant decline from Australia’s mean score in PISA 2003 of 525 points. Australia was significantly outperformed by five countries in PISA 2006: Korea (556), Finland (547), Hong Kong-China (536), Canada (527) and New Zealand (521). Australia performed at a level with no statistically significant difference or not significantly different to Ireland, Liechtenstein, Poland, Sweden and the Netherlands and outperformed all other participating countries. Australia was outperformed by only two countries, Finland and Korea, in PISA 2003.

(a) Countries with mean scores significantly above the OECD average (b) Countries with mean scores not significantly different from the OECD average (c) Countries with mean scores significantly below the OECD average Building the Education Revolution Program (Question No. 817) Mr Pyne asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 25 June 2009: In respect of the Building the Education Revolution Program: (a) have any schools with transient enrolments, such as hospital schools, been provided with funding under the program; if not, why not; and (b) are schools with transient enrolments eligible for any other capital grants under other programs; if so, what are the details. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) Funding under the Building the Education Revolution (BER) program is allocated based on full time enrolments at schools. As the students at schools with transient student populations are enrolled at other schools, funding has been provided to those other schools for those students, who are expected to return to their local school and so benefit from the funding. As such, no BER funding is available for schools with transient student populations. (b) The Local Schools Working Together Program is aimed at partnerships to build shared educational facilities. The preferred partnership is between a government and non-government school but it may include a partnership within the educational sector along with a third party. Under this arrangement a school with a transient student population could be a partner with another school eligible to receive recurrent funding under the Schools Assistance Act 2008. Schools: Funding (Question No. 818) Mr Pyne asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 25 June 2009: (1) What sum of money was provided to (a) government, and (b) non-government, schools in every electoral division for the 2007-08 and 2008-09 financial years. (2) What was the (a) expenditure on, (b) location of, and (c) purpose of, each grant in part (1). Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The government school detail requested in the question is not collected by the Department and is not available. The nongovernment data is not easily compiled and responding to this question would be an unreasonable diversion of the department’s resources. (2) Grant information for General Recurrent Grants (non-government schools only), Capital Grants and Investing in our Schools Program is published in the Green Report annually on a calendar year basis. The latest report is in respect of 2007 funding. Other grants to schools are published on the Department’s websites. Building the Education Revolution Program (Question No. 819) Mr Pyne asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 25 June 2009: In respect of the Building the Education Revolution program: (a) what action does her department take to resolve formal complaints; and (b) are there any complaint operating procedures and guidelines for the program; if so, what are the details; if not, why not. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) Formal complaints about the Building the Education Revolution Program (BER) are received through an email inbox set up for the National BER Coordinator. Every complaint received by the BER Taskforce is investigated by Departmental officers. Replies are sent, wherever possible, within 24 hours. (b) The complaint operating procedures and guidelines for the BER make provision for responses to be provided to all complaints. Once complaints are received, they are registered and the National Coordinator is notified. The complaint is investigated by Departmental officers in consultation with the relevant state/territory education authority or Block Grant Authority and a response is prepared. Distance Education (Question No. 820) Mr Pyne asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 25 June 2009: Is the Government committed to funding distance education; if so, what are the full details of its commitment to public distance education providers. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The Australian Government believes that every parent has the right to choose an education that best suits the needs of their child, irrespective of their religious beliefs. I acknowledge that regular schools are not available or may not be suitable for all children and therefore distance education fulfils a need. The Government provides funding for distance education students that are using registered distance education facilities which are part of a registered non-government school. The Australian Government provides funding for students educated at government schools under the National Education Agreement. It is each state and territory’s responsibility to determine its priorities in the provision of education, including distance education. Higher Education (Question No. 821) Mr Pyne asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 25 June 2009: (1) For the calendar years 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009: (a) what was the total number of school leavers enrolled in (i) Vocational Education and Training (VET), and (ii) university; and (b) what percentage of all school leavers enrolled in (i) VET, and (ii) university. (2) What sum was allocated in the 2009-10 Budget to (a) VET providers, including TAFE’s, and (b) universities? Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Mr Pyne’s question is specific to ‘school leavers’. There is not a national administrative data collection of school leaver numbers, and hence percentages can not be derived as requested. However the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ annual ‘Survey of Education and Work’ publishes estimates of school leavers aged 15 to 24 years, and their study destinations. The survey estimates that there were 302 100 school leavers in 2006, 303 100 in 2007, and 313 600 in 2008. Enrolments at bachelor degree level or above were estimated at 82 600 in 2006, or 27.3 per cent of school leavers, at 83 600 in 2007 (27.6 per cent), and 83 900 in 2008 (26.8 per cent). Enrolments in vocational studies were estimated at 79 200 in 2006, or 26.2 per cent of school leavers, at 82 300 in 2007 (27.2 per cent), and 89 000 in 2008 (28.4 per cent). (2) (a) In the 2009-10 Budget $2 657 482 000 was allocated for funding for training to VET Providers, including TAFE’s. This includes funding provided to states and territories to fund their VET training systems through the Inter Government Agreement on Federal Financial Relations and the VET infrastructure component of the Education Infrastructure Fund. In prior years, under the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Act 2005 and the 2005-2008 Commonwealth-State Agreement for Skilling Australia’s Workforce, States and Territories were required to contribute base recurrent funding on a 2:1 ratio to Commonwealth government funding, plus match the Commonwealth on additional recurrent funding. All States and Territories met or exceeded this requirement during the period of the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Agreement. Under the new Inter Government Agreement there is no specific requirement in terms of the amount to be contributed by States and Territories. (b) In the 2009-10 Budget $6 350 955 000 was allocated for 2009-10 for the higher education sector (including universities and other eligible bodies) through the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations portfolio. This excludes funding to universities through the Innovation, Industry, Science and Research portfolio. This also excludes funding allocated for Commonwealth Scholarships administered by higher education providers, Higher Education Loan Program assistance for students and Education Investment Fund VET projects. Private Health Insurance (Question No. 827) Mr Dutton asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 25 June 2009: (1) As at 31 March 2009, how many (a) people were covered by private health insurance policies provided by an employer; and (b) businesses provided Fringe Benefits Tax-liable private health insurance membership for their employees. (2) Did his department or any other agency model the effect of the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives policy on businesses which provide Fringe Benefits Tax-liable private health insurance membership to employees (1) The number of employer-provided private health insurance policies is unquantifiable, as this type of fringe benefit is not separately identified on fringe benefits tax returns submitted by businesses. Private health insurance fringe benefits fall into the ‘Other benefits (residual)’ category on the fringe benefits tax return, along with various other types of fringe benefits. (2) The effect of the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives policy on businesses which provide Fringe Benefits Taxliable private health insurance membership to employees was not modelled due to information on the number and incomes of such employees not being available. Private Health Insurance (Question No. 828) Mr Dutton asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 25 June 2009: (1) Is his department able to estimate the additional annual increase in private health premium liabilities for businesses which provide Fringe Benefits Tax-liable private health insurance membership for their employees from 1 July 2010, due to the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives policy; if so, what is the quantum of those liabilities. The increase in private health insurance premium liabilities for business cannot be quantified, as this type of fringe benefit is not separately identified on fringe benefits tax returns submitted by businesses. Private health insurance fringe benefits fall into the ‘Other benefits (residual)’ category on the fringe benefits tax return, along with various other types of fringe benefits. Private Health Insurance (Question No. 829) Mr Dutton asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 25 June 2009: Is his department able to estimate the additional annual Fringe Benefits Tax liabilities to businesses which provide Fringe Benefits Tax-liable private health insurance membership for employees from 1 July 2010 due to the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives policy; if so, what is the quantum of those liabilities. The additional fringe benefit tax liability for businesses with employer-provided private health insurance policies is unquantifiable, as this type of fringe benefit is not separately identified on fringe benefits tax returns submitted by businesses. Private health insurance fringe benefits fall into the ‘Other benefits (residual)’ category on the fringe benefits tax return, along with various other types of fringe benefits. Private Health Insurance (Question No. 830) Mr Dutton asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 25 June 2009: Is his department able to estimate how many businesses will no longer provide Fringe Benefits Tax-liable private health insurance membership for their employees from 1 July 2010 as a result of the increase in premium costs associated with the introduction of the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives policy; if so, how many. The number of businesses who no longer provide private health insurance policies as a result of the policy is unquantifiable, as this type of fringe benefit is not separately identified on fringe benefits tax returns submitted by businesses. Private health insurance fringe benefits fall into the ‘Other benefits (residual)’ category on the fringe benefits tax return, along with various other types of fringe benefits.",188,Naplan Identifies Student Achievement Of Essential Literacy And Numeracy Skills A Key Part Of This Process Is The Identi Questions In Writing
