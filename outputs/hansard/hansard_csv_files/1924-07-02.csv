If permanent heads approve of discretionary increments as from 28th A p r i l last, will these bc paid? 3. If not, why not? 4. Does the answer to question 2, asked by the honourable member for Barton on the 20th .Tunc last, mean that permanent heads will not be allowed to exercise a discretion in regard to increments awarded by the Arbitrator? 5. In view of the fact that the existing salaries of oflieers w ill be taken into consideration by the Puhlic Service' Board in fixing salaries under the classification in a ll instances, why arc automatic increments paid as they accrue, but discretionary increments refused? honourable member's questions are as f o l low : 1. Yes; but such increments can only be paid if the necessary funds arc provided. 2 and 3. No. The granting of such increments would involve undue interference with classification of the Service, which will be elfective from l s t July, 1924. 4. Thc discretion of permanent heads is absolute under the Determination, but is dependent upon funds being made available. Pending classification, it is not proposed to make such funds available. 5. The assumption that existing salaries w ill be taken into consideration in classification is incorrect, but the claims of officers for discretionary increments aro being kept in view by the Public Service Board in fixing salaries under the classification of the Service. Payment of automatic increments is mandatory, and all future increments under classification will bc automatic. NOTE PRINTING OFFICE.

Tlie introduction of this amending legislation synchronizes w it h certain advances now being made by financial magnates in other continents,, particularly Europe, concerning which I shall speak later, because they have a direct relation to t i l s b ill . I recollect that you, Mr Speaker,, in tbe course of a learned dissertation upon financial questions in 1922, re[71] minded those who were privileged to hear you on that occasion that "" finance is government and government is finance."" Therefore^ the legislation now before the House is of the utmost gravity and i m portance,, because it may be rightly regarded as directly affecting the fundamentals of government. I view with serious concern the proposals which the Government hassubmitted. Last year members of the Opposition warned rhe people of the possibility of the present fiovernineut seeking to destroy the effectiveness of the Commonwealth Bank. ""We reasoned that such action was to be expected from the representatives of "" big business "" and financial corporations, for, as other wealthy sections of the community had received handsome gifts from the Goveriumetit, it was unlikely that the financiers would be omitted from the distribution. That prophecy is verified by the bilL now trader consideration. The Commonwealth Bank was established in spiteof the uncompromising hostility of vested interests. I have familiarized myself w i th the debates in this Parliament in 1911, when thc first Commonwealth BankB ill was introduced by the Right Hon. Andrew Fisher, and I have read with particular interest the contributions to that debate by a number of honourable members opposite, including some who are now Ministers of the Crown. I remember the grave fears and evil forebodings that were expressed by those honourable gentlemen on that occasion. They had very little sympathy w it h those who proposed! to establish the bank,, and having a knowledge of their statements at that time, I am not surprised at the In the light of. the history of the bank, however, the Government's action in attempting to tamper with one of the mask substantial institutions in the Commonwealth is most audacious. There appears to be no limit to the extent to which, the Government is prepared to sacrifice the. interests of this country to those of its private and privileged friends. The proposal is that the Commonwealth Bank shall become an instrument of convenience to private financial interests, regardless of therelation of such interests to the welfare of the nation. It is appropriate that I should review what the Commonwealth Bank has done for this",17,Defence Department Medical Treatment Of Home Servi Ce Force S

It was the chief factor in fche keeping open of the doors cf many of thc private hunks, for it enabled thorn to nieeu urgent obligations. supported counteracted the effects of depression. Tn the flotation of war and peace loans il. saved the Government, approximately, £6,000,000. The average price paid to the Commonwealth Bankf o r the flotation of loans was 5s. 9d. per cent... while private financial institutions were charging £ 2 7s. per cent, for the same class of business. The bank also financed tht> primary producers, and assisted to solve intricate financial problems associated with the handling of primary produce. accomplished that work with the same degree of success. Mr MarkB . Young, who represented the Commonwealth Bank at the first Bank Pan-Pacific Congress, in Honolulu, in October, 1922, referred to the work done by fche bank in assisting to market primary produce. He statedI'liiuuiciitl problems of grout magnitude and intricacy arose during the war, and had to be faced and solved. The ordinary means of transporting produce had been greatly reduced, and at times almost destroyed. The necessity therefore arose of financing a nation's produce while it was not able to reach its customary markets. In all these banking transactions (relating to thc marketing of wheat, wool, rabbits, bultor, sugar, and metals), the Commonwealth Bank played the central part. course of a great war, evidence of unrest and even panic might have been expected to have been shown, but at no time was there any uneasiness. This satisfactory condition is widely attributed to the existence of the Commonwealth Bank, which had happily been created just prior to the outbreak of hostilities. So we find that during that period the Commonwealth Gibraltar. savings, and providing banking at a minimum Commonwealth Bank has presented to the Hr, Makin. Although, it may not have people a.profit of £4,500,000. As I have already indicated, the bank has not accomplished all that was possible, but this is in no way due to any limitation of power in the original act introduced by It has been of great advantage to the Labour party under Mr Andrew Fisher. If all the advantages that might have accrued have not been realized, that has been due to the conservative policy of the management. There is something to be said in favour of ref o r m in that respect, and I think that improvement can be brought about under the amendment submitted by thc Leader It of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton). It business enterprise, aud is suggested in this amendment that provision should be made for banking experts-employee s of the Commonwealth Bank itself-to bo selected to co-operate w i th the management i u so directing the affairs of the institution as to make it of the greatest possible service to the people. We know that business has been refused by the bank. A person with whom I am acquainted went to the Adelaide branch and asked for accommodation to the exNo private bank could have tent of £400 upon the security of assets worth £1,200. H is money was invested at the time w i th a private institution, and the Commonwealth Bank was not prepared to take the business out of thc hands of the private bank, for it was said to be contrary to the policy of the Oommonwealth Bank to do so. not hesitate to take business out of the hands of another. monwealth Bank can find the necessary money to effect new business in other directions, but it withholds its hand when it has an opportunity to protect a citizen from the rapacity of the private banks.

35,Mr Makin,"T h a t is so. The Comexchange and reserve. When the bill was introduced, however, expectations were not realized, and when the bank began to function it became perfectly clear that a national bank hud not beeu established, but merely a governmental institution in competition with the private 'hanks. The bill tile Government now brings forward is designed to carry out the criminal expectation. In the opinion of the Treasurer the Commonwealth Bank should not compete with private banking institutions. Although the Minister remarked that the basis upon which the Government justified the introduction of the bill was the fact that the bank had been in competition with th6 private banks, and although he said the bill was designed to give it the national character that he alleged it did not now possess, ho stated a little further on in hia speechOn the whole, it will bc recognized that the Commonwealtli Bank has not been a serious r-onrpetitor of the other banks. Indeed, it is understood that the policy of the management * up to the present has been not to enter into active rivalry with the trading banks, and in pursuance of this policy the interest payable nn Commonwealth Savings Bank deposits is, and has always been, lower than the interest I'd'id hy the stato institutions. Therefore, the very premises on which the Treasurer based his justification of the introduction of N;he measure were swept away by his own declaration that the national Commonwealth Bank had not been a serious competitor with the private financial institutions. other part of his speech the Treasurer said:The Commonwealth Bank, however, gave assistance to the other banks in respect of seasonal demands by making advances out of existing credits. through the co-ordination of the resources of the Treasury with those of the bank. Indeed, all the money offered was not accepted by the banks. According to the Treasurer himself, thc Commonwealtli assistance to the private banks, and has afforded them the necessary credits to enable them to meet the seasonal payments required of them. In fact, greater credits tban even they were prepared to use were available to them. nofc appear, therefore, that the Commonwealth Bank has been a serious competitor with the privately-owned banks. The provisions of this bill have been dictated to the Government by the controlling interests of private financial corporations. My justification for that remark is also a statement made by the Treasurer in his second-reading speech. He saidDuring discussions which I recently have had with bankers, they mads it clear that the right to get cash in case of need is of the greatest value to banking. Though some of them urged that mora legal tender notes be issued, they said over and over again that all they really"" wanted was the right to get notes iu case of need. It is quite clear that the Treasurer consuited the private banking authorities in drafting the bill. But not he alone entered into that consultation, for a little later on in his speech he said that "" in conferences which Ministers have had with the general managers of the private banks,"" certain things were said. The Government has been in close touch with the very people who hope by means of this bill to strangle the Commonwealth Bank, and so make available to their own banking institutions a greater volume of business. The Commonwealth Bank, as a matter of fact, will be scientifically destroyed if Parliament passes the bill in its present form. One of the most important steps in the process of strangling the bank is to be the appointment of an unsympathetic board of directors. The gentlemen who, it is proposed, shall be given positions on tbe board will be mora concerned with conserving the interests of private banks than with promoting the interests of the Commonwealth Bank. Several of the interests In anthat are to be represented on the directorate have already made large and somewhat irregular demands upon the Government, which it has conceded to them in almost every case. The board of directors This was made possible is to be composed of eight persons, six of whom will represent private financial, commercial, and pastoral interests, and only two of whom will care for the welfare of the general public. I think I may say justly that the only members of Bank has been of the board who will be greatly concerned about the future success of the bank from the point of view of the people of Australia will be its governor and the Secretary to the Treasury. Of the other directors two are to represent the comI t does mercial and industrial concerns, and two the agricultural and pastoral interests. The remaining two members are to be chosen for their special knowledge of currency. We may assume, therefore, that these two will have a very close, even if indirect, association with private banking institutions,' and that they will closely identify themselves with the Government's policy of sacrificing the bank. The next step in destroying the bank's usefulness is also -worth careful consideration. The Government proposes to load it with all the charges and interest payments connected with a £6,000,000 which the Treasurer is to provide. profit which the bank has in its reserve f u n d , is, we are told, to give the bank a capital of £10,000,000. irony of the situation lies in the fact that the bank at present has authority to issue debentures to the £10,000,000 if it deems such a course to be necessary. U p to the present it has not iised its power in that respect. compel it to set aside a £10,000,000 reservo in the manner the Treasurer has proposed w i i l seriously handicap it . Why should it be required to pay interest on £6,000,000 which, up to the present, has not been considered necessary to its The bank is to be forced to pay half of its profits into the National Debt Sinking Fund, but ifc is not proposed that the Government shall give credit for this as a contra for interest due from the 'bank to the Treasury on the proposed loan of £6,000,000. 'On what ground can it be claimed that the -Commonwealth Bank should be compelled to forgo reasonable interest on -money which ifc so invests ? Ifc should bo permitted to enjoy f u l l y the benefits of the credit balance which results from its operations. The only reason that I can give for the Government proposing the course provided for in the bill is that it wishes to ensure the success of its scientific effort to sacrifice the bank. honourable member for Werriwa is apt. The Government undoubtedly desires to place the bank in subjection to private banking institutions and so prevent it from fulfillin g the real purposes for which it was established. by unsympathetic administration from functioning in the interests of the general community. That method is frequently adopted to destroy the usefulness of government-controlled institutions. Honourable members who support the Government are pleased, from time to time, to point to various government ventures which they allege to^have been unsuccessf u l . The principal reason why there may be room for criticism is that the institutions concerned have been subjected to totally unsympathetic administration. A flourishing enterprise .can soon be made ineffective by unsympathetic administration, and a study of the history of loan of allegedly unsuccessful Government enter,prises usually shows that they bave not This amount, together with the been as successful as their promoters hoped they would be simply because of unsympathetic administration. Why The should the Commonwealth Bank be compelled to hold a reserve of £10,000,000? It is aeeally to meet the demands that extent of private institutions may make upon it in oansequence of its being made virtually a .clearing bank. One would expect, howTo ever, that jprivate banking institutions would be required to have credits with the national or reserve bank sufficient to meet the demands which .they might make on it , amd that ethey wiould not be able to trade upon the reserves of the na'bional c bank.

He saidTho removal of tlie automatic cheek enabled huge credits to be built upon the war currency and the short-dated securities issued by the Government. Then was seen abnormal increase in available purchasing units, without an increase in available commodities. Prices rose and, though wages were frequently raised, the pay of the workmen usually lagged beliind the cost of living. That is the first confession of the kind we have heard from any honourable member on the other side. They have always endeavoured to make it appear that the demands of the worker have been in excess of the cost of living. ""We have at last the truth proclaimed by the Treasurer when he says that, although tlie wages of workmen were frequently raised, tbey usually lagged behind the cost of living. stance. If credits are inflated it means higher cost of living, if a deflation it means unemployment. These powers are too great for private interests to hold. The honourable gentleman f u r t h e r saidDuring this period of inflation trade was wonderfully active, because merchants and dealers continually acquired large stocks in the fond Ibelief that in consequence of a world shortage of goods, prices would go higher still. In the wild scramble dealers bought from each otlier, and ever prices rose. This speculative business could not go on indefinitely, however, nnd at length reaction set in. We 'find, on the declaration of tbe Treasurer, that the war provided an opportunity for the money powers' mighty hand to exercise a very effective control over the conditions of the people. These are the merchants honour who, under this bill, are io share the custodianship It is well for us to remember that the control of currency and credit, au it does, the nation's security and the welfare of its citizens, should be entirely the 'Special function hase saidl that .there has been <a concentration of (money power. rati mated in his tapeech that, during the last 10.0 weasrB in tihe United 100 banks had .passed ;ooit of existence, amd that (the banking business of England and Wales is conducted now by the Bank of England, nine clearing hanks, and seven country banks. A similar concentration of money power has taken in Australia. and Banking Record gives the information that, in 1915, there were 22 banks operating throughout Australasia, and that twenty of these were operating in Australia. In 1922 there were fifteen banks operating throughout Australasia, and fourteen of them were in Australia.

Although they have been paying very substantial dividends, they have this amount of u n -' divided prdfits in reserve. The Commonwealth Bank, under the system proposed by the bddl, is to become a member of -fche combine. The Treasurer has admitted that in his speech. He saidThe excellent banking material which we Imve already should ho strengthened and coordinated in' order that Australia should haw a symmetrical and well-balanced system of central banking. To this end the Government proposes that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia should become the pivot of Australian hankinga hank of issue, deposit, discount, exchange, and reserve.

According to the statement of the Treasurer, the private banks took their gold to the Treasury voluntarily. cognized that the accommodation provided by the note issue was more easy to handle and more convenient for them. In presenting their gold to the Treasury they were given the privilege of getting tliree notes for every sovereign they surrendered. I recognize that they were charged 4 per cent, per annum on the notes given them in excess of the gold they presented. Three notes were issued to them for every sovereign they presented. on a credit basis of £4 for every £1 they held in reserve in gold. secured from the Treasury the additional accommodation to which I have referred, they were able to expand their credit to a ratio of twelve to one. This proves that the private banks were prepared to make use of the position for their private advantage, even though by doing so they might risk the stability and security of the nation. they use that right?

I believe that it is because they endeavoured to stand against the private interests represented by the other members on the. board that this measure has been introduced. hope that this House will see the wisdom of rejecting, the gpvernment's proposals, and will support the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton).

It is. one of thc most important that has been brought before us, aud one which is likely in the future to have a. far-reaching effect on the finances and the economics of this country. I am not sure', however, that it w ill immediately effect any of the changes which are expected. Perhaps the best feature of the bill is its cautious adventure into ground in advance of the field which the bank has to slowly, and to advance with caution. That the b i ll proposes to do. The change proposed is not so much in the functions of the bank as in the method of exercising those functions; at institutions. These greedy, the same time, the bank is to be given power to extend aa experience may warrant. That shows wise foresight, and a clear perception, of what is required of the bank. These remarks apply especially to the provisions relating todiscounting. Experience alone will disclose how far the discounting provisions will be effective in achieving the ends desired. The functions of the bank cannot be greatly changed or extended except by making it entirely a. reserve bank. I and. many others would prefer it to partake more of that character, but we have to recognize I the facts as they are, and, unfortunately, owing to the narrow lines, upon which the bank was originally established, it has become an ardinairy. trading bank to such aai extent that.its evacuation of that field would probably completely dislocate the finances of the country. Therefore, the Commonwealth Bank cannot be made purely a reserve bank, and, in the circumstances, the best possible compromise is that contained in the bill. The Leader This legislation, conof the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) said that both in respect of its past operations and its future conduct as proposed in this bill, the bank is not sufficiently a national institution. Other honourable members opposite spoke as if the bank The time is certainly coming when should be a people's bank. Only by an examination of the various statements they have made can one get a clear idea of what they mean. For instance,, the Leader of the Opposition read, ant a> large number of figures regarding the present position of the private banks,, aaid said that thewonderfully safe posi-bion they occupy justifies intervention by the Commonwealth Bank. He said, also, that I desire the Commonwealth Bank was not in keen enough competition' with the private banks. It is apparent that he and his followers desire that the Commonwealth Bank shall take pessession of the whole 1 field of private banking, ultimately displacing the private banks entirely. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr. Makin) to-day complained that the bank has had to refuse business from' certain individuals, whereas a national, or people's, bank,, could not do that. It hitheris clearly the honourable member's concepoccupied It is well to go tion of the national bank that it should",23,Commonwealth Bank Bill Second Reading
46,Mr Mann (Perth) [ 4 . 2 9 ],"absorb tbe entire banking business of the country. Private financial institutions like the banks, which the Leader of the Opposition admitted to be safe and successful, should, according to the views of honourable members opposite, be incontinently destroyed. Yet the Leader of the Opposition proceeded to say that the finances of the Commonwealth should be as sound as the rock of Gibraltar. Surelv he has gravely misconceived how best to keep the finances of the country sound and safe as the rock of Gibraltar if he believes that every financial institution which is successfully doing its work should be destroyed by the competition of the Commonwealth Bank, backed by the Government. In the opinion of a great many people, including myself, the Commonwealth Bank has already competed too much in some spheres of finance: I allude particularly to its unjustified intrusion into the domain of savings banking, thereby causing considerable mischief, and financial difficulties to some of the state governments. Mi*. WEST for the people. stand the logic of the honourable member if he says that when a government financed by the people,gets into monetary difficulties, it is good for the people. Some honourable members seem to consider the Government as something apart from the people, whereas in reality the Government cannot suffer without the peojDle suffering in like measure. I am unable to understand how a purely trading government bank can -be a ^national bank to any greater extent than can any private trading bank. In fact, if .a government bank has other functions which enable it to stabilize, strengthen, and regulate ""banking finance and practice, it is much more likely to give service of a national character. bill proposes to confer such functions upon the Commonwealth Bank, and so enable it to be of greater national benefit than if it were 'continued 'as -a purely trading institution. The Leader of tihe Opposition said that 'there was no necessity to appoint so ""ma-ny -members to the board of directors. Most of the criticisms 'wharchfaaroebeen (levelled at ithe past operations of 'the hank-lan d I say this without intending ""to reflect upon any in divadtial-hav e been due chiefly to the autocratic one-man .control which has hitherto existed. Objection was also taken by the Leader of the Opposition to the proposal to appoint the Governor and Deputy Governorf o r a period of seven years. B e argued that it would be necessary .to t r y out a man before we could know iwith ^certainty whether or not he was fit for :his position. I cannot refrain from asking myself why seven years was not considered too long a term for which to appoint the late Governor of the Oommonwealth Bank? That appointment was made by a Labour Government, and it seems that a term of .seven years is all right if proposed by honourable members opposite, but all wrong when proposed by their politioal opponents. W it h the b ill as a whole I lam. very well satisfied, but I would suggest to the Treasurer two or three minor alterations, and I ask h i m to show me special courtesy in this matter, because, owing to my departure for Western Australia to-morrow, I shall be unable to make these suggestions during the committee stage. W it h regard to the constittition of the executive committee It was a very good thing as proposed in clause T 5 E , T think it would be advisable to obviate the possiI entirely fail to underbility of this body becoming a mere departmental -board <of co»trott.

The only . other alteration I woiiald suggest is in regard to bhe returns which wiU have .to be made from time to time. Time returns at present received from the banks are not as satisfactory as they might be. The quarterly returns include letaly the figures concerning the bank's feusiness within the Commonwealth, and ithe bill proposes to reenact that requirement. The entire",25,Commonwealth Bank Bill Second Reading
47,Mr Mann,"assets of the banks are shown only once every twelve months in their balance sheets. sheets are made up at different times of the year, and consequently the balance sheets of the different banks do not synchronize, and do not enable a complete survey of tlie banking position to bo made at any one time. The result is that sible to obtain accurate figures as to the banks' business otitside aud inside the Commonwealth up to a certain date. I suggest to the Treasurer that the banks, in addition to furnishing quarterly returns giving figures relating to balances within the Commonwealth, should be compelled to give accounts of their business outside, the Commonwealth, including, at Jeast, accounts of their London balances. That would prevent "" window dressing '.' between banks and banks, which is said to to make up nnancial statements, and this information is necessary to enable the board of the Commonwealth Bank to form definite opinions regarding the regulation of exchange. the Commonwealth Bank should be required to make exactly similar returns, which should be published in the Commonwealth Ca-i-ttc. There would then be uo differential treatment as between one bank and another, and we should have statements setting out all the information required for arriving at a correct opinion concerning exchange. no doubt, that difficulties arise to-day be-, cause we have no figures that disclose the actual factors in the exchange trouble, or that indicate how long the position is likely to continue. The Treasurer dealt with that trouble at considerable length, and I should like to take this opportunity of warmly congratulating him upon the preparation and presentation of his statement on a very intricate and difficult matter. great use to honourable members, for it is very informative, and extremely sound aud accurate.. It is based on sound principles, and is spoken of in the highest terms of approbation by all who know anything about the subject. cept those who have an obsession for the destruction There is no doubt that consideration of the problem of exchauge is inextricably mixed up with the b ill, for every one Unfortunately, these balanceconsiders that the arrangements made for carrying on the business of the Commonwealth Bank must affect exchange and other financial questions. change ? count rates must work together. Several suggestions have been made to meet bhe trouble. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) recently favoured the House with a long speech on the subject.. He suggested that the exchange difficulty was d\ie to somo fault in our banking system, and that ' certain somewhat drastic remedies should be applied by the Government. Ue went so far as to say that it was time Australia developed its own occur when it is necessary economic system, independently of international finance. While the difficulty that this would cause in buying goods from abroad had no terrors for the honourable member, it was difficult to sec how, In all fairness when we wanted to sell our goods in other countries, we could reconcile this desire with such a formula. To talk of having our own economic system independently of the world's finance, is to talk of learning to breathe without using the atmosphere. Tlie exchange difficult}' is due entirely to the balance of trade. Many statements have been made about the conThere is dition of our trade, which has been attributed to the large amount of importation; but it is wrong to consider such matters from the point of view of only a twelve-months' period. It is, in fact, quite impossible to do so, because the period of importation and exportation may not come within the same financial year. The only accurate way to get a proper view of that matter is to Work out the figures That statement should be of over a long period. Many of our exports of years ago have only recently brought a return to the Commonwealtli. If . instead of a twelve-month, we take n ten-year.period, we find thc figures rather astonishing. D u r i ng the last ten year""! our total visible exports show an exeass over imports of £92,800,000. In addition there are invisible exports, which in clude such things as increase of debts and It suits every one exinterest payments. When these arc included we find that the balance swings of everything successful. back somewhat, but not eo f a r as most",26,Commonwealth Bank Bill Second Reading

51,It Is Impos,"Mr MANN The exchange and dispeople imagine. There was an excess of invisible imports over exports of £85,800,000. When the one figure is subtracted from the other, the exports are still in excess of the imports by £8,500,000. These figures do not include other invisible exports and imports, such ae services and private loans. We have no means of ascertaining these. As a matter of fact it is very doubtful whether the figures for our exports are not misstated. Let me give one instance of how that may happen. Suppose an exporter is sending fruit to England, and, on the basis of what he thinks the fruit will realize, declares the value to the Customs Department at 10s. or 12a. a case. In stead of realizing 10s. or 12s. a case, the fruit may sell for 15s. or 20s. a case. crepancy arises iu either case. I am explaining how the figures relating to exports may be inaccurate. I am aware of no means by which the amount actually obtained for the fruit in England is brought to account to correct the figures of exports. Therefore, we are working on very unreliable figures. The same argument applies to our exports of butter and all other products. It is therefore impossible to obtain any reliable figures. tralia to England take money with them from this countiy. Australia to'England do not take money with them. That is one of the extraordinary fallacies held by some people. The exchange rate to-day is a very great boon to the man who wants to go to England, for if he deposits £97 with a bank in Australia, it will give him the right io spend £100 when he gets to London. He does not take money with him, but by depositing money with a bank in Australia, .and spending money iu London, he assists to correct the exchange trouble wliile reaping a benefit himself. No definite information is obtainable as to the credit balance existing in London. We must infer that there is a credit balance in London, but probably it is not so large as is stated. Some people say that it is £50,000,000, but any such statement is more or less a guess. The figure cannot be stated accurately until we compel the banks to supply the information in their returns. A credit, however, must be there to account for the condition of the exchanges. It has always been the practice of the banks in Australia to keep balances at sliort call in London for financing their business transactions. The important consideration for a bank is not so much to have the money on the spot, as to have it readily available in case of need. In the old days, when we were working ou a free gold basis, the banks kept balances ' in London to meet their requirements. Those balances earned interest even for short periods, and did not embarrass the banks' operations in Australia, because they were readily available if required, and could be transferred here at very short notice. Since wo have departed from, the free gold basis, that cannot be done. There is only one way of actually transferring the money or its equivalent to this country, ancl that is by importing goods. Tliis has become increasingly difficult for two reasons. In the first place, our protective policy tends all the time to force one-way trade. It tends to force exports and stop imports, ancl that is one reason why it is difiicult to transfer money or its equivalent from London to Australia. The other reason is -and I shall speak more on this matter later-that the purchasing power of the people of this country has probably diminished. If these difficulties cannot be removed, if it is not possible to give greater facilities for the importation of goods, or if it is not possible to increase .the purchasing power of the people here so that they can buy in spite oi the tariff, then the only way to rectify tlie trouble is by the exchanges. This remedy is now being applied, and it is being shown that the banks are anxious to replace their balances in London by balances hero. The money cannot be brought out to Australia, for the reasons I have mentioned; but by means of the exchanges we can replace a balance in London by a balance here. The banks are forced to do that. They are compelled to apply the mechanism of exchange, even though they do it by a process that encourages imports and discourages exports. The banks are not operating, as has been alleged, in a definite conspiracy against our fiscal policy. The fiscal policy has forced them to take",27,Commonwealth Bank Bill Second Reading

Much has been said of the result of borrowing:. exchangesis obvious and. deplorable, but I confess that it is very difficult to find a remedy. ing. gration policy many peoplecontend that the British Government should help us more than it does. In response to representations to the British authorities large grants in aid of immigration have lately been offered. need grantswill affect the exchange position just as much as loans do. Eveni f we stopped borrowing altogether and depended on grants from the Imperial Government we should still be faced with the difficulty of bringing money into Australia. would' mean the stoppage of developmental works and immigration.

I db not propose to deal with some otf'fchesuggestions that have been m'ade for Govern1 ment intervention to devise schemes for transferring credits, for it is evident from The eifeet on the the statement of the Treasurer that such schemes de net meet with, the approval of the Government, and are not likely to be We are told to cease borrowadopted hy. it . For that I am devoutly Eveni n connection, with our immithankful. I refer to the floating of loans and the issue of notes on the strength of the credits existing in London. Even if such schemes were practicable they would not be beneficial, but would probably be harmful, to the country. I am glad, Nobody questions the thereifore, toi know that the Treasurer for immigration, but these does not intend to support any such proposal.. Now, I come to the question of the note issue and the Note Issue Board. I know that I shall probably be in a minority on this subject when I say that The cessation of borrowing the board,, in the past,, has done absolutely right. I have no criticism to offer on the work of the board, which has, I believe, been actuated by sound principles, and has acted in the best interest's This isi shown by the in of the Cbmmonweartb. The honourable member for Macquarie( Mr Manning) referred last week to an instance which he said showed that the board had acted If the economical wrongly. It was the case of certain Japanese wool purchasers, who wished to deposit 20Oi,OOO sovereigns, and obtain 200',0'00 notes in return. One of the banks was willing toundertake the transaction, but. ifc haid not the necessary notes on hand, and it referred the Japanese to the Note Issue Board, which declined to grant, their request, ontheground .that to do so would cause inflation. The honorSo long as we tie up our in able member for Maequarie said, that in flation eould; not result so* long aa gold was behind, the* notes-. Let me disabuse I feel .the minds of hoaiQ-rable members, of that idea. The addition of gold will not decrease inflation.. The statement made by the honourable member for One notices it when Macquarie-, and many other honorThere is able members, shows that they are under the impression that the financial position is still controlled hy the gold reserve. But our notes ar.e inconvertible;-. gold, is no Borrowing, can be longer the basis of value. It is simply an article of merchandise,, and additions to the gold reserve w ill not in any way diminish inflation.. The test by whicli we may judge whether or not there is depreciation of Gui-rency is the price of gold bullion and the starte of foreLgjn ex chawges, and the only way to correct depreciation ia' to reduce currency relatively to the productiono f the country. The .Npte Issue Board acted rightly in trying to decrease inflation. ""We should bend all our efforts to getting back to the basis of free gold as soon as possible. Increasing our note issue indefinitely will never attain that end. u gold basis until England does so. getting near it ; and I think we should aim at restoring it as soon as England can do so. One means to that end will bo to control our note issue with the object of decreasing instead of increasing it. lionorable member for Macquarie is capable of being met. It is quite probable that sufficient notes are already in circulation for our currency needs. Honourable members may ask where they are. Tliey do not leave the country, so they must be here somewhere. Inquiry would probably reveal that some of tbe banks, and possibly the Commonwealth Bank, arc holding notes to help them to obtain, business under our competitive system, rather than allowing the notes to be used co form what may bo called a pool of yurrency to meet a crisis of the kind we are now facing. I suggest that it is the duty of the banks to try to get some measure of co-operation among themselves rather than to carry the spirit of competition too far. tion at present. But if a certain bank is unable to secure for itself the business it has in mind, the made his demand in a curious way. He notes should be available for use byanother bank. That is much preferable to issuing new notes to a bank, as it often wishes, in order to enable it to increase its own. business. If the already issued notes were available instead of being locked up, they could be used for trading as opportunity arose. matter of fact, very little currency is required to conduct a large volume of business. us suppose that A owes B £13, and that B owes A £10. Tho amount of currency required to meet that situation will vary according to the method of payment adopted. SendsA £10 simultaneously, £23 of currency is required. If B sends A £10 and A sends back to B the same £10 with another. £ 3 , £13 of currency is required. If , however, A and B get together and cancel the £10 of mutual debt and A pays B £3, only £3 of currency is required. It will be well worth inquiring whether the Commonwealth Bank is withholding notes from circulation. I do not propose to go into that question now, but some such arrangement as I have suggested should be possible under the provisions of this bill, because the Notes Issue Board will be working in co-operation with the board of directors of the bank. The disThe difficulty referred to by the position of the currency will then be. so well known that it will be possible to utilize it to give the maximum benefit to the interests concerned. If our currency resources are pooled for general servics as part of a definite central policy to get back to tbe gold basis as soon as possible, it will be altogether to the advantage of the countiy and we shall be in tlie right way to escape from our present troubles. In discussing financial matters recently, the honourable member for Barton( Mr F. McDonald) went so far as to say that the Government was responsible for the unsatisfactory exchange position. This Government is no more responsible for it than any preceding Government, including the Labour Government. The honourable member for Martin( Mr Pratten), in a speech he made lately on our financial outlook, demanded government action to remedy the situation. He said: "" The Government must do something."" But he reminded me of a patient who said to his doctor: "" I do not know what is wrong with me, .but I want you to find out and to do everything necessary to cure me. I make one stipulation, however. There must be no operation. I will not submit to one.''' The honourable member for MarAs a tin requested the Government to act, but said that it m-ust not interfere witli our policy of protection.

That applies to problems of trade and exchange also. sire to read to lionorable members some remarks made by Sir Henry Strakosch, chairman of the Financial Committee of the League of Nations, who, I believe, was responsible for the establishment of the South African Reserve Bank. He said:There are no countries except those in the must primitive state of civilization which can IK' c.iilled self-contained. Thin highly complex economic organization of the world has Ijcen built up by a gradual iin.l almost imperceptible process of evolution. liVorything hud in that process adjusted itself to the progros3 as it was gradually achieved, .=o that to-day that organization cannot exist without the essential elements that have built it up, namely, the possibility of a free and unfu'iiderud exchange of goods mid services the world over. The lack of this freedom of exchange is one of the root causes of the present disjointed condition of the world and one of the outstanding causes of the instability of the exchanges. :nd yet there are people who doubt ihe necessity of international co-operation when, as T havp tried to show, the very life of a vast proportion of the population of this globe could nut. be sustained for any length of ""time without the closest international co-operation. it: litis been said that our present position is unprecedented, and is an extraordinary outcome of the great war, and that as we have no guide from history we must evolve JI soluliou for ourselves. There is nothing new under the sun, and those that say that this situation is new only do so because they aro ignorant of the past. Circumstances exactly similar to those in which wo now find ourselves faced England at the close of the Napoleonic wars. Any one who w ill take the trouble to read the history of banking w ill find that a sanation existed then which was exactly like this one. If certain dates and names were altered that history could be made to -ipply iu Australia. Tlie famous Bullion Committee of 1819 was appointed to inquire into the subject of currency. In its report it laid down the principles which have governed sound banking practice ever since. wo are wiser than those who preceded us, or that we can afford to ignore the past and throw aside the accumulated experience of the years, we shall act very foolishly. suffer if we neglect to heed the lessons of history, and set out to make experiments. The principles laid down by the Bullion Committee, whioh are the basis of the exchange practices aud sound banking I deprinciples of to-day, are also the foundation of this bill. quated t h in g ! aud foolish if we allow the argument that because a thing is old it is useless to cause us to neglect to profit by the lessons of the past, and i r y io guide our course by our own limited experience. That will uot discover for us a way out cf our difliculties. The Government has adopted a sound and absolutely right, course in placing before honourable members the proposals contained in this bill. It does uot suggest any foolish experiments, and I am glad that it has been strong enough to refuse to be misled into adopting suggestions which would only accentuate our troubles. By passing the b ill . Parliament will act wisely, and do a great deal to stabilize comnierce, and remove many of the difficulties which face the business world. If the principles which underlie the bill are adopted, and supported by a sound and economic fiscal policy, they will help every branch of trade and commerce. 1 want to say in reference to the bill it self, to which I -shall not devote much of my attention, that, like many other measures introduced by the Government, it is intended in the first place, as the Treasurer ( D r . Earlo Page) has told us, to stabilize the money trust of Australia, and, i u the second place, .to provide some very good jobs for friends of the Government. In introducing the measure the Treasurer was strictly orthodox. He has made no attempt to substitute some better system for one that has broken down throughout the world. Eor any such purpose this b ill is useless. Wc are told that the Commonwealth Bank is to be made a banker's bank in order to stabilize banking, but the one provision which might have helped to If we think that makei t effective even on those lines has been left out of this bill by the Treasurer.

The Treasurer told us that, in 1920, money was tight. Of course ir was tight. Who made it tight? It was the banks who did so. It was the same scheme all the time. The bankers are talking in this way, yet they say. "" Let us get a few more notes.""

Some honourable members may arguo to quote any financial writer, worthy of consideration, who contends that a cheque is not currency. Let me, for the purpose of illustration, take two people-on e a goldsmith, and the other a farmer. The goldsmith turns gold into trinkets and It will be the primary and ornaments, and, while he may not be of much use in a country, he manufactures articles which give pleasure to a number of people. Let us assume that, because: of a falling off in trade, he Those requires currency with which to pay Cheque his debts.

The Treasurer told us of the methods which were adopted to finance the Avar loans. The banking institutions extended credit to the extent of £300,000,000 on a legal currency of £53,000,000. In doing so, the private banks did not forego the interest on their money. own experience. A t one time. I conducted a small business. I had property worth probably £1,200, but was in need bf £100 or £200 ready money. When I applied for that I could not get it , as money was very tight. loan was floated, I could have obtained credit for the f u l l £1,200. surer also referred to the war gratuity loan. He told us that £6,000,000 had to bo raised to meet necessitous cases among soldiers and their dependants, and that the banks had agreed to find the money on the understanding that they would bo able to get notes again at the same rate of interest as was paid on the bonds. that time we on this side of the House argued that the Government could just as easily give that £6,000,000 to the soldiers free of interest. The same thing is true concerning the wheat pools. When Sir Joseph Cook was Treasurer, I pointed out that wheat created its own credit, and that all that was necessary was for credit to be given for the time being. SirJ oseph Cook admitted that I was right, but added that he did not know where the money was coming from . We were told that the farmers could only get 2s. 6d. per W it b banking institubushel for their wheat at the time, and . that a certificate would be issued in six months' time for the balance of the 5s. Immediately those certificates were issued, they were cashed by the banks at considerable profit to themselves. The members In 1914 the of the Country party, who claim to be here in the interests of the primary In producer, are supporting a Governinent which is standing behind institutions which are bleeding the farmer. The Treasurer, in referring to the creation of security to meet the deflation of currency, used the arguments of Law and the French assignats, and the greenbacks I repeat that the everof America. The assignats failed because an attempt was made to make them concurrency can, under present form to a gold standard. Further, the inflation did not take place in France, only bo satisfied by but in England, where the printing presses were kept going day and night printing counterfeit notes, which were smuggled into France by the hundred million. Similarly, the American greenbacks did not depreciate u n t i l they were repudiated by the Government. Let me give an instance from my War. of deflation went on. The loans for the Civil War were floated in the American dollar. They adopted the same system as an overdraft I was informed is proposed here. They decided that there must be a reversion to the gold basis, and But when the war ?100 worth of bonds, owing to inflation, was reckoned to be worth §60 in gold. The TreaA f t e r the process of deflation back to a gold basis had taken place, these bonds were worth §5100 in gold. The national debt was thus increased 40 per cent. But the American greenbacks never depreciated u n t i l they were repudiated by the Government, which refused to accept them in payment of dues and taxes, and At even after that happened they circulated at par freely throughout America for a number of years.. An y attempt i u Australia to deflate currency down to a gold basis will be attended by the same woes and distress as characterized Lawism in France and the deflation of the greenbacks in America. It can only result in enslaving the masses of the people by giving economic domination to the large bondholders.

They decide whether we shall' become aself-reliant nation or be tied to theapron-strings of nations in Europe or elsewhere. They control absolutely the economic policy ef the country, andi they act in. accordance only w it h their own interests. The Treasurer told^ us that the Conimoar wealth Bank, would publish, the exchange and discount rates. That presumably is part of the deflation, scheme. The. Commonwealth Bank, im. short, is. to operate 1 like the Bank of England.. As. he talked so much about the. gpl'd basis, I presumed that he anticipated that the, discount rate would rise and f a l l accounting to the amount of the gold reserve. In this connection I issue a ward of warniaig. This practice of the Bank of England, was. the outcome, of the wonderful Bullion, report, upon which a bill waa passedby. Sir Bobert Peeli n 1844'. Because the Bank of England raises or lowers thediscount veiiy ofteni they debased tlie rate according to the. gold reserve, the own ends. Treasurer says the same system should be introduced here. I invite him to con1 The sidertheMTbwing extract from a financial journal': Sonie years ago, during a period of some weeks; a» growpof Americanfinanciers drew from the Bank of England' sums equad' in all to £11,000,000 in gold, and shipped it to New York. Prior to thisi operation the gamblers sold British securities heavily, and bought United. States bonus', amd' slraresi Thiw transfer of £11,000,000 of gold caused, a heavy fall in 325 of Britisli representative securities, equivalent to £1T5,OOO-,OO0;' while the absorption of gold ini America; caused a> corresponding rise 1 in American, seeunitiesu. Currency is It was computed that the natural' resources of England were worth £20,000,000,000 . Because of the "" wise "" provision referred to by tbe honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann), the removal by a few American gamblers of £11,000,000 froma country possessing such immense resources caused a financial crisis, and 325 of British representative securities fell in value. The crisis caused unemployment and depression of trade. Why? If that £11,000,000 had been represented by goods, by the products of British factories, the result would have been buoyancy in GreatB r it a in ; it would have added to employment in that coun-' try, and increased the output of its factories. But because the export was of gold, the effect was different. That is what a gold standard controlled by a few people does for the world. Many people speak of the necessity for maintaining the longestablished gold standard. When was it established ? Gold has been an international standard only since 1870. Before that it was purely a British currency. Great Britain had a gold basis of currency, and Franco a bi-metal basis. Bismarck, when Germany received her indemnity of £400,000,000 from France, turned the German basis of currency from silver to gold, and Italy and the United States of America followed shortly after. The argument that the gold basis is very old, and must for that reason be retained, does not affect me, because I know that the world managed very well without the increase in the industrial development in Great Britain amounted to about 600 per cent. That was when there was no international gold From 1870 to 1905, when the international standard was gold, there was relatively almost no progress. The worship of gold certainly gees back to pagan days, and while we continue to worship it we shall have the undesirable economic conditions found in pagan countries. On the one side we shall have those who are economically secure, and on the other those who are economic slaves. Sitting bill is one of the most important, measures that could be submitted to Parliament, and I hope that the Government will not regard the criticisms I am about to offer as desire to embarrass Ministers, for I realize that, unless honourable members can induce the Government to give my view something in tlie nature of favorable consideration, the interests for which I desire to speak are unlikely to receive the attention to which they are entitled. My keen desire is that the Government may reconsider their proposal, so far as the note issue is concerned, or, at any rate, try to obtain evidence as to what, the effect of the bill is likely to be on the trade and commerce of Australia. It is all very well for the Treasurer or his officials to endeavour to get information on the banking question, but it would bo far more satisfactory in the public interests if we appointed a select committee of this chamber to ascertain how Parliament could best legislate on banking so as to aid trade ancl commerce. Kather than in dulge in patchwork legislation, due more or less to party differences, the desire of every honourable member should be to help develop the industries of the country, and we should call to our assistance the keenest intellects in Australia. One matter on which I desire to reproach the Government-and many previous governments are equally blameworthy-is the fact that once legislation has been passed at the instance of what I might call a Socialistic party, no effort is made to repeal it , even when it is found to operate it. Between 1840 and 1870 against the best interests of Australia. Believing that the note issue, as it is at present, is a grave menace to the future of this country, there standard. is great danger in not repealing its objectionable features. Other statutes, such as the Arbitration and Navigation Acts, are open to similar objection. Notwithstanding any threat that may be made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), Parliament should, without fear or favour, repeal legislation found to be opposed to the country's best interests. I do not blame the Leader of the Opposition for threatening what be would do if he were entrusted with the suspended from 6.27 to 8 p.m. reins of government, and if honourable members on this side of the Hou""e think any particular legislation bad their first duty is to repeal it .

MB . Josephi \ Jlolimstoimv of the; New York University School' o£ Trades amd Accounts, a recognized authority irn the United Statesof America,, has written a book on the Canadian banking, system, from which I have copied a chart which shows the seasonal requirements of the There is a national people of Cauadai n connection with their banks' note issue. The period covered is fourteen years old,, but I believe that the I hold position to-day ia exactly the same as it was then. The chart shows with marvellous exactitude each year the extraordinary seasonal demands which occur in Cauada as to an equal, if not greater,, extent in Australia. There is an almost normal' note circulation from January to Julyi u each year. In August, there is a large issue of notes; for the. purpose of financing, the wlieat harvest, but innearly every instance these notes are returned and cancelled, in January of. tlie following, year.

I fcrus* that honourable members' w ill examine the chart I have prepared, and that the Treasurer w ill also give some j : attention to it . In almost every year the note circulation of Canada varies f rom July to October, but becomos normal in January. A slight inflation is bound to occur, at certain periods of the year, but the banks may be trusted to sec that it is not serious, for they aro required to legal tender. pay taxation on the notes they issue. They take all possible steps to cancel the extra notes as soon as possible after they are issued. a utomu tic arrangement. gret that I havo not been able to obtain definite particulars of the variations that culation. £50,959,768; or £5 ISs.

Canada's note circulation has shown an increaso each year which corresponds with the increase in her trade and commerce. That, of course, ought naturally to occur.

I obtained recently from thc Commonwealth Statistician a return showing the population and the imports and exports of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, and also of the notes in circulation ou 30th June, over a period of years. In considering these figures, honwe should get back as speedily as possible orable members should recollect that the figures for Canada, which aro given in pounds sterling, are for the period when the note issue wffs normal, and not when it reached its apex in October or November. In 1900, when Australia had a population of 3/740,665, and a trade of £87,845,000, the notes in circulation totalled £3,762,286, or £1 0s. Id. per head sible for us to consider at present a reof the population. In the same year, New Zealand had a population of 763,594, a trade of £23,892,257, and a note circulation of £1,361,355, or £1 15s. 3d. per head. The Canadian figures that year were:-Population , 5,322,000; trade, £73,129,464; note circulation, £9,570,362, or £1 16s. per head. In 1910, Australia had a population of 4,367,405, a trade of £134,505,501, and a note circulation of £4,563,907, or £1 0s. l i d . per head. The currency which will ensure safety to the note circulation per head of the population of .New Zealand in that year was £1 12s. 0d., and of Canada, £2 8s. lOd. Those were the days of gold currency. I shall now quote some figures which relate to thc post-war period when notes were In 1920 Australia had a population of 5,360,462, her trade was valued at £248,797,801, and her note circulation was £21,627,117, or £4 0s. 8d. per head. Tlie figures for New Zealand for tliat year are:-Population , 1,192,620; trade, £1.08,037,774; note circulation, £7,890,418; or £6 12s. 4d. per head. Tho Canadian figures are:-Population , 8.631,475; trade, £523,649,628; note cirhead, as against Australia's £4 0s. 8d. per of complaints that have been made of the inflation of our currency. There may have beeu some inflation but it has not been of a serious nature. As the trado and commerce of a country grows its note issue should expand. That has been the experience of practically all countries. Canada, in 1900, had trade worth £73,129,464, and a note circulation of £9,570,362; in 1910, when her trade had grown to £137,485,538, her note circularespective figures were £523,649,628 and £50,959,768. It is customary in almost overy country to expand the uoto circulation as trade increases, but Australia has not adopted that principle. I should like to know why she has not done so. I think all honourable members agree that to the basis of a gold currency. We require security against undue inflation or deflation of currency; provision for its increase to meet expanding trade; elasticity to meet seasonal requirements, aud strict legislative provision to secure ite stability. Will these result from the passing of this bill? It seems imposturn to the gold standard. Until Great Britain and a majority of the other leading countries of the world are in a position to return to it we cannot. Gold is at a premium now, and we cannot afford to allow it to go out of Australia until other countries will reciprocate. For some time to come a gold currency will be impossible, and we must consider other means to obtain a stable and an elastio",41,Commonwealth Bank Bill Second Reading

The Treasurer would be well advised to take expert advice as to whether it would be desirable for the Governmeut to purchase all the gold produced in Australia. on the matter, but it is well worth considering whether such a policy would assist to relieve the exchange position and tend to develop the country. There from inflation as from deflation of currency, and we ought to take what steps wo can to prevent undue variation. Are we more likely to get a stable currency by placing the note issue i u the hands of a Government-controlled or semi-politically controlled board than by giving it to people who thoroughly understand financial affairs? I consider that we shall be acting wisely if we adopt a system similar to that of Canada, provided that the Government has sufficient safeguards to meet any emergency that may arise. issue of notes is lef t to the private banks, subject to a suitable measure of official control, the progress of the country w ill be more satisfactory than it has been. Section 60P of the original act should, in my opinion, be repealed immediately. It gives power to thc Government to issue a proclamation by which it may supersede the Note Issue Board and take f u l l control of the note issue. the Treasurer ( D r . Earle Page) w ill not misunderstand me or think for a moment that I am casting any reflection on hi m wheu I say that there may be Treasurers who, in n time of stress, would take advantage of that provision. Issuo Board, in such a circumstance, would not issue as many notes as a Treasurer desired, possibly to relieve unemployment, or to assist some of the states to carry out a public works policy, he might cause the Government to issue a proclamation to remove control of the notes from the board and proceed immediately to inflate the currency. The provision which makes that possible should be repealed without delay, and if a crisis occurred in the affairs of the country Parliament could bo asked for, and, I am sure, would grant, power to meet it . We liave had inflation of currency in the past. When the war started a huge issue of notes was made to provide large sums of money for the states. members w ill refer to last year's budget statements they will find that an issue of £17,000,000 was made to the states. At that time £22^00,000 worth of notes was issued, as a direct result of political influence. That may have caused au I shall not express an opinion inflation of prices. There was then ample scope for the employment of every able bodied man, and there should not have been any necessity to make unemployment doles. That £22,000,000 was loaned is just as much danger to the states and to the Commonwealth. If honourable members peruse last year's budget they w ill find that in the funds of the Commonwealth there is an item of £3,000.000, which is classed as a credit. I admit, of course, that the present Treasurer ( D r . Earle Page) was not responsible for that action. Still, it furnishes ample proof of what can be done when political influence is exerted upon those who control thc issue of notes. Honourable members are aware of what has hapI f the pened in Germany and Eussia. We do not want to have the experience of those countries. I want to make it impossible for such conditions -to be brought about in Australia. Subsequent to the issue of those notes, great depression was felt in trade. In 1/920 Australia's trade amounted to £248,700,000, while the note circulation was £21,600,000-£8. 2 per cent., or £4.8 per capita. In Canadai n that year I am sure that the trade amounted to £523,000,000. while the notes in circulation totalled £51,000,000, a percentage of 9.34. In New Zealand the trade amounted to £108,000,000, and the note circulation to If the Note £7,900,000, a percentage of 7.3. In 1921 Australia's trade increased to £295,000,000, while the notes in circulation showed an advance to £23,924,000. The following figures w ill show that there has been undue deflation in the note issue, considering the increase in trade: Yoar. Note Issue. Notes In Circulation. £ £ 1020 57,000,000 24,000,000 1921 55,000,000 . 22,000,000 1922 61,000,000 . 22,000,000 1923 .. ' 52,000,000 . 23,000.000 It w ill thus be seen that whereas in 1920, with a trade totalling £248,000,000, tbe note issue amounted to £57,000,000, in 1923, with a trade amounting to If lionorable £249.000,000, the note issue was £5,000,000 less. Let us deal with the matter on another basis. In 1915 the deposits in our bank totalled £169,000,000, white tbe notes in the hands of the banks amounted ito *29'000,'000, a ratio of 17.9. In 1922 the deposits totalled £249,000,000, but ""She notes .amounted ££4,000,000, a ratio of -'9.9. period £70,'750,-000, while 'the notes decreased by £4,240,000, or 8 per cent. That, to my mind, indicates undue deflation in -the last few years. I make no reflections on the Note Issue (Board. I believe that the members of 'that board consider that they are acting in the best -interests of Australia, and ithat ffhcy are keenly desirous of getting back :to a gold standard.

85,Mr West (East Sydney) [9.5],"minimize the importance of the Commonwealth Bank and to injur e it i u every possible way. The provisions in this bill for the appointment of a board of management for the bank are really the crux of the measure. If they are proposed with' tbe object of putting the national bank into the hands of men whose concern will be, not the interests of the people but their private interests and the interests of their friends, no better means could bo devised for the purpose. The Government proposes a board of management to consist of two persons associated with manufacturing industries or commerce, two associated with agricultural, pastoral, or other primary industries, and two having a knowledge of currency, and declared by the Governor General to be choseu because of that knowledge. What that knowledge is it would puzzle a Philadelphian lawyer to explain. I do not think any person is likely to live on this globe whoi will be able to say what it really means. nothing to justify confidence in the board which, under this bill, it is proposed shall in future manage the Commonwealth Bank. The exercise of the banking power may make or break a nation. It may reduce men, women, and children to a deplorable condition, and may retard' the progress of any country. This parliament is charged with the conduct of national affairs, and I believe that if we properly look after its financial affairs we may in Australia lay the foundation of a nation whose prosperity will bc without parallel since the world began. That is an ambition which can be achieved, but I do not believe for a moment that it w ill be achieved if we put the national bank into the hands of people who will have no higher ambition than to serve their own private interests. The Leader of the Opposition has submitted an amendment in which he proposes that the management of the Commonwealth Bank shall be placed in the hands of men who understand banking, who will be removed from outside influences, and whose salaries will be paid to them to watch the interests of the bank aud its expansion as a national bank, such as it was intended to be. 1 do not know how any honourable member on the other side can find fault with thc amendment. now so ashamed of their conception of what the management e<f the Commonwealth Bank should be that they are Jfr.

If I were to submit the So far the Treasurer has said amendment moved by thc Leader of the Opposition to a meeting of electors in the Sydney TownH a l l , I am quite satisfied that, excepting a. few outside cranks supporting the Government, the whole audience would be in favour of it . Sydney contains more people who understand the difficult question of finance than does any otlier city in the world. No t one largo institution dealing in commerce, banking, or insurance, not even the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, is managed other than by one man, who, in turn, is dependent upon experts in charge of its operations. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is managed, by Mr Knox, and the experts employed by that company to further its interests are not even allowed to mix with the experts of other commercial houses. The late Sir Thomas Dibbs was manager of the Commercial Banking Company, Sydney, for over 50 years, and if one of the directors of the bank had attempted to interfere with his administration he would have been politely shown out of the f r o n t door of the institution. Sir Charles McKellar, M ' . L . C , oue of the members of the board of directors of the Bank of New South Wale3, would not interfere with the management of that institution.

87,Mr West,"The board of directorsto do with the operations of the bank. Sir Alfred Meeks went to England to establish a branch of the Australian Mutual Provident Societyi n Threadneedle-street, London. As a member of the board of directors he refrained from interfering with the operations of the society. when in control of the Commonwealth Bank, was very fortunate to have the support of an excellent staff to instruct h i m in the management of the bank. Treasurer himself is dependent upon the staff of the Treasury, who frame his speeches and compile the tables of figures that aro from time to time placed before this House. The members of the Ministry are incompetent to administer the affairs of this country. Their actions are hampered by outside influence, and Australia is consequently in a sorry position. However, I am confident that a change of government w ill soon take place. Queensland National Bank, at one time, was in straitened circumstances, but recovered, owing to the determined efforts of the manager, Mr Ralston. One gentleman, who was a director of the Bank of New South Wales, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the Australian Mutua l Provident Society, Burns, Philp aud Company, the Sydney and SuburbanH y draulic Power Company Limited, and other companies, while on a visit to England for twelve months, was also a senator of the Commonwealth of Australia. One can imagine the control he must have exercised in the management of those institutions. of companies are called guinea pigs. If a person wished to float a company for the manufacture of patent pills, in reality made of rubbish, he would obtain the consent of well-known men to bc appointed to the board of directors, at a fee of, say, £2 2s. per sitting. In the aggregate they woulcl receive £400 or £500 per annum in return for the privilege of publishing their n nm.es as directors of the concern. That was the usual practice resorted to when floating gold mines and other ventures. Sir Charles McKellar is a director of the Bank of New South Wide.?, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and the Australian Mutual Provident Society. Persons appointed to a board of directors, although ornaments, are very useful individuals to their friends. I am not making this accusation against the persons whose mimes I have mentioned. Sir Thomas Hughes wa3 interested in a brewery, an hotel, an insurance company, a newspaper, and two banks. It is proposed that sucli persons as I liave mentioned should be appointed to thc board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank. Thc honourable The late Sir Denison Miller, member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning) stated last Friday that he knew all about thc banking business owing to information received by h i m from a director of a Tho certain bank. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) said practically the same thing, and no doubt he supports the Government in its action, because he w ill be able to interview members of the board in order to further the interests of his friends. We should permit nothing of this sort to occur. The men controlling the operations of the Commonwealth Bank should be in the same The position as is the Secretary to the Treasury. He is a Crown servant, with the interests of the Crown at heart. How can any man serve the interests of both the bank and a private institution ? If a man is tlie chairman of directors of an insurance company, drawing, say, £4,000 a year, he w ill serve thc interests of that company rather than those of the bank. Jt is only reasonable to expect that. My object is to prevent men from being placed in a position where they will have the opportunity to serve their own interests. Men with banking experience should have charge of the bank's operations. There w ill be plenty of work for Let me explain why directors them to do. Wo are all interested in thc success of the bank, because we are all shareholders in it . I want to see thc bank so managed that every shareholder will reap some benefit from its operations. Credit is essential to commerce. Because of that, the system of payment by cheque was inaugurated. Prior to the introduction of that system, silver was taken from London to 'pay for goods purchased in the East. Large firms, such as Anthony Hordern's, or Farmer's, in Sydney, or similar big establishments in Melbourne, do not invite outsiders to their board meetings. And in the conduct of thc Commonwealth Bank we should not permit merchants and others to become acquainted with the details of its operations. Every one of these persons, if possessed of any ability at all, would be able to make a fortune in three years. Do honourable members think that they would attend the board meetings, and acquire information, of it ins their own interests ?

93,©He Of Them Mr West,"I have endeavoured to the proposed board, he says it must be apparent that if men engaged in competitive pursuits are appointed, the knowledge they gain of their competitors' affairs must necessarily give them an unfair advantage iu the conduct of their own businesses. For that reason, he submits that the Government proposal for the constitution of the board should be abandoned. people would prefer to do business with our national bank if they were assured that it was controlled by men who understood banking, and who were exclusively engaged in the service of the bank. A good deal has been said during the debate upon the note issue. I well remember how honourable members representing the interests of the parties now supporting the Government ridiculed the proposals of the Fisher Government, suggesting that the output of notes would be almost as mechanical as the production of sausages, and with what dismay they viewed the prospect of a Labour government ever having control of the note issue. By no stretch of the imagination could the proposals then made by the Fisher Government be compared with the intention of the present Government with regard to the note issue. wedded to the idea of the control of the note issue by a board. The Government has not attempted to deal with the question of exchange in a satisfactory manner. In the course of an address delivered recently, the honourable member for Martin( Mr Pratten), who has lately become Minister for Trade and Customs, advocated the cessation of borrowing abroad in order to improve the nnancial position of the Commonwealth. Subsequently in conversation I told him that there would be no alteration in our nnancial policy until wo had a change of government. At that time this bill had not been brought forward, and in view of its many defects, 1 say now that the Government must take full responsibility for the measure, which, I feel confident, will not do what is expected of it . The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) had a good deal to say about the banking arrangements in other countries. He quoted the systems adopted in Great Britain, Canada, Africa, and many other countries. Is he net aware that tbe Labour party was the first party to advocate the establishment of a national bank? We do not want to follow any other country in this matter. [72] We ourselves created a precedent in this matter many years ago, and we should now go further in the' development of our national bank. The reserve bank in the United States of America is a valuable institution, differing in many respects from our own system, which merely relieves private banking institutions of the necessity to keep in reserve I am quite sure that tbe large holdings of liquid assets. A great deal more could be done in the way of developing our primary and secondary industries by the application of common sense methods to the operations of our national bank, and could be done without in any w a y creating a panic. B y intelligent handling of our national debt OUT liabilities could be reduced. Thus our friends in the corner, representing country interests, would be assisted in all the ramifications of their business as primary producers, and at thc same time we could extend valuable aid to our secondary industries. In Gormany, prior to the war, trading or manufacturing concerns whose credit was temporarily lowered, were able to obtain financial help from the Government, on the basis of I am not goods sold on bills of exchange. Under our present system of banking it is not possible to render the same assistance in Australia, but I trust that some action will be taken to improve the position. Thc appointment of a board of manage ment will not necessarily safeguard the interests of the people. Many years ago, the directors of a Glasgow bank were gaoled for having substituted lead washers for bullion in their strong-room. A great deal of misery was caused through the failure of -that bank. We have had the same evidence of imprudence in banking methods in Australia. I remember in 1903 travelling, with a man interested in finance, through Grafton, the district now represented in this House by the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page). My companion, who was charged with the duty of inquiring into the banking position there, found that his bank had advanced as much as £42,000 on certain properties which actually were not then worth £42. The amendment submitted by my leader ( Mr Charlton) should remove that danger, because the directors would be required to devote the whole of their time to the business of the bank, and, therefore, to the interests of the country. The Government proposal will not bear There is nothing in history to justify the Government's proposal. Government is haunted by the thought that this bank was established by the Labour party, and it is anxious to take from us the credit that is due to us on that account; but nil the ingenuity of honourable members opposite will not blind the people to the fact that the Labour party created the bank, and that if it had been enlarged as we intended, it would be lo-day a bank of reserve, and a still greater credit to Australia. function the Commonwealth, difficulties could be tackled in a way that is not possible under present conditions. were given charge of exchange iu London the people of the Old Country would' applaud us for conducting business in such . a sensible way. criticisms have no destructive aim; they are intended to bc helpful and constructive., and if honorablo members opposite will place the welfare of the nation first, they will realize that this bill is fraught with a great deal of danger. would give greater Leader supporters have to give to the bank a truly national character so that it would bu better able to ensure better control of the finances of the Commonwealth. placing thc management of the bauk in the hands of private persons, for history warns us against what may be expected from such a policy. upon to make a most important in regard to this bill, for upon thc future operations of the Commonwealth depends the relief of thc position which Australia has been placed by the mismanagement of those who held the reins of government No other country in the world has greater productive capacities and possibilities of prosperity than has Australia. it needs is that its finances be placed upon a sound basis, and if the Government will not adopt the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition, God help the country! The creation of a bank of reserve and othor extensions are minor compared with the necessity for placing Mr West. the control of the bank in the hands of investigation. independent men who w i ll realize and promote its national aim.

If they neglect their responsibility the people w ill eventually punish them, but in the meantime serious damage may be done. Over £405,000,000 of money is earning nothing.
