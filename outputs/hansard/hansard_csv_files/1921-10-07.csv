Ter And Attorney","General) [11.1]--(B y leave.)I move That, unless otherwise ordered, this House shall meet for the despatch of business at 3 o'clock on each Wednesday afternoon, at half-past 2 o'clock on each Thursday afternoon, and at 11 o'clock on each Friday morning. If that motion is not acceptable to the Bouse, I shall he prepared to move instead, "" That the House, at its rising, adjourn until 3 o'clock on ""Wednesday next."" I suggest to honourable members that, without pr .judice, we try the meeting on. Wednesday in each week for a month. We shall see what the state of business is then; and, if it is shown to be necessary, we can then decide to meet on the Tuesday,' or even, earlier in the week. Por the present, I think I shall meet the wishes of honorahle members hy arranging for meeting on Wednesday. am opposed to reducing the number of days of meeting in each week. In no period of the life of this Parliament has there been so much work to be done of grave importance to the community. Honourable members have only to inspect the business-paper to see that that statement is borne out. The delay in the settlement of the Tariff is holding up the business people of Austraha. Some of the requests for its amendment submitted from another place, which it was never intended should make ducks and drakes of a Tariff, are of a very debatable character. Huge expenditures of public money are proposed, and require careful consideration. It would be better in the interests of honourable members to transact the business between now and Christmas than to. have to meet in the hotter portion of the year-fro m Christmas time until March. 7 October, 1921.",19,Setup

3,Mr West (East Sydney) [11.3],"IUr. CHARLTON (Hunter) [11.4] I think that the niotion submitted by the Prime Minister is a reasonable one, and I hope it will be agreed to. It will be quite sufficient for us to meet three days in each week. If , as the right honourable gentleman has said, we find in a month's time that it will be impossible for us to complete our work within a reasonable period unless we meet oftener, we can then consider the advisability of having an extra sitting day. offer no objection to the motion, but I should like to reiterate remarks which I have made on previous occasions when I have urged that, in the interests of honourable members coming from fardistant States, some special effort should be made to get through the business of this Parliament more rapidly than has been done in the past. It is very raTely that it is possible for me to get across to the State from which I come, and more rarely still to spend more than a week there. Another matter of great importance is, that when Parliament is continuously sitting it is quite impossible for Ministers to keep in touch with their Departments as they require to do. I hope that in future some change will be made to prevent such continuous sittings of Parliament as we have had in the past Question resolved in the affirmative. HIGH COMMISSIONER.

Is the right honourable gentleman aware that the chief officer of the Department in ""Western Australia has refused to give evidence before the Select Committee referred to? If so, will he make it possible for that officer to give evidence, or permit some measures to be taken in this Chamber, that will bring to lightanything that may be wrong regarding the whole question of war gratuities? that a demand has been made by the State Government of ""Western Australia' upon a Federal officer to give evidence and produce documents.

This is a matter of great importance to honourable members and the people. It is understood that the measure will be passed towards the end of this year, and that the Convention will be elected early in 1922. The people are anxious to know upon what terms the Convention is to be elected. Will the right honourable gentleman introduce the Bill at the earliest possible date 1 making arrangements for my visit to, England, and in fixing the date of 'my return, I had in view all the points which the honorable member has mentioned; and in my view it would be impossible io get the Bill through this Parliament unless it were introduced at a time approximating to the date fixed fer my return. vernment has all along been shaped towards that end which the honorable member declares to be the desire of the people; but two problems of importance cannot occupy the attention of the House and the public at the same time. We have been discussing matters of very great importance this week. Next week we shall probably be discussing matters of equally great importance. We have no idea at present what they may be, but no doubt that is what we shall be doing. And then in the week after we shall be dealing with a subject to which my attention has already been drawn. Shipbuilding, the Estimates, and the Budget debate are questions ahead of us for discussion; and we are only human beings. However, Ministers are quite ready, and it only remains to clear away all these other matters of vital importance, and which cannot be ignored, in order to enable the necessary Bill to be introduced. orable gentleman introduce it, and thus meat works at Darwin play in the developmake the people acquainted with its proment and in the lives oi the people of that visions ? but my experience of adopting that course has been such that it does not commend itself to me. Unless a measure thrown on the table is accompanied not only by .explanation, but alsoby action which brings it before the House, and compels its discussion by honourable members, it has very little chance at all. If we introduce this Bill we must go on with it. Of course, the Government have their own ideas about it, but as the measure is one that can hardly be said to be a party matter in the ordinary sense of the term, the House can express an opinion upon it quite freely, and make of it ultimately what it pleases. Ministers certainly cannot regard it as something to which they are committed, beyond the fact that they are responsible for its introduction and passage through the House.

What results have been obtained throughout the whole Territory? honourable member's questions is as folhonorable member's questions are as follows :1 to 5. Yes. With a view to the discovery and development of new sources of mineral oil within the Empire, an agreement was entered into between the Government of Great Britain and the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia for oil development in Papua. It was agreed that both Governments should share the expenses of investigations by the Anglo Persian Oil Company (which has acted in various instances as agent for the British Government, and has specialized in the development of oil-fields within the Empire), the liability of either Government 'being expressly limited to £50,000, and the mineral oil, if discovered in commercial quantities, to be worked in such manner as was mutually agreed upon for the joint benefit of both Governments, the proceeds being divided equally between them. As indications seemed more promising in New Guinea territory than in Papua, the Commonwealth Government approved of the company's geological staff proceeding with the examination of the oil country in the former territory, and negotiations have for some time been carried on with the British Government, with a view to its sanctioning the extension of the original agreement to cover the operations' now being carried out in ex-German New Guinea..

If so, will he take steps to obviate this serious delay and loss? low:1. No. Grading of cheese for export, until recently, was mainly performed by State officials acting for the Commonwealth. Complaints from merchants in England regarding the unsatisfactory condition of Queensland cheeses were received. All cheese submitted for export in Queensland is now graded entirely by Commonwealth officers. 2. So far as the Commonwealth is concerned, there is now no dual system of grading cheese submitted for export. The whole of the grading is carried out by Commonwealth officers under, the supervision of a cheese expert. State legislation in Queensland, however, requires all cheese produced to be graded, whether for export or not; but, until the cheese is actually submitted for export, the Commonwealth cannot interfere. Recently, owing to State officials insisting on State laws being carried out in regard to cheese intended for export, a large quantity of cheese was held up; but, to protect exporters from hardship and inconvenience in consequence of that hold up, the Commonwealth allowed the cheese to be exported bearing grade marks which were inconsistent with Commonwealth grade marks. 3.

These statesmen demanded that the B r i tish Empire should have six votes, and be considered six States. that, according to article 3 of the Covenant, there would be three delegates each from Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, SouthA f r i c a , and India. The British Empire embodies all those States, and thus would be entitled to eighteen delegates, while America would have only three. not the main reason. reasons. There is a much stronger reason. is one of the main reasons. the League of Nations has ever attempted to deal with disarmament since its establishment ? answer that. The League was formed as an outcome of the war, when the statesmenof Europe, and President Wilson, saw the suffering due to the war, the ruined homes, the widows, the orphans, the wounded, the crippled, and the-blind, and they determined that something must be done to prevent futur e wars. signatories to the Peace Treaty and the original members of the League of Nations were:United States of America.

The whole of the latter States accepted the Covenant of the League, and came in . Nearly the whole of them were repreThat meant sented at the Assembly of the League at Geneva last year, and I believe nearly all of them are represented, and some other States as well, at the Conference now sitting at Geneva. Unfortunately, so little information is given regarding this League, which is the hope of the world, that we do not even know the names of the delegates. Of course, we have the name of our own representative (Captain Bruce), and we occasionally hear such names as those of Lord Robert Cecil and It is one of the main Monsieur Noblemaire. But we have nothing like the information which should be at our disposal. Article8 of the Covenant statesThe members of the League recognise that the maintenance of peace requires the reduoW ill you tell us if tion of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety, and the enforcement by common action of international obligations.

100,Mr Higgs,"Yes, I shall be able to the Assembly the acceptance of an undertaking not to exceed for the first two years following the next financial year the sum total of expenditure on the military, naval, and air services provided for in the next financial year. To show the difficulty with which President Harding is faced in this matter, I may mention that that resolution was withdrawn because it required unanimity, and the best the League could do was to get a recommendation carried. The opposition to the resolution was led by France. This recommendation was to submit for the consideration of members the acceptance of an undertaking not to exceed the current military Budget during the next two years unless required to do so by recommendation of the League, or by reason of exceptional circumstances notified to the League. The recommendation was carried by a large majority. That happened in 1920. Honourable members will see in the very sparse information which has been given to us : ' in the .cable : messages that the present Assembly at Geneva has approved of Lord Robert Cecil's report in reference to that matter. Lord Robert Cecil proposed the summoning of an International Conference in 1922 for the control of the private manufacture and traffic in arms. He also proposed the renewal of the request that all nations should agree not to inoreaso their naval and military Budgets for the next two years over those of the current year. port was carried. Honourable members will have seen that Monsieur Noblemaire, representing France, said that that country would give full support to the practical realization of disarmament, but demanded that there should be power to make investigations in all countries. "" France,"" he is reported to have said, ""was anxiously watching the tragedy which, was being enacted in Germany between the spirit of work, peace, and Democracy, and the spirit of war of the junkers. France was bound to keep an army in readiness. It was not her fault that circumstances compelled her to be ready to act as the world's police."" When President Harding meets the Conference delegates at Washington, and speeches are made by him and other delegates in favour of peace; when the delegates have been supplied with statistics concerning the huge indebtedness of the nations as a result of the late war; and when it is proposed that there shall be a reduction of armaments, the French delegation will express again the views that have been expressed on behalf of France during the last week or two at the Geneva Conference of the League of Nations. I have no doubt that President Harding will find that he can make no quicker progress than is being made by the present League of Nations. He will find that he will have to proceed in the same leisurely way. I do not believe for a moment that Monsieur Noblemaire, and the other Frenchmen who are unable to agree to a reduction of armaments, represent the opinion of the people of France. I do not believe that the objections to an endeavour to establish the world's peace, such as wero made in the speech by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt), who referred to what might happen in Poland owing to the warlike spirit of the population there, represent public opinion throughout the world. To my mind, the public opinion of the world is in favour of a union of civilized nations to reduce armaments and to lighten the burdens which the people have to carry. I believe that people welcome this League of Nations. They will support it, and will maintain it. I believe that the Washington Conference which President Harding has called is . the outcome of public The resolution to adopt the reopinion in the United States of America. I read, during the presidential campaign, that President Harding's opponent, Mi\ Cox, the democratic candidate, asked, "" What does Mr Harding propose to put in place of the League of Nations?"" He added, "" He has nothing to propose, because there can be nothing put in the place of the League."" In my opinion, the Washington Conference will fail to bring about a reduction of armaments; and I hope that Senator Pearce, the British delegation, and the other people who go there, will try to induce the United States of America to join the League of Nations, because only in that way can we bring about the desired reduction. I believe that only with the joining up of the United States of America with the League of Nations will the aims and objects of tbe League be obtained. In the absence of the United States of America, we cannot hope that the League will do what might otherwise be done. member think that good will come out of the Washington Conference in regard, say, to Naval matters? will be arrived at.

To my mind it cannot be brought about by the Conference that has just sprung into being. The business programme of the Washington Conference is a mere commonplace, if I may apply such a term to it , as compared w i th the programme of the Covenant of the League of Nations, which has been signed by the majority of the civilized Powers who were permitted to sign it . Let us take, for in instance, Article 11 of the CovenantAny war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the members of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League ehall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations. . . . .

Article 12 of the Covenant provides No ; it means somethatThe members of the League agree that if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, they will submit the matter either to arbitration or to inquiry by the Council, and they agree in no case to resort to war untilthree months after the' All that ought to be award by the arbitrators or the report by the Council. Article 13 readsThe members of the League agree that whenever any dispute shall arise between them which they recognise to be suitable for submission to arbitration and which cannot be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy, they will submit the whole subject-matter to arbitration. Theni n Article 14 it is provided thatThc Council shall formulate and submit to the members of the League for adoption plans for the establishment of a Permanent Court of International Justice.

People remind us that we have in Australia a territory of 2,974,501 square miles in-extent, with a population of something over 5,000,000, but they should remember that Japan controls Formosa, Korea, Manchuria, and on the borders of Manchuria is Mongolia, w i th an area of 1,367,600 square miles, and a population Japanese may go there. It will interest the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming), who is a pastoralist, to know that the Japanese are taking sheep fro m Australia to Mongolia and that they may be competitors of the honourable member and his colleagues in the pastoral industry of Australia. they can get in Korea. plenty of territory quite at their hands without bothering themselves about this country. Here is another very important Article of the Covenant of the League of Nations-Articl e 16. Should any member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under Articles 12, 13, or 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other members of the League, which hereby undertakes immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a member of the League or not. member think that the League of Nations would give effect to that Article? member that Japan has signed the Covenant of the League and has agreed to do so. if she attempted to break that Covenant? The most important States that could como into the League are members of it , and are obliged under its covenants to adopt means to punish any State which breaks them. I should like specially to direct the attention of honourable members opposite to Article 23, which readsSubject to and in accordance with the provisions of international conventions existing or hereafter to be agreed upon, the members of the League: (a) will endeavour to secure and maintain fair and humane conditions of labour for men, women, and children, both in their own countries and in all countries to which their commercial and industrial relations extend,'and for that purpose to establish and maintain the necessary international organizations;' (6) undertake to secure just treatment of the native inhabitants of territories estimated at 2,600,000. The under their control; (a) will entrust the League with the general supervision over the execution of agreements with regard to the traffic in women and children, and the traffic in opium and other dangerous. drugs. I notice that the question of the traffic in women and children came up at the Assembly of the League of Nations only They are taking a ll the other day. It is, I think, to be deplored that the French delegates-and this for the second time-oppose d the efforts of the League of Nations to tighten up the restrictions upon the ""white slave traffic. I notice from the meagre information supplied by the press that at the conference of t h e Assemblyi t was decided by a majority of 120 delegates to 5 to carry out the covenant of the League for the restriction of that traffic. W ill any member of this House affirm that the attitude of the French delegates who opposed the restriction of the white slave traffic represents the public opinion of so enlightened a race as the French people? I do not believe it for a single moment. I believe that, like a number of other so called leaders of public opinion, these delegates have got out of touch with the real sentiments of the people generally since the Great War. I again assert that, in my opinion, honourable members ought to pay more attention to the League of Nations, for in its maintenance and development under Divine Providence I remind the honourable lies one of the great hopes of humanity. I regret that during the course of this What would be thought of Japan debate the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference at Washington have been discussed as if they were to some extent antagonistic. I see no justification whatever for that view. Personally, I am a warm supporter of both the League of Nations and of the",34,Robert Best W H I L S T I Have Per Tions Is A Member Of I T And Has Agreed To

122,Mr Jowett (.Grampians) [12.50],"proposal of the United States President to bring about general disarmament of the-nations. The Conference which is to meet at ""Washington shortly should be regarded as complementary and supplementary to the work already done by the League'of Nations, and as in no sense opposed to their ideal. It is regrettable that the United States of America did not see its way to join the League of Nations, but their reasons, no doubt, seemed sufficient to the people of that country. But other nations should not regard the attitude of America as deserving of reproach or as a reason wKy the forthcoming Conference should not receive the generous support and assistance from all people who, like myself, and I believe every honourable member of this Chamber, love peace rather than war. the House is not so much the necessity . for the representation of Australia at the Conference as it is the method by which our representative should be chosen. In considering the method of selection, it is perhaps well to consider the objectives of those who desire that the nations of the world shall participate in the Conference. It also seems necessary to consider what is likely to be the attitude of Australia. I agree that Australia should be represented at the Conference; but it is highly important that this country should not be misrepresented. More attention should have been paid inside and outside this House to what is likely to be the attitude of Australia's representative at the Conference, because it seems to me that there is some danger of our being misrepresented. Not that I have anything to say against Senator Pearce, who has been chosen by the Government. personal considerations from this selection. member has any objection to the selection on personal grounds it is for him to. say so, but I will not associate myself with any personal references in contralia to attend the Washington Connexion with this matter.

At the dictation of the military classes of this country he has been insisting on putting boys of sixteen years of age into training camps for seventy days each year. He it was who conscripted Italians living in. Australia. I cannot forget the active part he took in the conscription campaign, nor help thinking of the attempt he made in the Senate a few weeks ago to thrust upon the Democracy of this country the British Army Act with all its faults and militarism. I cannot conceive of a man who would so act at the behest of the miliwhile Tasmania, with its small populatary classes as being a fit person to repretion, also has six. Honourable members sent Australia at a Conference where the main issue, for discussion is the question of disarmament or the limitation of armaments. His heart will not be in his task. A ll the time he will be thinking of what the military chiefs of Australia will be saying. We want to be represented by a man who will express the thoughts of the people of Australia, and impress them upon the Conference. sure that Senator Pearce will not be able to give a true reflexion of the feelings of the people here. one else could, and probably better. changed his views once or twice, and probably he is ready to make another change. He was a pacifist and anti-militarist. To-day his strongest supporter cannot charge him with being an anti-militarist. He carries out every recommendation made by the military chiefs. Throughout the war he, endorsed whatever they said. No matter what Parliament declared, the law was what the military heads of Australia declared it to be. Eveni f Senator Pearce were a desirable person to represent Australia, I contend that the choice should have been made from among honourable members in this Chamber. I do not ask, as the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) has asked, that the selection should be made by all the members of this Parliament. I agree with the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) that we should be guided by the traditions established under the British Constitution, as to the exercise of the powers of responsible government. ButT hold that the Government in the exercise of their responsibility should have chosen some He is a militarist. one who, having a seat in this Chamber, would be responsible to the House of Representatives. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) has asserted that the Senate has equal rights with this Chamber. I deny the contention. Honourable senators have not been elected upon the same democratic principle as have honourable members of this House. The basis of representation is not equitable. New South .Wales, for example, with its large population, provides only six members of the Senate, know Senator Pearce pretty well; they know that he will take very little note of anything that may be said from this side of the House. No man in Australia, apart from the military class, wishes to see another war. No man in this country, no matter how wealthy he may be, 'desires another outbreak of international hostilities; but there are influences being exerted throughout the world, which, if I am they are permitted to expand, will precipitate another war. WhatI would like Senator Pearoe to declare at Washington, and to lay down most emphatically to the financial institutions of Great Britain, is that if, because of their covetousness in seeking to exploit the markets of China, and in that way clashing with American and Japanese financial interests, war should break out between the United States of America and Japan, with Great Britain as the ally of the latter, not one Australian youth will leave these shores to fight with any yellow race against a white people. I have just read, in the locial press, that the London Daily Express, discussing the possibility of war between the United States of America and Japan, saidWill the Washington Conference avert the peril? Our information does not warrant optimism. The public must understand the country is standing again on the verge of tie abyss, and that Imperial interests in Canada, Australia, and the Far East are vitally threatened. In what way are the interests of the working classes of Great Britain or of Australia threatened by the actions and efforts of any group of financiers operating in China? The working people of the world may expect to get no gains from exploitations being carried, on there ; all they can",37,Robert Best W H I L S T I Have Per Tions Is A Member Of I T And Has Agreed To

146,Mr Mograth,"He has alreadylook for is the possibility of a great deal of suffering, misery, and loss. However, if that London journal be correct in its assertion, that we are again upon the verge of international hostilities, its comconfident, upon this matter of Great Briments can only refer to the fear and expectation of one war, namely, that wherein Great Britain and Japan will be in alliance against the white people of the United States of America. I can only say that it will take a great deal in the future to induce the Democracy of this country to leave its shores and fight again. There is not a shadow of doubt but that the workers of Australia will-never again be eager to participate in a war, no matter whether the flag under which they are asked to.fight be the Union Jack or any other. If the great financial corporations find their interests so clashing in China that war is precipitated between the yellow race and the white peoples of America, there need be no misunderstanding in Great -Britain, or at the Washington Conference, about the attitude of the Australian workers. No matter though the Mother Land range herself with her yellow allies, Australians will , not. fight side by side with them in that alliance. It would not take much, indeed, to induce the workers, of this country to range themselves alongside their kith and kin in the United States of America against the Japanese. to the workers of Great Britain. I trust, for the peace of the world, that the trade unions of this and every country will actively spread the gospel of peace. No war ean bring gain to the working man. sent to the Washington Conference who would speak clearly and distinctly in those terms to the representatives of the United Kingdom men who know full well the value of the Australian soldier on a battlefield-somethin g in the direction of disarmament might be brought about. The Australian delegate at Washington should not hesitate to tell the capitalistic authorities of Great Britain that never again will an Australian go to the aid of the British in any war in Which they may be assisting a yellow race to fight white men. I have no f a it h in Senator Pearce. I have no expectation that he will utter such sentiments as those. I do not believe he is a pacifist. I am not at all sure that he wall advocate disarmament. Though honourable members, on this side may be in the minority, I am' tain allying herself with Japan in the event of war being precipitated with the United States of America, that we are speaking on behalf of the great majority of the people of Australia. I repeat that I regret the choice made by the Government. I shall vote for the amendment in the hope that the Government will select one who is truly a pacifist, and who will earnestly press at the Conference for the disarmament of the nations.
