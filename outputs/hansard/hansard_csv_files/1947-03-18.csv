Six L.S.T.'s could carry 12,000 tons of food to Britain quickly. in Britain about May, which is the time experts predict Britain will have reached a food climax. The Minister says that these ships need repairs which would take two months. I do not believe that, if the ships were required for operational purposes during the war, anything like this time would be needed. The plight of the people of Britain to-day is as desperate as it was during the war, and emergency measures should be taken to give them all possible assistance. The Government is entitled to undertake repairs on the same high priority basis as in war-time. ""Whilst L.S.T.'s may not be suitable for some types of food, such as perishable goods, they are eminently suitable for tinned foods, which are in unlimited supply in Australia as they are unrationed and load every grocer's shelves throughout the country. This is a proposal for which, in the final analysis, the Government need only provide the ships. The people of Australia can provide the food if the Government fails to do so, and the ships can be manned by volunteer crews. I have already received the names of many volunteers. Although the wartime complement of an L.S.T. is 70 officers and men, this could be reduced to approximately 25 or 30 for food transport purposes. An emergency gift of 12,000 tons of food conveyed in this way would be a gesture both to Britain and to the world that Australia intends to help Britain meet its crisis, but it should be followed up by a vigorous policy which would expand shipments over and above those already contemplated in current programmes. Either these ships rust and rot in Sydney Harbour, or they are utilized on "" Operation Food "". WAR. by leave-On Friday last the Minister for the Army( Mr Chambers), in answer to a question addressed to him by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull), made a certain statement of Government policy. I have no desire to These ships could arrive traverse that aspect of the matter, but to deal solely with the Minister's remark about what the War Gratuity Committee is alleged to have done in 1945. The Minister said that the payment of war gratuity in respect of World WarI . to all members who served overseas was something in the nature of compensation for disabilities which such members of the fighting forces may have suffered. He said that a similar situation existed in respect of men who served in World War II . , and he then quoted an extract from the report of the War Gratuity Committee, the most important portion of which readsI n considering tlie gra.tuity for overseas service, the view was taken that this should be fixed at a figure which would afford some recognition of the arduous and hazardous periods which are generally associated with such service. . . . I was a member of the W a r G r a t u it y Committee. The Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) was chairman, and other members included the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) and my colleagues the honourable member for tor Collett. In my following remarks I am authorized to speak on behalf of my two colleagues. I make it clear that at no stage of the proceedings did the committee discuss prisoners of war, or how they would be affected in respect of any gratuity. The terms of reference of the committee did not allow us to do so even had we been so minded. The terms of reference were1. The committee was appointed by the What is the alternative? Prime Minister to consider and report on methods of recognition of the services of .the fighting forces in the war. 2. The basis of the committee's consideration was the Prime Minister's announcement that the committee would be constituted to i:uiisidei' .the question of a gratuity based on the principle of place and length of service, or payment for extended leave based on the same principle, .and/or other methods of indicating the nation's recognition of the services given by the fighting forces. The first of the decisions reached by the committee was] . That recognition should be regarded as a thanksgiving from the nation for the services",13,Trans Australian
17,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),,14,Subsistence Allowance Lif E Insurance
18,Corangamite ( Mr Mcdonald) And Sena,"rendered, and not as a rehabilitation, or repatriation, measure. That clearly shows the attitude of the War Gratuity Committee on this matter. I say without equivocation that the committee was never authorized at any time to say whether prisoners, of war should be paid money in lieu of rations which they did not receive. It did not discuss that aspect. Therefore, the Minister for the Army should make it quite clear to the claimant soldiers concerned, and to the country, that the War Gratuity Committee was in no way responsible for, or in any way condoned, or supported, the attitude which he adopted on this matter on Friday last. Dame ENID LYONS A case recently came to my notice, which I have reason to believe is not an isolated one, of an ex-prisoner of war who, having been discharged from the forces as medically f it , applied for life insurance when be proposed to be married, and his application was refused on the ground that his health was not sufficiently good to warrant the company issuing a policy. Will the Minister give consideration to a proposal that, in the event of the death of an ex-serviceman who has been unable to obtain life insurance for the protection of his dependants because of the effects of his war service, and where his disability is non-assessable, he shall be deemed to have been a pensioner at the maximum rate and his dependants shall be treated accordingly? orable member's question is largely hypothetical, I shall have it examined with a view to ascertaining whether a procedure can he devised to meet any such cases that may arise. which I desire to ask the Minister for the Interior, I refer to a recent announcement made by his department and also an announcement by the Minister for Works and Housing that it is the intention of the Government to carry out an extensive building programme in the National Capital over the next five years, and to adopt measures whereby the present population may be increased. In view of this announcement I ask the Minister whether his department has decided to increase the carrying capacity of the Cotter Dami n order to ensure an adequate water supply to meet the increase of population and to provide for the expansion of industry within the capital? W ill the Minister state whether the Government intends to provide a permanent water supply for the township of Hall? During the term of the last Parliament the then Minister for the Interior, Senator Collings, received a deputation of citizens of H a l l , introduced by the honourable member for Eden Monaro and myself, and promised that when, man-power and materials were available he would give such a project every consideration. part of the honourable member's question first, it is a fact that my predecessor gave an undertaking to the citizens of Hal] that when man-power and materials became available he would investigate the possibility of providing a water supply for that township. Since assuming office, I , too, have discussed the project with the residents of H a l l . I can do no more at the moment than say that that project will receive consideration when other more urgent works have been completed. The proposal to increase the carrying capacity of the Cotter Dam has been made the subject of investigations by the technical officers of the Department of Works and Housing. I shall consult with the Minister controlling that department, and advise the honourable member as to the position. ON FARM LOANS. MrM c EWEN I refer to the most recent report of the Rural Reconstruction Commission, wherein the commission recommended to the Government that, for reasons set out in the report, the controls imposed on primary industries should, in its opinion, be removed as early as possible.

Subsequently I learnt that the Joint Coal Board had arranged for Professor J ones to meet representatives of the miners federation at Newcastle on that day. It was not possible, therefore, for me to meet him. Professor Jones, however, has every intention of visiting certain coal mines in Queensland. For the information of all honourable gentlemen I desire to state that I have had some discussion with SSr David Rivett .about the work that is being done in this country by Professor Jones. It has been suggested to me that it would be excellent if Professor Jones could give an address to members of Parliament during which a film dealing with research into coal dust could be screened. I hope, with 'the consent of the President and Mr Speaker, to arrange for this to be done, but I-do not think it will be possible to do so 'until after the Easter recess.",16,ANZAC Day Final Of Loan Quiz Competition

If so, what effect will this change have upon the amount to be provided by Australian taxpayers in connection with the New Zealand wheat deal as far as the current season is concerned ? Wheat Board has advanced the price of wheat to approximately 16s. a bushel. Obviously, that will have an effect on the wheat agreement with New Zealand while the high prices prevail, but it is the general opinion that the higher wheat values sky-rocket now, the lower will be the depths to which they will plunge eventually. I desire to inform honourable members regarding a position which has developed in connection with the printing and publishing of Hansard. I have been advised by the Government Printer that, owing to staff shortages at the Government Printing Office, the publication of Hansard may he delayed. There may be delay also in the issue of proofs of members' speeches and of "" flats "". In view of this, I suggest that honourable members assist by reducing to a minimum, first, requests for the inclusion of tabulated matter in Hansard, and, secondly, purely verbal alterations which they are permitted to make in the proofs of their speeches. doctors and dentists in the Royal Australian Navy whose period of war service, unlike that of similar practitioners in the Army, has not yet been terminated. These young men experience difficulty in rehabilitating themselves, and their release, I suggest, has been inordinately delayed. Will the Minister for the Navy examine the position of the men who are due for discharge and, if possible, expedite their return to their civil practices? In the Army, I understand, civil surgeons and dentists are being released and are rehabilitating themselves. are not members of the permanent forces tralian Navy. At present, there is a grave shortage of medical officers, and these doctors are required not only to examine men who are being demobilized but also for general purposes within this service. The Navy has found it difficult to release all of them, but as quickly as possible these men are being discharged. As soon as circumstances permit, they will all he released. nesday, the 12th March, the honourable member for Wentworth asked a question concerning licences to import watches, in which he made particular mention of the licence granted to the honourable member for Watson. The Minister for Trade and Customs has informed me that special quotas to cover the importation of watches to the value of £2,700 for each approved applicant were originally granted to 23 ex-servicemen, of whom the honourable member for Watson was one. The granting of these quotas was followed by a flood of over 200 further applications from ex-servicemen. As the granting of similar quotas in all cases would have involved a huge expenditure of Swiss currency, it was decided to review all applications and quotas. The review was made by committees representing the Department of Trade and Customs and the watch trade. Eligibility for a special quota was determined in each case, chiefly on the applicant's claim to assistance towards his rehabilitation. As a result of this review, quotas granted were either terminated or renewed on a reduced basis. As the honourable member for Watson was not regarded as needing such assistance, the quota originally granted in his favour was not renewed.

This dispute is causing serious hardships to the potential consumers, and financial loss to the Commonwealth Government, which has already acquired shipments now in Sydney.

The waterside dispute in Sydney is having very serious consequences not only to those whom the honourable member mentioned but also to the public who need these perishable goods. The Minister for Supply and Shipping and, to a lesser degree, myself, have spent a great deal of time in endeavouring to find a solution of this unfortunate and, I think I should say, unwarranted happening that has occurred in Sydney due to the waterside dispute. I understand that to-day or to-morrow, the Stevedoring Industry Commission, under the Conciliation Commissioner, Mr that Charles Cousens has not had a fair Morrison, will hold another meeting to discuss the position.

69,Mr Speaker,"Order! The PrimeDebate resumed from tbe 5th March, (vide page 359), on motion by Dr. That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is a classic example of action which the Government has been forced to take in order to cover up the mistake of one of its instruments, namely, the Stevedoring Industry Commission. The commission decided that workers should receive 16s. a day attendance money on those days when they did not work. This amount was eventually reduced by the Government to 12s., and the present bill is designed to raise money in the form of tax in order to pay attendance money to the waterside workers. The decision of the commission to pay attendance money was improper in the first place, because no temporary body of the kind bad power to take such action. In the past, the Arbitration Court administered industrial awards. Indeed, in this instance, it was the Arbitration Court that framed the award for the waterside workers. The cost of administering awards was borne by Consolidated Revenue. Now, the Government has decided to take the stevedoring industry out of the Arbitration Court, and place it in the hands of the Stevedoring Industry Commission. I doubt whether any bill of this kind would have been introduced had it not been necessary to cover up the improper action of the Stevedoring In dustry Commission. The effect of the bill is to impose a tax of 4Jd. per manhour, and it is calculated that the tax will return approximately £550,000 a year. Of this, about £350,000 will be needed to pay attendance money, while the remaining £250,000 will be used to meet the administrative expenses of the commission. There was never any reason why the commission should have ruled that attendance money be paid. The Arbitration Comrt had fixed a wage of 4s. an hour for waterside workers, because it recognized the casual nature of the work; but the commission, acting under pressure, member must confine his remarks to the ordered that attendance money be paid bill before the Chair. The amendment in addition. That is one aspect of the matter, and it is an important one-importan t enough in itself to merit a full debate in this House. However, there is another aspect, namely, that the machinery of the Taxation Department will be 'used to collect this money at a time when that Department is itself under criticism for the tremendous power which resides in the hands of the Commissioner for Taxation. I recognize that it is essentially a committee bill to set up the machinery for financing the operations of the Stevedoring Industry Commission. waterside The Government now proposes to separate the functions of the Arbitration Court, and to set up little pockets of control all over the country. These, instead of being financed out of Consolidated Revenue, as is the Arbitration Court, are to be financed by burdens placed directly upon the industries themselvesa most important departure from principles hitherto observed. The Stevedoring Industry Commission has been criticized in this House for failing to do its job of administering war-time regulations, but the principle of commission-control is now to be perpetuated. It is something which the Government proposes to foist upon the industry. The Government, in effect, says, "" We are not interested in the efficiency of your side of the industry; we are responsive only to the pressure exerted upon us by the waterside workers. Therefore, you must take it and like it. Not only must you take it and like it, but you must also pay for it "" . This will have a prejudicial effect on the industry, and also upon shippers, because the extra burden must be reflected in increased freight charges. Every measure introduced by the Government in recent years clarifies the pattern of socialization which is part of the Labour party's policy. Under the Stevedoring Industry Bill, this industry will be completely socialized; and, indeed, the amendment which has just been forecast makes it perfectly clear that the Government proposes to take active steps The SPEAE:ER -The honourable to which he refers is not yet under consideration.",21,Order Of Business

Already the taxpayers are being taxed in order to finance the industrial courts. They are being taxed to finance all payhappen should the waterside workers ments prescribed under awards in respect of the watersiders' work. This bill will impose another form of taxation. The taxpayers will now be compelled to meet not only payments involved .under this measure, but also the cost of the estabwill the Government draw upon Conlishment of the Stevedoring Industry Commission, which is estimated at nearly £600,000. But that is only a first smack; panies, in order to make up the we can envisage the astronomical propordeficit? tions to which that cost will ultimately develop. It is a good start when the Government sets up a new industrial commission and says to the taxpayers: "" Notwithstanding the fact that we are already taxing you to meet the administrative charges of all our industrial courts, we are now setting up another body in that sphere, and we propose to tax you still further not only to meet the administrative charges of the commission, but also to pay attendance money to the waterside workers "". The provision of attendance money was bitterly criticized when the Stevedoring Industry Bill was before the House. It is true whilst this tax will be extorted from .the stevedoring and shipping companies, they will have the right to pass it on; and of course, the tax, ultimately, will be passed on to the unfortunate producer, or shipper, who commission will be still-born, because the will thus have to defray the costs of attendance money and the administration of the commission. The Stevedoring Industry Commission, having improperly granted attendance money, the Government now geeks to cover up that blunder and looks to the shipper to bear the cost involved. I do not know whether the proposed rate of 4£d. per man hour is too high. Perhaps, the estimate has been worked out between the Government and those who must provide the wherewithal; but the total estimate appears to be nearly £600,000. that that figure will be increased to £1,550,000 before the Stevedoring Industry Commission has been operating for many years. As I have said, the estimate sum of money, and that money will be 1 should like to know from the Attorney General (Dr. Evatt) what is going to go on strike, because in those circumstances the estimate of collections in respect of attendance money on the basis of 4£d. per man-hour will not be realized. Should such circumstances arise solidated Revenue, or impose additional charges upon the stevedoring comShould only half of the wharf lahourers work during a given period, who will provide the balance of the amount estimated to be required to finance the commission? Doesi t mean that an additional charge of say 9d. per man-hour, or Is. per man-hour, will be imposed in order to finance the scheme? Those questions raise interesting possibilities, because the Stevedoring Industry Commission has been brought into being in order to establish peace on the waterfront. The present temporary commission has failed to achieve that objective. Earlier this afternoon I pointed out that its administration has led to riots in Sydney, and members of Parliament are being bashed in the Sydney Domain because they dare to express their opinion as to what should be done to establish peace on the waterfront. Therefore, it seems that the new existing body has not proved effective and exercises no control over the men. This bill is the outcome of a weakness in the existing commission, because it is designed to enable the new commission to do something which a temporary body could not do; and now the Government asks the Parliament to co-operate with it in covering up a mistake made by the existing body. There are other interesting aspects of the measure.

I am concerned about some recent disclosures made by the Commissioner of Taxation in a report relating to the activities of certain retail stores. It should be an accepted principle that any person who makes outside the Parliament statements which reflect upon the integrity of others, whether they he individuals, companies or corporations, shall be subject to challenge at law. It is true that members of Parliament frequently take advantage of parliamentary privilege in criticizing the activities of others; but if , outside the House, they made reflections upon persons or companies similar to those made by the Commissioner of Taxation regarding certain retail firms, they would be subject to a challenge at law. I take strong exception to the fact that persons, other than -representatives of the people in the Parliament, should be permitted by way may require the of written report to make charges against individuals, firms, companies or corporations, without being subject to liability to prove the accuracy -of such charges. Glark) -The honourable member must connect his remarks with the bill. in my opinion, strictly relevant to the bill. The point I make is that power is to be given to the Commissioner of Taxation to have access to the books of an industry of the business of Which he knows nothing. Although he may have no practical knowledge of the industry he may place his own interpretation upon the acts of those engaged in it. He may even unwittingly reflect upon the integrity of persons engaged in it, but they will have no redress under the law. The High CouTt has recently upheld the authority of the Commissioner of Taxation to make privileged statements in his report to the Parliament -believe that the industry itself should The same powers are to be given to him with respect to the stevedoring industry as he now possesses under the general income tax legislation. given specifically in respect of the stevedoring industry? The ""Commissioner of Taxation may have no specific knowledge of the customs or practices that have grown up over the years in any particular industry. The attitude of the Commissioner of Taxation is that he does not care about established practices in an industry. He says, "" To me it appears that some evasion has taken place, and I therefore propose that in my report to the Parliament I shall blast your name and you will have no right to challenge my observations "". The provision specifically giving the Commissioner of Taxation power to do that, of course, applies to the employer; but what do we 'find with regard to the employee? No action has been taken by this Government to include in the bill a specific clause that the books of the Waterside Workers Federation shall be made available to the Commissioner of Taxation. It is true that the Commissioner has general power 'to examine them, and I do not know why that general power should not be sufficient to enable the Commissioner of Taxation to carry out what he-may regard as a necessary investigation of the affairs of the stevedoring industry. It is obvious that the Government's intention is to render the task of the stevedoring industry for the nationalization of the industry. This is a machinery bill, in respect of a number of clauses of which we shall require specific information from the Minister. It is extraordinary to find that the Government should introduce a measure into this House to cover up or to validate some improper act of the existing Stevedoring Industry Commission. If that commission had not committed the Government to an expenditure from Consolidated Revenue of £350,000 for the payment of attendance money, a ""bill such as this would never have been introduced. The Government says, in effect, "" Y o u have made a mistake that has cost us £350,000. We do not consider that we should carry that burden. We carry it, and therefore we intend to levy on the employers a charge of 4£. for each man-hour of employment on the waterfront in order to finance the administraWhy should such power be tive expenses and attendance money payments incurred by the commission"". It is a poor state of affairs when a commission is able to force the Government to introduce a hill the effect of which will be to impose double taxation upon certain individuals. Although this measure appears to be almost book-like in its scope, a close examination of it shows that it could be condensed into one sentence. Its sole intention is that industry generally shall be taxed by over £550,000 a year in addition to the heavy imposts already levied. It is merely a taxation measure. On ""almost every page of it reference is made to the powers and duties of the Commissioner of Taxation and his deputies. It states how much money is recoverable, and what shall happen to the unfortunate stevedoring companies which f ail to meet his demands. The bill provides that the Commissioner of Taxation may force them into bankruptcy, and recover moneys from their assets'? What taxes are already levied upon industry? First there is the payroll tax which is substantial, and then 'there is the sales tax which has wide application. Although this new tax is to be imposed, ostensibly, upon organizations employing waterside workers, in",23,Evatt
74,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr So Difficult As To Create A Specious Reason,,25,Evatt
75,Mr Harrison,"My remarks are,",25,Evatt
76,Mr Amthony (Richmond) [4.30],"practice the charge will he passed on to industry generally. Clause 12 provides that the charge in respect of the employment of any waterside worker shall be paid by the employer of that waterside worker, but it also states that an employer ing or unloading ships, or does it include shall have the right to recover the amount of the charge from the person to whom an account is rendered. In plain terms it means that this tax can be passed on, and will in effect be an additional imposilar section of workers who have defied the tion on the cost of loading and unloading ships. Although the stevedoring companies and shipping companies showed some concern at first because of the proposal to impose this tax upon them, they soon found .that their fears were groundless because the bill would entitle them to add 5 per cent, or 10 per cent, to their present charges. Who, then, will ultimately pay this tax? It will be paid on exportsI am ignoring imports for the moment because it is difficult to analyze them-and as 90 per cent, of our exports are primary products, the burden finally will rest upon the primary producers. These unfortunate individuals will not be able to pass on the charge. The bill does not provide that the primary producers may recover this money from the the Government, or that if their already enormous difficulties are increased, relief will be granted to them. The primary producer will be forced eventually to appeal to the Parliament, through his elected representative, for assistance. He is being driven into a corner. Probably the Government will eventually graDt him some relief in the form of a subsidy, and then in the Domain and elsewhere, government supporters will refer in sneering tones to these "" beggars "" on the Government's doorstep, as they have referred in the past to dairy-farmers and others. This measure is unworthy of the time of honourable members. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) has given a clear exposition of its purpose, which as I have said, is to force the people of Australia, mainly the primary producers, to subsidize the waterside workers to the tune of 12s. for their beds listening for a call for labour which they hope will not come. Although a considerable portion Mr Anthony. of the bill has been devoted to definitions I cannot find any definition of a ""manhour "". What does it mean ? Does it mean the time that a waterside worker is engaged specifically on the task of loadhis ""listening"" time as well? That, however, is a detail. The main fact is that £550,000 a year is to be taken from the community and paid to this particuGovernment for the last two years. This is to be a reward for their defiance of the law. The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) has been more humiliated than any other member of the Government by the organization that this bill is designed to benefit. The waterside workers have taken the foreign policy of this country out of the right honourable gentleman's hands. The honourable member must confine his remarks to the bill. to the bill now. I am merely drawing attention to what has been done by the men who are to benefit by this measure. deals with the imposition, assessment, and collection of a certain charge. act "" relating to the imposition, assessment and collection of a charge in respect of the employment of waterside workers "".

82,Mr Anthony,"I will not labourI do so with the specific object of once more calling the attention of the workers of this country to the initiation of a system that in my opinion will eventually lead to industrial conscription. I believe that clauses 22 to 25, and particularly sub-clause 2 of the last-mentioned clause, of the Stevedoring Industry Bill are the root of the troubles inherent in that bill. Until the. Senate has dealt with them we should hold up this measure, the operation of which is entirely dependent on the passage of the Stevedoring Industry Bill through the Senate. Tf that bill is not passed by the Senate this bill will be absolutely inoperative. It is my belief that if the dangers inherent in that bill should become thoroughly known to the masses of the people of this country that measure will he rejected by the Senate in no uncertain terms. Before saying why I support the amendment; moved by the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons). I desire to make a few general observations on the hill. The measures necessary to give effect to the Government's plan to control the stevedoring industry are the Stevedoring Industry Bill, which passed through this House last week, the Stevedoring Industry Charge Assessment Bill, with which we are now dealing, and the Stevedoring Industry Charge Bill, which will be founded on a resolution of a Committee of Ways and Means. The bill passed last week might well be described as "" an act to destroy the Australian system of compulsory arbitration and introduce a system of industrial conscription "". The right honourable member is not entitled to debate the Stevedoring In dustry Bill, but must confine his remarks to the bill before the House. properly be described as "" a bill designed to destroy the sea-borne trade of Australia "". The measures to be taken after the passage of this bill will clearly indicate how that will be done. Ninety per cent, of Australia's interstate trade is by sea. Ships carry our goods abroad. Under this and related measures nearly £600,000 a year will be added to freights,. because, as the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) has rightly pointed out, this bill provides for the charge to be passed on to the exporters and importers. We have heard a great deal about the impossibility of the Government providing the money to endow the first child of a family. A pay-roll tax of 2£ per cent, is levied which assists to provide funds with which to endow all children hut the first in each family. The charge to be levied under the Stevedoring Industry Charge Bill will be 4^d. a man-hour on a wage of 4s. an hour. That is to say that the charge will be 8-J per cent. It is a pay-roll tax at almost four times the rate of the pay-roll tax levied to finance child endowment. The money collected under the Stevedoring Industry Charge Bill is to be used to pay attendance money to waterside workers if they are not required to work and to provide certain amenities in connection with the stevedoring industry. It is a scandal that the Parliament should be complacent enough to provide for the imposition, assessment and collection of a charge of 8-J per cent, on the pay-roll of those controlling the stevedoring industry when the Government pleads that it has insufficient money to endow the first child, which is much more important than anything contained in this measure. I direct the attention of honourable members to the almost empty Government benches at a time when legislation such as this is being debated. It is to a great degree true that, as was said by the honourable member for Richmond, the charge will fall entirely on the exporters and importers, but it will bear upon every consumer. It may be that the exporter will not be able to pass on the charge and that it will have to be taken from the pittance that he gets for his goods, but, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, know from your business dealings, the charge will be levied on goods handled on the wharfs. The result of the charge will be that what is regarded as a reasonable amount to be paid for labour on the waterfront will be increased by 8^ per cent. This country is cursed with breaks of gauge which are not likely to be eliminated for years, that considerably",26,Evatt

The use of the railway system will not he a means of escaping increased interstate sea freights. It is disgraceful when every one should be endeavouring to reduce the costs of production that the Government should even contemplate levying a charge like this, which is to be collected not by the Stevedoring Industry Commission but by the Taxation Commissioner. I direct attention to the fact that the size of this bill is almost' equal to that of the Income Tax Assessment Act. This bill relates to tfie imposition, assessment and collection of a charge of 4$d. per man hour worked by men employed on tie waterfront. The Income Tax Assessment Act relates to a Himalayan sum of money compared with tlie amount that will be collected under this legislation. The Government is using a steam hammer to crack a nut. I agree entirely with, the views expressed by the honourable member for Darwin. This bill and its associated measures' represent the thin edge of the wedge of industrial conscription. If the Government another, prevent certain people from obtaining work in a certain industry, it can do so' in relation to any other industry. The enactment of this legislation may Bring great misfortune upon Australia. had an opportunity to examine the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid' Lyons).,, and I find that it is' out o£ order.

No other amendment may be moved' to such Question except in the form of a resoluthe liabilities that the Government may tion strictly relevant to the Bill. The amendment submitted by the' honourable member for Darwin does not comply with those requirements, and I therefore rule it out of order.

Dame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [4.52]. -6-! / leave I move That the word "" now "" be left out, and that the words "" this day six months"" beadded to the question. My reasons for doing so are precisely the same as those which I stated previously. I have much pleasureinsupporting tie amendment. The Government has acted : prematurely in bringing this bill before the House at this stage. Last week the House dealt with the Stevedoring Industry BiB, but that measure has not been1 passed by the Senate. Therefore, it ha's not yet become law. During the passage of that bill', the Attorhey-G'eneraf (Dr. Evatt') endeavoured to impress' upon us the freedom and independence that would be' enjoyed by the commission proposed to can, by one means or' be established under its terms.

Tlii's bill anticipates the decision, of the' occur from day; to day?new commission on this subject. In this connection, I draw the' attention of the' House to a judgment delivered on the ll'th February of this year by Judge Eoster, who had. been asked to adjudicate upon certain questions in relation to waterside work. Although lie. did not make any award on the subject of attendance money,. Judge Foster did state that there was some case for the payment of attendance money to waterside workers in view of the fact that,, by a special order of the Stevedoring Industry Commission,, they were compelled to hold themselves in attendance in respect of every daily pickup; National Security Regulations,, and I do not. know whether it will be upheld by the commission to be appointed. However,, the new commission may reasonably hold the view that,, whilst waterside workers are entitled to attendance money when, they attend, pick-up places but are not. engaged for work, they should also be subject to a fine equal, to the attendance fee if they fail to. attend, pick-up. places when instructed."" to. do so. In that event; the amount, of the Commonwealth's liability in respect of the attendance money may be much, less than the Attorney-General expects. Thousands of men on the. waterfront to-day refuse to attend pick-up places and. refuse, to accept, work that is available to them. This measure, is extremely premature in view of our lack of knowledge of the liability which may be placed upon the Treasury to finance the payment of attendance fees. Certain of the. powers which the. new commission, will possess, will involve expenditure.; but. the House is not in a position at this stage to make even an approximate estimate of these liabilities'. The introduction of this bill at this juncture' is completely in line with the policy of this Government. It ' has always insisted; thatindustrial 1 authoritiessuchas theStevedoring In dustry Commissionand. the. Maritime Industry Commission, were entirely freefrom political influence; but weknowthat they have, been completely under thedomination either of trade, unions or the Government. How can any industrial authority give an unprejudiced or independent decision when things: like, this Mr H'OU.OWAY -What things? M-r. McBRIDE I refer to' theaction of the Government in asking this House to vote money to meet liabilities which : the Stevedoring Industry Commission has not yet incurred. The-new authority has not yet Been created . How can the! Go1 vernment anticipate what the financial requirements of that Body will Be? But by this action, the Government gives alead' to the watersideworkers^ and other trade unionists, who are makingclaimsupon Commonwealth! industrial' authorities for increasesof wages and That order was made under improved conditions. In this instance, the Government says to the waterside workers, "" Y o u askfbr attendance money, amenities and improved' conditions, because the necessary money will be collected""! For somes years, these tradeunionists have not required any encouragement of this nature' from the' Government or any other authority. One of the tragedies' of the present time is that Australia has been prevented by incessant hold-upsin' many of its most important industries from proceeding toimplement its post-war programme-. Unless this Government is prepared, not only to give authority to its industrial tribunals, but also to support the enforcement of their awards, this unfortunate position will not improve. According to reports in thenewspapersprobably they are completely unfounded -the Government does not propose to proclaim, the Stevedoring Industry Bill, Because of the constant stoppages in Australian ports. If that be the intention of the Government, surely there is no urgent need for the Parliament to pass this bill'. I , for one; have much pleasure in supporting the amendment, and if it he defeated, I shall oppose the second reading of the bill. ficial examination exposes this bill as a taxing measure designed to raise approximately £600,000 from shipowners for the purpose of meeting the expenses of the Stevedoring Industry Commission. As the result of that superficial examination, I desire to offer several criticisms. I find it extraordinary that, for the first time in our industrial history, the machinery of arbitration will be financed by the particular industry in which the workers concerned are employed. That proposal is without precedent, and the principle underlying it is very curious and unjustifiable. I do not know whether this industry alone will be required to finance its own arbitration system, or whether the Government intends eventually to introduce some device that will compel each industry to do so. I always helieved that the principle of arbitration was so deeply implanted and so completely accepted in Australia that the cost of making awards should be a charge against the budget. Therefore, I object to the proposed tax as I regard it as a departure from established principles. I object also to this proposal on more out of the annual budget. Although general grounds. As the honourable memprotests are now being made against this ber for Richmond( Mr Anthony) pointed proposed tax, the impost later will be out, honourable members should not think completely forgotten, and become simply for a moment that this tax will be borne another small load on our export indusultimately by the shipowners. The truth tries and on the cost of living. This inis that those people who are not able to direct tax will be just one more reason pass on the impost will bear it. The Gowhy the basic wage earner will wonder vernment will meet the expenses of the why his wages do not nearly meet the cost commission by means of an indirect tax of living. Partly as the result of this rather than by a direct tax. An indirect imposition, the values of our exports will tax is a most vicious form of taxation, fall, and we shall be less able, as a primbecause it eventually bears more heavily ary-producing country, to bear the impact upon the community generally than does of the decline. For those two reasons any direct tax, and the responsibility for which I have mentioned, namely, the having imposed it is not so evident. In new principle of making industry pay for fact, the responsibility is eventually the cost of arbitration and the unsoundforgotten. wards"" all the time. plain that. A direct tax, like the income tax, is the first and last imposition. The indirect tax which will be levied under this bill will be imposed upon the shipowner, who will pass it on in freights and other charges to the importer, who will pass it on to the wholesaler, who will' pass it on to the retailer, who will pass it on to the consumer. That is a brief description of the process of passing on an indirect tax. We know that, in the channels of tradeand commerce, the tax will be passed, on by many more people than the few whom I mentioned. Do those people passon the exact amount of tax! We know that they do not. With the sales tax they do not. The wholesaler or retailer whopays sales tax marks up the price of hisgoods in order to make a profit, not only on the actual price of the goods, but alsoon the sales tax. As the right honorable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page)stated, an indirect tax of this kind continually "" pyramids upwards "" until the ultimate purchaser-the home-consumer or an export industry-wil l bear the tax;, and the amount of the impost on the final transaction may be twice as much as theoriginal tax. Therefore, from the standpoint of public finance, this proposal is bad. The Government, which proclaims itself in favour of anti-inflationary measures, should take the sound, anti-inflationary course of meeting the charges of the Stevedoring Industry Commission ness financially of the plan, the proposal ia a bad one. At the outset, I explained what a superficial examination of the measure revealed. A detailed examination discloses that it is a part of the mechanics for",28,Evatt

95,Mr Mcewen,"I was about to exfinancing the Stevedoring Industry Bill. I objected to the entire proposal, and I feel impelled to object to this aspect of it. The purpose of this legislation is to secure industrial peace on the waterfront and to expedite the handling of goods more effectively than under the present system. For the good of this country, and for the export industries, I would be prepared to tolerate almost any measure if I were convinced that, irrespective of its viciousness, its immediate application would achieve the ultimate result of peace on the waterfront .and the expeditious handling of cargoes. But will this measure achieve this end? For two reasons, I am sure that it will have exactly the opposite effect. The first is that it will produce an unbalanced -condition in the payment of men for their services in the various industries in which they are employed. The soundness of arbitration in this country rests upon one simple authority which bases its awards for various industries by relating one to another. The very basis of industrial peace is that men in one industry shall not feel that they are being worked longer hours, or paid lower wages, than their fellow men in another industry. No more deadly threat could be made to the industrial peace of this country than to embark upon a course of action which is bound to cause thousands of men to believe that some work under more favorable awards than do others. Therefore, I contend that this is a bad principle. My second objection is that this bill reveals the success of pressure politics. If it is once demonstrated that a government can be coerced into giving special consideration to one section of the workers merely by the application of political pressure and the creation of continuous industrial unrest, it is a bad day for Australia. Who are the people who have obtained this favoured treatment? The waterside workers! They will have their own industrial tribunal. Alone among the workers in this country, they are to be paid for working and not working. -Order! The honourable member is embarking on a speech which may have been a very good one had it been delivered on the Stevedoring Industry Bill. The measure now before the chamber provides for the levying of a charge for the purpose of financing that bill. Whilst the argument advanced by the honourable member may be a good one, it is irrelevant to this measure. your ruling, Mr Speaker; but my view is that I should oppose this charge because it will achieve a certain result. If my opposition to this charge has allowed my imagination to take flight vision in the Standing Orders for imagination. MrM c EWEN I do not desire to discuss the Stevedoring Industry Bill. However, I emphasize that the object of the bill now before the House is to levy a special tax for a definite purpose and for the immediate advantage of one section of workers ruling applies to the latter portion of the honourable member's remarks. The House has already decided that a commission shall be set up. This bill deals with the method of financing its operations. It may be a good or a bad charge, but the merits of whether the Stevedoring Industry Bill should or should not have been introduced have nothing to do with this bill. canvass your ruling, Mr Speaker, or discuss whether a commission should be set up. WhatI am entitled to canvass is whether this commission should be financed in the way proposed in this bill. To reach a conclusion on that, I feel bound to examine the historical background which led to the introduction a special tax upon goods handled and upon wages paid on the waterfront is a privilege which has been secured by reason of the pressure applied by the Waterside Workers Federation. marks may have been quite applicable to the debate on the Stevedoring Industry Bill, but the House is now considering whether the method proposed for raising the money required under that",30,Evatt

In my view, the circumstances in which that measure was passed were such that this bill should not be proceeded with until we know the .final shape which the act will take as the result of the deliberations upon .the bill in the Senate. Certain requests for the amendment of the other bill were made during the consideration of it in committee-request s of which, doubtless, you, Mr Speaker, quite open and public, between the Minister in charge of the bill (Dr. Evatt) and the Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward). It was quite obvious that Ministers themselves were not satisfied with the shape in which the other bill left this chamber. In the circumstances, Turning to another the Attorney-General promised to have certain matters examined, and probably to have amendments made in the Senate. Those matters are vital. Until we know the final shape in which the legislation will go on the statute-book, the Government is not in a position to ask this House to agree to the Stevedoring Industry Charge Assessment Bill. For that reason, I support the amendment of the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) that the bill be read a second time this day' six months.

Secondly, the consumers of. Australia will have to defray the charge of 4£d. a man hour which is to be levied on waterside labour, on all goods that come into Australia. Therefore, in whatever way one cares to argue the matter, it is. incontrovertible that the primary producer and the consumer are to be called on to pay a. tax of 4jd:. a man hour on all labour employed on the waterfront in Australia.

They have determined to get away from the court, and the Government has bent its knees in the way they desired, thus permitting the Communists to dictate the terms upon which waterfront employment may be carried on. able member must deal with the bill that is now before the House. charge for which the bill makes provision is the outcome of that alteration of policy. Decisions of the Arbitration Court have been made in the expectation that they would be obeyed. Because that has not been the result, the proposal now is to "" soft-soap"" the Communist-protected waterside workers, and to provide that the community shall find the requisite finance. The bill provides that between £500,000 and £600,000 a year to these spoon-fed gentlemen. Doubtless, that cost will be passed on, and the burden will fall mainly on the primary producers who export such essential commodities as meat, butter, cheese, sugar and wool, hut those e/igaged in secondary industries will also have to bear a share. No such charge should be levied on industry, especially at a time when heavy taxes are activities of the Communists are costing Australia many millions of pounds a year.

In certain cases the charge may he passed on. This is really part of the wages cost of carrythe commission. It will be passed on. ing on the stevedoring industry, and the method of taxation proposed by the Government is absolutely essential because of the impossibility of collecting the money from individual employers in any other way. Furthermore, this is the method which employers in the industry suggested should be adopted. and the interstate shipowners requested that this method be adopted because the collection of the requisite funds could not be effectively carried out in any other of the question. way. Attendance money represents less than 10 per cent, of the weekly earnings of waterside workers which, on the average, amount to much less than £7 a week. Almost all of the discussion relative to the passing on of the charge is beside the point. I do not dispute that a charge of this kind may be passed on, it must be passed on in an industry such as this which has a direct monopoly of part of the sea transport services. The charge will not be different from any other wages charge. To regard it as some new form of indirect tax is completely wrong. Two of the three items, administrative expenses £150,000, and amenities and contingencies, £50,000, were recommended specifically in the Foster report as appropriate charges against the industry. The third item, attendance money, which the charge proposed by this bill is intended to cover, and the merits of which I am unable I'o discuss, was recommended by an independent body, the Stevedoring Industry Commission. The commission has recommended that the payment of attendance money be continued, and the bill before us is designed to enable that to be done. Ma. McBMBE -The charge was previously met from Consolidated Revenue? becomes law it will continue to be paid from Consolidated Revenue. Provision for its payment has in the past been made regularly every year in the budget. It was not necessary to introduce a specific bill to authorize such payments. Every penny taken in this way is taken as a means oi carrying out either the recommendations of the Foster report or existing or anticipated commitments of It has been passed on; and, perhaps, as some honourable members, have suggested, to an unfair degree. I do not know. I shall not discuss that aspect. It is just as much a charge as the charge for transport. The charge for transport between Australia and overseas depends upon shipping freights.

I admit that I do not know of any. Br. EVATT (Barton-Attorney-Genera l and Minister for External Affairs) [8.5] -The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) evidently misunderstands the position. In this bill, for Barker would not approve. we arc dealing with States and State instrumentalities as employers of labour. The bill provides that employers in this industry shall contribute towards the administrative expenses of the Stevedoring Industry Commission. If the commission orders the payment of attendance money to waterside workers, the employers, as a group, shall bear the charge, that being the only way in which the machinery can be operated. The honourable member is arguing that although the iStates, as employers of labour, are bound to pay the wages and observe the conditions fixed by the commission, they shall be exempt from paying the contributions fixed by the commission. I do not think that the honourable member will find anyone in the committee to support his argument. States and State instrumentalities already are liable as employers for pay-roll tax. They are liable as importers to pay customs duty. Forty years ago, one State government thought it should be exempt from Customs duty and the ensuing struggle in what was known as the wire-netting case convulsed the relations between that State and the Commonwealth for some time. In this bill we bring State instrurights of States, and place them, as emmentalities into the plan qua employers. In 1,920, it was decided that the State Railways Department of Western Australia was bound as an employer to observe federal laws, just as were other employers. That is just and proper. My own opinion is that the word "" employer "" by itself is clear enough, the scheme being so comprehensive, and should be understood to include States and State instrumentalities. should be argued that the States are in a position to claim some immunity, we propose now to make it clear by expressed amendment that the word "" employer"" includes the Crown in right of a State, and any authority constituted under the law of a State. Seeing that such an authority is bound to pay the wages appropriate to the industry, why should it not also be bound to pay this charge which is, in essence, a wage charge? If State authorities do not pay the charge, a greater burden is thrown upon other employers, and that would be something of which I am sure the honourable member participate as employers in the stevedoring industry? explained that in some States harbour trusts, which are State authorities, employ waterside workers on stevedoring operations from time to time, and in Western Australia the State shipping service does the same. Therefore, they should be liable to the same charges as are other employers. that there is more involved in this amendment than has so far been revealed. It may be that this is, in effect, a step towards the destruction of the sovereign rights of the States. In New South Wales, there is in force a Maritime Services Act, under which the Harbour Trust built wharfs and made tremendous improvements around Sydney harbour. This work is now carried on by the Maritime Services Board, which employs persons not only in Sydney Harbour, but also in the outer ports. If the point is conceded that the Commonwealth has the right to over-ride the sovereign ployers, on the same footing as other employers, it may be that we are opening the way for a conservative and hostile Commonwealth government to prevent by taxation a democratic State government from putting into effect pregressive legislation designed for the welfare of the State. Let me cite an, example. There is in Queensland a State Insurance Office, which does However, lest it a tremendous amount of good for persons who tak© out insurance policies.

170,Mr Lang (Reid) [8.7],"It may becompany out of existence, and this principle could be extended to any or every enterprise embarked upon by a State .government. What right has this Parliament to tell :a sovereign State Parliament that its instrumentalities are to be subject to -Commonwealth taxation? This question deserves more than the rather brusque consideration that has been given to it by the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt). There are innumerable examples that I -could mention; but I shall not take up the time of the committee. The fact is that State, enterprises established for the committee stage-somethin g about which welfare of the people could be taxed out -of existence by a hostile Commonwealth .government. For instance, at the request of the master brick-makers, a federal administration could impose a tax that would wipe out the State brick works entirely. Similarly, if graziers decided that they wanted their own abattoirs, a Commonwealth government could tax the State abattoirs out of existence. In this way any State enterprise could be stultibut with the principle that it embodies. fied or eliminated by a hostile Commonwealth administration. believe that the founders of federation ever intended that the Commonwealth Parliament should have the right to interfere with State activities. -sovereign powers of the States must be maintained. those powers is an attempt to undermine federation. It may he argued that this is only a small matter; but all greatthings have their beginning in small matters. asked why a State, as an employer, should uot pay taxes. I do not say that it should other legislation already on the statutenot pay taxes, but there must be another way to reach that end without exercising a power which possibly might be unconstitutional. I hope, as a federalist, that it will he found to be unconstitutional, and that this Parliament will be denied the right to override sovereign States. This may be a small matter and the next one may be a small matter, but the accumulative matters -may be very serious indeed. I question whether this action is constitutional, and, even if it is, I believe that the Government could find a -better way of achieving its ends than this rough-andready method. When this bill was being Mr Lang. prepared the draftsmen no doubt made a thorough examination of all its ramifications, and provision was made for everything that the bill was designed to accomplish. But now, at the committee stage, an amendment has been moved. I am inclined to look rather askance at amendments that are moved at the committee stage of any bill. When a measure is introduced into the Parliament it is open for inspection by anybody who wishes to examine it, and, at the second reading stage, it is open to criticism by members of Parliament; but, in.this case, something new has been sprung at the honourable members knew nothing when they made their second-reading speeches, and about which the general public knows nothing now. The amendment may appear to be innocent enough, but it may have serious effects ultimately. I raise this matter, not in any spirit of hostility, but because I think that it should be given consideration. I . am concerned mainly not with the details of the amendment [8.15] I am afraid I cannot leave this matter where the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) has left it. The points that have The been raised by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang) are weighty, and Any attempt to destroy should be given consideration by the Government. Take for instance, the position of the coal-mining industry. If the Commonwealth Government is entitled to levy a tax of so many pence The Attorney-General has per man-hour in respect of men employed in the stevedoring industry, then, under book in respect of coal mines, it is equally entitled to levy a tax of so many pence per man-hour in respect of men employed in the coal mines. I should like the committee to understand just what that would mean. In Victoria, for instance, the biggest coal-mining enterprise is, I understand, a State-owned concern. In South Australia, an attempt is being made to effect of many small develop the Leigh Creek coal-fields, and I am quite sure that the Parliament of that State will not submit willingly to a tax of this description. In Western Australia, I believe, there are coal mines operated by the State, and I am quite sure that the same applies to Queensland.",39,Sfeakek Hon J S Roseveab Be Added And Includes The Crown In Right
171,I Am Loath To Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"I have very -grave doubt as to whether the Labour Governmentin Queensland would submit willingly to a tax of this kind.. It is true that, under section 51 of the Constitution, the Commonwealth has power over taxation, but section 114 provides that the Commonwealth has no power to tax State property and that the States have no power to. tax Commonwealth property. On two occasions since the right honourable gentleman has been Attorney-General, Commonwealth governments have asked the people of Australia to amend the Constitution to confer upon the Commonwealth power over civil aviation. If the right honourable gentleConstitution prevents the taxation by the man's opinion that the taxation exemption is limited to property be correct, and if a State of Commonwealth property; but. the Commonwealth has the right to taxthe man-hours of men employed in, say, Western Australian wharfing enterprises, what is to prevent States turning round and taxing the Commonwealth's aircraft, services ? I see no reason why they should not. If the exemption be limited entirely employers, become bound to the same deto property,, then obviously the landing, and. other facilities that are required in be bound. That was one of the great the various States may be subject to taxation. to do that. know that, and I thank the honourable member for the information. The Attorney-General is inviting retaliation by the in 1920. Earlier, in New South Wales, States. If the Commonwealth is to intrude into what, if not constitutionally, Industry Board^ claimed that it would at least by practice and custom, has been a State preserve, the States may be expected to take similar action. We may through this amendment be forging a chain of events for which both the States and the Commonwealth may be sorry before we are many years older. The Attorney-General cannot argue that the scheme will not work without this amendment. He has mentioned only one State instrumentality so far, the Western Australian State shipping concern. That is not a very big affair, but, if he is going to tax man-hours, let us have another glance at what the effect may be. The Commonwealth has certain powers in regard to the maritime industry. He may decideto tax the man-hours of the people employed in the maritime industry. Then the Government, will get 127] up against every State, vessel.. That would cause some very interesting repercussions. My advice to the Attorney General, as friendly as I can make it, is that he drop this amendment like a hot brick. and Minister for External Affairs) [8.21] -The honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang) has raised a matter of principle to which I wish to refer without, repeating what I said earlier. It is true, as the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) said, that the Commonwealth of State property and by it is a well-recognized law of the Constitution to-day, as it has been for twenty years, that where the Commonwealth has power to make laws for conciliation and' arbitration in industrial matters to prevent interstate disputes, the States, as gree as other employers. So they should struggles of the trade union movement of Australia. Some of the States, claimed that they would not be bound"" by awards of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court on the. ground of their sovereignty, which was referred to by the honourable member for Reid.

The High Court set aside that contention. Then there was the wire netting case. The Government of New South Wales claimed that it was not liable to pay customs duty. When some wire netting was imported, the Premier, Sir Joseph Carruthers, seized it from the customs; but it was held that State immunity from taxation did not cover that. If it is property that one is dealing with, the position is different.

183,Mr Lang (Reid) [8.29],"I raisedStates would try to avoid a just and proper responsibility. In this measure dealing with the waterfront, certain arbitration principles are being put into operation. Out of the hill arise certain administrative costs and charges and this bill is a taxing measure. The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) said that he would be loath to think any Government would discriminate against a State. I , too, would have been loath to think so at one time; but I have known governments to do so in my experience. I have known this Parliament to set out to crucify a State, leading to a long-drawn war in which, but for certain circumstances, the State of New South Wales would have defeated the Commonwealth. If this Parliament gives the Commissioner of Taxation the powers sought in this measure, where will it call a halt? The Commissioner of Taxation has very wide powers, subject to little control or supersider whether it would not be safer to vision, and he is not greatly affected by public criticism. If the Parliament opens the door to give these powers to the Commissioner, how will it stop a flood? Will it merely say, "" Well, we will only tax the State instrumentalities in order to make them pay their just proportion "" ? Suppose that it says, "" We have the power of taxing, and we will tax the whole of the income of all the States without discrimination "". What would be the meaning of federation then? What would happen to the States? They would be taxed out of existence. This is not just a matter of taxing the States as in the illustrations I have cited of a State insurance office and a State brickworks. It involves the very existence of the States. If the Commonwealth lacks the power to tax the whole of the income of all of the States without any discrimination, then how can it have power to tax them under this measure? I assure the Attorney General that I do not question the justice of this charge upon the States. I do not rrgue about that at all. I admit that the States should pay their just proportion of these charges, but I object to the method which is proposed. In my mind, it foreshadows a gradual whittling down of the rights and powers of the people. the honourable member suggest it could be done? as it was originally drafted. It would then cover all employers. If , in that form, it failed to achieve its purpose, the Government could then make the amendment which it proposes to make now. The bill has not been tested, and the amendment is not required at this stage. If the bill were enacted in its original form, and if then any State refused to pay its just due, this Parliament could give further consideration to the matter. Candidly, I am afraid of the principle that I believe tc be incorporated in the amendment. For that reason I have uttered my thoughts on the matter, and I ask that they be considered, not because of the small things involved at the moment but because of the bigger things of which this measure might be the forerunner. I seriously ask the Attorney-General to conpass the bill in its original form. Then, if some State or instrumentality should refuse to pay its contributiona circumstance which I cannot imagine-thi s Parliament could act and I would be prepared to support its action. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang) and the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) have contended that a new principle is involved in taxing a State in respect of its employees. Honourable members opposite established that principle long ago, when they were in power, by instituting the pay-roll tax, by which State governments were obliged to pay a tax to the Commonwealth for each of their employees in order to help to finance the child endowment scheme. Any principle that is involved has already been established in a much more significant measure involving much greater payments by the States to the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Reid said that, as a matter of principle, a State instrumentality should be immune from a Commonwealth tax; but he abandoned that point of principle by saying that, if the States did not contribute he would favour the Commonwealth Government taxing them. The determining factor is not what this Parliament thinks about the Constitution, but what the High Court thinks of it.",42,Sfeakek Hon J S Roseveab Be Added And Includes The Crown In Right

186,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [8.36],"The doctrine of the immunity of State instrumentalities was abandoned by the High Court many years ago. time, it was believed that the Constitution implied a prohibition against the taxing of the States by the Commonwealth, and vice versa. That doctrine went by the board when the State of Western Australia took action against one form of Commonwealth tax, namely, customs duty. It decided to pay customs duty to the Commonwealth on certain locomotives imported into Australia. Its decision was not upheld by the High 'Court, and the Chief Justice of the day, Mr Justice Isaacs, definitely laid down then that there were no implied prohibitions in the Constitution. He ruled that the Constitution was an act of the British Parliament which should be interpreted by the words that were written into it in precisely the same way as any other act of parliament. The Constitution does not embody any specific prohibitions upon federal taxes, other than taxes upon State property. The pay-roll tax and the tax proposed in this measure are not taxes upon property. Therefore, the Commonwealth can validly tax State instrumentalities in these ways. doctrine of the immunity of instrumentalities from tax by the Commonwealth was abandoned in the High Court over 26 years ago. Both the honourable member for Lang and the honourable member for Barker have, therefore, been raising a dead issue. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses5 to 9 agreed to.

(vide page 359). -This motion introduces the third and last of the infamous bills relating to the Stevedoring Industry Commission. The Stevedoring Industry Commission Bill 1947 provided for the establishment of the commission. The Stevedoring Industry Charge Assessment Bill 1947 related to the imposition, assessment and collection of a charge in respect of the employment of waterside workers. The third bill, which the House will proceed to consider, provides that a charge be imposed in respect of the employment of waterside workers at The the rate of 4id. for every man-hour of employment. This tax will be paid by the employer of the waterside workers. When speaking on the Stevedoring Industry Charge Assessment Bill, I asked the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) 'to give to the House certain information. On that occasion, I pointed out that the proposed charge of 4-^d. for every man-hour of employment would, according to the estimate, yield £500,000 a year. This amount would be devoted to meeting claims for attendance money. The purpose was to give effect to some improper action which had been taken by the present commission. Let us suppose that industrial stoppages continue on the waterfront. How does the Attorney General expect that the amount required to enable the administrative functions of the commission to be carried on will be raised? The right honourable gentleman explained that £150,000 will be required for administrative charges, £360,000 for attendance money and £50,000 for amenities and the like on the waterfront.

The honourable gentleman asked what w ill happen if , as the result of industrial disputes, the estimate is not realized. I inform hi m that the estimate of receipts-£562,500-is based upon statistics during the last few years, when the average number of man-hours worked per annum was 30,000,000. In the circumstances, I do not consider that there is any need to apprehend that the receipts from this charge w ill not meet administrative charges, and the cost of amenities and the like. The estimate was made on that basis. Unless the manhours are worked, the money w ill not be collected. When an experiment like this is initiated for the benefit of the industry, trade and commerce and particularly a group of men whose status needs improving, the Government and the country are entitled to expect them to do their part and give continuity of service. [8.47] -It is very seldom that I listen to the broadcasts of news services. In fact, I believe that I listen to them as infrequently as the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) reads newspapers. This evening, however, I listened at 7 o'clock to the national news service prepared by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. This is a government instrumentality, and its news can be expected to be near the truth . A f t e r a description had been given of certain difficulties in the Sydney Domain to-day, there was a statement attributed to a gentleman who is reputed to be the head of the Sydney branch of the Waterside Workers Federation. This man accused the chairman of the Stevedoring Industry Commission, Mr. Morrison, of wanting the present strike to continue; but, in addition, he said that the waterside workers were determined to continue the present strike until their demands had been met. In view of the unsatisfactory response of waterside workers to the Government's endeavours to secure peace on the waterfront, I ask the Attorney-General whether we are justified in proceeding with the consideration of this motion. Order! The honourable member's remarks are not related to the motion, which deals with the fixing of a charge in respect of the employment of waterside workers. care what rate is fixed; it w ill not achieve the Attorney-General's aim of peace on the waterfront. I am quite indifferent to what rate is fixed by this motion; I say that what the Attorney General aims at, and what he has given us to understand he has achieved, w ill not be accomplished by the adoption of the motion, and therefore I oppose it .

Debate resumed February (vide page 216), on motion by attention to the similarity of the drafting That the bill be now read a second time. In speaking to the second-reading only to make comparisons by means of debate on this bill I do so principally a passing reference. Under the 1938 Act, because of the possible application of its the chairman of the board was elected by principles to other primary industries a committee of growers' representatives, which may come under the aegis of Comand those representatives were, in their monwealth Government organization.

198,Mr Anthony,"I do not intend toThere are certain features of the bill which I believe will be beneficial. The size of the board is to be reduced from sixteen to twelve members. But there are factors associated with it which, in my view, will do a tremendous injustice to the smaller States. AlthoughI represent a constituency in New South Wales, I believe that there should be a disposition on the part of this national Parliament not to wrest by the weight of numcent, of the total representation on the bers of the larger States, unfair advantages from the smaller States, such as Tasboard is to be reduced to 16.6 per cent, mania. If we tolerate such injustices, the day will surely come when those representatives of other industries who sit placidly by and acquiesce in them may themselves require somebody to come to their aid. What is the position in respect of Tasmania? Under the act passed by the Menzies Government, the board consisted of sixteen members, of whom four were from Tasmania, two from Victoria, one from New South Wales, one from Queensland, one from South Australia and two from Western Australia. All of those were growers' representatives. There were four representatives of exporters, and one representative of the Commonwealth Government. Under the present proposal, eight of the twelve members of the board are to be representatives of growers. The growers had 68 per cent, of the representation on the old board, and they are to have 67 per cent, of the representation on the new board; consequently, there will not be very much difference in that respect. But what is the position in relation to Tasmania? The finances for the establishment of the fund for the operation of this legislation are to be raised by means of a levy on the apples and pears that are sold overseas; in other words, by means of an export charge. Over a period of years, of an approximate average of 5,000,000 cases of apples and pears exported anually, principally to the United Kingdom, Tasmania has contributed no fewer than 3,000,000 cases, or three-fifths of the total quantity. If a levy of Id. a bushel is to be imposed, as the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) suggested in his second-reading speech, Tasmanian growers will contribute £12,000 of the total levy of £20,000 a year. Those figures demand a basis of representation that will be consistent in some degree with the contribution that is made by a particular State. Tasmania is to contribute aproximately 60 per cent, of the total levy; but what is it to have in the way of representation on the board? It had four representatives of growers on the old hoard, and it is to have two representatives of growers on the new board. On a percentage basis, it had 30.7 per old board. Its representation on the new of the total. I mention this matter to the Minister in the hope that a little fairer representation will be given to this smaller State, and one which will have to pay the largest proportion of the total finances of the board. I leave it to the honourable member for Pranklin( Mr Falkinder), who is quite capable of speaking for his State, to expound his views as to the methods that he considers ought to be adopted. It is not for me to say what they should be. On the figures that I have presented to the House, there is a clear and strong case for greater representation of Tasmania. The bill is really an amendment of the 1938 Act, which I have before me. There are one or two points which I consider call for comment, criticism, and opposition by honourable members who sit on this side of the House; because I believe that the precedent that is to be established in the constitution of this board will be followed in the constitution of other rural industry boards. In a very substantial degree, this bill follows the lines that were laid down in the bill which provided for the constitution of the Australian Wheat Board. Certain principles have been followed, two of which I shall mention specifically. One of them is that the chairman of the board is to be appointed expressly by the Minister. That procedure was followed in connection with the constitution of the Australian Wheat Board. By what authority, other than the weight of numbers on the government benches, by what moral right, by what pretence that the growers are having conferred upon them means for organizing their own industry, does the Minister filch from them the right to nominate their own chairman? honourable member belongs adopted the -same procedure. interjection. Section7 of the 1938 act makes this provisionAt the first meeting of the Board, which shall be held at a time and place notified by the Minister in the Gazette, the Board shall appoint one of its members to be the Chairman of the Board. Australian Wheat Board. the Apple and Pear Board. Clause7 readsSection7 of the principal act is repealed and the following section inserted in its stead:""7 (1.) The Government representative shall be the Chairman of the Board. The original act provided that the board should appoint one of its members to he chairman, but under this hill the members of the board will have no choice; the Government representative w ill be the chairman. The effect w ill be that the authority of the board w ill really he vested in the chairman who w ill be the nominee of the Minister. Clause 12 w ill amend section 13 of the principal act which provided, in sub-clause 1 (e), that the board may, either on its own behalf or in collaboration with any other board or authority, do certain things in connection with the industry, such as establish new markets or organize the industry to provide for the better distribution of apples and pears. In future the board may do certain things subject to any direction from the Minister. In other words, the bill provides for the political control of the board. About six months ago the electors of the Commonwealth, including the growers of apples and pears, were asked to confer additional powers on the Commonwealth Parliament so that primary industries could be better organized. Apparently what the Government had in mind was a for m of organization such as that proposed in this measure. The Government wants as chairman a person like Sir Louis Bussau, who, travelled extensively throughout the Commonwealth and made statements which were afterwards proved to be not in accordance with facts. It wants a chairman who w ill do the w ill of any MinisI am glad of that ter so long as he is allowed to remain in his position and be paid £2,000 or £3,000 a year. ment, made under cover of parliamentary privilege. I am referring to the which cannot be contradicted. During the election campaign Sir Louis BussauI am speaking of made statements designed to cover up the nefarious wheat deal w i th New Zealand. allow a f u l l discussion on wheat. during the election campaign shows the danger of having a political appointee as chairman. I hope that in his reply to the second-reading debate, the Minister w ill t r y to explain why the growers cannot have their own nominee as chairman, and why that office must be filled by a person appointed by the Minister. I have studied the bill carefully, but I cannot see in it any provision that the Government w ill contribute to the f u n d to be set up. In his second-reading speech the Minister saidThis board is financed by a levy on all apples and pears exported from Australia. The Apple and Pear Export Charges Act provides for a maximum levy of id . per case subject to a lower rate being prescribed. At present the prescribed rate is i d . per case. It is intended to introduce legislation to increase the maximum levy to Id. per case to provide for additional revenue for the board's activities should such be considered necessary or desirable. In that statement of the Minister there is not even a suggestion that the Commonwealth w ill contribute to the financing of the board; yet it has the audacity to demand that its nominee shall be its chairman. Should another person like Sir Louis Bussau be appointed, God help us. In any scheme to control a primary industry three principles should be observed. There should be, first, the right of those engaged in the industry to choose their own representatives by some satisduring the election campaign, factory method of voting; secondly, the right of the elected representatives to select their own chairman; and thirdly,",46,Apple And Pear Organizationbill 1947 Second Reading

There is no occasion for the continuance of such controls in times of peace. ment established a board to control the apple and pear growing industry under war-time regulations. sary evil in war-time. As I have said, this bill has been drawn by bureaucrats who, limpet like, are hanging on to every bit of power vested in them in war-time and can be prized from the backs of the producers only with a hammer and chisel. By revealing the disparity between the contribution they will make and their representation on the board, I have shown the injustice which this measure will do to the small estates. The House is entitled to much more information than has so far been vouchsafed to it. The purpose of this bill is to amend an act already in existence, and it is, thereporters, but Victoria is not to have any fore, more a bill for discussion in committee than for debate in the second reading stage. However, I propose to have something to say upon it in this stage so that the Minister may become acquainted, through me, with the views of the producers in my constituency. This is a short bill of four pages designed to amend the original act of twelve pages. In order to understand what the amending bill means it is necessary to go careexported 2,426,658 bushels, while Western fully through both the bill and the principal act, something which takes time and requires some legal knowledge. Members of Parliament, even those who are not lawyers, have acquired some facility in the reading of bills, but it must be very difficult for the producers, whom this bill closely concerns, to understand just what it purports to do. It seems to me that it would have been easier for the draftsman, instead of preparing a bill to amend this section and that of the principal act, to have provided for the repeal of that act, and the substitution of a new one in its place. That would certainly have made it easier to understand. There may be legal objections to such a course, but there certainly would have been advantages. I have sent many copies of the bill and the act to interested constituents, and it seems to me that the method the and complicated. The bill provides for altering the constitution of the Australian Apple and Pear Board, something which is of great importance to my constituents. The old board consisted of sixteen members, eleven of whom represented the producers. The board also represented the exporters, one of whom was drawn from Victoria. The bill ""proposes to reduce the number of the board to twelve. l it general, I agree that a small board should: be able to work better than a large one', but in this instance it is necessary to consider the balance of the board and the representation which it gives to the industry in the various States. Bearing that in mind, I should prefer the board to consist of sixteen members rather than of twelve. On the new board there are to be seven representatives of the producers, apart from the representatives of the exdirect exporter representative, something which has caused dissatisfaction among Victorians. I cannot see how the Minister can justify the exclusion of a Victorian exporters' representative. During the period from 1930 to 1938, Victoria's exports of apples and pears amounted to 7,633,299 bushels, while exports from Western Australia amounted to only 5,325,733 bushels. Of pears, Victoria Australia exported only 238,617 bushels. Therefore, if there are to be representatives of exporters on the board, Victoria is certainly entitled to one of them. The bill provides that Victoria is to have one member only on the board, the same as Queensland and New South Wales, but Victoria is a much more important producing and exporting State than either New South Wales or Queensland. The representation of Tasmania has been reduced from four to two. There is no objection to Tasmania having more representatives on the board than any other State, but on the old board Tasmania had",48,Apple And Pear Organizationbill 1947 Second Reading

209,Mr Hutchinson (Deakin) [9.20],"four representatives, and I am sure that Tasmanian producers would be better pleased to have four representatives than two. On the old board Victoria had two representatives, Western Australia two, and the other States one each. That was a more representative and better balanced board than the new one will be. The point has been raised whether the exporters are entitled to be represented on acres he has under apples and pears, the a hoard of this kind. I have always believed that no export marketing board is properly constituted unless the exporters are represented. occasion, I pointed out to this House how producer representatives, when at the Ottawa Conference, by failing to heed the advice of an exporter representative, brought trouble to the meat industry, it took some years to settle the trouble satisfactorily. growers and exporters should be represented on an export board. I have the highest regard for the men who market our produce overseas. They have gone to great expense to develop markets in Great Britain and Europe, and their experience must be of value to the industry. In any major primary industry we cannot dissociate the export market from the home market because, where there is a surplus, as there is in most of our primary industries, including the apple and pear industry, a healthy home market is dependent upon a thriving export market. However, the provision of representation of exporters involves a special problem in the apple and pear industry. This is not an industry in which, comparatively, only s few people are exporters, or concentrate solely on exports, as is the case in other primary industries. Thousands engaged in the apple and pear industry are not only growers but also handle their own marketing; and among the rank-and-file of growers are to be found many who possess a sound and wide knowledge of export markets. I admit that I can see no way of determining the representation of exporters by ballot, but I suggest that the Minister should take into consideration the industry's point of view on this matter. He will help to promote a greater degree of harmony in the industry if , when selecting exporter representatives he chooses men who also are producers in the industry. Mr Hutchinson. The principal act stipulated that, in order to qualify as an exporter, a grower had to export a certain quantity of fruit during two of the three years preceding the implementation of that legislation. Under this measure, the right of a grower to vote in the election of producers' representatives is based on the number of number of acres stipulated being 5 acres. I believe that that is a better basis for a poll of growers than the old basis, because On a previous one cannot distinguish between the value of the export side and the value of the home market. Export activities naturally assist the home market. Therefore, all growers should be given a voice in the election of members of the board. The number of acres which might be taken as I believe that both the a basis of qualification is a matter of degree. Possibly, three acres would be the most satisfactory to the industry as a whole, because that basis would be more comprehensive and would embrace more growers. The principle of basing the qualification to vote in the election of the board on the number of acres a grower has under apples and pears is again preferable to the old basis which confined the right to vote to those who exported apples and pears, because it could happen that a person who exported during two of the three years preceding the implementation of the principal act qualified for a vote although he may not have exported in any other year. Therefore the provision under this measure is sound. Another matter which is causing concern to the industry is the appointment of an employees' representative on the board. On behalf of the Opposition in the past, I have handled several measures relating to primary production and the marketing of primary products. I have always held the opinion that provision for the appointment of an employees' representative on commodity boards is wise, because, undeniably such representatives are given an opportunity to become acquainted with problems on the business side about which the employees in an industry know very little. Indeed, this lack of knowledge is one of the primary causes of present industrial unrest, because the average worker has little or no knowledge of any of the problems which arise in his industry from a managerial point of view. If the worker had such knowledge he would not be playing up as he is doing to-day in many industries. He lacks knowledge of the difficulties ahead of his industry, and is also unable to foresee the incidence of those difficulties insofar as they impinge upon every household. Tbe greater the opportunity given to the representatives of employees to appreciate the difficulties of management, the greater the harmony we shall establish in industry generally. Thus, by appointment to commodity boards representatives of employees have a chance of learning about problems about which, apparently, they do not know anything to-day. Such a provision generally is wise, and I have advocated it on earlier occasions. However, I doubt the wisdom of appointing an employees' representative to this board, because there is no union directly concerned with the apple and pear industry. Certainly, there are unions representative of workers engaged in packing houses, timber mills and in the manufacture of fruit cases, and also on the orchards, but no one union is directly representative of those engaged in the industry, and, therefore, no one union can claim the right to provide the representative of 'these employees on this hoard. I can see no good reason why some particular union boss should be appointed to this board. The Government is not justified in regarding this appointment as a plum to be given to some union favourite. The next point with which I shall deal is the filling of vacancies on the board. Sub-section 14 of section 4 of the principal act provides(.14.) On the occurrence of any vacancy in the membership of the board by reason of the death, resignation or removal from office of any member prior to the expiration of the term for which he was appointed or elected, the Governor General may appoint a person to f i ll the vacancy, and any person so appointed (other than the Government representative) shall hold office for the residue of the term of the member whose place became vacant: Provided that, where the member whose place became vacant was selected from a panel submitted by the approved growers' organizations in any State, the person appointed to f ill the vacancy shall, subject to sub-section (0) of this section, be selected from a panel submitted for the purpose in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this section. Under this measure, in the event of a vacancy occurring by reason of the death or resignation, of a member of the board, the Minister is empowered to appoint a substitute. I suggest that appointments to fill vacancies should ultimately be decided by poll of the growers. In other words any appointment made should be subject to a poll of growers as soon as practicable. Of course, should a vacancy occur, say, one month before the expiration of the term of a member who dies, or resigns, or is dismissed, it would be foolish to conduct a poll; but all vacancies which occur a considerable time before the term of the previous holder of the position expires should be filled eventually by a poll of growers. Other honourable members dealt fully with the appointment of the chairman of the board. This involves a fundamental principle. Producers are wary of boards; and they have every reason to be. For instance, the wheat grower has found out to his cost the damage that can be done by a board which is dominated by the Minister. I refer to the part played by the Australian Wheat Board in connection with the agreement to sell wheat to Sew Zealand. It is not surprising that growers look upon boardswith suspicion. However, their suspicion, would be minimized if they were assured that a board was, in fact, a producers'"" board, and had freedom of action in the interests of producers. Under the principal act the board had the right to elect its own chairman, but under this measure that right is abolished. I shall be interested to hear the Minister explain the reason for this change. I can see no good reason for it. Having regard to the composition of this board, I do not see how the chairman can dominate it. Therefore, the provision that the Minister shall nominate the chairman serves merely to annoy the growers. I urge the Minister to give way on this point by accepting an amendment which would give to the board the right to elect its chairman. Honourable members on this side of the chamber believe that a board which, in the main, is elected by a poll of growers should be given the right to determine the most suitable person to be chairman of it. That right should not be denied to the growers. Section 13 of the principal act, which prescribes the powers and functions of the board, reads(1.) The Board may(a) make recommendations to the Minisdoes not, or need not understand them, ter in relation to the making of and may in fact act in accordance regulations for the purpose of reguwith the directions of Cabinet. lating the export of apples and in these important respects, the Minister pears from Australia; (6) make reports and suggestions to the will be given authority to over-ride the Minister on such matters as the decisions of the producer and exporter quality, standards and grading of members of the board on matters with any particular class or kind of apples and pears to be exported which they are thoroughly familiar. from Australia; (c) advise, and make recommendations to, the Opposition intends to submit an the Minister in respect of matters amendment designed to deny that power arising in connection with any programme for the export from Austo the Minister. The honourable gentletralia of apples and pears; {d) advise, and make representations to, ing his promotion to a position of the Minister or to any other authority over this so-called "" producers' authority on matters affecting the welfare of the apple and pear indusboard "". Section 14 of the principal act t r y ; and -(e) cither on its own behalf or in collaboration with any other board or authority, take, or arrange for the taking of any action which, in the opinion of the board, is likely(i) to lead to the improvement of the quality of, or the prevention of deterioration, before or during transport from Australia, of apples and pears; or ( i i ) to expand existing markets or to secure new markets for apples and pears, and shall have such other powers and functions as are conferred by this Act. The point to which I specifically desire to refer is that covered by the words in paragraph e"" either on its own behalf or in collaboration with any other board or authority"". Under this bill, those words are to be deleted, and in their stead the words "" subject to any direction of the Minister"" will be inserted. Al l these matters which were previously within the exclusive authority of the board, are now to be made the subject of direction of the Minister of the day. He may, I assume, vary or alter any decision made by the board. The Minister is to be given even greater powers, because the bill proposes that the following sub-paragraphs be inserted after sub-paragraph i i of paragraph e:(iii) to increase and extend the consumption of apples and pears Australia; or Mr Hutchinson. (iv) to improve the production of apples and pears in Australia. These appear to be very wide powers for any Minister to possess. The last thing that this industry wants is meddling in all sorts of matters by the Minister who Yet When clause 12 is under consideration, man will find great difficulty in justifyreads(1.) The Board may(a) determine the total quantity of apples and pears harvested in any year which may be exported from the Commonwealth; and (b) determine, upon a basis applied uniformly throughout the Commonwealth, the quantity of apples and pears harvested in any State in that year which may be exported from the Commonwealth. If , in the past, any dispute arose as to the total quantity of apples and pears that should be exported in any year, that dispute was referred to one or more independent arbitrators. Under the amendments proposed in the bill, the Minister himself is to determine such matter?. It is difficult to understand why the Minister wants this power. The apple and pear industry, which is widely scattered throughout the Commonwealth, produces millions of bushels of fruit each year. If the board fails to arrive at a unanimous decision in respect of any matter arising in connection with the quantity of apples and pears to be exported from Australia, is it likely that the Minister will know more about the subject than the board itself or an independent arbitrator or arbitrators? Yet the Minister may super-impose his decisions over those of the board, and whatever he decides will throughout become law. Previously, three independent arbitrators conversant with the industry over a period of years, would be given tbe right to decide such questions. I am aware that Ministers are constantly seeking to assume additional responsibilities; but I am unable to understand why the Minister should seek to place upon his shoulders the responsibility for determining such questions. Isi t likely that the Minister's judgment would be better than that pf an independent arbitrator? Section 14 (2 ) reads-^In adopting a basis to be applied by the Board in accordance with paragraph 6 of the last preceding sub-section the Board shall take into consideration the average yearly exports overseas of apples and pears from each State during the period of three years immediately preceding the year in which the basis js adopted, and such other factors relating to the production of apples or pears in each State and the available markets there for as the Board thinks necessary. The last seven years have been years of war, and I doubt very much whether any wise board would adopt the formula stated in the principal act. During the war years, the whole of the export trade was ""held up because of shipping difficulties. In my opinion, that section should be amended in such a way as to exclude fro m the basis of calculation the war years. If that were done, there would be no doubt about the matter. It would be distinctly unwise to take into account a period when the industry was "" topsy t u r y y "" as the result of circumstances arising froni the war. I trust that a suitable amendment w ill be accepted to exclude the war years from the basis of calculation. If that were done, it would produce a great deal more satisfaction in the minds of producers. Section 14 (3) statesFor the purpose of enabling the board effectively to control the export of Australian apples and pears, the Governor General may niake regulations prohibiting the export from the Commonwealth of any apples or pears. . . . It is proposed that after the word "" export"", first occurring, the words "" and the sale and distribution after export"" be added. Before this bill was introduced, I discussed this matter with the Minister, who told me that he had consulted with the Apple and Pear Council which had requested the insertion of these words in sub-section 3. I should like to have further information on this matter. I foresee circumstances in which, for example, our overseas export trade could be abused. ""When. 1 was in GreatB rita in in 1935, I found that there was a widely held view that too many Australian apples and pears went to London, and too few to the provinces. It may be that the board should have discretionary power to determine such matters arising from exports. Perhaps the Minister will be good enough to deal with, that matter when the bill reaches the committee stage. The bill proposes the repeal of section 26 of the principal act. Under that section, provision is made that after the expiration of a certain period, a poll of growers may be held to determine the question of the continuance of the operation of the act. That is a wise provision, and I cannot see any reason for its removal. A fte r all, the best judges of the work of a board are those who are most closely associated with its activities, namely, the growing and exporting elements. They should have the right to determine whether or not the board has functioned successfully on their behalf, and if it has done so, we can be sure that it has also functioned successfully on behalf of the Commonwealth as a whole. Finally, I wish to correct a misconception that has arisen in the minds of the growers. There is a general belief that' under this measure power is being given to the Government to trade in apples and pears. The Government has had this power in connection with other boards that have been set up recently, but that is not so under this legislation. Section 13 (2) of the principal act states(2.) Except as otherwise expressly provided, nothing in this Act shall be deemed to empower tlie Board to buy or sell apples or pears or to engage in trade. When the bill reaches the committee stage I propose to have more to say about certain aspects of it . I hope that having listened to the words of wisdom that have been uttered by honourable members on this side of the chamber as representatives of growers'' organizations, the Government w ill ensure that the measure shall emerge from the committee stage a better bill than it is now. -This hill has much to commend it. Although Queensland, compared with other States, produces comparatively few apples and pears for export, it is most interested in the possibility of expanding this industry. Incidentally, all the apples and pears grown for marketing purposes in Queensland are produced in my electorate. I favour a grower-controlled board. member of a marketing board in Queensland, and, through the Council of Agriculture, I have had some contact with other boards. Since this measure was introduced into this House, I have been in touch with interests associated with tlie marketing of apples and pears, and have ascertained their views. The chairman of the committee that deals with apples and pears agrees with me that there should be an export marketing board to handle these commodities, but he submits that the grower representation should be more on the lines of the Queensmust have produced so many bushels of land marketing scheme. Under that scheme all members of marketing boards are elected by the growers, with the excepbe some justification for a. definition intion of one government representative on each. The marketing of a product should be the entire responsibility of the board that handles it, and as the marketing has to be financed by the growers themselves, they should be permitted to organize it to the best advantage. I agree that there should be a government representative on this board because our experience in Queensland has been that such representatives can be of great help. There the government representative does not endeavour to dominate the proceedings of a board and he cannot make decisions of growers have a substantial majority. In the case of the board to which this bill refers, there is a majority of grower representatives, but the Minister has an overriding veto. That is a principle with which I disagree entirely. My view is that there should be a comprehensive measure providing that producers in any industry may, by a majority vote, engage in co-operative marketing if they so desire. I admit, that this would present some difficulties. In the case of wheat and certain other commodities, for instance, separate legislation is required; but in Queensland we have what is known as the Primary Products Pools Act, covering almost every commodity. Fruit is one exception, and of course, sugar cane is another. That legislation provides that if 60 per cent, of the growers in a particular industry favour the setting up of a marketing board, controlled by the growers themselves, but including one government I am a representative, this can be done. I think that every commodity board that has been set up in Queensland is proving a success. There need be no fear of such boards charging too much for the commodities that they control. That would be very foolish, and any board that took such action would very soon find that it would be forced, by the decline in the sales of its goods, to reduce the price to a level at which there would be sufficient public demand. In the apple and pear industry, security is necessary in the export trade. In the principal act, the definition of "" grower "" provides that he apples and pears for export for a period of two out of three years. Whilst there may volving export requirements in a bill dealing with exports, I do not agree that it should cover three years or even two years. I believe that a grower of apples and pears in any particular year should be covered, because he is marketing his own crop and his livelihood is involved. The other side of the picture is that growers have to start producing some time, and even if they are not exporting, they are interested in that aspect of the industry, because the surpluses must be marketed overseas, otherwise the home consumption price will be affected. his own accord because the I consider the definition in the bill preferable to the one in the principal act. I am not sure that the Minister is wise in limiting to 5 acres the area qualifying a man to be regarded as a "" grower"". He would be well advised to reduce the area, because a man who has 3 acres under apples and pears, or both, is directly interested in the marketing of his crop. I am opposed to the ministerial veto provided for in the bill. In Queensland, with the exception of the wheat-growers, the growers have the right to elect the",49,Apple And Pear Organizationbill 1947 Second Reading
210,Mr Adermann (Maranoa) [9.53].,"chairmen, of the boards controlling their products, whether they be government representatives or growers' representatives, and that system has worked admirably. No justification exists for the inclusion in this bill of the provision that the chairgrowers in the various States? Is there man shall be a government representative, because no financial responsibility is cast upon the Government. The board, if it has the responsibility of sale and action, will measure up to it whenever called upon to do so. The bill provides that the board shall not have the right to trade. Possibly that is a proper provision, but I do not agree to it. Other speakers have said that the powers given to the board under the bill are great, but [ have no objection to its having excessive powers if they are not misused. It is possible that the board would be hamstringed by a too tightly worded measure. I l is necessary that the board should have all the power normally possessed by a co-operative marketing board. I would go so far as to say that the board ought to have the right to trade, because at times it may be necessary for it to have that right in order to supply and maintain a market that it otherwise might lose. I would support any action to give that right to the board. The number of members of the board is to be lower than that provided for in the principal act. Generally, I regard the number now proposed as sufficient, but I think Tasmania is hardly being treated fairly, and I would support any amendment designed to give it an extra member. I hope no move is made to deprive Queensland of representation, because, although the Queensland apple and peargrowers do not export large quantities, they are nevertheless vitally interested. When the Minister renlies, I should like a representative of the agents. him to tell me the proposed basis of export sales of apples and pears. There has Queensland committee objects, as voiced not yet been final settlement in respect by the chairman. of the apple and pear acquisition scheme, but I understand that the sensible and wise decision of the him. court in a recent case is to be the basis of payment and that the growers ought to be worried about him and about will be paid according to the grades and the growers and their welfare. I am quality of their fruit. Obviously,' a surprised at his attitude and that he is in grower who supplies lower quality fruit favour of having agents or exporters should not receive the same payment as on the hoard. I am not, unless they take the grower who supplies better quality. There may be differences of quality in the various States. There are different varieties. What is to be the basis upon which payment will be made to the to be an overall payment, in other words, an equal division of realization all over Australia, or is payment to be on the basis of sales effected by each State? That is a vital point. It ought to be explained by the Minister.

The grant of each of these classes of pensions is subject to a means test, and it is not proposed to extend the concession to other persons, including those in receipt of war pensions, whose type of pension does not exclude them from augmenting their income from other sources. RE-ESTABLISHMENT : LAND Post-war Reconstruction, upon notice1. Isi t a fact that New Zealand has granted loans totalling £12,317,474, to establish 3,211 ex-servicemen on farms and sheepstations, and that 1,353 others have completed farm training and another 1,603 are receiving training? 2. How much has been granted by the Australian Government in each State for similarpurposes, and to how many ex-servicemen? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the figures quoted by the honourable member regarding the amount and number of loans granted by the New Zealand Government to ex-servicemen seeking re-establishment on farms and numbers for whom training is being provided. Australian conditions are not A t the moment the comparable with those in New Zealand because of the different systems of government. The Commonwealth has provided under the Ee-establishment and Employment Act 1945, loans of up to £1,000 to ex-servicemen wishing to establish or re-establish themselves in agricultural occupations. In addition, certain State governments have provided systems of advances to ex-servicemen for similar purposes. In some cases tlie .Commonwealth Re-establishment loan may be used to supplement assistance provided by the State either for ex-servicemen exclusively or through State Agricultural or Rural Banks to primary producers generally. I have no information as upon to the extent of the advances made to ex-servicemen from State sources but it would be necessary to take this into consideration if it is desired to make comparisons with other countries. However, comparisons of this nature are of little value because of the presence of factors peculiar to each country. 2. The number of agricultural loans granted The Postmaster-Gento ex-servicemen and the amounts of loans approved under the Re-establishment and Employment Act up to .the 28th February, 1947, are as follows:New South Wales-1,90 1 applications approved for amount of £1,325,076. Victoria-80 8 applications approved for amount of £538,178. Queensland-29 8 applications approved for amount of £170,971. South Australia 336 applications approved for amount of £256,766. Western Australia-96 9 applications approved for amount of £799,908. Tasmania-15 4 applications approved for amount of £98,124. Northern Territory 1 application approved for amount of £1,000.

The complete work w ill occupy several years, having regard to .the size of the job and the necessity for causing the least possible disturbance to essential facilities. The honourable member may rest assured, however, that the work will be put in hand immediately the circumstances permit. honourable member for We n t w o r t h ( MrH a r r is o n ) asked a question concerning licences to i m p o r t watches, in w h i c h he made p a r t i c u l a r m e n t i o n of the licence granted to the honourable member for Watson( Mr Falstein). TheM in is t e r for T r a d e and Customs has supplied the f o l l o w in g in for m a t i o n :Special quotas to cover the importation of watches to the value of £2,700 for each approved applicant were originally granted to 23 ex-servicemen, of whom the honourable member for Watson was one. The granting of these quotas was followed by a flood of over 200 further applications from ex-servicemen. As the granting of similar quotas in all eases would have involved a huge expenditure of hard Swiss currency, it was decided to review all applications and quotas. Tho review was made by committees representing the Department of Trade and Customs and the watch trade. Eligibility for a special quota was determined in each case, chiefly on the applicant's claim to assistance towards his rehabilitation. As a result of this review quotas granted were either terminated or renewed on a reduced basis. As the honourable member for Watson was not regarded as needing such assistance, the quota originally granted in his' favour was not renewed. On member asked system of i m p o r t licences, p a r t i c u l a r l y in reference to i m p o r t s from the U n it e d Kingdom. referre d to t h is subject in a speech on the a d j o u r n m e n t of the House on the 7 t h M a r c h , in w h i c h he suggested t h a t the quota system of i m p o r t l i c e n s in g was preventing ex-servicemen from establishing themselves in business. . TheM in is t e r for T r a d e and Customs has supplied the f o l l o w in g in for m a t i on :Restrictions imposed on the importation of gin iris from the United Kingdom have been progressively relaxed since the cessation of hostilities and most of the remaining restrictions were lifted as from 23rd January, 1947, Since that date a ll essential United Kingdom goods are entirely exempt from import licensing, with the exception of tinplate. Control is now limited to a small range of less essential items and, even where these are concerned, the policy is to so administer the controls as to permit a normal How of trade to take place. The volume of applications such as diamonds and precious stones indicates that complete removal of control would lead On the 1 2 t h M a r c h , the to excessive expenditure of overseas funds on non-essential goods. Imports from the non-sterling area are, of course, still subject to import licensing control because of the continued need to conserve dollar and other non-sterling currencies. As regards ex-servicemen who wish to set up in business as manufacturers or importers, I would point out that the quota system now operates in relatively few cases. Some goods are totally prohibited, but most controlled items are treated on an administrative basis, which means that each application for a licence is treated on its merits, factors principally taken into account being essentiality of the goods and proof of their availability. This applies particularly to raw materials and other goods for manufacturing. In cases where the quota system operates, the cases of ex-servicemen have been given special consideration in every instance. Quotas have been granted irrespective of base year figures wherever possible, especially in the case of general trading lines such as diamonds, perfumes, sunglasses, glassware, plastic products, furs, textiles and watches. The results, however, especially in the case of goods in limited supply, have not always been happy, the quotas granted merely reducing the turn-over of established traders without providing a substantial livelihood for the ex-servicemen concerned. This has been particularly the case with textiles and watches, where the number of men applying for licences has been large. It has therefore been found advisable to> the 6 t h M a r c h , the honourable review the practice in this matter and to conf o r Balaclava ( Mr White fine the issue of special quotas to cases which a question concerning the appear to merit consideration solely on rehabilitation grounds. I would again stress that the import licensing system as now operating in no way hampers the supply to The honourable member also ex-servicemen of goods required for manufacturing purposes.
