The French judge was able to acquire from Willie Brigitte information that he was planning terrorist attacks in Australia. As in the September 11, the Bali and the Australian Embassy bombings, and now in the London bombings, numerous terrorists have been involved in each attack, requiring extended periods of time during the interrogation process to build a case. One of the most difficult aspects of police interrogations is determining the truth, especially when there is more than one suspect in custody, as the investigator will build the case by searching out the truth and eliminating the lies of suspects. It takes time to even get the pieces of the jigsaw together, let alone the whole puzzle. On balance, detaining a terrorist suspect in custody longer than 24 hours is greatly outweighed by the real possibility of a terrorist walking free from a court as investigators run out of interview time. I strongly recommend that the investigation times be greatly increased for Australian investigators to be given every assistance to do their job and not be impeded by restrictive legislation.",124,Natsem Shows That A Sole Parent Once They Soft Approach To Zimbabwe That They Had

Mr Mcgauran To Present A Bill For An Act To,"National Roads Program (Question No. 187) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, in writing, on 29 September 2004: (1) What is the projected expenditure under the National Roads Program for (a) 2004-5, (b) 2005-06), (c) 2006-07, (d) 2007-08. (2) Have any of the National Roads Program funds been allocated for works associated with level crossings in 2004-2005; if so what are the details. (1) Commencing from 1 July 2005, the former National Highways and Roads of National Importance Programme was replaced by the AusLink Investment Programme. The Programme provides funding to projects on the AusLink National Network and to existing projects off the Network. The National Network includes road, rail and intermodal links. Projected expenditure for the AusLink Programme on National Projects over five years is provided in the table below. AusLink Projected Expenditure (Budget 05-06) 2004-05 2005-06 2006-07 2007-08 2008-09 $1296.99 $1320.39 $1615.86 $1770.82 $1688.24 (2) Under the AusLink Investment Programme, in 2004-05, funds were allocated to the Fremantle Port North Quay rail loop project in Western Australia which included a level crossing among other works. The Australian Government commitment to this project is $14 million, of which $10.72 million was paid in 2004-05. The Australian Government also contributed $300m towards maintenance of the AusLink Network in 2004-05. It is open to States and Territories to apply maintenance funding to maintenance of level crossings. Firearms (Question No. 490) (1) How many individual firearms were legally imported during 2003-2004. (2) How many individual handguns were legally imported during 2003-2004.

(5) What sum was spent advertising the National Handgun Buyback program during 2003-2004. (6) Why did the administered expenses for the Handgun Buyback Program increase from $224,000 in 2003 to $84,407,000 in 2004 as reported on page 148 of his department’s report for 2003-2004.

138,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Customs does not record data on the number of individual firearms parts imported, but rather the number of consignments imported and their total value. In 2003-2004 there were 1,616 consignments of firearms parts legally imported, with a Customs Value of $19,920,382. (4) Customs does not record data on the number of individual handgun parts imported, but rather the number of consignments imported and their total value. In 2003-2004 there were 131 consignments of handgun parts legally imported, with a Customs Value of $1,083,190. (5) A total of $150,436 was spent advertising the National Handgun Buyback program during 20032004. Advertising took the form of the development and maintenance of the National Handgun Buyback website and development of communication resources for State and Territory implementation of the program. (6) The increase in administered expenses for the National Handgun Buyback between 2002-03 and 2003-04 reflects the formal commencement of the Buyback in most States and Territories on 1 July 2003. Prior to the formal commencement date, jurisdictions were not able to receive surrendered firearms, parts and accessories, and were not able to claim reimbursement and administration payments from the Commonwealth. The expenditure in 2002-03 represents administrative costs incurred in establishing the Buyback. Detainees (Question No. 754) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 9 March 2005: How many detainees have been in detention for over (a) 4 years, (b) 3.5 years, (c) 3 years, (d) 2.5 years, (e) 2 years, (f) 1.5 years, and (g) 1 year. Mr John Cobb-The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: As at 1 July 2005, there were 276 people who had been in immigration detention for 1 year or longer. Of these: (a) 70 people had been in immigration detention for 4 years or more. (b) 21 people had been in immigration detention for over 3.5 years, but less than 4 years. (c) 13 people had been in immigration detention for over 3 years, but less than 3.5 years. (d) 19 people had been in immigration detention for over 2.5 years, but less than 3 years. (e) 29 people had been in immigration detention for over 2 years, but less than 2.5 years. (f) 52 people had been in immigration detention for over 1.5 years, but less than 2 years. (g) 72 people had been in immigration detention for over 1 year, but less than 1.5 years. The new Removal Pending Bridging Visa (RPBV) came into effect on 11 May 2005. It was introduced to enable the release, pending removal, of people in immigration detention who have been cooperating with efforts to remove them from Australia, but whose removal is not reasonably practicable at the time. The RPBV allows a person to live in the community while the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs continues to organise their removal from Australia. As at 14 July 2005, the Minister has offered the RPBV to 58 people, 42 of whom have accepted. These people are all long-term detainees in immigration detention Facilities or in alternative detention. Asylum Seekers (Question No. 818 amended) Mr Georganas asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 15 March 2005: (1) What has happened to Mr KS Masoud, a Christian Iranian asylum seeker, who has been returned to Iran under Australia’s Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Islamic Republic of Iran. (2) Under the MOU, in what circumstances is a detainee (a) returned and (b) not returned to Iran. (3) How many Iranian asylum seekers have been returned to Iran since the introduction of the MOU. (4) How many Iranians have sought asylum in Australia since the introduction of the MOU. (5) How many Iranian asylum seekers were returned to Iran in the 12 months prior to the signing of the MOU. (6) How many Iranians sought asylum in Australia in the 12 months prior to the signing of the MOU Mr John Cobb-The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Department does not monitor returnees. The only effective way to protect refugees is to have a reliable process in place to test people’s claims and to identify refugees so they are not sent home in the first place. Australia has such a process – a world class process – and the people in question have been through that process and been found not to need protection. (2) My Department is obliged to arrange the removal as soon as reasonably practicable of any person who has no legal right to remain in Australia, including failed asylum seekers. (3) 35 failed Iranian asylum seekers have returned. There have been 28 voluntary returns and 7 involuntary returns. (4) Ten. (5) 46 failed Iranian asylum seekers were returned to Iran in the 12 months prior to the signing of the MOU on 12 March 2003. (6) Four. Broadband Services (Question No. 937) Mrs Irwin asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 17 March 2005: (1) Is it the case that Broadband service is not available in all areas of the electoral division of Fowler; if so, which regions or areas do not have access to Broadband. (2) Is the Minister aware that a substantial number of commercial enterprises in the electoral division of Fowler are unable to obtain Broadband services. (3) Is the Minister aware that the owners of these businesses are being advised that the reason is that they are either (a) too far from the Exchange, (b) the service is not available due to insufficient pair gains or copper cable, or (c) they are on a rim that does not support ADSL. (4) Is the Minister aware that of the numerous approaches made to Telstra by business owners in the electoral division of Brand regarding their inability to obtain Broadband services. (5) What has been the response from Telstra and what action is Telstra taking to address this situation. (6) Can the Minister say when Broadband services will be available throughout the electoral division of Fowler. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question, based in part on information provided by Telstra: (1) Broadband services are available in all areas of the electoral division of Fowler via one or more broadband access technologies. All telephone exchanges within the electoral division of Fowler have been ADSL enabled. Technical limitations associated with ADSL mean that not all customer premises connected to an ADSL enabled telephone exchange are able to receive an ADSL service. Hybrid Fibre Coaxial (HFC) cable and wireless broadband services are also available to a number of customers within the electoral division of Fowler. Customers that do not have access to broadband services via either ADSL, HFC cable or wireless can access broadband services via a twoway satellite connection. From early 2006 the Government’s $50 million Metropolitan Broadband Blackspots Program will assist customers in metropolitan areas where affordable broadband access is not available. This program builds upon the success of the Government’s $242 million Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme which is assisting customers in regional Australia. (2) As noted in part (1), all business are able to access broadband services through either one or more technologies. (3) Telstra has advised that a number of business customers are currently unable to receive ADSL services due to technical barriers such as the distance customers’ premises are from their local exchange, and the presence of pair gain equipment or Remote Integrated Multiplexers (RIMs) in the customer access network. Normally, Telstra would notify individuals and businesses who have applied for an ADSL service and are impacted by one of these barriers of the reason why an ADSL service cannot be supplied, and advise them of alternative broadband services. (4) Telstra has advised that it has received requests for ADSL services from businesses in the electorate of Brand. (5) As noted in part (3) where ADSL is not available, Telstra advises business customers of alternative broadband services. Telstra has advised that it is committed to an ongoing program of improving the availability of ADSL services. In August 2004, Telstra announced that it will be spending $28 million to extend ADSL services to an extra 250,000 lines by upgrading and replacing Remote Integrated Multiplexers and other pair gain systems, mainly in metropolitan areas. In the electoral division of Brand, Telstra has undertaken major network enhancement projects in Rockingham, Medina and Mandurah. Further, Telstra advises that upgrades have been planned within the Mandurah Exchange Service Area (ESA) in the areas of Halls Head, Coodanup, Falcon and Dudley Park. Upgrades have also been planned within the Medina ESA for the areas of Leda, Oakford and Casuarina. (6) As noted in part (1), broadband services are already available throughout the electoral division of Fowler. People with Disabilities (Question No. 958) Mr Kerr asked the Minister for Workforce Participation, in writing, on 10 May 2005: (1) Is the Minister aware that, according to Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission data, people with disabilities experience a higher unemployment rate than other Australians’ (8.6% com-",126,Questions In Writing
139,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Artspared to 5%) as well as lower incomes, and that these figures have failed to improve notably over the last decade and in some areas have become worse. (2) How many people with disabilities are currently employed by Commonwealth Departments. (3) Is the Minister able to provide statistics revealing patterns of employment of people with disabilities by Commonwealth Departments over the last decade. (1) The Government is aware that people with disabilities experience a higher rate of unemployment than other Australians. However, according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (2003) unemployment amongst people with disabilities decreased by 2.9% between 1998 and 2003. As part of the Welfare to Work package, the Government is investing $550 million over four years to assist even more people with disabilities to move from welfare to work. This includes an increase of 101 000 employment assistance and rehabilitation places to help people into work in keeping with their capacity. The Government is also working with employer groups and industry representatives to increase employment opportunities for people with disabilities. An Employer Roundtable has been established to provide high level advice to the Government on ways to increase workforce participation for people with disabilities. In addition, a new jobs accommodation service will be developed during 2005-06 which will include a website and advice on a range of issues for employers and employees with disabilities. An additional $29 million over four years is being provided to boost the Workplace Modification and Wage Subsidy schemes for people with disabilities. These changes will assist in increasing the rate of workforce participation of people with disabilities. The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, the Hon Kevin Andrews MP, has provided a response to parts (2) and (3) (2) As at June 2004, 3.8% of ongoing employees of the Australian Public Service (or 4,613 people) identified as having a disability. It should be noted that identification of a disability, whilst encouraged, is entirely voluntary. In 2004, there was 31.5% of all ongoing employees who either chose not to reveal whether or not they have a disability, or for whom no relevant data was available. (3) The proportion of employees with a disability in the APS has declined steadily over the last decade. The 2003/04 State of the Service Report showed a general decline from 5.8% of ongoing employees in 1994-95 to 3.8% in 2003-04. TableA below shows the percentage of ongoing APS employees who identified as having a disability each year since 1995. Action is being taken to improve employment opportunities in the public sector for people with disabilities. All agencies are required to have a Disability Action Plan for improving accessibility for people with a disability, and are required as part of the Commonwealth Disability Strategy to remove barriers for people with a disability by ensuring access to buildings, services, information, employment, education, sport and recreational activities. The Public Service Commissioner’s Directions require that Agency Heads put in place measures to prevent discrimination in their workplace and recognise the positive advantages of diversity in the workplace. Agencies are active in this area. The 2004 State of the Service Report showed that 85% of agencies have measures in place to recruit people with a disability, including: Provision of assistance during the application process;",129,Questions In Writing
140,Mr Dutton,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Adjustment to working environments; and Staff networks. Pleasingly, the number of agencies with measures in place for the retention of people with a disability has grown significantly, with 90% of agencies now using initiatives such as: Network participation; Disability awareness training; Access to contact officers; Flexible working arrangements; and Access to skills development programmes. The APS Management Advisory Committee agreed in July that its next project would address the employment of people with a disability in the APS and would draw on relevant aspects of the work currently being undertaken in the area by the Department of Family and Community Services and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Australian Public Service Commission is continuing to monitor the employment of people with disabilities in the Australian Public Service through its annual State of the Service Report.

141,Mr Ruddock,"The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to(1) The AFP has received additional funding for a number of new activities and deployments in the past five years. The following table shows new activities and deployments: AFP ADDITIONAL FUNDING MEASURES 2000/01 – 2005/06 Australian Police presence in the United Nations (UN) in East Timor Protection of the National Information Infrastructure Unauthorised arrivals in Australia / People Smuggling Protective Security& Counter Terrorism Crime Capacity Enhanced aviation security Expansion of AFP presence in Melanesia Back capture of DNA from Federal prisoners Expansion Law Enforcement Cooperation Program Double the strike team capacity of the AFP Extension of Project Axiom E-security national agenda AFP rapid response capability Expand research & development capability of AFP Enhancement of protective security services PNG Deployment Solomon Islands Regional Assistance Mission Bali Investigation costs Combating trafficking in persons whole of government strategy Aviation Security enhancement Safer Australia enhanced check aviation security cards Solomon Islands Health Service Aust Personnel Investing in Australia’s Security rapid deployment capability Investing in Australia’s Security Jakarta Centre Law Enforcement Investing Australian Security Air Security Officer Program Surveillance enhanced capabilities & oversight Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games Contribution Aviation Security enhancement (2) As at 1 June 2005 the AFP had 6.9 % of its workforce, including Protective Service Officers, deployed overseas. This figure includes both the AFP’s International Network as well as the AFP’s peacekeeping and enhanced cooperation programs. In addition, a further 67 State Police were deployed overseas as part of AFP initiatives. (3) Resources for the AFP’s overseas deployments are made up of staff selected from the AFP’s National area, ACT Policing and from State Police forces. (4) AFP staff do not move to the IDG permanently, but for an agreed period of deployment. This arrangement allows for a fixed term allocation, which in turn is covered through a backfilling strategy. (5) The following table shows sworn staffing levels now and in 1988. Due to the uncertainty of future operational activities and the changing environment in which the AFP operates, the AFP is unable to forecast sworn staff levels for 2010. Sworn Staff1 July 1988 Sworn Staff Currently 2532 2317 (6) For deployment on IDG missions to Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Jordan and Nauru the minimum policing experience required is set at four years.

(2) In respect of each weapons system which uses depleted uranium, what amount of depleted uranium is used and for what purpose. (3) Which types of aircraft operated by the ADF incorporate the use of depleted uranium for ballast or other purposes. (4) In respect of each type of aircraft which uses depleted uranium, what amount of depleted uranium is used and for what purpose. (5) For what other purposes does the ADF or the Department of Defence use depleted uranium. (6) What safety precautions are laid down for maintenance and other personnel who may come into contact with depleted uranium used by the ADF or the Department of Defence. (7) What provision has been made for public health and safety in the event of dispersal of depleted uranium from ADF or Department of Defence activities. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) None. (2) Not applicable. (3) and (4) See my response to Senate Question on Notice No 1855, part (1), published in Hansard on 9 October 2003. (5) None. (6) Screening for exposure to depleted uranium following deployment is offered to ADF personnel considered at increased risk and to those who request it. The testing is completed by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, utilising the latest industry methodology available. Defence uses SAFETYMAN, which includes Australian Defence Force Publication 724 Defence Ionising Radiation Safety Manual, as the key policy document to provide guidance to workers who may be exposed to depleted uranium. (7) As the only depleted uranium used in the ADF is in counterweights, the likelihood of dispersal is negligible.

(3) Are there Guidelines for the roll out of telecommunications base stations; if so, do they provide details indicating where a proposed base station would not comply with (a) State legislation, (b) Council regulations, and (c) the Telecommunications (Low-Impact Facilities) Determination. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: The response in part is based on advice from the Australian Communications and Authority (ACA), now part of the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA): (1) ACMA has a role in regulating carriers who are acting under powers and immunities established by the Telecommunications Act 1997 (the Act) and its subordinate instruments. ACMA is responsible for ensuring that carriers comply with the Telecommunications Code of Practice 1997 (the Code of Practice) when inspecting land or installing low-impact facilities. Where a carrier has breached the Code of Practice, ACMA has advised that it may take enforcement action. Carriers deploying mobile phone infrastructure must comply with the Australian Communications Industry Forum Deployment of Mobile Phone Network Infrastructure Code (the ACIF Code) which",140,Questions In Writing
144,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Artsis registered by ACMA under Part6 of the Act. ACMA has the power to issue formal warnings and directions to carriers to comply with the ACIF Code. (2) ACMA has no role in determining whether a facility is a low-impact facility or not. Low-impact facilities are defined in the Telecommunications (Low-impact Facilities) Determination 1997 (the Determination). The Determination specifies certain facilities that are of low visual impact and specifies their size, colour and zoning limitations. Only a court of competent jurisdiction may make a ruling on the interpretation of the Determination and whether a facility complies with this Determination. (3) Yes. The Telecommunications (Low-impact Facilities) Determination 1997 (the Determination) specifies certain types of facilities that may be installed under the Telecommunications Act 1997 (the Act). The Determination defines where facilities may be installed based on the zoning of the site as commercial, industrial, residential or rural under State or Territory planning laws. Telecommunications installations that are not low-impact facilities, or for which a carrier does not hold a facility installation permit, can only be installed with approval under State and Territory Government planning laws. Development approvals for new infrastructure are generally dealt with at the local council level. Individual State and Territory Governments or Councils may issue their own guidelines relating to these facilities. Carriers must also comply with the Australian Communications Industry Forum Deployment of Mobile Phone Network Infrastructure Code (the ACIF Code) when installing mobile telecommunications facilities, whether installed under Commonwealth or State and Territory law. The ACIF code requires that carriers apply a precautionary approach to the design, operation and selection of sites for communications facilities. In addition, The Mobile Carriers Forum (McF) publishes the Guidelines for Better Visual Outcomes: Low-impact Mobile Facilities. The McF states that the ‘guidelines have been prepared to assist in the siting and design of new low-impact mobile telecommunications facilities.’ These guidelines have no legislative authority. De Silva Family (Question No. 1442) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 24 May 2005: (1) Is the Minister aware that Mr Remigeus (Wayne) De Silva and his family from Sri Lanka have been prevented from applying for a substantive visa while in Australia because he has previously applied for, and been refused, a substantive visa. (2) Is the Minister aware that Mr De Silva has been advised that he can apply for a visa, but only from another country. (3) Is the Minister aware that (a) Mr De Silva has gained a position as the only White Goods Repair Mechanic with Hardinghams Plumbing and Electrical in Donald through the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme, (b) Mr De Silva’s wife volunteers at the local aged care facility and (c) they have one child in primary school and another in High School. (4) Can the Minister explain what advantage would be obtained for Australia by requiring Mr De Silva to leave Australia before applying for a visa to re-enter the country. (5) Can the Minister understand that the disruption, not only for this Sri Lankan family, but also for the community of Donald, is totally untenable. (6) Would the Minister grant the De Silva family visas to enable them to remain in Australia without having to leave the country to do so. Mr John Cobb-The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. Mr De Silva was refused an application for a substantive visa on 3 January 2002 after initially entering Australia on a Visitor visa. He applied for and was refused a Protection visa. He unsuccessfully appealed this through to the High Court. This meant that he fell within the provisions of section 48 of the Migration Act, which did not allow him to make any further substantive visa application while in Australia because he had been refused a visa since arriving and no longer held a substantive visa. (2) Yes. This is the effect of section 48 of the Migration Act. Officers of the Department worked with Mr De Silva to minimise the effect of this provision by completing much of the processing before his departure. (3) (a) Yes. (b) Yes. (c) Yes. (4) The section 48 provision was put in place in 1994 to combat the practice of people temporarily in Australia repeatedly applying for further visas, particularly Protection visas, in order to prolong their stay. (5) and (6) Officers of the Department worked closely to assist Mr De Silva to apply for an appropriate visa to return to Australia. Processing was finalised and he was granted a temporary business visa to enable him to return to Australia quickly. He and his family returned on 20 July 2005 on a temporary business (long stay) visa (subclass 457) valid for four years. In that time he will be able to apply for a permanent resident visa, including an employer sponsored permanent visa. Broadband Services (Question No. 1458) Mr Hayes asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 25 May 2005: (1) Is it the case that Broadband service is not available in all areas of the electoral division of Werriwa; if so, which areas do not have access to Broadband. (2) What reasons does Telstra give for not providing access to Broadband. (3) What action is Telstra taking to address this situation. (4) Is the Minister able to say when Broadband services will be available throughout the electoral division of Werriwa. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question, based in part on information provided by Telstra: (1) No. Broadband services are available in all areas of the electoral division of Werriwa via one or more broadband access technologies. All telephone exchanges within the electoral division of Werriwa, with the exception of the Kemps Creek exchange, have been ADSL enabled. The Kemps Creek exchange is scheduled to be ADSL enabled in September 2005. Technical limitations associated with ADSL mean that not all customer premises connected to an ADSL enabled telephone exchange are able to receive an ADSL service. Hybrid Fibre Coaxial (HFC) cable and wireless broadband services are also available to a number of customers within the electoral division of Werriwa.

Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme (Question No. 1669) 14 June 2005: (1) Does the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme operate on the basis of 1963 Actuarial Tables; if so, is it the case that life expectancy data cannot be updated under the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973. (2) Has the Minister’s department undertaken any research on the current life expectancy of defence personnel retirees. (3) Has the Minister’s department considered amending the relevant legislation to ensure it is consistent with other comparable superannuation schemes in Australia. (4) To what extent is post-commutation pay under the Defence Force and Retirement Death Benefits Scheme derived by reducing the pre-commutation pay by an amount calculated by dividing the service person’s commutation lump sum by the person’s life expectancy as set out in Schedule3 of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act. (5) Is it the case that there is no mechanism in place to restore the pension to the pre-commuted entitlement once the ex-service person has reached their life expectancy. (6) What action if any has been taken to ensure that the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme complies with section 41B of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) No. The actuarial tables used in Schedule3 were sourced from Australian Life Tables 1960-1962, and cannot be updated under the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973. (2) No. (3) No. When announcing the review of ADF superannuation which led to the creation of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme (MSBS), the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, the Hon David Simmons, made the following undertaking on 29 August 1989:",146,Questions In Writing
149,"Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister Representing The Minister For Defence, In Writing, On","“The Government has given an iron clad guarantee that the benefits for which members are currently contributing will continue to be available to them when they leave the Defence Force”. The undertaking ensured members who elected to remain in the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (DFRDB) Scheme would not be disadvantaged by any changes to the Scheme made after their decision to remain in the Scheme. It also enabled members to make the decision whether to remain in the DFRDB Scheme, or join the MSBS, while being certain of their entitlements under each Scheme, and the basis and method by which they would be calculated. The DFRDB Scheme is not comparable to other Australian schemes. Even if the Scheme was able to be reviewed, all of the Scheme would need reviewing, rather than elements in isolation. This may not result in a favourable outcome for all members of the Scheme, opening the ability for members to raise concerns regarding the Government’s guarantee. (4) 100 per cent. (5) Yes. It is a common misunderstanding that pensions are reduced after commutation in order to repay the amount commuted. This is not the case. The repayment is a notional concept used to explain the process by which life expectancy factors are used to ensure that members electing to commute part of their pension do not receive more than they would in usual pension payments over their expected lifetime. That is, the amount commuted and the residual pension should not exceed the amount of pension a member would receive if they had chosen not to commute their pension. As well, the view that the commutation has been ‘repaid’ does not take account of the benefits the member may drive from the commuted amount. (6) The Department of Defence has researched the DFRDB Scheme and has responded to questions posed by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission regarding section 41B of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. This was in response to a complaint against the DFRDB Authority, Commonwealth Superannuation Administration and the Department of Defence. The Commission has found in favour of the respondents. Government Services (Question No. 1710) Ms Hoare asked the Minister for Human Services, in writing, on 16 June 2005: (1) Can he confirm that part of his brief as Minister for Human Services is to streamline the delivery of government services to the Australian people; if so, can he confirm that this includes (a) improving the lines of communication and (b) eliminating policy inconsistencies between the Government’s various service delivery agencies. (2) Is he aware that where Centrelink needs to take into account the child support and maintenance actions of its clients serious problems often arise because information is not communicated between, or is assessed differently by, Centrelink and the Child Support Agency. (3) Can he outline the specific measures he is undertaking to address these communication deficiencies and inconsistent approaches, it not; why not. (1) My responsibility as the Minister for Human Services is to improve the delivery of government services to the Australian people. That includes ensuring services are as streamlined as possible, with clear and straight forward access to these services. My aim as minister is to maximise coordination of the delivery of services across the six agencies, to the benefit of the Australian people. The Department of Human Services is consulted in the development of policy options by policy departments.",147,Questions In Writing
150,Mr Hockey,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) I am aware that Centrelink considers Child Support information in determining entitlements to Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and therefore accurate exchange of information is essential. The Child Support Agency (CSA) sends information to Centrelink via an electronic interface on a regular basis to inform Centrelink of customer entitlements to FTB. Information provided includes details of child support entitlements and payments needed for the purposes of the maintenance action tests and maintenance income test. Centrelink and CSA necessarily apply different criteria for assessment because they are administering different legislation. The test applied by Centrelink for receipt of benefits is based on the principles of need and equity. The resources a person has available to them must be considered and, as such, the total household income is taken into account when determining eligibility. Consequently, the joint incomes of both partners of a relationship are considered when assessing entitlement to any payment. The Child Support scheme is based on the principle that parents of children are primarily responsible for their financial care, and that children continue to share in the financial circumstances of their parents following separation. I note that the government is currently considering the recommendations of the Parkinson Report. (3) Specific actions to improve communication and information exchange between Centrelink and CSA include: CSA and Centrelink commenced a joint initiative on 1 June 2005 to offer parents the option of a phone transfer directly to a client service officer in the other agency. This is aimed at improving service to mutual clients; A three month trial to extend the concept for a broader range of clients is scheduled to commence November 2005. The transfer option should assist in resolving some of the issues parents have around the child support/family assistance interaction; Client data is exchanged electronically, under a joint information protocol between CSA and Centrelink via a secure network link. The data exchanged includes a weekly entitlements file, a three-monthly payment file as well as daily client information updates. CSA provides weekly information to Centrelink through an alternative delivery channel about parents who are ineligible to apply for child support. Centrelink and CSA are communicating regularly to seek improvements in data exchange; A joint agency working group, comprising Centrelink and CSA officers, meets regularly to deal with operational issues; A Centrelink / CSA computer system enhancement is scheduled for September 2005, which will improve the accuracy and timeliness of child support payments and Family Tax Benefit; and Centrelink’s Child Support Steering Committee meets regularly to monitor the development and direction of the delivery of the child support program. Centrelink and CSA are participating in departmental deliberations on the response to the Parkinson Report. Further, if a customer is not satisfied in relation to Centrelink’s assessment of their child support information they can request clarification or review. If the customer is not satisfied with the explanation they can also appeal against the decision. Detainees (Question No. 1715) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 20 June 2005: (1) For each of the last three years, how many complaints by Immigration detainees have been lodged with the Ombudsman’s Office. (2) What is the process for determining these complaints. (3) What is the average time taken to determine a complaint. (4) How many complaints have not been finalised within a year of lodgement. (5) Do detainees have any appeal rights on the determination of a complaint. (6) Do detainees have access to (a) legal advice and (b) legal representation when lodging a complaint. Mr John Cobb-The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Ombudsman has advised as follows: The Ombudsman’s office does not record complaints by the nature of the complainant; therefore we cannot say how many complaints immigration detainees have lodged for any period. (2) The Ombudsman has advised as follows: The Ombudsman’s office conducts investigations impartially and in private. Under the Ombudsman Act 1976 (the Act), the Ombudsman has wide powers to investigate a complaint within his jurisdiction in the manner in which he sees fit. The legislation gives the Ombudsman the discretion not to investigate certain complaints. Where the Ombudsman’s office decides to investigate a complaint, staff follow processes established within the office. These processes can include seeking more information from the detainee; seeking information from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA); examining DIMIA files, policies and procedures; and viewing footage of alleged incidents, if available. The Ombudsman is also able to exercise formal powers under s(9) of the Act to inspect or obtain DIMIA documents or interview anyone with information relevant to an investigation. (3) The Ombudsman has advised as follows: The average time taken by the Ombudsman’s office to finalise a complaint about the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in 2003-04 was 61.2 days. (4) The Ombudsman has advised as follows: The Ombudsman’s office received 865 complaints about the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in 2003-04. Of these, 19 were not finalised within a year of lodgement. (5) The Ombudsman has advised as follows: A detainee who has made a complaint to the Ombudsman’s office has the same review rights as any other complainant. He or she may seek an internal review, conducted under processes established within the Ombudsman's office. There is a right for anyone affected by a decision by the Ombudsman to seek judicial review of that decision under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. (6) (a) Detainees do not require legal advice when lodging a complaint with the Ombudsman’s office. If a detainee chooses to seek legal advice when lodging such a complaint, he or she may do so. However, this legal advice will be at the detainee’s own expense and will be arranged by the detainee. My Department provides the detainee with the means to contact a legal firm (ie access to the phone book). (b) The response concerning legal advice provided at (6)(a) above also applies to legal representation for detainees who lodge complaints with the Ombudsman’s office. Media and Communications Officers (Question No. 1781) Mr Bowen asked the Minister for Human Services, in writing, on 23 June 2005: (1) How many media and communications officers are employed in the Minister’s department.

(3) What sum was allocated to the media and communications unit in (a) 1996-1997, (b) 2004-2005, and (c) 2005-2006. (1) The core Department of Human Services employs 3 media and communications officers. (2) The Department of Human Services did not exist in 1996. (3) (a) The Department of Human Services did not exist during this period. (b) The Department of Human Services was established on 26 October 2004. The sum allocated in the core department to the media and communications unit in 2004 – 2005 from 26 October 2004 to 30 June 2005 was $451,650. (c) The sum allocated to the media and communications unit in 2005 – 2006 is approximately $850,000, however, internal department funding allocations may vary over the course of the year.

Once the Commanding Officer became aware that media representatives ashore covering the earthquake disaster had issued press reports on the crash he, by necessity, re-opened the telephone and e-mail lines of communications and advised the ship’s company to let their families know they were well. (2) There is no formal direction of this nature. However, any ships Commanding Officer would be expected to make similar judgements in such circumstances. (3) The Commanding Officer’s primary concern was with protecting the families of the deceased and injured. The immediacy of the release of the press report on the crash to the public was unforseen and occurred due to the presence of media on Nias covering the earthquake relief effort. (4) The timeliness and correctness of notifying the next-of-kin of the deceased and injured will be investigated by the Board of Inquiry. Protocols for advising other family members will be reviewed once the findings are handed down.

Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (a) to (l) Briefings and access provided to visitors to the JDFPG are given at a level appropriate to their level of security clearance and the requirement of their position.

(2) Does the Government have an estimate of the likely rate of the annual decline in production after global oil production passes its peak. (3) Does the Government have estimates of the impact on global oil prices of the continuing decline in global oil production; if so, what are they. (4) Has the Government undertaken any economic modelling to determine the consequences for the Australian economy of very large and sustained increases in global oil prices; if so, what are the outcomes of the modelling. Mr Ian Macfarlane-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) No. As the size of the world’s total oil reserves are not known with any certainty, a specific year cannot be readily identified as the ‘peak point’. However, my Department monitors research/ publications on the issue to remain informed of the wide range of industry forecasts. (2) No. The rate at which production will decline following the ‘peak point’ is subject to a wide range of factors, including global oil extraction and consumption rates, and the extent of substitution between oil and other energy sources. The government does not have estimates of the likely annual rate of global production decline following the peak point. (3) No. The government has no specific estimates of the impact on global oil prices from declines in production (4) Yes. My Department is currently involved in a study on ‘the Impact of Oil Prices on Trade in the APEC Region’, which is being undertaken by Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, on behalf of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Energy Working Group. The study will undertake detailed economic modelling to quantify the effects of sustained increases in oil prices on macroeconomic indicators and patterns of trade in the APEC Region, including Australia, and will be completed in October, with key findings reported to the 7th Meeting of APEC Energy Ministers on 19 October 2005 (which I will be attending). At that meeting, I will discuss the issue of recent sustained increases in the world price of oil with my APEC counterparts, and we will consider a regional coordinated response. Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (Question No. 1955) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 9 August 2005: (1) Did the Government take any action to have the implementation of non-proliferation treaty commitments incorporated onto the agenda of the Non-proliferation Treaty Convention in New York. (2) Did the Government make representations to the Government of the United States of America to achieve this objective. (3) Does the failure to have discussion of these commitments added to the agenda of the New York meeting represent a significant diplomatic setback for global efforts for non-proliferation. (4) Is he aware that the United States uses concerns about the existence of weapons of mass destruction as rationale for its foreign policy but refuses to adopt equivalent measures for its own stockpile of nuclear arsenal. (5) Is the task of persuading all of the international community to support the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction made more difficult by the refusal of the United States to disarm. (1) A review of the implementation of Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) provisions is a standard agenda item for NPT review conferences and was part of the agenda for the 2005 NPT Review Conference. Australia supported this. (2) No. See (1) above. (3) See (1) above. (4) The NPT does not prohibit possession of nuclear weapons by the five nuclear weapon states (the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France and China) which existed when the Treaty was concluded. However, the NPT nuclear weapon states have given a commitment to advance and eventually achieve nuclear disarmament. The United States has substantially reduced its nuclear arsenal, including through the 2002 Treaty of Moscow. Upon completion of the Moscow Treaty reductions in 2012, the United States will have reduced by about 80 percent the number of strategic nuclear warheads it deployed in 1990. (5) Australia believes that progress on nuclear disarmament is a core NPT obligation, vital to the Treaty’s political strength and vitality. But we do not accept that movement on nuclear disarmament should be a precondition for improvements to the non-proliferation regime. Such an approach puts at risk the security benefit all NPT parties derive from assurances that nuclear programs in non-nuclear weapon states are peaceful.

Each year the Federal Government provides financial assistance grants to Local Government paid through the States under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995. The financial assistance grants have two components – general purpose grants and identified local roads grants – and both components are untied in the hands of the receiving council. This means that councils are able to spend the grant (including the local road grant) according to the priorities of their communities.

(4) No. The Australian Government believes that where possible, any dispute should be resolved directly between the parties without third-party interference. Further, insofar as the entitlement to negotiate a collective agreement is concerned, the existing law means Boeing is within its rights in taking the position it is taking. (5) It is and it will remain illegal for employers to coerce employees to agree to Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs). However, it is perfectly legitimate for employers to use AWAs as their employment instrument of choice when offering employment.
