I am taking this course in order'to direct attention to the fact that the report of the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner, insofar as it summarizes the operations of the Commonwealth Railways Department for the year ended the 30th June, 1939, in its statistical abstract, is,administration of the Commissioner no doubt, thorough and complete; but insofar as it relates to the administration of the railways by the Commissioner, it leaves out. I venture to say, the most cardinal aspect which calls for the attention of honourable members. During the ycar covered by the report an inquiry was ordered by the Government into the administration of the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner. No particulars persons who .tendered evidence at the inquiry .have since suffered to some degree in respect to their rights in the of the inquiry. an inquii-y held at the behest of the Minister into the administration of the Commissioner of Railways is a vastly different matter. Sir 'CHARLES MABB -When was the inquiry held? mation. I believe it took some weeks. It may even have been months. Perhaps the Minister can tell me. by the Minister makes it all the more necessary that we should know what actually occurred. I think that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) will agree that an inquiry into the of Railways is an entirely different thing from an inquiry into the actions of a subordinate officer because, while the responsible Minister is under obligation to Parliament in connection with the railways, the conduct of the administration is reposed by statute, and very",13,Requisitioning Of S S Binqera

Cabinet directs the policy and the Minister is responsible for seeing that it is carried out, but, by and large, the administration is entrusted to the Commissioner by statute.. The statute authorizes the Commissioner to do many things on his own volition. Cabinet, or the Minister, cannot-vary the administration of the Commissioner, because his duties are so clearly specified by statute. This surely indicates clearly that an inquiry held by ministerial order into the administration of the Railways Commissioner is of very great importance. In my opinion it is utterly wrong that the result should be withheld from Parliament. survey that I have made of the report just tabled I find no reference whatsoever to this inquiry. There are references to what I shall describe as fiddling details of administration which are in themselves unimportant; but there is no reference to the ministerial inquiry. I have moved this motion in order to draw attention to this fact. I make no accusation against the Commissioner. I do not know the nature of the evidence submitted at the inquiry, but I feel that we are entitled to information on the subject. I desire that the evidence adduced at, and also the result of, the inquiry, shall be laid on the table of the House. In connection with this motion I draw attention to Standing Order No. 68, Country party ( Mr Archie Cameron) which readsTlie House shall proceed each day with its for bagged wheat and 2s. 4d. for bulk ordinary business in the following routine:(I) Presentation of petitions; (2) Giving wheat at sidings""? notices; (3) Questions on notice; and (4) Motions aud orders of the day or vice versa, as set down on the notice-paper.

I had hoped, a clear statement on this subject last night, to which I have nothing to add to-day. I fully explained the position in which we find ourselves. I sincerely hope, as I am sure every other honourable member does, that we shall be able to effect such sales of wheat during the season as will enable further payments to be made to the farmers, but whether that will be so or not neither I nor anybody else knows. ter inform me whether I am correct in surmising that the Leader of the agreed with his proposal outlined last night for the payment of 2s. 6d. a bushel speak for myself, and I should prefer the industry.

43,Mr John Lawson (Maequarie,"imports from British mandated territories as well as from Egypt and Sudan. It is, therefore, proposed to exempt all goods originating in countries of the sterling area from the application of the licensing control. Goods may be imported from such sources under the same conditions as apply at present. however, no goods may be imported from countries constituting the non-sterling area, including Canada, Newfoundland and Hong Kong, unless a licence to import the goods has been granted. In addition, as from to-morrow, exchange for the purchase of imports from countries outside the sterling area will not be provided except on production of an import licence authorizing the importation of those goods. The restrictions will not apply to goods now in transit to Australia, and it is proposed to admit under licence, goods on order under drafts drawn under letters of credit already established in Australia. In order to facilitate the administrative arrangements and to serve as a guide to all interested parties, all goods entering into trade have been classified into four categories according to the degree of importance attached to the imports. Essential or very important imports are given an "" A "" classification; important goods a "" B "" classification; less important goods a "" C "" classification, and unimportant goods a "" D "" classification. The grading of the whole range of imports into categories obviously presents many problems. I , therefore, do not hesitate' to say that the classifications are not regarded as perfect or final. As they stand 'at present they provide a basis for immediate application. It is realized that variations may be necessary in the light of either additional information or new conditions affecting particular commodities. Where sufficient evidence in support of alterations in classification is adduced they will be made. The general scheme of administration contemplates that licences will not be issued' for ""the importation from nonsterling countries of goods classified in Category"" V "" . The goods included in Category"" ' D "" for which licences will not' be granted are shown in the schedule which has been circulated for the information df honourable members Calculated on the basis of the imports from non-sterling countries during the year 1938-39, these goods were valued at £3,250,000 sterling. Total imports from non-sterling countries in the same year were valued at £46,500,000 sterling.. With regard to goods in the remaining In future, categories, that is, all goods except those shown in the list circulated to honourable members, it is proposed,, in general, to base the measures of regulation on the value of imports during the year 1938-39. That should not be taken to mean that licences will be immediately obtainable for amounts equivalent to the importations in that year. During the first licensing period which will cover a period of two months ending on the 31st January, 1940, licences will be granted to individual importers to the extent of one-sixth of the value of their respective importations of the same goods during the twelve months ended the 30th June, 1939. This is a general principle that will apply and will place licensing officers at the various ports throughout the Commonwealth in a position to deal promptly and uniformly with a large proportion of the more or less regular imports. The normal period of validity of a licence has been fixed at eight months in the case of imports from European countries', and six months in the case of those from other countries. Departures from the general principle will be unavoidable in the case of certain classes of imports as for instance(1) Imports of a seasonal character. (2) Irregular or non-recurring import transactions as for exampleimports of special machinery, new plant or equipment. (3) Essential commodities, the demand for which may have substantially increased under the emergency of war conditions. (4) Essential commodities subject to material price increases since 1938-39, the demand for which in terms of value exceeds the 1938-39 levels. In the interests. of sound administration it will be necessary progressively to adjust the bases on which licences are granted to meet these cases. Such adjustments as may be necessary maly only be determined in the light of the factors affecting the particular commodity or transaction. The measures, therefore, do not involve any immediate reduction of the value of imports except insofar as the goods named in the schedule in the hands of honourable members are concerned. The limitation of the immediate issue of licences for other goods to one-sixth of the importations m 193S-39 will enable the U rernment to keep a close watch on the situation should the position in relation to non-sterling exchange become more difficult at any time. When it is realized that Australia does, not directly acquire sufficient foreign exchange to finance essential imports from non-sterling countries, the urgent need for husbanding our resources becomes doubly apparent. We will, in fact, be obliged to draw on the reserve of nonsterling exchange held by Great Britain, and we can hardly approach the British Government for aid in this direction unless we are exercising the strictest economy in our use of foreign exchange. The British Government has itself imposed major restrictions on imports from countries outside the sterling area and the purposes for which foreign exchange is made available. The total Empire demand for foreign exchange necessary to finance urgent war requirements will be extremely heavy and will necessitate the wisest use of such supplies as'we can command. I would be misleading honourable members if I failed to say that there is little doubt that further restrictions will be unavoidable. We are engaged in a life and death struggle, and as the pressure of war needs increases we may have to face the question, not so much from the point of view of what we can do without, as from the point of view of what we must do without. The administration of the import control measures, which represent, the biggest step iu trade control adopted in Australia, is eertain to present many new problems. Everything possible will be done to deal with those problem cases fairly, impartially and expeditiously. where difficulties associated with supply and shipping space are sometimes acute, and where prices may be subject to sudden increases, the importance of prompt decisions will he fully recognized. Mr John /yoieson. It will be an important aim in administration to guard against conferring anything in the shape of monopoly rights on individual importers, and to preserve the free play of competition as far as practicable. The Government appreciates fully the implications of the policy of restriction and control which it has been obliged to adopt in the national interest, and realizes that measures of import re* striction and control must inevitably bring about a disturbance and dislocation of many businesses. We shall do our utmost to reduce those conditions to a minimum, and to that end shall be glad to consult with interested parties. The measures arise from necessity. Therefore the Government feels that where it is a question of choice between essential commodities and those imports that we can do without, or obtain with less embarrassment from other sources, the people of Australia and the business community will accord the Government, measures their full support. further reports appearing in the daily newspapers 'regarding the shortage of cornsacks, does the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce still maintain that ample supplies are available? leave-In response to a question asked by the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Scully) the day before yesterday, I undertook to make a complete statement to the House in regard to the cornsacks position. In view of the publicity that has been given to the cornsacks position in respect of the 1939-40 wheat harvest, I think it desirable that I should set. out the facts insofar as the Commonwealth and State Governments are concerned. In the first place it should be pointed out that the responsibility for ensuring an adequate In a world supply of sacks attaches primarily to the wheat-grower or his agents, and in ordinary times little or no difficulty is experienced in meeting requirements, as it is possible even at the Inst moment to supplement quiekly supplies from oversea?.",17,Control Of Imports Ministerial Statement
44,Mr Scholfield,In view of the,19,Price Op Cornsacks Ministerial Statement
45,Sir Frederick Stewart,"b yThe incidence of the war, with its extraordinary demand on the world's jute supplies for war purposes-the British Government in one order is reputed to have called for 500,000,000 sandbagschanged the conditions entirely, with the consequence that those farmers who had failed to make early provision found themselves in difficulties. In these circumstances the Commonwealth Government interested itself and instituted action in several important directions(1) Cornsacks were included in the list of items brought under price control; (2) Action was taken to stimulate the ordering of sacks up to the esti3s. a dozen, Australian currency, less than mated requirements, and to ensure fulfilment of orders already made in Calcutta. Added to the difficulties attendant on the huge demand for European war supplies, was that of ensuring appropriate shipping space, and in this latter connection our Commerce Department was able to render valuable aid. In connection with price regulation, prompt action was taken when, immediately after the outbreak of war, representations were made to the effect that profiteering was taking place in woolpacks and cornsacks. tions indicated that there wassome danger . of profiteering. Accordingly, when the Minister for. Trade, and Customs issued his first proclamation six days after the outbreak of war, bringing a number .of goods under price control, all jute goods, including cornsacks, were included in the list of controlled commodities. The price of cornsacks-in Calcutta on. the 31st August, 1939, was 8s. 2£d. a dozen c.i.f. Australian currency. Between the3rd September and the Oth September prices in -Calcutta had advanced to 9s. 3^:d. and indications were that the market would continue to rise. Although 'trading was taking place, there was some slackening off of orders because of the general nervousness, and on the 1.8th October, the Commonwealth Government decided to.take steps to ensure an additional 6,000,000 bags . being ordered over and above those ordered through the usual channels. But for this action, in respect of which the Commonwealth Government assumed a measure of financial liability, there would have been a most serious shortage. In regard to 4,260.000 of these sacks the average landed cost in Australia will be 12s. l^d. a dozen, in which is included additional war risk insurance of approximately 1-Jd. a dozen and increased freight of approximately 2fd. This compares with 8?. 2*d. just before the outbreak of war, 9s. 3^d. on the 9th September, and 15s. 3^d. quoted on the l l t h November for January delivery. All prices quoted are in Australian currency. Thus, the action taken by the department has secured these additional 4.250,000 sacks at the current prices, and will result in a saving to growers of-at least £50,000, as well as ensuring a substantial increase of supplies above what would have been available but for this action. The Government was also faced with pressing requests from Queensland and New South Wales for cornsaeks for districts where the wheat matures early. Although approximately 60 per cent, of the. season's requirements for the whole of Australia had been purchased and distributed at pre-war prices, the outbreak of war caused a heavy demand, especially Preliminary investigafrom early districts, because of the fear of a restriction of supply. As an indication of the problem which was put to' the Commonwealth Government, it is only necessary to say that on the 18th October the authorities of Queensland said that they needed 105,000 sacks immediately; eight days later, on the 26th October, they said that the quantity required was 180,000 sacks; on the following day they said that it was 315,000 sacks; and on the 31st October, after referring to their previous requests, they said that the total requirements should have been set down at 600,000 sacks. These have been obtained. Since the 31st October the Queensland WheatBoard has asked for a further 135,000 sack"". Most of these have also been obtained and forwarded to Queensland. In each case the -Commonwealth was asked to get these sacks immediately and at any. price. At the same time the authorities of New South Wales were pressing the Commonwealth to obtain sacks. At first, during the third week in October, they said that they needed 1,350,000 sacks immediately. Later this demand was reduced to 1,050,000 sacks, -300,000 immediately and the balance out of the next three steamers to arrive from Calcutta. Upon receipt by the Commonwealth of the first requests for sacks the authorities ing to make other arrangements for in Queensland and New South ""Wales were urged to explore all possible avenues, of supply within their respective States. They claimed to have explored all of these avenues without result. The Department of Supply and Development concentrated first of all on the immediate inquiry for 300,000 sacks for New South Wales and .105,000 sacks for Queensland. Unfortunately, the inquiries were interrupted from time to time because tbe Queensland -figure was constantly increased until finally, as stated, it reached a total of 600,000 sacks on the 31st October. This increase made the total immediate, requirements 900,000 sacks from a market on which, at the commencement of the inquiry, there was not one bale of cornsacks readily available on spot. been examined in New South Wales and Victoria, but no evidence of cornering could be found. As the result of the efforts of the Department of Supply and Development, Queensland now has been supplied with nearly 750,000 sacks and New South Wales has 60,000 sacks out of the 1,050,000 requested. The balance, 450,000 for New South Wales, will be supplied next week. The quantities required have been obtained without the Commonwealth Government having to commandeer one sack. They have been freely lent as a contribution towards the national well-being, and they will be replaced by the borrowers out of the shipment of 6,000,000 sacks to which I referred previously. Despite previous assurances that rethe effect that at the end of next week quirements for New South Wales had 1,400 bales would be distributed. Does been covered, asT have already explained, that mean that no more cornsacks will I was informed, at 11 o'clock on Monday be available?

The situation has been brought Rir Frederick Stewart. 60,000,000 bushels in his State. The sacks necessary to cope with such a crop have been fully arranged for, but the estimated crop has now been increased to 66,000,000 bushels, necessitating an increased quantity of 1,800,000 cornsacks. At this stage it is impossible to obtain these sacks in time for the harvesting, and the Minister for Agriculture is endeavourhandling the excess wheat. I point this out in amplification of my earlier statements regarding cornsack supplies for New South Wales. As I have previously indicated, the Department of Supply and Development has arranged for the supply of all of the sacks which had been asked for by the authorities in New South Wales prior to Monday last. I wish .to pay a tribute to the assistance rendered by members of the trade in the inquiries and by fertilizer and other companies in making sacks available on an undertaking of replacement. Having dealt with the immediate problem of cornsacks for the crop now being harvested, the Department of Supply and Development is now devoting its attenAllegations of hoarding had tion to the task of ensuring adequate supplies of jute goods in the future. The position is extremely difficult owing to the increasing prices in Calcutta, which may or. may noi continue and which are responsible for the present high costs of jute goods to farmers and others in Australia. I know that honourable members, particularly those representing rural districts, are deeply interested in this matter, and I can assure the House that the Government is doing all it can in the face of the existing difficulties to assist producers to secure their supplies at the best possible prices.

In Committee of Supply: Treasurer) [3.42] -When the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) brought down his budget on the Sth September, he stated that, although the budget was not delivered until after the outbreak of war, the estimates upon which it was based had been prepared in a time of peace. I direct the attention of It was true that the budget had been prepared to meet greatly increased defence expenditure and had provided for substantial increases of taxation. The altered position due to the war, however, necessitated revision, and a plain indication was given by the Prime Minister that the Estimates of expenditure would have to be revised, some upwards and some downwards. The Prime Minister also stated that the Estimates of revenue would have to be reviewed. As the Estimates of expenditure had to be returned to the departments, it was not possible for their revision to be completed before Parlia; ment was adjourned. In order to avoid delay, however, certain supplementary war taxation measures were brought down which were estimated to produce an additional revenue of over £2,000,000 this year, and over £2,500,000 for a full year. In the meantime, the detailed Estimates have been reviewed by the Government, and revised''Estimates, of revenue and expenditure have now been presented.

THE FINANCIAL , A t the outset I would emphasize thai the Government has given much consideration to the financial problem. -Obviously all of the difficulties which we shall have to face are not yet unfoideJ to us. We can, however, make plans for the future as f a r as it is practicable to do economic system must precede a judgso. looked ahead with the object of formulating a financial policy which w ill fit into a co-ordinated plan, and w ill be capable of being adapted to changing circumstances. Just as the United Kingdom is planning for the war lasting at least three years, so must our plans visualize a similar possibility. This requires a much more intensified defence and economic effort than this country was called upon to exert in the last war. It will be necessary for us to direct a very large proportion of our resources, physical and financial, to war purposes. Various phases of our activity will require to be co-ordinated closely if wasted effort is to be avoided. Briefly, we are faced with an economic problem of enormous magnitude. It is necessary for us to consider this problem in terms of the resources which wil] be required both for the war effort and for the civil needs of the people. Only the resources now available can be used for these purposes. To see the problem as one of making the best use of resources makes it clear that the real' burden of our war effort must be borne now; that it cannot by ingenious financial devices be shifted Once we recognize this fact we can concentrate our attention on securing the necessary diversion of resources from peace to Avar purposes with a minimum of interference with the standards of eonsumption we have enjoyed„in the past, and on avoiding disturbance to the balance of our economy which would make the .subsequent transition from war to peace more difficult. General Financial Briefly stated, the financial policy o the Government is to finance the. war effort by a balanced programme of taxation, borrowing from the public and borrowing fro m the banking system. This nate how that policy w ill be applied at any time. The balance between these three methods of finance must change from time to time' and the determining factors w ill be mainly economic. A review of the condition and trends of the The Government has, therefore, ment on the exact financial policy required. Present Economic Situation. In the period before the war we had experienced a prolonged f a l l of export prices. In the last few months of tlu pre-war period, the adverse effects of f a l l ing export prices were intensified by a decline of private investment. As a consequence there was some recession in economic activity in Australia, which may be illustrated by the increase of unemployment. Between the June quarter o 1938 and the June quarter of 1939 the percentage of unemployed in trade unions rose fro m 8.6 to 9.7 per cent. Another aspect of this recession was the declining liquidity of (he trading banks. The low level of export prices had caused a decline in London funds in each of the last two years. Despite considerable activity by the Commonwealth Bank to offset the effects of this decline, there was a net deterioration of the liquid position of the trading banks which necessarily intensified the difficulties ot the period. We had not recovered from this slight recession when war was declared. There was inevitably some dislocation of normal to the future. economic activity, which showed itself in a greater hesitation in private investment, in a check to the flow of imports, in a n increase of the numbers of unemt ployed and in some delay in the receipt of ,the proceeds of export production. There is no reason to believe that this dislocation w ill be more than temporary. A number of factors are working for improvement. First,' 'the proceeds of the J recent sales of-export products to the. United Kingdom are already coming to hand. Altogether they w ill amount to Policy. more than £100,000,000. Payment will p probably be received sooner and w ill affect the banking system more quickly than normal peacetime sales. There has been, indeed, a general improvement in respect of the balance of payments. Whereas in the last two years our reserves of London funds have been substantially drawn upon, in the current year we may reasonably expect some net increase of those funds, perhaps as much as £15,000,000. This is, however, an optimistic estimate, and may be reduced if difficulties are exdefence purposes in this financial year. perienced in shipping exports or if there is a very great reduction of the flow of capital into Australia. A second factor working for improvement is that Commonwealth Bank operations are continuing to give support to the banking system and to maintain economic activity. Thirdly, defence expenditure is having an increasingly stimulating effect on the economy generally. ""Wihile these factors have not yet been fully reflected in the employment of our resources, their effects will continue to become more evident in the coming months. Immediate Financial Policy. Paced with the temporary dislocation in the economic system the Government considered that for the time being it must avoid action likely to discourage private activity until our resources are more fully employed and our national income has been raised. Consequently the Government, has decided that, in distributing the cost of its war programme between taxation, public borrowing and borrowing from the banking system, it will for the time being weight the balance towards borrowing with the assistance of the banking system rather than towards taxation. In accordance with this decision two private loans have been arranged from the banking system; the first for£10,000,000 for Commonwealth and State works and the second for £2,000,000 for special defence works low in the order of defence priority, especially chosen to ease tin? unemployment position until the effects of defence expenditure become fully apparent.. In view of the increases of taxation impared to avail itself of this instrument posed , in . September, £3,000,000, . the uncertainty from the outbreak of -war and the recent decline of employment, the Government is of the opinion that to increase taxation at the present time would merely delay the recovery of our economy, retard the Mr Spender. full utilization of employable labour, reduce the potential of our national income, and consequently interfere with the full prosecution of our war programme. It has been decided,. therefore, not to in -. crease further the burden of taxation for Long Term Policy. While the Government is convinced that the policy I have just outlined is the most appropriate for the present situation, it does not imagine that that situation will remain static, and it has consequently made plans to modify its financial policy to meet the changing character of the economic problem facing it. . We expect the economic situation to be profoundly influenced by the financial policy we are putting into effect. In the absence of increased taxation and with the stimulating influence of increasing export income and rising defence expenditure, it is anticipated that the employment position will improve substantially, and the national income will he increased correspondingly. When these changes have occurred, the demands of the war on our physical resources will commence to encroach on what may be described as the ordinary civil demands. The Government will then review the economic position to decide the exact form in which its policy needs to be applied. The problem will be to determine the most appropriate balance between the various methods of finance upon which the Government has planned to rely. Some consideration of the general principles to be taken into account may be appropriate at this stage. Credit Expansion. Credit expansion is a valuable instrument of financial policy for bringing into the economic system resources which might otherwise remain unused. The Government has shown by its financial policy at the present time that it is preaggregatingfor its appropriate purpose. It must, resulting however, be used with discretion: We learned'some lessons from the last, war when credit expansion was carried to excess by most belligerent countries and even by Australia. This excess was reflected in the spiral of rising prices and costs, profiteering, industrial unrest and in the burden on fixed incomes and also on salaries and wages which lagged behind prices. Moreover, to undue monetary expansion in the last war must be attributed much of the economic instability of the post-war period. It is the intention of the Government to avoid these evils in Australia as far as lies in its power. The simple fact is .that defence must be paid for now Avith men and materials. No manipulation can alter the burden. All that can be done is to change its incidence. Credit expansion overdone is one of the easiest ways of doing this, but its results are very different from what its advocates believe. While wage and salary earners suffer and savings are whittled away, those engaged in trade inevitably profit from the Avar, and the large investor protects and increases his Avealth by holding equities, the value of which will rise us the purchasing power of money declines. Not only is it unjust in its incidence, but it also brings repercussions Avhich are harmful to the whole economic life of the community. For every undue expansion we shall ultimately pay the price. Borrowing from the Public. It is the policy of the Government to draAv for Avar purposes upon the savings of the whole community. These savings are devoted to the capital development of our country. They are embodied in factories, machinery, railways, roads, homes, motor-cars and other capital goods. If we are to devote our greatest efforts to the Avar, it -will, unfortunately, be necessecurities regulations a proviso that banks sary for us to content ourselves with a slower rate of civil development than we have had in the past. The expansion of capital equipment and of public amenities must proceed more slowly. At the same time, the Government considers it of firstin the market is already declining, and class importance that progress and development should proceed to the utmost extent which available resources permit. Furthermore, we must exercise care to see that the savings of the people are not dissipated in ventures inappropriate in time of Avar. Regulations under the National Security Act have recently been promulgated to provide for the regulation of private investment so as to conserve the resources required for our war effort. Action has also been taken under the various monetary control regulations to ensure that no capital finds its way out of Australia. By this supervision and control, it is hoped to direct the savings of the people, first, -into Government, loans for war activity and, secondly, into the development of enterprises indirectly necessary for war activity. It is, I am sure, unnecessary for me to emphasize that this control will not be employed arbitrarily to restrict commercial activity. Limitations on private investment Avill be imposed only to ensure priority to the Government's needs. An important part of our borroAving plan is the issuing of savings certificates to afford people of small means the opportunity to play their part. The certificates will be available at an early date. Similar certificates are being issued in the United Kingdom. Little-has been said so far about the rate of interest. The Government is of the opinion that in the financing of the large war effort a low rate of interest is essential. Thus, to reduce interest, rateis a definite objective of the Government'financial policy. This objective Avill bs reached, however, as a consequence of our whole financial policy, rather than as the result of action directed solely at interest rates. The Government is confident that its general financial policy Avill enabte it to reduce rates from the level now current. Already we have arranged a loan at a substantially lower rate than any floated for some years. As part of its policy directed to this end, the Government recently incorporated in its could not charge rates of interest on loans in excess of the rate current for similar loans on the 31st August, Avithout tinapproval of the Commonwealth Treasurer. The yield on Government securities it is expected that the Government's policy will ultimately result in interest rates reaching and being maintained at a satisfactory and acceptable level. "" Taxation. As1 have pointed out, the Government has decided not to impose new taxation at the present time apart from the increases aggregating about. £8.000,000 which ware embodied in the budget and supplementary taxation measures which have already been placed before this House. This does not indicate an unwillingness on the part of the. Government to use taxation for financing the war effort. Of all forms .of war finance wellplanned taxation spreads the burden mosl equitably and has theleast harmful repercussions. The vital questions are when and to what extent taxation should be relied upon at any given time. I have drawn attention to the limits supervision I have outlined to prevent of finance by credit expansion and by the waste of resources, and to eliminate public loans. When our resources are as profiteering. fully employed as is practicable and our "" real"" national income at its peak, borrowing should not exceed the savings of the people available at any time. Any additional requirements should be drawn from taxation. There may, of course, be change in emphasis will come before the unexpected changes in our economic end of this financial year. Our attitude system which temporarily may render towards the plans for next year's budget, advisable the U3e of credit expansion the details of which are already being again, but that does not affect the validity considered, is therefore substantially difof this conclusion. It is inevitable that, if the necessary same three sources of finance-taxation, effort is to be achieved, we shall have to public borrowing and borrowing from do without some of the luxuries and semithe banking system-the Government inluxuries which, in more appropriate timet , tends to impose a comprehensive scheme we would he able to enjoy. A well-planned of war taxation details of which will be scheme of taxation will cut into only those brought down early in 1940. Only if this forms of expenditure which can best be is done and if the other controls of exdone without and will be capable of adchange, prices and capital investment are justment so that the burden does not maintained will it be possible for Ausexceed what is necessary at any particular tralia to avoid the evils of excessive time. burden can be reduced if taxation is avoided. The measure of the burden is the reduction of the supply of goods available for consumption made inevitable by our Estimates. The outstanding feature While the burden cannot be reduced, it can fall with varying hardship on differour Estimates. The outstanding feature ent groups of people. Whereas credit is the greatly increased estimate of Deexpansion used to excess causes the burden fence and War Expenditure. In the to be distributed unfairly, and in a disbudget, defence expenditure was estiguised way, taxation enables us scientimated at £33,137,000, to be met as folfically to place the burden where it can lows :best lie borne and where it will interfere least with the basic needs of the people. Taxation once paid is riot lost, to the community. It is available to the Government to be spent on purposes which are in the interests of the community as a whole. Mr Spender. ' Summary. It will be evident from bhe considerations which I have laid before honourable members that, as the economic recovery which has already begun gets under way, the Government will necessarily transfer the emphasis in its financial policy from boi-rowing from the banking system first to borrowing from the public and secondly, and more particularly, to taxation. These financial measures will be supplemented by the other forms of It is probable that the need for this ferent from our attitude to the present problem. In 1940-41, while retaining the Do not let us imagine that the credit expansion. Defence and War Expenditure.

Expenditure other than Defence and War. In view of the greatly increased burden of defence, other departments have been asked to exercise economy and to forgo, for the present, expenditure which, in happier times, would probably be approved. It must be emphasized, however, that the field within which economies can be effected is narrow. Little reduction can be expected in statutory and fixed expenditure, salaries and wages fixed by law and other irrevocable commitments. economies can be made is approximately £12,000,000 out of a total expenditure of about £102,000,000. Nevertheless reductions have been effected of the votes of departments amounting to £1,617,000. T Statement. 1855 Revenue. The war situation has affected the esti.. 13,780,000 mates of revenue also.

Taxation. . CONCLUSION. I have sought to place before honourable members in general outline the financial plans which the Government has in mind to meet the problems of war. Necessarily they must be sufficiently elastic to adjust themselves to such conditionsi n which we may find ourselves. The burden which has been imposed upon the country by our present commitments w ill increase, not decrease. The duty of "" the Government is to so distribute it that it w ill cause the least disturbance to our economy. It would be foolish, as I have been at pains to point out, to delude ourselves into the belief that there is any easy way of. bearing this burden, It would be equally foolish to believe that this war w ill not entail substantial sacrifices for every section of the community. The financial task which confronts the Government is one which, if discharged in accordance with the plans which I have outlined, w ill , it is believed, ensure that the nation may, when this conflict is over, confidently face with a sound economy.and financial system the EXI:ENDITUH E 1939-40. possibly greater tasks which peace itself will present. ""We must build now and for the future. The path ahead is arduous and beset with difficulties. No one can predict the course the war w ill take, or the toll it w ill finally exact. We are in this war against our w ill ; Ave are determined to Of this see it through to the finish. No matter what the sacrifices that may be entailed, so long as we preserve-as we will-the liberty of this country, they w ill be insignificant' indeed compared with the disaster which will result -if victory is works charges amounting to not ours. -I am confident that the people of Australia, Avho have never yet failed to face their difficulties Avith courage, Avill be prepared without demur to give their earnest support to the Government in from the tremendous task which lies ahead.

Progress reported. Debate resumed from the 16th November (vide page 1174) on motion hy Mr of vital importance, feeling secure in the That the paper be printed. During the last fortnight, the House has been regaled with a series of ministerial statements outlining, with all the disorderly design of a patchwork quilt, the war activities of the Government. One would have thought that the legal training of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) would have dictated to him the advantages of having all his witnesses of governmental activity tell a story of governtrovert what has been done, believing, as mental planning that would, at least, hang together. One might even expect now that the right honourable gentleman has created himself the General ""PooB a h "" of the Government, under the impressive title of Minister for Defence Co-ordination, that it would have been a distinct advanMinister for the Army( Mr Street) on tage to the House and to the country had he made the whole procedure a solo effort instead of using the services of all of the ances and the present policy of the GoCabinet"" inner group "" to present a picture of their lack of direction and muddling incapacity. The Standing Orders do not permit of a close analysis en bloc of all of the ministerial statements, but those that have been so far discussed, and the one now under consideration, have shown, and will show, the grave dissatisfaction that exists, not only in this House, but also throughout the country, at the efforts so far made by the Government in the matters of defence, the trading of primary products, and the lack of protection afforded to the great bulk of the people, producers and consumers alike, against wartime exploitation. Recently the Prime Minister assured the House that he did not desire a muzzled Opposition, but the fact is that, in making most of its fundamental decisions, the Goveimment has effectively muzzled the whole Parliament. In defence, as in all other governmental activities, the Gospeculation as to what was the ultimate vernment has set up boards and advisory committees whose recommendations are virtually translated into government decisions, the most important of which are made while Parliament is in recess. Thus, not only are irresponsible bodies practically governing the country, but also the Government is studiously avoiding parliamentary discussion on matters power to make regulations .under the National Security Act. What has been the spectacle of the past fortnight? A minority Government, usurping the powers of Parliament, has presented ministerial statements of what it has accomplished, or has sought to accomplish, with a flamboyant air of "" take it or leave it "" . It has strained theloyalty of its' own supporters, trusted to the vacillation of the Country party, and challenged the Labour party to conrecent events have given it reason to believe, that there is a more or less pliant majority in the House that will assist it in evading a vote on a vital issue. So we pass to the statement by the the wartime activities of the fighting services, wherein he outlined past performvernment-a t least, one should say, the policy as it was at 3.30 p.m. on the 17th November, 1939. What it is to-day no man knows and few, apparently, care. In these days of kaleidoscopic changes of policy and reshuffles of portfolios and Cabinet personnel, he would be a bold prophet who could venture a stable opinion. . Whether these changes bespeak disclosed incompetence, or whether the situation at home and abroad has created a Tower of Babel in the Cabinet-room, only the Prime Minister can say, and he, to say the least, is not communicative. The Minister for the Army has given an extensive review of the defence forces and the proposals to extend the various arms of the Service, but has been strangely silent on the many changes of-policy in -recent months. The decision of the Government to raise a 6th Division, to be known as the 2nd Australian Imperial Force, for service at home or abroad, caused considerable objective of the Government. The Government has pondered long, but, apparently, not very deeply, on flhe wisdom of sending the 2nd Australian Imperial",35,Import Duties
115,Mr Rosevear (Dalley) [4.25],"Force abroad. Various Ministers have, from time to time, indicated that the expressed desire of the British Government was that Ave in Australia should concentrate on the defence of Australia. That view is completely shared by the -Labour party. The continued uncertainty of the international situation, the doubt as to Avhether the Rome-BerlinTokyo axis is still an active factor in world politics or is defunct, and the isolated position of Australia from any conceivable assistance in the event of invasion, have all been continued sources of speculation among thinking people when considering the Avisdom of sending men abroad. Now the die has been cast. The Prime Minister has announced the Government's decision to despatch a division, abroad. The House has debated the proposal at length, and I do not propose to deal Avith the matter, other than to express my pleasure that the Labour party has set out clearly its objection to the course to be taken. I contrast the Labour party's attitude with that of the Government, which has said, in effect, through its leader, that the only reason for the despatch of this force is a desire to offset German propaganda. 20,000 men to be despatched will certainly not be the last to go. History will repeat itself. Tens of thousands Avill be marched to the slaughter in Europe and the safety of Australia will be jeopardized as a counterblast to German propaganda -a t the Avill of this vacillating and inept Government,, which has, itself, Avarned tbe people against "" falling for "" the very same propaganda. It is the fervent hope of the Opposition that its Avorst fears Avill not be realized. The Minister, in his statement, dealt extensively with army organization, camp Avorks and supply of materials and equipment. Questions about supplies, equipment and the general comfort of the men visited the Militi a camp at Warwick Farm haAe been directed from all sides of the yesterday, he made careful inquiries into rer House to the Minister, but have usually ports that men were inadequately supplied with produced the reply that all is well. No blankets doubt, his reports have been based on informed the Lord Mayor (Alderman Nock) reports of departmental officers. But the that he wished to .become patron of an immefact is that the picture of efficiency that diate appeal for 500 pairs of blankets for he has, from time to time, presented has men in camps. been a trifle overdone. The clothing of Is it not a tragic commentary on a dethe troops in at least one camp was of partment that, this year is spending poor material, shabby and ill-fitting, and £59,500,000, that the Lord Mayor of the eating .utensils were a standing disgrace. There Avas a rifle to every fourmen. ber substitute that statement-that four men have to share one rifle? bers Avho have visited the camp can do so, and I can assure the Minister that it is true. An interesting picture of theefficiency and equipment of the defence forces is presented in an editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald to-day. It is statedThe final training of the uth Division could not be provided in Australia for some time; certain armament for the modern division is not yet locally available, and Avith the adoption of the new training manual, it was clearly important to lutve the benefit of a training base where the necessary weapons could be provided without delay. In plain language, instruction of an Australian division for modern warfare could not have been completed in this country at present. If this is a statement of fact, then it is obvious that the Australian, forces are not only deficient in equipment, but also deficient in training for modern Avarfare. The It would appear that, despite the muchvaunted efficiency of the Defence Department, Australia is maintaining a force that can only secure the requisite knoAYledge and equipment outside Australia. At the same time, it constitutes an effective reply to those Avho claim that Ave must have conscription in order to teach our men hOAV to defend Australia in Australia. The Sydney Morning Herald could have gone further and said that not only is our equipment defective, but also the supply of it has not kept pace with enlistments for the Militia Forces and the other units of our Defence Forces.

The same article statesFurther reports from camps at Warwick Farm, Rutherford mid other place indicating that sickness is increasing because of an insutliciency of warm clothing and blankets led the . Lord Mayor to take further action. During the day, he sent a. telegram to the Minister for Defence( Mr Street) asking if the military authorities proposed to increase the issue of personal equipment to the M i l it i a . The telegram followed an urgent request from the Maitland committee asking from the Lord Mayor's patriotic fund an issiie of 200 sets of shirts, socks, singlets, underpants and other articles for men in tlie Rutherford camp who were suffering intensely from the cold. To use the vernacular, the Defence Department has put the Army on the "" bum "". Sickness and disease in the Army are such as to warrant the greatest consideration. records of the last war, 5,379 out of a total of 60,000 Australian deaths were due to sickness and disease. Of the 698,706 deaths in the British and Dominion expeditionary forces, no fewer than 113,173, one in every six, were due to disease and injury other than war injury. Those figures disclose the importance of careful supervision of camp hygiene, -proper food and clothing. To-day, we are given the belated information in the press that the issue of complete uniforms to the 2nd Australian Imperial Force is to be made, and I quote a report published in to-day's issue of the Daily News, which saysOfficials at Victoria. Barracks said yesterday that the issue of complete uniforms to members of the 2nd Australian Imperial Force at Tngleburu. camp would be completed within a short time. Uniforms were issued yesterday to many of the 6.000 soldiers in tlie camp but a number were still without sufficient clothing. They are unable to provide themselves with extra apparel because of meagre pay. thousand .pairs of soeks have been sent to the camp by the Lord Mayor's appeal fund and more will follow shortly. It has been revealed that some time ago officers refused to accept uniforms for the men which consisted of tunics aud breeches of a different shade of khaki. Before concluding my remarks on this point, I desire to stress, in the interests of the men, the importance of instituting more effective drainage and sanitary systems. It is beside the point for the Mr Rosevear. Minister to dismiss the subject with the cursory statement that these matters are up to the usual standard. The figures that' I have already quoted indicate the importance of vastly improving the camp conditions that operated in the last war. The camps are in close proximity to settled areas and the danger of epidemic is always present, menacing the health not only of the troops, but also of the civil population. The next point of outstanding importance in the Minister's statement is the announcement regarding the re-introduction of compulsory military training. This change of policy, like all vital changes by this Government, was effected while Parliament was in recess and no opportunity was available for discussion. The Labour party makes clear its opposition to the compulsory training system and, if I did not know politics as well as According to official I do, I should expect considerable support from the -Government benches. During the last election campaign, Government supporters frantically denied the charge levelled at them that the Government would introduce conscription. From their leader down, they pledged themselves to oppose conscription. There can be no doubt of that. That they are selling out on the people, as many of their predecessors have done, there can he still less doubt, if that be possible. I have no doubt that many of them will shelter behind the plausible excuse that universal military training is not conscription. It is the difference between "" tweedledum "" and "" tweedledee"" and the distinction matters as much to the young men concerned as it matters to a chicken whether it is to be boiled or baked. Boiled or baked, the chicken loses its head in the process. Subjected to universal military training or conscription, the person conOne cerned loses that sacred right that was so dear .to the Prime Minister himself in the last war-the right to determine whether his duty or obligation to serve was greater than his personal or family duties and obligations. Tlie right and the privilege that the Prime Minister reserved for himself are now denied by him to others. How >a man holding such views can lead a conscriptionist government passes all human understanding. Repugnant as is the principle of conscription in a democratic community, it becomes even more so when we know that the Government intends to bring about a form of discriminatory conscription made possible by the use of information contained in the National Register. This decision confirms the fears expressed by the Labour party when, in speaking to the National Registration Bill, the present Minister for the Army saidThe National Register, however, will provide write asking for exemption from service. means by which the allocation of appropriate classified personnel can be made to meet the requirements of defence forces and of the community in general. A list of reserved occupations is being compiled and will be published for information. Men trained in these particular occupations are limited in number and there would naturally be great demand for them in time of war. Individuals whose names and occupations appear on this list would be precluded from serving with the forces in an emergency. The result of the application of these principles will be the setting up of a privileged class from which service will not be demanded, whereas the forgotten legion of youth, the unemployed young men to whom society denies the right to work and lead a decent life, will have the obligation to serve thrust upon them. On the 7th June, 1939, the Minister for the Army saidMany honourable members opposite have urged that this bill is the forerunner of the introduction of compulsory training and some have gone so far as to assert that it is the prelude to conscription for military service overseas . . . In regard to compulsory training for home service, it is a well-known fact that the Government is providing for the peace Organization of the Army that is necessary for Australia's defence. strength of the Militia Forces, as a result of the recent recruiting campaign, already exceeds date for the Government's action. What the figure that has been recommended. The Minister then went on to boast about the success of the campaign and the fact that the Defence Department was able to turn away potential recruits. In his speech last week, he indicated that the Government's aim was to maintain the Militia at a war-strength of 75,000. In other words, the wartime strength was to be exactly the same as the peacetime strength. 75,000"". great deal of difference between "" 75,000 "" [26] and "" not less than 75,000 "". That indicated to me that the Minister's aim was to have a war establishment of the Militia Eorces of the same strength as the peace establishment. On his own showing, the recruits offering up to June last exceeded the 75,000 required. ""What has happened, in the meantime, to justify the belief that those numbers cannot be maintained without compulsion? cerned with what most of the members do. I am concerned about the disparity between the Minister's first statement and his second statement. I am endeavouring to find some justification for the Govern-, menfs change of policy from voluntary enlistment to compulsion. Is enthusiasm for enlistment lagging as the result of the miserable treatment proposed to be meted out to militiamen after the 1st January? Or does the Government, by compulsory measures designed to call up single men, seek to cheapen the cost? Tho decision of the Government to reduce the Militia pay from 8s. a day to 5s. a day has been described by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) as a breach of contract. It could be called something far worse than that without adequately stating the case. The Minister's defence that -the Government's action is technically correct begs the question'. Is it to be assumed that the average raw recruit in future must take with him a legal adviser to peruse thoroughly the regulations and master the technicalities In fact, the before signing up? The Prime Minister claims that his Government has a manmandatory right have the voters of the Commonwealth to authorize the conscription of the non-voters who will be affected? The Labour party is opposed to this action by the Government and it challenges this interpretation of the Government's mandate. We believe that Australians will not be lacking in their desire to defend Australia, and we insist that military service is a question to be determined by the individual conscience of the manhood of Australia.

But this scheme has been abandoned now in favour of an Empire scheme, the exact details of which are still in the clouds. The Labour party believes that the Air Force would be the main line of defence in the event of invasion, from the point of view not only of the developments of modern warfare, but also of the vast area of the continent to be defended and the extent of our financial resources. In addition to our opposition to military expeditions abroad, we say that the sending overseas of the flower of our aerial defenders would be a national calamity of the greatest magnitude. Reference is made, in the Minister's of statement to the defence works being carquatelythe public and the workers are aderied out in the Commonwealth. The defence work Labour party welcomes the statement that the Government 87 per cent, of defence requirements of beneficial influence the Government will be produced in Austries, both during, and tralia; but we are by no means satisfied that the interests of the taxpayers and the conflict. workers in war industries are being adequately safeguarded.

The continued failure of the Government to provide adequate safeguards against sub-contractors committing breaches of industrial awards is causing grave concern in trade union circles. If the Government genuinely desires the cooperation of trade unions in carrying out its defence programme, the best evidence of its sincerity will be immediate action to place the same restraint on sub-contractors as is already provided in respect contractors. Provided that the interests of safeguarded the carrying out of to the degree estimated by cannot fail to have a on Australian indusafter, the present The possibilities of new Australian inThe Prime Minister, in his statement, talk will not get the Government far; action is needed. The only things of which the Government seems capable are inaction and reaction. According to the statement issued on the 1st November by the Prime Minister, "" up to the present the estimate of Australia's £59,500,000. This represents an increase of £26,250,000 on the pre-war estimate of the cost of the defence programme for the current financial year"". I direct attention to the fact that, despite this enormous expenditure on defence works, unemployment is increasing in every State. This is undoubtedly due to the tremendous drain on capital available for investment, caused by the Government'3 decision to finance the whole of the defence requirements by loan and taxation in what has been so often described as "" sane, orthodox methods of finance "". It is a maxim of unchallengeable accuracy that more cannot be taken from a pint pot than is put into it. From the economic results achieved to date, it is also abundantly clear that orthodox methods of finance have failed, and that from the employment aspect, what Australia has gained on the roundabouts it has lost on the swing-boats. It is an accepted fact that in taxation matters, particularly in the taxation of wealth that is active'in production and industry as against capital that is idle and yet is gathering unearned increment, there is a point of absorption beyond which it. is disastrous to proceed. There is a point at which it begins to stifle investment and destroy employment. It is equally true that a policy of borrowing extensively at high rates of interest, whilst it has its hectic and seductive inducements during the pleasant process of spending, inevitably brings in its trail the day of reckoning. The easy course of leaving the debt that results from the folly of this generation for posterity to pay has lost much of the effectiveness that it had in generations past. The close co-operation and the co-ordinated efforts of the institutions of privately-owned and controlled finance to-day determine, at their sweet will, when and how "" the piper must be paid "". In quite recent years we have had abundant evidence of that fact. The question ia whether this Government has learned the lessons of the immediate past, or intends to follow the natural tory instinct of the Bourbons of France. We find no evidence in the statement of the Minister for the Army that he has changed the views which he expressed during the debate on the National Rewar expenditure totals gistration Bill, that he was entirely in favour of financing this war as the last war was financed, by the good old orthodox methods. I remind him that this war is not an orthodox war. To date, the experts agree that its conduct has been entirely unorthodox, and that the estimated expenditure will be such that the cost of the last war will pale into insignificance. This Government has at its disposal a national bank. The wealth producing capacity of the Commonwealth is unlimited. It is claimed that the very life of the community is at stake. Why, then, continue the futility of the community borrowing from private and privileged financial institutions, pawning the present and future welfare of this and future generations to institutions whose only genuine backing is the wealth producing capacity of the community? If the community is to struggle for its life, why should that life be prolonged only for an existence shackled in the chains of Mammon? The evidence before us is that, to date, the Government's policy of war finance is destroying the very fountain from which employment springs. Economically, Australia is tobogganing to disaster. It has a bank; it has a country rich in natural resources. Let it use the bank and the credit resources of the nation in the interests of the nation. Labour does not view with pleasure this enormous expenditure on defence, but as an outward manifestation of the stupidity of present-day civilization. Labour has a deep-seated urge of peace and goodwill to all men, but Labour realizes that these world conflicts happen despite our efforts, not because of them. We realize that while we live in a world that, is an armed camp, we ourselves must go armed. [Leave to continue given.] For that reason our policy dictates, and our pledges to the people of Australia demand, that we support all proper efforts to defend Australia adequately against aggression. We believe that that is our paramount 'obligation in the world circumstances that face us. We believe that our obligations, in conformity with our declared policy to help to maintain the integrity of the British Commonwealth of Nations, can best be fulfilled by providing for the dehad been made with Great Britain; in fence of a self-reliant Australia, by defending Australia within Australia. ""We, therefore, express our complete opposition to the despatch of Australia's man-power overseas; we believe that those who serve iii the defence forces of the Commonwealth should be paid an adequate remuneration and we oppose the conscription of Australia's manhood for service. The condition of military preparedness of Australia and the lack of enthusiasm that has been shown in regard to the expeditionary force, as is evidenced by the failure to get the 20,000 men desired to make up that force in the time originally set, is in sharp contrast with the forward stage of the economic preparations, and especially the industrial progress in connection with the manufacture of munitions. The lack of military preparedness can, I think, he shown to be due to the fact that there has been a reversal of the decision of previous governments and, in addition, several reversals of its own deoisions by the present Government. Insofar as our economic preparation is concerned, it can be said that we have been getting ready ever since the Imperial Conference of 1937. In 1938, I discussed this matter with. . Sir Henry French, the ControllerGeneral for Food in Great Britain, personally. In February of this year, I appointed the various committees to deal with certain commodities, and sent Mr Lynch to London as the representative of the Australian Government to make the necessary arrangements for the final purchase of our commodities should war break out. All of the wheels of this organization were not merely placed in position; they were also oiled. All that was necessary in the event of war was to fix the price of the goods that were sold. On the industrial side, extraordinary proprotection of localities whose defence was of gress was made before the declaration'of war by the previous government. Industrial panels were arranged for, and provision was made for the building of defence annexes, whilst the aircraft industry had been established and was producing aircraft before the Government of which I was a member went out of office. Moreover, partnership arrangements in respect of aircraft construction fact, a Controller^General had been appointed for this undertaking while arrangements made for Australia to become the arsenal of the southern hemiisphere for practically all British requirements. Insofar as the economic side and industrial side of things is concerned, this Government has carried on operations from the position that had been reached by the previous Government. .Without question, extraordinary progress has been made by reason of the uninterrupted march of that programme. But, insofar as the military side of things is concerned, that is, the getting ready of the man-power of this country to defend Australia, there has, unfortunately, been a change of policy which has been largely responsible for the chaos that has occurred. I acquit the present Minister for the Army( Mr Street) of responsibility in this connection. I am quite satisfied 1hat he has tried very strenuously to secure continuity of policy in this regard. I am fortified in that belief by my knowledge that the honourable gentleman-did his best while he was Minister for Defence in. the Lyons Government, to give effect to the recommendation^ made by Lieu'tenant-General Squires, who was brought to Australia last year as Inspector-General of our Military Forces to endeavour to bring our methods of preparation for war into lino with those that have been successfully adopted in Great Britain. The Minister, while still a member of the Lyons Government, made a statement on this subject on the 14th March last, in the course of which he saidThe Inspector-General recommended the formation of field units, other than those now permitted under the Defence Act, as part of the Permanent M i l it a r y Forces. Such units would be immediately available at all times, and would provide a means of securing the tlie first importance from the commencement of hostilities, thus affording greater security against minor aggression. Later they could, as the situation demanded, be employed either as reserves of highly-trained troops available for the reinforcement of any areas in which reinforcement was needed: or be distributed, as a "" stiffening"" element, among M i l it i a formations.",40,Street
122,Sir Earle Page (Cowper) [5.2],"Apart from the value of such units in war, they would have a very definite value' in peace, in that they would assist the training of the Militia, during both continuous and homo training, by lending instructors, providing demonstrations, and by setting a standard, and would thus help to raise the all-round efficiency of the Commonwealth Forces. They would also furnish a new and much-needed source of supply of permanent instructors for the Militia, and afford the officers of the Staff which was due, not to ineffective military Corps more opportunities for gaining experience in the command of troops than they can have at present. The Inspector-General recommended that the raising of field units as part of the Permanent Forces be accepted as part of the Government's policy for placing the Australian Military Forces on a sound basis, and rendering them more capable of dealing with any emergency, and that the first units be formed within the next two years. As the result of the honourable gentleman's advocacy, the Lyons Government agreed to the policy that he outlined, and went ahead with the proposal to prepare two battalions. That decision wa3 made on the day after the present Prime Minister' resigned from , the Lyons Government. Unfortunately, after the right honourable gentleman became Prime Minister, the policy was reversed. This occurred in late May or early June of this year. The reversal was brought about, not because it was felt that there was any lack of wisdom . in the recommendations of Lieutenant-General Squires, but entirely because of the outlook of the Prime Minister, who really gambled on there being no war. I am strengthened in that opinion by reason of a speech which he delivered on the 18th August at Hurstville, New South Wales, which was dealt with in a leading article in the Sydney Morning Herald of-the 19th August under the heading "" The European Crisis and Australia"". The writer dealt with the history of negotiations between various countries and also with the speech made by Lord Halifax, who was quoted as follows:Indeed, it may well be that the next few weeks or months may prove critical. The article went on to sayIn contrast to the Foreign Secretary's four different statements have been made measured words, Mr Menzies struck an inin regard to child allowance. congruous note in his speech at Hurstville on Thursday. "" Let us "", he said, "" give up talking about the inevitability of war. Let us be optimistic and talk about peace and happiness "". Commenting on those sentiments of the Prime Minister, the article saidThe Prime Minister surely does a disservice to this country when he indulges in loose "" sunshine"" talk at such a time as this. Nobody iu Australia knows better than he how critical is tlie situation in Europe. As the result of that initial mistake advice tendered to the Government, but entirely to the bad judgment and unfortunate outlook of the Prime Minister, there has been extreme difficulty in getting Australia's war effort properly moving. Innumerable false starts have been made. Jobs have been put in hand which have been discontinued, or only partly completed. I need to refer, by way of illustration to only one instance. When the Prime Minister, on the 16th or 17th September, suggested the possibility of an Australian expeditionary force in a broadcast address, he said.that if such were provided the pay of the troops would be on much the same basis as that of the previous Australian Imperial Eorce. He also added that conditions in regard to dependants would be similar. The arrangements in this regard in respect of the 1st Australian Imperial Eorce were 2s. for wives and 4^d. for each child. Since the Prime Minister made his broadcast statement a series of alterations has occurred. The child allowance has been increased, by successive steps, to 6d., 9d. and Is., at which figure it now stands. I am hopeful that, before this debate coneludes, the Minister for the Army will be able to announce that the allowance will be Is. 6d. for each child. I shall state good reasons for providing this additional amount. The allowance for wives was increased from 2s. to 2s. 6d. and later it was lifted to 3s., at which it now stands. 2s. 6d. for wives and 9d. for children. challenges the accuracy of my statement, I shall, during the course of the debate, produce newspaper extracts to show that were 9d. for each ehild and 2s. 6d. for wives.",43,Street

125,Mr Street,"The figures originallysary, produce the newspaper extracts to which I have referred and ask that they be incorporated in Hansard. The attitude which the Prime Minister has adopted has undoubtedly caused a reduction of enthusiasm in recruiting. Within the first week of the declaration of war the feeling of the people of Australia was such as to have ensured, in my opinion, the enlistment of 250,000 men, who would have been prepared to fight so long as they were told definitely and clearly what they were to fight for, and how they would fight. that yet. that three months after the declaration of war we are facing the tragic spectacle of the dominion which, in 1914, led the rest of the Empire in its preparations for war, coming on this occasion a bad last. I cannot understand the attitude of the Opposition in regard to the proposed expeditionary force. We have to face the fact that many weeks ago it was stated clearly and definitely that the Governments of Canada and New Zealand each intended to send an expeditionary force overseas to serve in the western theatre of the war, while it was only yesterday that Australia made its decision known in this respect. It is rather interesting to read the., comments of the press in regard to our war preparations over the period of the last two or three months. I direct atteny tion first to the following statement that was published on the 14th September in the Melbourne Herald in regard to camps and training:The immediate anxiety is that the Government is lagging behind the people in determination of the part that Australia should immediately prepare itself to play. is growing a great restlessness because of delay in the mobilization of Australia's manpower. On the 15th November the same newspaper discussed in a leading article "" Why the new Australian Imperial Force is short of men"". It statedThe Government made confused statements which left every one in doubt as to the relative purpose and importance of the M i l it i a and of I trust that the Government will not the special force. The man who was prepared to make every sacrifice to fight for Australia was at a loss to know where his duty lay. shall, if necesI n the absence of any statement of the future of the special force it was no wonder if men have hesitated to give a l l their time to soldiering if no more was to be required of them than they could give by m i l it i a service. A t one time a plan was suggested by which the M i l it i a could be made the training ground of the special force, but it was rejected by the Government, which appeared to take the view that the training of the special force was something apart from Australia's measures for its own defence, and must therefore be made secondary to militia preparations. The result of that attitude is clearly seen in the fact that, whereas at one time it was confidently anticipated that 60 per cent, of militiamen would volunteer' for the new Australian I m perial Force, it is in the militia quota that enlistments have fallen short. Soi t is clear that not only in the period immediately preceding the declaration of war, but also in the months that have since elapsed, a definite lack of enthusiasm has been noticeable in a country which at heart is absolutely and solidly with the Empire. This lack of enthusiasm, and of failure to stir the hearts of the people, is due to ineffective leadership on the part of the Prime Minister. I shall take a second illustration to demonstrate my point. Every one remembers how eagerly the people received the announcement of the Government many weeks ago that an air expeditionary force would be equipped and despatched overseas. I think that almost every honourable member of this House approved of that decision. It was intended, we were told, to enlist 5,000 men. But what do we find? The enthusiasm evaporated when it was found that the men were not to be prepared for immediate service, and that it might be a long time before any of them would be sent abroad to participate in the titanic struggle that is proceeding. The original 5,000 has dwindled to a mere 166 men. The remainder of those who enlisted are There to remain in Australia indefinitely. In all of these circumstances I sincerely trust that there will be no false step on the part of the Government in respect of the proposal to send 20,000 men abroad in the 2nd Australian Imperial Force. Even since the announcement was made last night that this would be done, the enthusiasm of the people has increased. allow this eagerness to be again dissipated.",44,Street
126,Sir Earle Page,I,45,Street
127,Mr Holloway,No one can tell them,45,Street
128,Sir Earle Page,"It is regrettableA comparison of the position of Australia three months after war was declared in 1914 with its position to-day, will show how ineffective the Government's activities have been. In 1914 we were not expecting war, but I suppose that every honourable member of the House has felt for the last four or five years, that he has been living under the constant threat and shadow of war. The fact that 70,000 militiamen were enlisted was due entirely to the previous government and not to this Government. The 1914 war broke out on the 4th August. On the 7 th August our men were beginning to go into camp. On the 17th August our first expeditionary force had started for Eabaul. In October we had a contingent actually on the. sea. On this occasion, in about the same length of time, our men are just beginning to go into camp. The whole trouble at present is that our men do not know where they stand. No one knows what the position is. I have a boy in the Militia who does not know what to do because he cannot get any definite information from the Government. The time has surely come for the Government to gather up the scattered threads of its preparatory work and give a definite lead to the Australian people. It is high time that we were emulating the deeds of 1914. Not only should there be proper coordination, but we should also ensure that, when the men go into camp, they are treated properly. ""When we gather 5,000, 10,000 or 20,000 men into a camp, it is important that measures be taken to ensure that a high standard of health is maintained. Money must be spent on preliminary preparations. It is useless to wait until an epidemic breaks out. It is then too late to recover lost lives. Nothing disorganizes a force so much as sickness, as was demonstrated during 1914, 1915 and 1916, when meningitis broke out amongst the troops in the military camps. The danger of such epidemics can be minimized by the installation of proper systems of hygiene, at least as good as exist in towns with the same populations. For years past, the Government has been voting money to enable towns with populations of 2,000 and upwards to install sewerage systems. The first essential for tihe preservation of the steel. Whether the men have enlisted for health of the troops is the sewering of the camps. ""When I went to Ingleburn camp, and advocated the installation of a sewerage system, I was told that I was talking out of my turn. Now, I am glad to hear the Minister say that this work is to be undertaken. It will be found that the expense of installing a sewerage system, either by linking up with a near-by drainage system or hy septic tanks, will be more than repaid by saving the cost of disposing of the night-soil in other ways, and by a reduced incidence of sickness caused by the contamination of food. I understand that the preparation of the camp is to cost £192,000. Eveni f it were to cost another £10,000-and I do not think it would, because there would be countervailing economies-w e should not hesitate to spend the money so as to bring tihe hygienic faoilities up to those of towns of similar size. The cost should not be so very great, because there would be a clean slate to work on, and it should be cheaper to sewer a military camp, where the huts are close together, fjhan a town, where the dwellings are more widely separated. 0 done at the earliest possible moment, not only at Ingleburn, but at all of the camps. of the camps as soon as possible. a good sewerage system in the nearest town, the camp should be connected with it at a cost of a few hundred pounds. It is important that due consideration be given to the matter of soldiers' pay, and particularly to allowances for wives and children. I do not believe that it is good economy to try to run this war as cheaply as possible as far as our soldiers are concerned. At any rate, our savings should not be at the expense of our defenders or their dependants. The Government has no compunction about paying the full price for the materials of war, and neither should it have any compunction about paying the full price for the human element that must take part in the war. Surely it is just as proper that we should pay the full price for the warm human flesh that has to participate in a war as for cold, inhuman home service or service abroad makes",45,Street

These men are allowed to enlist only because they are the physical pick of Australia. To-day, reference was made in this House to the fact that hundreds of trainees who had passed the first medical examination, had been rejected at the Becond. The men who have enlisted for overseas service are also the spiritual pick not done then, the reward of the whole of Australia, because they have offered their lives for the defence of their country. We cannot afford a cheap defence scheme at their expense. The country can afford to pay them properly, and we should see that it is done. Other countries have recognized that conditions now are very different from those of 1914. The rate of pay for soldiers in New Zealand during the last war was 4s. a day; now it is 7s. The rates, with deferred pay added, were 5s. a day in 1914, and are 8s. a day now. Although the rate of pay for soldiers in Great Britain is very low compared with here, the fact remains that, even in England, the rate has been increased by 50 per cent, as compared with the last war. When we realize that in Australia the basic wage has increased from £2 14s. a week in 1914 to over £4 a week now, we realize that the men who will fight for us are entitled to a higher rate of pay than was given in 1914. I do not approve of the action of the Government in reducing the pay of militiamen from 8s. to 5s. a day. They were encouraged by the Government to enlist on the promise, which was endorsed by several Ministers, that ithey would receive 8s. a day. Now, they find that they are committed, for the duration of the war, to serve for 5s. a day. That seems to me very like a breach of contract, no matter what the technical or legal position may be. Those of us who took part in the recruiting meetings never believed for a moment that militiamen who offered themselves for training in peace time, while others were free to amuse Sir Earle Page. themselves, would have their pay reduced Consideration from 8s. a day to 5s. This is especially unfair in view of the fact that the men are required to go into camp, not for twelve or sixteen days as originally proposed, but for as long Allowances as three monthsat a time. Men from the land thought at first that they would be able to get their neighbours to look after their places for a fortnight or so, but now, when they have to go into camp for three months, they find that they have to employ substitutes. Many of them will be going into camp in the autumn, just when the great bulk of the farm work must be done. If it is year's work will be lost. As I have said, it is important to encourage the marriage of trainees by making proper allowance for wives and children. As the result of constant pressure, the allowance has been raised from 2s. a day, to 2s. 6d. and lately to 3s. for wives, while the allowance for children has been raised from 6d. to 9d., and then to Is. We should not be satisfied until we make the allowances at least as generous as those in New Zealand, where wives receive 3s. a day, or one guinea a week, and 10s. 6d. a week is paid for each child, which represents Is. 6d. a day. In New Zealand, a man with a wife and two children will receive £2 2s. a week, in addition to his ordinary pay. That is not unreasonable. In Great Britain, the family allowance is 17s. for a wife, and 22s. for a wife and child. That, however, is in sterling, which represents 21s. 3d. in Australian money for a wife, and 27s. 6d. for a wife and one child, which is almost as much as is given here. were along those lines. proposal was that if men were prepared to go into camp to receive at one. time the military training which would ordinarily be spread over three years, they were to receive a special bonus. The country would gain rather than lose by making the family allowances more generous. If there is one thing we need in Australia it is increased population, and the best population we can have are the children of soldiers. What better memorial could there be to a soldier who",46,Street

It is a far better memorial than the expensive monuments of brick or stone which have been erected all over the country. It is desirable to deal frankly with these matters. Whereever there are large bodies of young men gathered together, well fed, and in good physical condition, something will go wrong if they have not some natural outlet. Therefore, we should encourage these men to marry in Australia, and we should make that possible by providing adequate allowances. In that way wo would reduce the incidence of venereal disease which has always wrought such tremendous havoc in every army.

Irrespective of what has happened before, it is necessary that what happens now should be right, and the right time to deal with this matter is the present. ""matter now. I suggest that the allowance for a child should be 10s. 6d. a week, which is only 6d. a week more than the endowment paid to widows by the Child Welfare Department in New South Wales. . Surely that is not asking too much. If I had any doubt with regard to this matter, it would have been completely removed to-day by the financial statement made by the Acting Treasurer ( Mr civil life. Spender). [Leave to continue given.] To-day, announced that a large part of the expenditure' incurred in connection with Australia's war effort would have to be met out of loan moneys. That means that when the soldiers come back they, and ultimately their children, will have to bear their full share of the repayment of those loans. Surely, then, it is reasonable that the Government should exercise some generosity in connection with this matter. Another point to which I should like to refer in regard to this matter is that the inadequacy of the soldiers' pay has been recognized by the Government; because it has stated that, in respect of its own servants, it will make up the difference between their Militia pay and their Public Service pay for the first sixrevert to their Militia pay. The very fact that there is this difference shows that the Government recognizes, to some degree at any rate, the inadequacy of the Militia pay. It was suggested, I think by the Attorney-General( Mr Hughes), that private business men should do likewise, and some business undertakings have even already agreed to make up the difference between the expeditionary force pay and the civil pay of their employees who have enlisted. A moment's thought will show that that cannot possibly be done generally. From 60 per cent, to 80 per cent, of the employees of one firm may enlist in the 2nd Australian Imperial Force and not a single employee of another firm may join the army. In this way discrimination would arise. The These responsibility in connection with this matter should be borne, not by individual employers, but by the general taxpayer. Unless that is done, all sorts of anomalies and difficulties will arise. This is a national question, arid because of that it seems to me that the military pay Consequently, I raise this should have some reasonable relation to the earnings of an average man in civil 1 life. I recognize, of course, that in serving their country some men make great sacrifices and that no provision can be made adequately to recompense them. Theirs is a special class of case; but at the same time. I believe that the military pay should be fixed at a rate comparable to what is earned by the average man in There is another phase of this matter the honourable gentleman which will have its effect on recruiting.",47,Street

From all these viewpoints, I urge that the Government should recognize the justice of the claims of those who are prepared to serve their country, and at the right time, I am prepared to do something in connection with it. statement of the Minister for the Army( Mr Street) has much in it with which we agree, but to claim that the Commonwealth war measures have functioned in a way that entirely justifies the care and forethought put into the preparation is something which, to say the least, is rather overstating what has happened. It is unfortunately trueand I do .not intend to labour this-that the Government has not adopted a forthright policy; on the contrary, there has been a great deal of change and delay. In the first place, we had a very definite statement that there would he no compulsory military training; then we had a pronouncement regarding the rates of pay to be paid to the force enlisted for overseas service; then there was a change in regard to that followed by delay in offering a division for overseas service; then we had a tardy decision about its really departing from Australia; all of these are matters which I brought up on many occasions and in . respect of which I incurred a good deal of unpopularity because one is frequently looked upon as a critic if one offers suggestions. There is no doubt as to the unfortunate position of the Militia. say very clearly to honourable members that the Government is in a difficulty about the Militia. It must be aware that what the Militia is expected to do now is vastly different from the original proposal of a camp of from six to twelve days' duration with pay at the rate of 8s. a day. Now, the Militia is to undergo a month's training in camp, to be followed by a further three months' camp, the pay for the latter period being at the rate of 5s. a day. I know that, since the first decision was made, war has broken out, and with the outbreak of war matters are entirely different; but the men to be called up for training are definitely covered in Part4 of the Defence Act. Although under Sections 59 and 60 of that Act, the Government may call up men between the age of 18 and 60 years for service in Australia, it has very tardily given notice of the calling up of one quota in January to make up certain deficiencies. To-day I asked the Minister for the ArmyTo approximately what numerical strength has the Militia been reduced as the result of enlistment of members in the 2nd Australian Imperial Force, transfers to the Militia Reserve, or discharges as the result of the specification of reserved occupations, unfitness or hardship t The reply wasBetween 55,000 and 65,000 at a guess. guessi misrepresent the Minister. I think that it was a liberal estimate. Dealing with transfers to regimental reserves, the Minister says in the statement he has issued that, as the result of the process of transferring to the reserves, discharge of those unfit, and of those married men who elect to be so transferred, 25,000 members of the Militia will not be available for the period of the three months' camp training. That leaves a very inadequate army for Australia. In 1914, with a population of 2,000,000 less than we have now, we had some 40,000 militiamen, who had at least undergone one camp, and some 80,000 cadets who had day and night training but no camp experience. I suggest that a Militia force reduced to these dimensions is quite inadequate for Australia's I defence. filled. filled? that Militia trainees will be called up in January.

If there be no fighting in Australia)-and I trust that there will not be-it will be the force that is overseas that will fight Australia's and the Empire's and civilization's fight and win it.

I then went to the Air Force. on the experience gained in the last war. the last war! The Minister should figure it out for himself. In 1918, the average age of the captains was about 30 years. Those men would now be about 50 years of age, and if they have stayed in the Army they will have advanced a step or so since then. Mr .STREET -The age limits were based on the reaction of war on .people of similar ages in 1914-18. have faced the doctor and passed him at my age. Surely experience counts more than a dogmatic age limit decided by some one in an office. Before this war is over, men of all ages will be wanted. Eveni f experienced men lasted only a year or two in this conflict, they would be able to tell the younger men something to their advantage, whatever their rank. Their services would be useful in camp' or overseas. Reverting to the matter of pay, I lay stress on the fact that the men who go overseas should be paid at a higher rate than those who remain for home defence; The renowned economist Keynes, in suggesting a means of avoiding a post-war slump, advocated-and was met with a good deal of criticisma system of part-payment in industry by certificates to be cashed after the termination of the war. He said that the cashing and spending of those certificates would help to maintain the impetus of trade. As an alternative to an actual cash increase of the pay to the soldiers who go overseas, the 'Government should look into that proposal. honourable member when he advocated a higher rate of pay for the soldiers, but T. do not agree with him now. is an alternative means of supplementing the soldiers' pay. certificates. could be. saved for redemption after the war. At any rate, I put that forward merely as an alternative, if the Government feels 'that it could not now afford to meet the additional expenditure which would be involved in an increase of the rates of pay for soldiers. There is no need for the Minister for the Army alone to take the responsibility of looking into these matters I have raised. There are now four Ministers, including the Prime Minister himself, who is Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, connected with the armed forces. Between them, surely they could undertake the task. It is a reasonable proposal that the soldiers should get more money, in spite of the fact that there is I a division of opinion in this country on the subject. The pay of the 2nd Australian Imperial Eorce would not amount to much in a programme of more than £60,000,000 worth of defence expenditure this year. I ask the Minister for the Army now what proportion of that expenditure will be involved in soldiers' wages? will be for the overseas forces? I think it would be fair to say that it would be between £2,000,000 aiid £3,000,000 for the whole of the expeditionary forces, which is only about one-thirtieth of the whole of the defence expenditure. It is cheeseparing to cut down where the human element is concerned, while big prices will be paid for weapons of death. paid the basic wage in New Zealand. the Labour government of New Zealand, not only for that, but also for the fact that it has decided to send an expeditionary force from New Zealand. To summarize, I suggest that the Government should give the militiamen an opportunity to re-enlist on the present terms, that existing and future gaps in the Militia should be filled by calling up further age groups for universal training, and that the Government should revise the rates of pay in the Australian Imperial Force in order to ensure that those whose patriotism is practical in offering their lives for their country if",51,Street

Minister for the Army( Mr Street) has clone good work in many ways since he has been in the Cabinet. He has always been prepared to listen to any complaints, and has always endeavoured. to rectify them wherever possible. There has been criticism of the Defence Departtwo or three years ago. Those facts, ment in this debate, but in any department whose ramifications have been extended so greatly as have those of the Defence Department there must be room for criticism. I was impressed with some of the critical remarks of the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), particularly those in which he drew comparisons between the conditions that prevail now and those that predefence forces, and I am also strongly vailed several years ago. The present attitude of the right honourable gentleman, however, does not appear to he consistent with the attitude that he adopted when he was a member of the Government. It is true that honourable members do not know what took place in the Cabinet room, where the right honourable gentleman may have expressed opinions similar to those that he expressed this afternoon, but the fact remains that, while defence preparations in Australia. The he was a member of the Ministry, very little was done to rectify the position of which he complained to-day, despite his statement that even in those days he foreMilitia has had a curbing effect saw the difficulties lying ahead of the Government. AlthoughI agree to a great degree with what the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) said this afternoon in the very fine speech with which he opened this debate on behalf of the Labour party, I also agree in many respects with what the right honourable member for Cowper said. Fortunately, I have not committed the political sin of being a member of a Government which is largely responsible for the lack of defence preparedness in Australia. Thi= Government, and others of the same political complexion, have occupied the treasury bench for more than seven years now. During the last three or four years, the ominous clouds of war have been looming on the horizon and, despite the fact that the Labour party has offered constructive criticism of the Government's defence policy and has made many valuable suggestions regarding preparations that should have been made for any conflict in which Australia, as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, might be involved, the Government ignored and, at times, ridiculed its proposals. Within the last few weeks, however, the Minister for Air( Mr Fairbaim) has made statements based on the very principles that Labour advocated at least which may be verified in the records of the debates .of this Parliament, speak for themselves. They show that this party enunciated years ago a sound policy for the defence of this country. I support much of the criticism that has been voiced this afternoon of the rates of pay provided for members of the opposed to any form of conscription. Conscription of man-power is neither necessary nor desirable at this juncture. The voluntary system has never had a fair trial; I do not believe that the Government has ever tackled very seriously the problem of obtaining recruits for the Militia Forces. Of course, as soon as the international situation overseas became precarious, there was a speeding-up of fact that the Government has repudiated its agreement with the men who enrolled for a period of three years in the on further enlistments; the alteration of conditions and the extension of the period that the men have to spend in training have had a tremendous effect. The New Zealand Government has had no difficulty in obtaining the number of men that it considers to be necessary for the adequate defence of that dominion by voluntary enlistment. One of the main reasons for this is that since a Labour government has been in power, it has done many things to bring about social and economic development; it has introduced a shorter working week, increased rates of pay in industry, improved housing conditions, and generally created a better set of social conditions. That has given the people of New Zealand a greater degree of confidence in themselves and has created an attraction for many men residing in Australia, because conditions in New Zealand provide",52,Street
170,Mr Barnard (Bass) [6.4],"Th egreater scope for the ability and skill of the working man. Men are rushing to the colours in New Zealand to take their part in the war effort of the British Commonwealth of Nations because reasonable rates of pay are provided for them. A married man with a wife and two children, who enlists as a private in the New Zealand militia forces, receives a weekly wage of £2 9s. for his own services and allowances of £1 Is. in respect of his wife aud £1 Is. in respect of his children, making a total of £4 l is . a week. I agree made for their families. with the right honourable member for Cowper that given sufficient inducement to enlist, we shall have no difficulty in obtaining as large a force as we need. BeforeI returned to Canberra to attend the present sitting of this Parliament I received numerous complaints regarding rates of pay in the Militia. Men joined the Militia for a term of three years in the expectation of spending some time in camp and attending a number of drill parades, which cut into their private lives, because it was considered necessary in the interests of Australia's safety to have a greater supply of trained men; but when the speeding-up process took place and the Government decided to introduce a longer period of continuous training, hardship was imposed on many of them who had fixed financial commitments. One of the many men who interviewed me told me that he was earning £5 ""a week and had to support a wife and four children. He was purchasing a home and had to pay insurance premiums and other regular expenses, which exhausted almost the whole of his income. He was sent into camp on a wage of' £3 a week and had to remain there for one month. For the whole of that period, therefore,' he suffered financially to the amount of £2 a week. To make matters worse for him the Government has now decided that the Militia must spend a further three months in camp early next year.

In this connection we find that while interest rates have been, pegged at the level'at which they said in this House yesterday, and draws stood on or about the 31st August, many men who have gone into camp are losing as much as £2 a week. Their wages were not pegged for even a fortnight. It requires a good deal of patriotism for a man with a family to maintain to volunteer for service when he knows that it will mean a loss of £2 a week to him. It is true that provision is made for exemptions in cases of hardship, but these men want to do the job, and are entitled to know that adequate provision will be The right honourable member for if Australians are Cowper also drew attention to the provision made at the military camps for the men. The Minister's statement contained the following paragraph:The estimated expenditure on camps for the 2nd Australian Imperial Force amounts to £1,250,000. Structures for outlying districts and commands have been erected, but the main works are for the brigade camps at Ingleburn and Allandale (New South Wales) and Puckapunyal (Victoria). The men in the ranks have a right to expect reasonable treatment when in camp. There should not be so much differentiation between the .men and the officers. In this connection I refer not 1 only to the canteens but also to other matters. The rate of pay has been fixed at the 1914 level, whereas the cost of living has risen about 50 per cent, since 1914. ""While we, as members of the British Empire, desire to help the Mother Country, we must not ignore the pertinent statements made during the last two or three years by the Prime Minister of Great Britain and other leading British statesmen. Mr Chamberlain has said quite plainly that, in the event of Britain being unable to protect the dominions, they would have to look after themselves. That leads me to remind the House that this continent is rich in natural resources but is thinly populated. We must also bear in mind that since 1914 the whole position has altered immeasurably in that, whilst distances remain the same, the period required to get from one place to another is much less than it was then. Australia would be wise to pay close attention to some of its near neighbours.

We do not know how the nations will align themselves in this conflict, and we must not be blind to the possibility of Australia being itself in the danger zone. Strategically our position' may change dramatically, and the consequences, indeed, be serious. For that reason, Australia must consider, first, its own defence, and take steps to safeguard this portion of the British Empire. That is our job. month's issue of Current Problems the following paragraph appeared:'We quote a high Japauese diplomatic authority: "" Japan is in no state to enter upon another war."" The European war does give Japan an opportunity, if she can end' the Chinese incident without loss of face, to rebuild her economic strength, whilst two of her strongest competitors, Britain and Germany, are fighting. Australia's policy should be to do a l l possible to re-knit the bonds which formerly united the two countries, and the Australian Government, when Japan makes a gesture of goodwill, should welcome it , which it is not doing at present. There is much of merit in that statement. I invite the Government's attention to this important aspect of our own defence. It has been said that our aim in the present war is victory, but much depends on what wei mean by victory. In my opinion, there are no victors in any war. The Allies were supposed to have won the war of 1914-1918, but whilst they may have won the' conflict in arms and imposed certain conditions on a supposedly defeated foe, the fact remains that economically, neither side won the war. Audited figures which were recently published show that the cost of the war to the nations that participated in it was «s follows:Exclusive of Great Britain. . Dominions US. of America France Russia Italy Entente Allies 26,227,530,000 Germany Austria-Hungary Turkey and Bulgaria. 12,128,632,000 Grand total Mr Barnard. Should the present struggle continue for any considerable time, both sides will be exhausted financially. I want to see the Allies win in this conflict, but I want also to see, at its conclusion, a peace founded upon justice in the social and economic lives of all the peoples engaged in it, including ourselves. In criticizing the Government's defence proposals I hope that I have said something of a constructive character. I In last desire to be helpful. AlthoughI am not satisfied with many of the activities of the Government, and have been somewhat critical in my remarks, I appreciate the tremendous problem confronting the Government. I am not satisfied with what is being done for those who will play the most important part in the conflict, namely the soldiers sand their dependants. That is an aspect of the war to which the Government should give more consideration, so that when the war is over, all sections of the community, soldiers, dependants of soldiers, and citizens generally, will be able to live in a better world. Mr P0RDE (Capricornia) [8.15] My colleague, the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear), dealt so ably this afternoon with the statement now under ""consideration that it is not my intention to speak at any length on the general subject. I shall devote my attention to one aspect of it which concerns the welfare of the members of the 2nd Australian I mperial Force and of the Militia Forces. In order to make clear the attitude of the Federal Labour party, I move That all the .words after "" T h a t "" be omitted, with n. view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:"" in the ojiinion of this House, the rate of loans. pay to a private in the 2nd Australian I m £ 7,068,800,000 perial Force should be not less than 7s. per .. 898,762,000 day, with an allowance of 3s. per day for a .. 5,655,050,000 wife, and Is.

We owe 98,356,162,003 a duty to these young men who are making great sacrifices. I was impressed by the remarks of the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) this afternoon concerning the spirit that prompted our young mem to enlist in the 2nd. Australian Imperial Porce and the Militia. Speaking as a medical practitioner, he said that he knew that many of these men were of the finest type, physically, in Australia, and were actuated 'by the adventurous spirit of their forefathers who had been so successful in organizing 1 and developing many of the great industries of this country. These young men, he said, were true to type. I agree with him. This country cannot afford to run this war "" on the cheap"", by inadequately paying those who are prepared to enlist, sacrifice jobs and prospects, and risk their tain herself and child on that meagre lives. As the representatives of the electors, we have a great responsibility to give our close attention to the matter with which I am now dealing. It is already engaging the attention of a very wide circle of people in the general community. The pay and conditions offered to these young men have been discussed at meetings of various kinds and also in numerous articles in the press. The existing rates have caused great dissatisfaction, not only in the ranks of the 2nd Australian Imperial Eorce and the Militia, but also in the community at large. We feel that we should be lacking in our duty as an Opposition if we permitted Parliament to go into recess next week without giving honourable membei's a. specific opportunity to express their opinion on this subject on the floor of the House. It is a long way to hark back to 1915. At that time our soldiers were being paid 5s. a day and Is. a day deferred pay on embarkation. It is surprising, therefore, to find that to-day the rate should still be only 5s. a day with Is. a day deferred pay on embarkation. In 1915, the allowance for wives was Is. a day and for dependent children 4£d. a day each. Corresponding rates for 1939 are 3s. a day and Is, a day. The total amount provided for the soldier and his wife and one child in 1915 was 6s. 9£d. a clay plus Is. a day deferred pay. In 1939, the corresponding amount is 9s. a day plus Is. a day deferred pay. This small increase is not at all in keeping with the increase in the cost of living, as honourable members must be very well aware. Moreover, a substantial increase of the basic wage has occurred during the period under review. In 1914, according to the statistician's figures, the Federal basic wage was £2 14s. 6d. In 1915, it was £3 Is. 6d. The figure for the 1st December, 1939, is £3 19s. The basic wage has increased by 22 per cent, since 1915, and by a much greater percentage since the end of 1914. Under existing conditions, the remuneration for a man and his wife and one child will be £3 10s. a week inclusive of deferred pay, and £3 3s. a week minus deferred pay. The soldier will retain 14s. a week. Thus, a married woman with one child will receive £2 9s. a week. Is it fair to ask her to pay rent and mainpittance with all the attendant worry, anxiety and sorrow? The right honourable member for Cowper pointed out this afternoon that the sister dominion of New Zealand is treating its soldiers and dependants in a much more liberal manner than Australia is doing. He added that the rate provided for New Zealand would satisfy him. The New Zealand rates are as follows:-Private, 7s. a day or £2 9s. a week; wife, 3s. a day or £1 Is. a week; ohild, Is. 6d. a day or 10s. 6d. a week, making a total of £4 0s. '6d. a week. The comparative rate for Australia at present is, private, £1 15s. a week; wife, £1 Is. a week; child, 7s. a week, making a total payment of £3 3s., not taking into consideration the deferred pay. Not only has a substantial increase occurred in the basic wage since 1915, but I emphasize that the cost of living has also increased greatly. The figure for September, 1939, according to the Commonwealth Statistician, is 33.3 per cent, above that for November, 1914. The figure for to-day is 35 per cent, in excess of that for November, 1914. All of these factors should be taken into consideration. We must also bear in mind that to-day we are offering the single man who enlists only the same rate as was offered to single men in 1915, namely 5s. a day, plus Is. a day upon embarkation. I do not see how any one can stand for that policy. Single men who have enlisted have, in many instances, left positions of great promise. I realize, of course, that some of them were unemployed, but that is no reason why the Government should underpay them in the hazardous undertaking on which they have entered. Those who have enlisted in Queensland include many young men who were receiving a basic wage considerably higher than the federal basic wage. Our young men made substantial sacrifices when they left their permanent positions and went to the nearest recruiting depot to enlist. Moreover, it happened that some of them had to wait from two to five weeks before they were called into camp. I met many young men in my own electorate quite recently who had given up permanent jobs to enlist and who were kept hanging about for weeks, at their own expense, before they were called into camp. Numbers of these young men had widowed mothers or aged fathers or other members of their families dependent upon them. I ask whether it is right' for us to expect them to make such great sacrifices ? assured the men who enlisted that they The young men who are enlisting are being asked to make sacrifices out of all proportion to the sacrifices capitalistic interests are being asked to make. In my opinion the Government should, if necessary, tax the wealthy classes of our community to provide additional money for the remuneration of these men. The people who own large properties, retail shops, or big manufacturing establishments, and enjoy huge' . in-comes, stand to lose most if Australia should be invaded, or if the British the militiamen, when they found, after Empire should be overwhelmed. I submit, therefore, that they should be taxed in order to assist the nation to provide for those who are prepared to fight for their country. The capitalist class of Australia should not expect to escape with a minimum of taxation. It is not fair that they should be able to call upon the Government to "" run the war on the cheap"" at the expense of the boys who are risking everything. it proper that they should expect the brave young spirits of this country, the very flower of our manhood, to enlist with the possibility of making the conceded in respect of wives and children supreme sacrifice without being willing, themselves, to do the fair thing. Many of the men who have enlisted in the 2nd Australian Imperial Force or who are at present in militia camps, have wives and young children as well as other dependants. Our soldiers who go abroad Jlfr. Forde. to this war will have an even worse time than the soldiers who served in the last war. Many of them will sacrifice their permanent employment, and even those who return at the end of two, three or four years, if the war should, unhappily, last so long, will be handicapped when they attempt to resume their civil employment. These factors should be considered now, not after the men have left our shores. We should do what we can for them now, while they are in camp, and before they leave on active service. WhatI am saying applies also to the men in the Militia. An additional reason for support for my amendment is to be found in the statement of the right honourable member for Cowper this afternoon that when he took an active part in the recruiting campaign some months ago, he would be paid 8s. a day. The right honourable member foT North Sydney( Mr Hughes), who was in charge of the recruiting campaign, and in course of it toured Australia from one end to the other delivering many soul-stirring speeches, also assured the men who enlisted that they would get 8s. a day. I can understand the dismay of the right honourable member for Cowper and many other honourable members, as well as the disappointment in the hearts of the outbreak of war, that the pay of men who enlisted was to be reduced from 8s. to 5s. a day. The men who go into the longer militia camps will also be recouped at only that lower rate instead of the 8s. that was promised to them. It is true that the Government has increased the allowance for a wife to 2s. Gd. a day and for each dependent child to 9d. a day, but we are of the opinion Nor is that privates and militiamen in camp should receive 8s. a day, wives Ss. a day, and each dependent child Is. 6d. a day. The increase which the Government has is paltry. In my opinion, it is too parsimonious altogether. Now, when the budget is under consideration, is the time to take action to put this matter right. It is not too late even at this stage to recast the budget, if necessary, so as to make proper provision for these young : men who have joined the. Militia and the 2nd Australian Imperial Force. Many of them are wage-earners, of course, but some have left their farms or small businesses to go into camp, and they will have to employ others in their places. They enlisted believing that they would be required to serve in camp for only about a fortnight a year. The period was increased first to a month, and then to three months, so that they will have to make arrangements for the working of their farms or businesses in their absence. It is not fair that, in addition to risking their lives in defence of their country, they should be compelled also to make heavy financial sacrifices. While the Government pays full price to manufacturers for arms, munitions and supplies, at the same time it wants to get human flesh, muscle and brain at an unreasonably low rate of allowance. No member of this House could keep a wife and child on the niggardly pay which the Government is offering to trainees, and the trainees should not be asked to do so either. I therefore call upon honourable members to show by their votes that they will not desert the just claims of the young men who have enlisted to become the defenders of Australia and of the British Empire.

Since then, it has been gradually reduced until it now stands at Is. a gallon, which is the rate proposed with the object of endeavouring to unin this bill. The wine industry, which began in South Australia a century ago, has now spread practically all over Australia, and wine grapes are grown in considerable quantities in Victoria, ""Western Australia, the position was somewhat eased. The and New South Wales. After the last war, the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia expended big sums of money in the settlement of large numbers pf returned soldiers in grape-growing districts along the River Murray. In 1924 the quantity of wine exported from. Australia was 142,000 gallons; in' 1934 it increased to 2,600,000 gallons; and in 1939 it reached the large figure of 18,500,000 gallons. The difficulties which beset the industry have been brought about by its dependence on overseas markets for the disposal of surplus production. To place it on a satisfactory footing we must either improve the export market, increase local consumption, or decrease the acreage planted with wine grapes. All of these avenues are being explored hy the wine growers and makers who, from time to time, submit proposals for the betterment of the industry to the Governments of the Commonwealth and of the States. To assist it the Commonwealth Government has seen fit to bring down this bill to continue the payment of a bounty of Is. a gallon on the export of wine. It was estimated that payments from the trust fund this year would be approximately £150,000; but in common with other primary industries, the wine industry is likely to suffer severely as the result of the curtailment of exports, due to the war, and it does not seem likely that the estimated bounty payments will have to be met. I have travelled right through the wine-grape growing districts in order to get first hand information regarding the industry from the point of view not only of the growers but also of the makers. former honourable member for Wakefield, the late Mr Charles Hawker, and earlier representatives of that constituency have stressed the importance to Australia of this industry. When the late Mr Hawker met a sudden and tragic Mr MoBugh. death in the Eyeema disaster he was flying from Adelaide to Melbourne with the members of the Viticultural Council ravel the problems that beset the industry at that time. Shortly after the death of Mr Hawker, nature took a hand and the wine-growing districts experienced a severe drought as the result of which difficulty which then faced the industry, however, was negligible compared with its outlook at the present time. It is estimated that the"" capital invested in this industry amounts to approximately £20,000,000. The three most important industries in South Australia are the .wool, wheat and the wine industries. Here is an opportunity for this Parliament to deal open-handedly with one of the smaller States. I appeal to honourable members to give this bill a speedy passage because of the almost chaotic condition of the industry in South Australia. Many of the returned soldiers settled in the wine-grape growing districts in South Australia find themselves, after twenty years' toil, no better off than they were when they returned from the war. Large quantities of wine-grapes are grown in the Barossa Valley, to which John Fife Angus brought out the first German settlers about a hundred years ago. As the result of their industry the Barossa Valley has been transformed from its native state into one of the most beautiful and picturesque spots in Australia. the original German settlers are returned soldiers valley of Clare, near the home town of my predecessor, the late Mr Hawker, grapes are grown in abundance. Another great grape-growing district to the south of Adelaide is in the electorate represented by"" the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron). The only new feature in this bill is contained in clause 11 which makes provision for an The initial payment of £2 on the 21st of the month following the delivery of the grapes. If a grower delivers grapes during the month of May the payment of £2 will be made on the 21st -June. This arrangement has received, the endorsement of both makers and growers. The",58,Lawson

The Labour Government led by the right lin) was resppnsible for the introduction of the first legislation providing for a bounty on the export of wine, and the growers, being the weaker section in the industry, have since then been protected by successive governments. This industry has always received, the sympathetic consideration of the members of the party to which I belong. The only stipulation they make is that those engaged in the industry shall be paid in accordance with the recognized standard of living in this country. I am glad to be able to assure them that^the pickers employed in the industry are members of the Australian Workers Union and are paid in accordance with an award of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. had to 'be assisted to remain on its feet. member had listened carefully to my earlier remarks he would know that there is no justification for his interjection. For ducts at less than world parity, in order the information of the honourable member I repeat that bounty payments are made from a trust fund established by contributions from the excise duty levied on wine. is really an equalization fund. into raisins instead of into wine? shall not go into the question of temperance. The wine-making industry is closely related to the dried-fruits industry, especially in connection with the provision of fortifying spirit. The banks of the River Murray are bordered by cooperative concerns operating in both industries. The pretty town of Berri, South Australia, is a splendid example of co-operation. I have not seen its equal in any part of the world that I have visited. In Renmark, the co-operative system has been so advanced that the grape-growers own not only the grapes, hut also the distillery, packing sheds, and the hotels. Last year tlie profit from the co-operative hotels was £9,000, every penny of which went into the. beautification of the town and district, and into the provision of educational facilities. The .co-operative system employed at Renmark has been commended all over Australia. Having been in close contact with both aspects of the wine-making industrygrowing and distillingI commend this bill to honourable members, because the industry is vital to South Australia and important to the other States. I realize that the cities of Sydney and Melbourne are largely responsible for the consumption of the product of the industry. Another aspect that enters my mind is the fact that Great Britain, which takes the bulk of our exports-w e export a little wine to Canada and New Zealandhas imposed duties on Australian wine, with a detrimental result to the industry, and I appeal to the Government that it take all steps' possible, through the High Commissioner in London, to have preference given to our wine. It must be impressed on Great Britain that, if Australia is prepared to sell to it wool and other primary proto assist it in this war, it should reciprocate. France is one of the largest wine-producing and wine-drinking countries of the world. To give the House an idea of the difference between France and Australia insofar as wine is concerned, I understand that France produces 1,200,000 gallons a year and that the per capita consumption is about six gallons, whereas the per capita consumption in this country is only six pints. That leads me to the belief that there is room for a big expansion of wine sales in Australia, provided that the alcohol content is reduced in order to make the wine comparable to the light wines of France. drunks then. honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) and I know from our experiences in France .that the consumption of wine in that country is considerable, but that the alcohol content is so slight as to render the drink innocuous.

One of the difficulties about expanding the wine trade in this country is the fact that the hotels are almost exclusively in the hands of the breweries. It may be that negotiations between the two industries would lead to better co-operation between them, with a consequent increased consumption of Australian wine. I make that suggestion in the faint hope that it will mean an increase instead of a diminution of the consumption of wine. exceedingly that honourable members seem to be almost united in an intention to grant a bounty to the wine industry. About sixteen years ago, I visited Renmark and the other wine-making districts along the Murray River and saw then that the growers, owing to the refusal of the wineries to give them a payable price for their grapes, threatened to turn their efforts from wine to raisins. Ever since the wine grape industry has been in existence, like most primary industries, it has been coming cap in hand to this Government for. a bounty in order to make the industry pay and in order to enable it to foist on to the Australian community something which it does not want.

When I was a member of the Parliament of New South Wales, I inspected most of the wine bars and counted the number of men and women in them. My investigations led me to make certain charges on the floor of the Legislative Assembly as. the result-of which the Chief Secretary ordered an inquiry by the police.

The French nation has become what it is to-day largely because it has allowed wine-drinking to sap it3 moral fibre, resulting in its own destruction through failure to reproduce the species in sufficient numbers. If wine were what some honourable members say it is, it would be a very fine thing to give to every body in order that they might benefit from its medicinal properties. But my experience is to the contrary. I went to Mildura and interviewed many men who told me that "" pinky"" was sold in Mildura and all along the River Murray in such quantities that honest, good and straight men were destroyed morally, mentally and physically by it. slander.

' It creates immorality and vice. I may turn to the scriptures in support of my remarks, for the Bible states ""Look not upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth its colour, for it biteth like a serpent and stinget.h like an adder"". Had the honourable member for Wakefield asked for a subsidy for dried raisins instead of a subsidy for wine, I should not have hesitated to give him my support. I believe that the dried fruits industry can be developed in the interests of the moral, social and physical welfare years in which I have been a member of this Parliament, I have heard many honourable members champion the cause of the wine industry. Obviously, it cannot maintain itself without the help of money taken from the pockets of the people of this country. I defy any man to prove anything to the contrary. It is all very well for honourable gentlemen to say that they will pay a bounty upon exports. That has been done, and still the industry has failed to show a profit. A bounty is granted in order to spread propaganda throughout Great Britain to persuade the oeople of that country to give preference to Australian wines over much less expensive wines produced in Portugal, Spain and elsewhere on the Continent. An. analysis of the condition of the wine industry in Australia will show that it is like many other primary industries, and the Government must call a halt some day soon and restrict the production of every .industry according to the wants of the people, so that it will no longer be necessary to pay bounties.

211,Mr Lane,"In this bill we are askeddo, because tbe growers do not receive a fair return for tbeir efforts. The wine grape industry of Australia depends upon the sale of wine under such conditions that, if we had not lost a great deal of our moral courage and instincts, we would not tolerate for one moment the existence of wine bars that are only traps of immorality and vice. The honourable member for Wakefield knows why wine bars are established in centres where working men congregate. Wine may be used very extensively by certain well-to-do people in their private homes, but wine bars are established in the great cities in order that the poorest people may be lured into the habit of drinking wine. Fortunately, the owners of those bars have never been able to create a popular taste for their wares. The honourable member for Wakefield advocated the making of an agreement with brewery firms so that wine would be boosted over hotel counters in order to make the industry successful. When I spent a week in the Murray Valley, inspecting grape farms, I saw many returned soldiers who cultivated grapes, not for wine merchants, but for raisins. I was introduced to a one-armed soldier who had made £700 a year from the production of dried fruits. Those returned soldiers were not allowed to grow anything upon their twenty-acre blocks apart from grapes, because it was said that the growing of grapes was a full-time job for one man. I saw many places where men had gone in for the production of dried fruits, and, after reaping the first full crop removal of things which destroy human of grapes, had sold out for as much as£4,000 and £5,000. The dried fruits industry was regarded in that locality as a very fine one. ' Farmers at Renmark, in South Australia, had at that time just informed the wineries that if they did not receive a higher price for their grapes, they would divert their energies to the production of raisins. Ever since I entered parliamentary life in 1922,1 have heard the same old story told by men who wish to foist wine drinking upon a growing nation. We Taise our families to lead good, healthy lives, and then, through false advertising, this damnabletraffic, which is being carried on under our very noses, seeks to lure people into the wine^drinking habit. In spite of all that, honourable members say Mr Lane. that the industry can be put up on a high plane. Nazarene give the people wine? classes of wine are referred to in the Bible. The original Scriptures contain two different words which have been interpreted as "" wine"", but one of them refers to fermented wine and the other to' unfermented wine. Where the Scriptures say, "" Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price"", the word "" wine "" ' refers to the unfermented juice of the grape, not the fermented stuff to which other ingredients are added that is handed across wine bars. But where the Scriptures say, "" Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging, and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise "" they refer to fermented wine Mr Archie Cameron interjecting, members from South Australian electorates are driven to interject is that the wine-growers of their State say, "" If you do not do certain things we will get some one else to represent us "". They are made to do what the producer of wine says, not what their consciences say they should do for the benefit of mankind. Most persons who have been received into any of the churches by baptism have been baptized, not with wine, but with what I regard as the best of all liquids-pure water. I make no apology for being a total abstainer, or for advocating the life at its best. The only reason why I am in public life is to try to lay hold of the things that destroy the flower ""of our youth and manhood. The reason why so many in our midst are physically unfit is that in our parliaments there are so many men who, like the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) a few minutes ago, use the name of the lowly Nazarene to bolster up the drink traffic. If the wine used in the great religious, festivals referred to in the Bible was fermented wine, as the wine-growers claim, those festivals would have been drunken orgies, not religious feasts. When I was responsible for the training of boys and girls and youngmen and women, I studied these issues in order that I might place before themt",62,Honourable Members Oh Oh

It is deplorable that when men advocate the need for moral and spiritual reformation, others in the community only snigger and laugh at the name of Him who gave to the world the greatest example of true manhood. I have never been afraid to stand in the public street, on the public platform, or in Parliament, as I stand here to-night, even though I have, perhaps, been only "" as a voice crying in the wilderness "", in opposition to the drink traffic. ""We are told that the people of France, .who are winedrinkers, are not drunkards, and that the English people, who indulge in another kind of beverage, are also good examples of decent citizens.

Should this Parliament accede to the demand to assist the wine industry, it will not act in the best interests of Australia. The wine industry has never been any credit to Australia. In the Parliament of New South Wales men who represent wine-growing districts have said repeatedly that the Australian people will not drink wine. When1 was a member of that Parliament, representing a large industrial centre, representatives of the wine industry asked for bounties. Sixteen years ago they acknowledged that the industry could not live unless assisted by money provided by the people. able gentleman oppose the hop-growers? these men be placed in such positions.

The honourable home to their wives and families with member made an unparliamentary no money in their pockets. On one occaremark. sion I had the pleasure of discussing this subject at a meeting in a wine-growing liament of New South Wales and Mr district which was attended by representaMcKell was Minister for Justice in a tives of some of the big wine-making firms, Labour government, the president of the such as Penf olds Limited. I told the audience of the evil effects of the drink traffic on its victims in order that a few persons in the community could become wealthy, and then I invited the representatives of the liquor trade to mount the platform aud speak a word in favour of the industry. Not one of them accepted the invitation. On another occasion I visited Gun Alley, where previously a man had been shot. BeforeI went, people said to me that I was not game to go. I went there on a Saturday afternoon and found young men and women, as well as old men, saturated with wine, until practically deprived of their senses. I asked those who were trying to rear families to look at this thing from the point of view of their children. Any parent knows that when his boy of eighteen or nineteen years of age goes out into the world, he must face conditions, permitted by law, which provide that men may learn to drink. I want men who love their children to know that their lives can be destroyed within 48 hours if , in that time, they acquire a taste for the things which destroy human life. I hope that while God gives me breath I shall be found opposing the vested interests which have used both honest and dishonest means to develop this industry. Many men who represent Labour constituencies are not game to say a word against the liquor trade or the wine industry, because they know that if they do those who control those industries will select other candidates to oppose them.

Leader of the Country party) [9.46] I am confident that honourable members generally will approach the consideration of this bill from a point of view different from that of the honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane). I regret the manner of his attack on the wine industry.' This is not the place for speeches of the kind he has just delivered. This bill deals with the provision of a bounty on fortified wine of fl certain strength which will be exported. It has nothing whatever to do with the sale of wine within Australia. The Commonwealth Parliament has no power to determine the conditions that shall govern the sale of wine in Australia. The honourable member for Wakefield gest wine area in Australia, referred, 1 believe, to the necessity for some review of licensing conditions in Australia. Whenever the question of the manufacture and sale of liquor comes up for discussion some people "" see red "". Like rigid teetotaller and a lifelong Rechabite, but I shall approach this subject in a way very different from that of the honourable member for Barton. Country party knows my attitude on the liquor question! so. I was a fellow member of the South' Australian Parliament with the honourable gentleman at a time when, I think, he did not represent a single grapegrower. There is a tendency in the community for certain people to tell other people how they should live. I feel that the best thing that any sincere man can do in such a matter is to show by I did not know that this his own example that his way of living is so much superior to that of other people with whom he may disagree, that they will be persuaded to his ideas. That method is far better than criticism. The honourable member for Barton does not seem to realize that the big wine-producing areas are not in the irrigation districts but in non-irrigated areas, such as those in South Australia that the honourable member for Wakefield represents, and which I , too, in a lesser degree also represent. Just as fine people are engaged in the growing of grapes and in the making and exporting of wine as are to be found in any other occupation in Australia. We ought, in considering this bill, to ask ourselves what sort of an industry this is. I remind honourable members that the wine industry provides a very close type of settlement in the country at a distance from the metropolitan areas. It also gives permanent employment for the persons engaged in the wineries. Making wine is not merely a matter of growing grapes .and putting them through the crusher; it involves the distillation of spirit.

234,Mr Archie Cameron,"Quit eskilled occupations. Only men who have been constantly engaged in wine and brandy making, and who have served a long apprenticeship, are able to do this work to perfection. The people for whom the wine industry caters are very particular, as a rule. Fashions change in wines and brandies, and those engaged in the wine industry have to study the requirements of their customers, just as, I suppose, the honourable member for Barton had to study the requirements of his customers when he was a suburban storekeeper selling groceries or the like. Unless the wine-makers study their customers they will undoubtedly lose their trade. The wine industry of Australia is facing a good many problems. Some of these arise from the fact that Australia produces more wine than our people consume. We are not regarded as a big wine-drinking country. One of the reasons, perhaps, is that too much highly fortified sweet wine is produced here and not enough of the light, dry types which are more of a beverage wine. There are climatic reasons why Australian wines contain a greater alcoholic content than the dry wines produced ' in less favoured countries. For the benefit of the honourable member for BartonI may say that in our fermentation the whole of the sugar content of the grape juice is retained. The greater the amount of sunshine in a country, the greater is the quantity of sugar contained in the grapes grown there, and, consequently, the greater is the alcoholic content of the dry wines produced. The reason why our wines contain such a high alcoholic content is that we enjoy so much sunshine. The problems of wine production in Australia are likely to become even more serious in the States in which governments have encouraged settlement, and possibly to their regret, in grape growing areas. Returned soldiers were not settled exclusively in irrigation areas. order, which constitute our three great Many of the vineyards which the honourable member for Barton appears to have visited in 1922 were planted by men inexperienced in the industry, but it should be remembered that the doradillo grapes originally planted have been replaced by more satisfactory types. The wine industry is one of our oldestablished activities. Wine-making has been in vogue in South Australia for nearly 100 years. About 90 per cent, of the wine and brandy produced in Australia is made in that State. Consequently, the bulk of this export bounty, probably well over 90 per cent, of it, will go there. But the honourable member for Barton, who has shown himself to be so bitterly opposed to this bill, must not imagine that the levy, which honourable members are being asked to reaffirm, all goes for the benefit of the grape-growers. There are two kinds of excise by which contributions are made to the revenues of the Commonwealth. The first is the excise of £1 6s. a gallon on brandy produced in Australia. In the last fifteen or sixteen years revenues totalling almost £6,000,000 have been received from this source. The other form of excise is that on fortified spirit, which is distilled from dry wine and is used to fortify wines for export. It is that type of duty which is now under consideration. The revenue produced from that source during the last fourteen years has totalled 'more than £4,200,000. The honourable member for Barton should realize that the wine industry, after having provided its own export bounty, has contributed very large sums to the revenues of the Commonwealth. the honourable member and I belong would never endorse a policy of producing liquor in order to derive revenue from it. not suggesting any such thing. I am referring to a fact of which the honourable member has not seen fit to take cognizance. After hearing the honourable gentleman's speech, 1 say quite confidently that he has not read the bill and does not understand the purpose of it. The wine industry is very strongly sometimes to their cost established in South Australia. We have in that State what is called "" the three W's""-wheat , wool and wine, in that primary producing industries. If the Commonwealth Parliament were to adopt the attitude suggested by the honourable member for Barton and veto this proposal, it would bring' stark ruination to hundreds of grape-growers, dozens of wine-makers, and very many people who",65,Honourable Members Oh Oh
235,Mr Lane,The organization to which,66,Honourable Members Oh Oh

The great bulk of wine produced in South Australia is exported, but in order to obtain the bounty certain conditions must he observed. For example, the wine-makers must pay a stipulated price for the grapes they purchase. That price is fixed at_a conference of various interests, over which the Minister for Trade and Customs 'presides, each year. It is in connection with the fixing of the price of grapes that one or two innovations have been introduced in this bill. Previously, the rule has been for both the co-operative and proprietary winemaking organizations to pay pretty well what it suited them, and when it suited them, for the grapes delivered to them each year. The result has been that grapegrowers, like the people engaged in other primary producing industries, have been forced, out of considerations of economic necessity, to form themselves into a rigid organization, which speaks, with very few exceptions, for all grape-growers of South Australia. It has been one of their grievances for a long while that the wine-makers have paid for their grapes only in instalments and at considerable intervals after delivery. The grape-growers have been greatly inconvenienced by this arrangement, for they, of course, have to pay for the ploughing of their land, the pruning of their vines, a.nd, in many instances, the carrying of their grapes to the wineries. This bill provides a method by which payment for the grapes shall be made on a more equitable basis. The buyers of the grapes will be obliged to pay £2 a ton for the grapes within one month of delivery. It is obvious that there is a slight flaw in this bill in that connection, which the Minister intends to amend. If the bill is passed, both the grape-growers and the wine-makers will be convenienced. The second payment, which will fall which I can give in that direction will clue about the 30th June, may possibly be readily forthcoming. cause considerable hardship this year. If I understand the situation, the wine industry will face one of the major crises support the bill. This may seem to be a of its history when the harvest comes small matter to be engaging the attention around next year. The difficulties have of the House in view of the gigantic been somewhat diminished by heavy difficulties with which we are now confrosts which occurred some months ago in fronted, but it is an important matter the ""Wakefield district. the crop was lost in some localities. Mr Arohie Cameron. so; but the crop will be so heavy that, about next autumn, the Minister for Trade and Customs will be experiencing headaches of a kind that he is not accustomed to. If it is found that the conditions are too stringent and that, because of war conditions, the grape-growers will not be able to sell their product, there will be an unanswerable case for the Government to finance the purchase of the wine grapes if private buyers do not feel disposed to do so. One of the hardest blows that the Australian sweet wine industry has received for a long time was delivered by the British Government this year when it increased the duty on Australian wine from 4s. to 8s. a gallon, as against the so-called British wines, which are our greatest competitors. We can deal successfully with South African competition, but the other is more difficult. South Africa, by the way, has a very much better method of blending wine and maintaining types, and a better system of marketing in the United Kingdom, than we have. There is-too much of the old piratical catch-as-catch-can method practised by those selling Australian wines in Britain, and this makes necessary the regulations which some people find irksome. I hope the Government will succeed in inducing the Government of Great Britain to reduce the import duty on Australian wines. This bill deserves sympathetic treatment by the House, and I am sure that no other honourable member, will endorse the views expressed concerning the industry by the honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane). In the interests of the Australian wine industry, it is imperative that the growers should know how they stand, not only in respect to the next export season, but also in respect of the next five seasons. Any assistance none the less. While I admire the zeal Lane), and agree that the excesses to-",66,Honourable Members Oh Oh

239,Mr White (Balaclava) [10.3],"Iwhich he drew attention should he investigated, I believe that we should be temperate in our criticism and not cite the worse examples. The wine industry is one of the most important in South Australia. The bill now before the House is a replica of the one which I brought down in 1934. The wine bounty was originally introduced in 1924, when Mr S. M . Bruce was Prime Minister, and was primarily intended to help grape-growers. The wine industry has suffered many vicissitudes. The growers were, in some instances, settled on the land by the State Government, and were advised to grow doradillo grapes, as well as various varieties of wine Australia, wine-makers, co-operative and grapes. Difficulty was experienced in marketing the wine, and in 1933, in company with the then honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr H'awker) and the honourable member for Barker( Mr grapes apart from those used for the Archie Cameron), then a iState member, together with representatives of the industry and officers of the Customs Department, I visited the wine-growing districts of South Australia. I may interpose here that, in the same aeroplane in which Mr Hawker met his death, there were travelling three representatives of the wine industry, who certainly did not merit the criticism of the honourable member for Barton, but were good and eminent citizens and leaders in their industry. At the time of our visit the wine industry was near disaster. Sales had fallen off, and both the co-operative wineries, which were run by returned soldier growers, and the proprietary wineries were in difficulties. The wine bounty is not paid from general revenue, but from a fund created from the proceeds of an excise duty on fortifying spirit used in the manufacture of sweet wines. It is paid only upon wines exported. No bounty is paid on dry wines, which are the kind that ought to be more generally manufactured in Australia. The export of wine from Australia has been encouraged by the payment of a bounty out of this fund. Since 1934, exports of wines to Great Britain from Australia have steadily risen, until they exceeded those of all other countries, except Portugal. Unless the bounty is renewed the industry will slump. This year, there was a surplus of grapes, and but for a frost, which reduced production, the industry would have been in difficulties. It was also proposed that production of doradillo grapes should be limited, and plans were made in conjunction with the South Australian Government for allowing a large area to go out of production. It must be remembered that grapes are grown for the manufacture of dried fruits, as well as for the manufacture of wine; and the industries, are, to some degree, interlocked. Almost constant difficulty has been experienced in connection with the wine industry in Australia, which is now stable. As the bounty is not paid on wines sold within proprietary, were able to buy grapes at any prices they thought fit. It was then provided that wine-makers, who did not pay the fixed price, should keep export wine manufacture of wine for the home market. A fair price is fixed for grapes used for the manufacture of export wine3, and the growers are assured of a reasonable income. There is a tendency for production to outstrip sales, and in the district of Berri, where there is a co-operative winery, something like a million gallons of spirit accumulated at one time, so that special arrangements had to be made for its disposal. All these are difficulties that had to be grappled with at the time of my examination, and they a y again recur. The industry is m now on a more or less stable basis, but it should not be allowed to slump again. Although we have a big export trade in wines with the United Kingdom, more can be done. Our wines, in some instances, are not sold under Australian labels. When I visited the Australian pavilion at the Scottish exhibition in Glasgow last year, I saw that South African Dutch labels had been put on Australian wine bottles. That sort of thing should not be allowed to happen. It is very difficult to get Australian wines in restaurants, hotels or trains overseas; they just do not seem to' be available. The sale of Australian wines in Great Britain should be encouraged, and when I speak of expanding the market for our wines, I do not mean that we should try to force alcoholic drinks on the people. The evils .to which the honourable member for Barton referred do exist in large measure, but that is due to the selling of bad and adulterated wines andto insufficient supervision. We are not a wine-drinking people. If more wines were drunk here instead of beer and spirits, it would probably'be better for the community. The honourable member was astray in condemning the French, who are a winedrinking people. They, as a matter of fact, are bearing the brunt of this war, and by that I imply no criticism of the part played by the British. It so happens that, because of their situation, the French must bear the brunt of it.. They have all along been the realists who understoodthe Germans for what they are. We might with advantage learn a lesson from them in the use of wine. I believe that the wine industry in Australia should be encouraged and developed, and I say that as one who is probably as temperate as is the honourable member for Barton. I support this bill for the reasons I have put forward, and hope that it will be passed Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clauses1 to 10 agreed to.

No bounty shall be payable unless the Minister is satisfied that(a) the price paid or to be paid to the grower for any grapes used in the production of the wine or fortifying spirit contained in the fortified wine in respect of which bounty is claimed is not less than the minimum price, and the grower has received, in cash, a payment of two pounds per ton within one month of the delivery of tlie grapes to the manufacturer of the wine, or of the fortifying spirit contained in the fortified wine, and has received, or w ill receive, in cash, payment of the balance in f u l l not later than the prescribed date, or payment of the balance by four equal quarterly instalments the first of which is payable on or before the thirtieth day of June next following the date of delivery of the grapes.

The words proposed to' be omitted are rather indefinite, and, by a strict interpretation, would permit the growers to claim payment upon any day of the month. The wine-makers and the growers have requested that a specific day be inserted, so that both parties will know that payments are to be made on that particular day. Will the Minister say whether payments are to be made in cash? When I visited the wine-growing districts, I found that in places there was in existence what could be called a cart note currency. When the growers took the grapes to the winery, they were paid with a chit from the winemakers, and with this they paid their accounts, or borrowed money from the bank. are required to pay in cash.

It is regrettable that this bill falls far short of what is needed, and is typical of our failure to think well and act wisely in our own national interest. We are slow to make up our minds, and equally slow to recognize that we have the future to provide for and, as it now happens, a tremendous This bill is the outcome of a long agitation on the subject of shipbuilding in Australia, and the closing chapters of the history of this matter prior to the introduction of the bill were provided by the shipbuilding unions in refusing to effect repairs to ships built outside Australia which could reasonably have been built in this country. The basis upon which the scheme has been submitted to the Parliament appears to rest on a Tariff Board report submitted to the Government on the 7th May, 1936. Subsequent to that date, an independent inquiry was conducted by certain officers of the Customs Department. Their views have not been",69,Honourable Members Oh Oh

245,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [10.18].,"made known, to the Parliament and, therefore, are not available for endorsement or otherwise. Against the Tariff Board finding on this question, which finally resulted in this proposal, two outstanding criticisms will be advanced, namely, that the tonnage to he assisted hy means of the bounty is far too low, and that it is wrong to admit free of duty boilers, machinery and auxiliaries for use in ships in respect of which bounty will be paid. What the Government proposes to give on the one hand by the payment of the bounty it is taking away with the other by admitting these components free of duty. It is upon that basis that we criticize the bill in the hope that we shall be able to convince a sufficient number of honourable members to compel the Government to see the need for extending the bounty to cover ships of 5,000 tons and for maintaining the duty on boilers, machinery and other auxiliaries so as to encourage the construction of complete vessels in this country. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr on which a special rate of 25 John Lawson), in introducing this bill, dealt with various phases of the Tariff Board's report. I propose to refer to some aspects of the report and to offer reasonable comment upon the board's findings. In its report of the 7th May, 1936, the Tariff Board statedWhile the board is convinced that the continuance of tlie duties on imported vessels is not in the best interests of the community, it is, nevertheless, convinced that an effort should he made to support the ship-builders in Australia, particularly in the construction of smaller craft. In arriving at this conclusion, the board apparently had' in mind the removal of the 37J per cent. British preferential tariff now applicable to vessels built in Great Britain. wards endorsed by -the second-reading speech of the Minister. In the course of his speech, the honourable gentleman said that the tariff on vessels up to 500 gross tons had failed to encourage the building of vessels of that tonnage in Australia. This only goes to 3how the callous indifference of the shipping companies in Australia to their obligation at least to provide employment for the workers of a country which give them an assured and healthy income each year. In fact, their actions in continuing to build their vessels overseas, and to pay the duty of 37-J Mr Beasley. per cent, rather than construct their vessels locally, shows the degree of their contempt for the welfare of the local industries. We have felt all along the need for some compulsion to force the shipping companies to recognize what we -believe are their simple obligations in this matter. , The removal of the duty and the substitution of a bounty of £12 10s. a ton absolves the shipowners from the payment of the duty to the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth, and at the same time provides no guarantee that by the substitution of the bounty for the tariff the shipowners will revise their present policy of building their vessels overseas. This is greatly emphasized by a perusal of Australia's Overseas Trade and Customs and Excise Revenue, 1937-38, Bulletin. Wo. 35. Under item 1435, ""Vessels including all fittings imported therewith"", it is shown that dredge plant, &c, to the value of £1,159, per cent. British preferential tariff for this class of vessel was paid,, amounted to £221 in 1937-38. Under item 1437, ""Other Vessels Dutiable "", page 545, it is shown that on one vessel valued at £17,098, imported from China, duty at 15 per cent, general tariff of £2,565 was paid in 1937-38. Item 1438, ""Other Vessels Free"", page 545, has application to other vessels in excess of the present operative tariff, that is vessels exceeding 500 gross tons. These vessels or their parts imported into Australia in 1937-38, were valued at £1,580,460, and were admitted free, under the general and preferential tariffs, and preferential by-laws, or because they were 1 for use by the Commonwealth GovernThis belief was afterment. It will be readily observed from the foregoing that under the proposals of the Tariff Board which have been accepted by the Government, the Government will in future, under these new proposals, surrender all revenues previously collected under items 1435 and 1437, in addition to the revenue already lost under item 1438. This has a particular significance to .item 1437, as it is understood that the Newcastle and Hunter River Steamship Company are now building a vessel in China on which a duty of 15 per cent, would be paid under this item. I have not been able to ascertain whether, of the boilermaking section, by reason of under the new proposals, this or any other the fact that many of the fitments and vessel will in the future be admitted free. component parts involved in fitting out a I have been informed that the 15 per ship are governed by the same circumn .ent. general tariff may apply according stances as apply to the steel sections; they to compliance with certain conditions. are a standard product of many of the What would these conditions be is an imengineering companies. portant point for determination?

As an illustration, the Board has calculated on a representative cargo vessel of 700 would be approximately £20 per ton. In the opinion of the board this figure is would be 70 per cent, for hull, superstructure and other requirements; the balance, 30 per cent., would cover the cost of the boilers, main engines and other auxiliaries. would apply generally to vessels of any gross tonnage. ported by the board's own figures in the example quoted by it in tbe report, which is as follows:Typical cargo vessels in the range up to 1,500 tons would cost at the port of clearance in the United Kingdom from £25 to £35 per ton gross. Thirty pound per ton gross would represent a reasonable average export price .at United Kingdom ports. Again taking the -example of the 700-ton vessel, the export price The importation of machinery and auxiwould be approximately £21,000. Included in that price would he approximately £6,000 worth of machinery, &c, which it is suggested -should be admissible free of duty to the Australian ship-builders. The balance of the vessel would be worth approximately £15,000, or approximately £2] per ton. The figures of the board's own example are 71 per cent, hull superstructure and 29 per cent, boilers, main engines and auxiliaries, respectively, for the sections mentioned, and approximate my own estimate. If these estimated percentages are applied to the bounty of £12 10s. a ton recommended by the board, the approximate increase of the bounty as the result of the whole vessel being built in Australia would be £4 a ton, and not £7 10s. a ton, as indicated by the board, or a total bounty of £16 10s. a ton. My estimate is approximately 46 per cent, of the cost a ton for a finished vessel built in Great Britain. From my information, there has been great difficulty for some time in securing vessels at less than £35 a ton, and, in view of the international position, fro m £38 to £40 would be about the present price a ton in Great Britain. Confirmation of this estimate is contained in the following news item cabled from London on the 28th October, 1939, and appearing in the Sunday Sun on the 29th October, 1939 :In three months the first ship of Britain's special war cargo fleet will be launched, and after that the shipyards will turn out ships like motor cars.

The-Tariff Board's report continuesAfter giving the question the fullest consideration, the board is satisfied that the Australian ship-builders should be permitted These percentages the right to import free of duty from the United Kingdom the engines, boilers, and This estimate is supauxiliaries required for inclusion in. vessels built by them under bounty. Free admission of these items would reduce the cost of the loyally-constructed vessel and would, in many instances, lower the amount of the bounty necessary to afigure the board will support. It is worthy of mention that a large percentage of the auxiliaries and special fittings, if not imported under by-law, would be manufactured by the ship-builders themselves, and not by outside engineers. liaries duty free for installation in the vessels to be built in Australia under the proposals directly affects the employment of engineers and allied tradesmen, and is viewed with apprehension by the unions covering these callings, particularly because opportunities for employment of tfheir members are restricted, as they would be the principal men employed in the manufacture of the machinery and auxiliaries. The machinery and other auxiliaries installed in any vessel comprise the following essentials:Main enginesReciprocating turbine or diesel. The first two named can and have been efficiently manufactured in Australia at a reasonable costDiesel engines. Diesel engines of the required brake horse-power for vessels of any tonnage mentioned in the board's report have not been manufactured in Australia. Only in recent years has this form of propulsion gained general favour in Great Britain. The shipping companies of Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Holland have favoured diesel engines for many years, because of their lower running cost, with the consequence that the engineering and ship-building companies of those countries have experimented with their use to such a degree that they have momentarily outstripped other countries as to cost, &c Auxiliary enginesElectric light, fan, steering and turning and reversing engines. technical engineering problem to any of the well-known and reputable engineering companies in Australia. If the main ""engines were of the reciprocating type and imported, the unit would embody the turning and reversing enginesPumpsCirculating, general service, sanitary, oil structed overseas for Australian comfuel, boiler feed pumps. There are companies in Australia that specialize in the manufacture of pumps of this type. These pumps are extensively installed throughout Australia, and the companies, if given the opportunity., would surprise the Tariff Board as to their capacity to manufacture at reasonable cost as compared with overseas prices for similar plant. Of course, it must be understood that the oil-feed pump is only necessary where the* heating agent adopted on the boilers for steam-raising purposes is oil fuel instead of coalBoiler feed pump. This is generally of the Weir type, owing to world-wide reputation as an ideal auxiliary for this purpose, although in the "" E "" and "" D "" class vessels built from 1918 to 1922, under the ship-building programme of that period, Australian manufactured pumps were installed in lieu of the Weir pump for the boiler-feed service, and from my knowledge they gave efficient service. Many and varied types of condensers have been built in Australia over many years, for other phases of industry requiring this equipment, and their manufacture for installation in any class of vessel presents no difficulties to engineering companies. My remarks on condensers would have a similar application to distillers, evaporators, oil coolers, heaters and filters. The engineering companies specializing in ventilating machinery would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate to the Tariff Board and the Government their capabilities and the efficiency of their plants installed in other spheres of industry requiring ventilation plants. Winches, windlasses and ash hoists installed in the "" E "" and "" D "" class cargo vessels were manufactured in Australia and could again be made here with no difficulty. In his second-reading speech the Minister stated that the scheme would apply toThe payment of a bounty on iron or steel vessels (other than war vessels) over 100 tons but not exceeding 1,500 tons, gross register. It would appear that by the fixation of the l i m it of the application of the bounty at 1,500 gross tons, the Tariff Board was guided by the number of vessels conpanies and/or governments from 1919 to 1937.

Such rate to be gradually reduced so 4 that on vessels of 1,500 tons gross register 4 the rate would be £10 per ton. 1 I consider that the rate of the bounty i is not sufficient to accomplish the objeci tive desired by the Government. To em10 phasize this point, a typical case would perhaps illustrate the point to better advantage. As near as we can ascertain, the crew, which is no small item. A vessel of this tonnage built in Australia The Government's proposal is that the Based on mum tonnage to which the bounty would In regard to the item.Machinery, boilers and auxiliaries required in the construction in Australia of vessels eligible for bounty to be admitted free of duty from the United Kingdom and at 15 per cent, from foreign sourcesit may be argued that this duty is sufficient at the present time to secure the objective of the Government, as great difficulty will be experienced in securing Apart from the running this equipment while the present European upheaval exists. point out, however, that the United States of America is a neutral nation and its ability to supply this essential equiptically all naval vessels built in Australia ment is in no way restricted as it is a favoured nation. The same argument can logically be applied to the building of a complete vessel. The shipping companies could refuse to build any further vessels until the international dispute is settled, but this would not further the objective of the ship-building scheme as designed by the Government. There is no guarantee that the present international position will last beyond the three years, at the end of which the present proposals will be reviewed, and should the shipping companies apply the policy I have indicated, the Tariff Board and the Government would be in a similar position to that which existed on the 7th May, 1936"", and which still exists. The boilers for vessels up to the gross tonnage suggested by the engineering unions can be efficiently and expeditiously fact that there is nothing to indicate that manufactured at a reasonable cost by the larger engineering companies in Australia, such-as Thompson, Castlemainc, Victoria; Mort's Dock, Balmain, New South Wales; Babcock and Wilcox, Regent's Park, New South Wales; Cockatoo Dock and Engineering Company, Sydney, New South Wales; Clyde Engineering Company, Clyde, New South Wales; Walkers Limited, Maryborough, Queensland; and should not be admitted free of duty. Taking into consideration the question of exchange, a reasonable duty to impose would be 25 per cent. British preferential tariff, and 42^ per cent, general tariff. Regarding the main engines only, the admission of steam engines, turbines or permitted same duty of 25 per cent. British preferential tariff and 42£ per cent, general tariff as applied to the boilers should ' apply These engines, apart from the turbines, present no technical or engineering problems to Thompson's, Oastlemaine, Victoria; Mort's Dock, Balmain, New South Wales; Cockatoo Dock and Engineering Company, Sydney, New South Wales; I would Clyde Engineering Company, Clyde, New South Wales; Walkers Limited, Maryborough, Queensland. Turbines for prachave been manufactured by the Cockatoo Dock and Engineering Company, which could, without any serious difficulty,, supply this type of propulsion for any vessel to the specification required. The manufacture of diesel propulsion engines of the required brake horse-power has never been undertaken in this country. In all the circumstances, no objection at tlie present time could be raised to their admission duty free (British preferential tariff), but I consider that the 15 per cent, general tariff should be raised to 25 per cent. The Minister said that the duties on vessels of the type eligible for the bounty would be fixed at free British preferential, and 15s. general tariff. What the Government hopes to achieve by the substitution of this duty for the current duty is difficult to understand, in the light of the these people will be forced to build ships in Australia. Commenting further on this aspect of the contemplated legislation, even at the risk of becoming a false prophet, I am convinced that, if this be done, shipbuilding in Australia will remain in the doldrums, a state from which the Minister for Trade and Customs is so anxious to l if t the industry. What is really achieved is that the Government will lose revenue to the extent of 374 per cent, ad valorem on vessels built in Great Britain, and will obtain only 15 per cent, ad valorem on vessels built elsewhere, which would include Hong Kong, where the Newcastle and Hunter River Steamship Company recently had a vessel built; that is, if the rate is to be applied in all cases. reciprocating, should not be With the removal of the duty in respect free of duty, and the of British vessels, and the conditional application of only 15 per cent, duty in respect of foreign vessels, the Government has disarmed itself of any weapon to to this equipment. enforce a policy of ship-building in Australia, thereby providing employment for the training of artisans in secondary industries, so that they may also be of assistance to the primary industries of Australia, to whom the marine transport question is an important matter. The Minister further statedI t is quite obvious that the present method of assistance, which provides for protective duties only on vessels up to 500 gross .tons register, has not succeeded in establishing ship-building on a satisfactory footing. Very few vessels within the protective duty range have been built in Australia within recent years, and it is a long time since any commercial vessels exceeding 500 tons register have been built here. If the present duties have failed to obtain the objective, how can the Minister, or the Government, expect to achieve the desired result by the removal of the duty in one instance, and the lowering of duty in the second instance, unless it is based on the assumption that by the sacrifice of a "" mackerel "" a "" whale "" may be caught? The fishing and whaling industries are now conducted upon a more modern basis with the aid of trawling nets and harpoon guns. Shipping companies are not potential philanthropists and they conduct their business, not on the basis of ancient proverbs, but on a sound business basis as a means to secure the maximum income for the minimum expenditure. The Minister should act in accordance with this precept by retaining, irrespective of the bounty, the 37^ tariff and at least tariff, if he is not prepared to increase the present duties to enforce the shipping companies to comply with the contemplated ship-building proposals of the Government. The Minister went on to sayThe matter to be reviewed by the Tariff Board after the bounty has been in operation for a period of three years. Why is it so necessary to fix a minimum of three years before the matter can be reviewed? sometimes take place overnight. an affirmative answer is the correct one to-day, a. negative answer may well be the correct one to-morrow. should be subject to review before three years if considered changed set of circumstances. since the Minister introduced his measure, circumstances have changed and, in view of what is happening on the other side of the world and the almost daily loss of British tonnage, a more radical programme may yet be necessary. Mr Beasley. The Minister proceededThe variation to which I have referred is in respect of machinery, boilers and auxiliaries. The Government proposes that, subject to consultation with the United Kingdom Government, such equipment should be admitted free, of duty irrespective of the country of origin, whereas the board recommends admission at rates of free (British preferential t a r if f) 15 per cent, (general t a r if f ) . I may mention that the Government's proposal with respect to this equipment is the same as that adopted by the United Kingdom Government in connection with its scheme of assistance to shipping. That statement does not coincide with the following leading article in The Marine Engineer. Details of the Government plan to assist British shipping and shipbuilding are given in a White Paper, and are incorporated in the British Shipping (Assistance) B ill , which passed its second reading on the 19th July, 1939. The general outlines of the Government's intentions were set Outin a statement hy Mr Oliver Stanley on the 28th March, the terms of which we have previously published. The whole scheme is directed to helping the shipping industry to operate with maximum efficiency, and shipowners to find the wherewithal to maintain their fleets, both n-s to size and age, in a thoroughly fit state. It is the shipowners who w ill receive direct financial aid. To that extent .the benefit to shipbuilders is indirect, but no less effective present duty of for that. The Government have been at pains per cent. British preferential to ensure that the construction of new cargo vessels required for British shipping trades per cent, general will not be postponed on account of limited financial resources or current shipbuilding costs. The response to the scheme was immediate, as witnessthe fact that as a result of the promise that tonnage ordered as from the l l t h Apri l would be considered for inclusion in the scheme of shipbuilding grants, by the 28th April, preliminary notifications covering about 190 vessels, aggregating 'over 850,000 gross tons, had been received by the Board of Trade, the majority of which were reported to have been already ordered. Of these about 150 were tramp ships and 40 were cargo liners. Revolutionary changes Assistance to shipowners for shipbuilding is to be both by way of loans and grants. It is Where proposed that a total sum not exceeding £10,000,000 should be made available for shipbuilding loan in respect of the building of new cargo vessels ordered after the 28th The matter March, 1939, and begun within two years of the passing of the act. These loans will be necessary by a available for the building of cargo liners, and Even tramp ships, with the exception of (<t) vessels with an amount of refrigerated space exceeding 80.000 cubic feet or 10 per cent, of the considerably, total space available for cargo, whichever is the greater, and (6) vessels constructed or adopted for the carriage of more than twelve passengers. Loans will not be made in respect of tankers, fishing vessels, or tugs, lighters, and similar craft. Shipbuilding grants will liKewisu not be made for vessels coming under category (d) or ( 6 ) , and w ill not apply to tankers or fishing vessels. A sum of £2,500,000 is to be set aside for shipbuilding grants, which w ill be spread over five years, and which will be in respect of the building of new cargo vessels ordered after the 28th March, 1939, and completed not later tlian the 31st December, 1941. grant payable in respect of each vessel will not exceed rates fixed according to certain classifications, and if the total amount of the initial grants payable to all ships to be assisted exceeded £500,000, the rates would be proportionately reduced so that the total amount payable :is nearly as possible equalled £500,000. These rates, it may be recalled, differentiate between the different fuels which the ships are constructed to burn, and are as follows:Per gross ton. Coal-burning or dual fired cargo liners Other cargo liners Coal-burning or dual tramip ships Other tramp ships . . The first grant will be made as soon as practicable after the 31st March, 1940. or the date of completion of the vessel, whichever is the later, and subsequent grants w ill be made after the 31st December for each of the years 1941-44. ditional on the average level of freights not rising to a point at which the Board of Trade would consider them unnecessary. Moreover any grants payable to a shipowner who is in receipt nf assistance under the shipbuilding loans scheme, would not be remitted to him, but applied in reduction of the loan. the shipbuilding point of view an important provision in the bill is tlie appointment of a joint committee representing shipowners and shipbuilders to consider the possibility of devising means for securing in the future the more regular ordering of new tonnage. Most will agree that this problem is a hard nut to crack, but' a satisfactory solution towards this end would be very much welcomed by the shipbuilding industry. Of dissatisfaction expressed over the ,bill, it is difficult to understand the omission of shipbuilding grants for vessels employed in the home trade. Coastal tramps operate in competition with foreign vessels, and high shipbuilding costs due to armament activity affect small ship construction equally with vessels of larger tonnage. of decp-sca ships of under 3,500 tons gross, special allowances are to be made in the scale of tramp shipping subsidies (which are not applicable to the home trade) owing to the "" grcnter costs of building and operation of small vessels"". It can be expected that the £10,000,000 to be made available for the grant of assistance to liner companies, whose services are endangered by foreign subsidized competition, will materially assist liner tonnage replacement, although the forms of assistance have yet to be worked out. British liner trades in the East are among those most urgently in need of new tonnage. Another factor affecting shipbuilding, which may yet arise in a more acute form, is the replacement of passenger liner tonnage by tlie Canadian-Australasian and other lines. It may be a long time before the present high cost of shipbuilding, said to be 25 to 30 per cent, above what is considered practicable, is brought down to a more normal level. MeanThe initial while the urgency of replacement will become greater rather than less.

These figures show that Great Britain required in the construction of vessels on sold to foreign owners 13.7 per cent, of her total tonnage and purchased only 4 per cent, which bounty will be paid. This criticism from foreign builders, an advantage in her is levelled on the ground that the free (Great Britain) favour of 0.7 per cent. This admission of such equipment w ill not confirms the analysis and statement made result in additional employment being in regard to foreign engineering and shipbuilding companies extensive diesel engiven in the appropriate industries. Both gine experience had given them a momentary the Government and the T a r i ff Board advantage over British companies. Tlie Minister's remarks may apply in some small degree to shipping companies which are receiving a subsidy in consequence of having engined their vessels with foreign-manufactured main diesel engines and diesel auxiliaries for the reasons already set out. They could apply only to the operation of the general tariff, as it would not be sensible to import boilers, engines, or auxiliaries into a country where they are being manufactured. A practical comment on turbine and industries must result from a building reciprocating engines may be helpful to construction programme. emphasize this point.

In his second-reading speech the the Government had been was in respect of its machinery and boilers and auxiliaries are f u l l y seized of this fact in principle, but the important consideration that cannot be avoided is that, if shipowners are to be induced to purchase vessels of local construction, and if freight rates are to be kept within reasonable limits, costs must be kept as low as possible. The decision to admit this equipment free of duty cannot result in the loss of employment in the boiler-making and engineering industries for the reason that vessels required by Australian shipowners are at present purchased overseas. Some additional employment in the engineering The Minister in his statement and auxiliaries, duty free, on the ground that no addistated that the admission of the boilers, machinery, and auxiliaries, duty free, machinery because this equipment was not previously except could not eradicate a malady by perand 65 per cent, experience and errors of the past. ""What My reason for saying this is I am concerned with, and apprehensive of employment for apprentices who entered the engineering trade prior to January, 1936, and who will complete their apprenticeship at the end of this year, or during 1940; also, those apprentices who have entered the trade since 1937. The following figures obtained from the Apprenticeship Council, of New South Wales, show the influx of appren-, tices into the engineering trade during the years mentioned:1st 1st January 1st January 1st January According to the Minister for Labour and Industry in New South Wales, the number of apprentices in the engineering trade covered by the Federal Metal Trades Award and the Engineers State. Award, exclusive of those in the Railway, Tramway, and Road Transport Services, of New South Wales, at the 31st August, 1939, was 3,465, covering all classifications in the engineering trade. The number of apprentices at the same date in the other sections of the metal trades was as follows:Boiler-making Electrical trade Moulding .. Sheet metal .. 189 [Leave to continue given.] This gives a total of 1,689, compared with 3,465 in the engineering trade. These figures show that there are two apprentices in the engineering trade to one in the other four combined sections of the metal trade. Under the Government's proposals, the hull and superstructure of a vessel constructed in Australia would make available to the boilermaking trade approximately 70 per cent, of the work. remaining 30 per cent, of the work, covering machinery and auxiliaries, would still be done overseas. If this work could also be clone here, it would help, to some degree, to provide a future avenue of employment in the engineering trade, which has the greatest preponderance of apprentices, as shown by the official figures I have given. The Minister admits the importance of the adverse comment on his proposal, but then proceeds to defend the principle by asserting that it is essential that the costs in protecting the Australian shipping of construction shall be kept within companies from a post-war intrusion upon reasonable limits to induce the shiptheir preserves by British or foreign [28] owners to build their vessels locally. If this, benevolent attitude was adopted as a guiding principle in the drafting of legislation that affected the workers' interests, one could applaud the reasonableness of the Government's point of view, but, honestly, such has not been the experience of the workers under the legislation of recent years. After examining the available financial statements of the shipping companies, I January to 31st December, 193(5 . . 451 to 31st December, 1937 . . 698 am at a loss to understand why it should to 31st December, 1938 . . 1049 be necessary to admit the boilers, machito 30th September, 1939 . . 704 nery and auxiliaries as an added inducement to the companies to have their »..ssels built in Australia. My financial analysis of the progress of the shipping companies has not been made so as to present my submission in a more favorable aspect, for the figures are sufficiently removed from the past, post and the present pre-war trading period as not to embrace any abnormal trading cycle. I do not desire to delay honourable members with numerous figures. A vast fund of information on this subject may be ob-; tained by reference to the Wild Cat. 410 Monthly from May, 1938, to June, 064 1939, in respect of Burns, Philp. .. .. 426 Limited; April, 1939, in respect of Huddart, Parker Limited; December, 1938, in respect of The Melbourne Steamship Company Limited; October, 1938, in respect of The Adelaide Steamship Company Limited, and the Port Jackson and Manly Steamship Company Limited; May, 1938, in respect of the Illawarra and South Coast Steam Navigation Company Limited; August; 1938, in respect of the North Coast Steam Navigation Company Limited; and The\ March, 1939, in respect of Sydney Ferries Limited. Even a brief examination of the financial position of some of the principal shipping companies shows their ability to make great progress in this country whatever their alleged disabilities may be, or special pleading by the Government, for they have distributed vast profits by dividends, bonus shares and the many processes known to the commercial world to-day. One factor that has been instrumental shipping, has been the provisions of Sections 248 to 293A of Part VI . of.the Navigation Act, which were proclaimed on the 1st July, 1921. The purport of these sections is to prohibit trading on the Australian coast by British and foreign vessels to the detriment of the Australian shipownei's. Unless the Government amends its proposals, as I have suggested, I cannot see any hope that Australia wiU develop into a self-reliant British dominion, which will provide employment and experience for potential engineering tradesmen in the ship-building industry. I am not at all impressed by the argument advanced by the Minister that in the final consideration of this matter costs are the only factor, and that the Government's scheme is a real contribution to this industry. I consider that a moral responsibility rests upon many of the big industrial enterprises of this country to build their ships here. In the past they have been assisted by both Commonwealth and State Governments. The Commonwealth Government has assisted by means of bounties, duties and the like, and the State Governments have assisted by granting freight concessions on the railways and in other very generous ways. The BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, in particular, which has been permitted to exploit the mineral resources of this country, and which has received substantial aid from various governments from time to time, particularly in respect of the establishment of the iron and steel industry, should have been prepared to reciprocate when it had the opportunity; but it failed to do so. I well remember that about three years ago when the company required two vessels to assist in the transport of its raw materials and finished products, it declined to have them built in Australia, and obtained them from abroad, justifying itself by arguing that the cost was less 12,000 miles away than it would have been in Australia. This, to my mind, was'a very poor argument coming from a company for which Australia-had done so much. Broken Hill Limited have been but for government in no circumstances will they be admitted assistance in years gone by? Mr Beasley. company had the opportunity to assist the ship-building industry of this country it should have done so. We shall not be able to establish a flourishing ship-building industry until some continuity of operations can be assured. Given encouragement, it would be-possible for us to build not only merchant ships, but also naval vessels of any class and design. The work on both classes of construction is somewhat similar. Blue prints are prepared and patterns made, to which skilled artisans can work. We ought to be training men for shipbuilding, not only for commercial purposes, but also for defence requirements. While we, naturally, welcome the short, step which the Government has now taken, we feel that it should be going much farther. After all, the assistance now being provided is on a niggardly basis. We feel resentful that the Government is only prepared to extend assistance in respect of the building of vessels not exceeding 1,500 tons gross. That is only tinkering with the matter. Assistance should he available for the construction of vessels of up to 5,000 tons. At the very least the Government should be prepared to extend the proposal now and grant assistance in respect of all such vessels up to at least their first 1,500 tons, no matter what their total tonnage may be. I sincerely hope that that will be done. We are particularly disappointed by the removal of the duty on engines, boilers and auxiliaries. This class of work can and should be done in Australia. We have the plant and the men available for the purpose. I hope that before this measure is passed we shall be able, with the help of some honourable members opposite who are also interested in the development of the shipbuilding industry, to induce the Government to liberalize its policy at least to the extent that assistance will be provided for the construe^ tion of vessels of up to 5,000 tons; if not altogether, at any rate for their first 1,500 tons. Finally, we also hope that the Gowould the vernment's proposal in regard to boilers, Proprietary Company engines and auxiliaries will be varied and duty free.",78,Second Beading

249,Mr Beasley,"Quite so. When thehave always believed in the development of the shipbuilding industry of Australia and am responsible for the Tariff Board inquiries and the Customs inquiry being made so that this industry might be assisted. In many ways, this industry could be made of great assistance for migration and development. were properly established here, many artisans from the Clyde and other British shipbuilding centres would be prepared to settle in this country. On two occasions at least this industry has been the subject of very close investigation. The Tariff Board has been, particularly thorough. While I appreciate what the Government is now proposing to do, I should like to see more effective action taken. Obviously it is not possible to provide a bounty for the construction of very heavy ships, for it would make the cost prohibitive, and this would react adversely on the primary producers whose goods have to be transported by ship to overseas markets. But the bounty-cum-duty basis of assistance could well be extended. Such action could have been taken even before the war occurred, but now it becomes more imperative in my opinion, because, owing to the heavy losses at sea, there will undoubtedly be a shortage of merchant ships in the years ahead of us. When air raids really begin, it is quite feasible that the docks and shipyards of Britain will be attacked as well as its shipping at sea. If the shipyards suffer, Britain will have difficulty in replacing ships, although it is the greatest shipbuilding nation, in the world to-day. It is in this respect that we in Australia can help. A few years ago, it seemed impossible that we could take any important part in the construction of aircraft; now, just as we are now helping the Empire in that respect, so we should be able to help in the direction of building ships here in safety, whereas in Great Britain they will, during the next few years, be built under great diffiadmitted free, under by-law if necessary, culties. The Government should examine this matter again in the light of the new situation which has arisen. These provisions were drawn up ju3t prior to the war. The rate of bounty is fixed at £.12 10s. a. ton on ships of more than 100 tons, but less than 750 tons, and it declines progressively until it becomes £10 a ton on ships exceeding 1,350 tons, but not exceeding 1,500 tons. This bounty will encourage the building of small vessels only, but Australia can build much bigger ships than are provided for here. We have done it before, and the Government should encourage it to be done It it again, as it could be at little extra cost. Instead of paying the bounty on ships of not more than 1,500 tons, the Government should pay it on the first 1,500 tons of every ship built. Then the bounty would he payable, not only on ferries and small coastal craft, but also on ships up to 10,000 tons or more. Some time ago, I asked the Government to consider that scheme, and to put it in this bill. I am disappointed that it has not been done. The Government, it is true, has given some recognition to the claims of the industry, but the assistance should have been on a more generous basis. It is proposed to admit boilers and machinery free because tlie British tariff admits them free to Britain. I believe, however, that the Government should protect the machinery manufacturing industry in Australia.. A duty should be imposed on boilers and machinery, but, where necessary, they could be admitted duty free under by-law. Last year, I visited the shipyards of Harland and Wolff, in Belfast, the biggest shipbuilding firm m the world, and learned that they import hardly any machinery, making most of their own. The truth is that, whilst boilers and machinery may be imported free into Great Britain, it is not often done. It would be a very rare thing for a turbine to be imported. The Australian machinery-manufacturing industry should be protected so that it may expand side by side with the shipbuilding industry. It would not be satisfactory merely to build the hulls in Australia, while the boilers and machinery have to be imported. Only machinery which cannot be made in Australia should be and the by-laws could be amended where necessary to make this workable. We should not retard the development of the Australian machinery-manufacturing industry by allowing all marine machinery to be admitted free. While I applaud the Government for having at last",81,Second Beading
250,Mr White (Balaclava) [11.29],"Iextended a measure of assistance to the shipbuilding industry, I ask that the suggestions P have put forward be considered. The proposals of the Government for the assistance to the shipbuilding industry do not come up to expectations, particularly in view of the importance of this industry to defence, and the further development of the economic resources of the Commonwealth. Assistance is limited to builders of vessels between 100 and 1,500 tons gross register-betwee n an extra powerful tugboat and the smallest of vessels operating on our coast. The Government proposes to expend £50,000 a. year for three years as an experiment to assist shipbuilders. I believe that the proposals are totally inadequate. Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr flooding of Australia with cheap foreign John Lawson) show that the demand for small vessels is falling. Particularly was this noticeable in the year 1938. Only four out of thirteen imported vessels were under 1,500 tons gross. This is due to the increased volume of interstate trade, and more economical working of larger ships; but, even if the demand were growing for small ships, .the following figures will give some idea of the paucity of the Government's assistance. The cost of a steamship would depend largely upon itsequipment, design and classification. The requirements of a ship of 1,250 tons capacity would be approximately as follows:550 tons of steel. 100 tons of woodwork, fittings, paint, &c. 155 tons of machinery. Approximate costRa w materials Direct and indirect labour of construction, only from above materials, and salaries Administration expenses Tbe Government proposes to subsidize this to the extent of about £15,625, so that after nine ships of this size had been built the bounty of £150,000 over the three years would be exhausted. The cost of machinery and plant for the building of ships is high, and prospective shipbuilders cannot be expected to go to this expense with a falling off in demand for smaller ships, and such limited financial assistance for the building of nine small vessels. The further proposal by the Government to remove the present tariff on imported machinery, boilers, &c, necessary for ship construction is even more serious and is to be strongly condemned. The present tariff rates on all machinery, &c, are 33 per cent., plus 5 per cent, primage duty, from the United Kingdom and 65 per cent., plus 10 per cent, primage, from foreign countries. The value of 1 machinery, boilers and other fittings is about 30 per cent, of the total cost of the ship, and would give work to a large number of mechanics and artisans in their construction. The removal of this tariff, which has assisted in the establishment of our mechanical, engineering and boiler Figures supplied by the shops, would open wide the door for the articles to the detriment of Australian workmen and manufacturers. This will more than outweigh the benefit of the bounty proposals. In addition, if this work is done overseas, it will be impossible to train skilled technicians in engineering in preparation for an emergency. In view of the issues involved, defence, the relief of unemployment, openings for our youth and further development of Australia, it is considered that far greater assistance should be given by the Government. The measures taken to establish the galvanized sheet plate works of John Lysaght (Australia) Limited, could be adopted without any extra cost to the Government. Total bounties of £ £469,061 were paid, and a tariff was im. . 14,000 posed which. raised altogether £1,040,-623. A similar policy adopted now by the present Government would place the ship. . 28,000 and . incidental building industry on a firm basis, lead.. .. 8,000 ing to greater stability in the whole of our national life. 50,000 Australia has been pre-eminently, in the past, a country which made its living by exporting primary produce and importing manufactured articles in exchange. Since federation, under the shelter of fostering tariffs, our manufacturing industries have multiplied and increased, but, broadly speaking, the situation is very largely the spme to-day as it was yesterday. Australia is still",82,Second Beading
251,Mr Watkins (Newcastle) [11.36],"largely dependent upon its mercantile shipping for the transport of its products to overseas markets, and, for its intra and interstate trade. To-day, Austra.ia's reliance upon its mercantile shipping has been greatly increased due to the war, and its position as a supplier of products to the United Kingdom. I draw reference to the British Government's decision to purchase our wool clip, and I assume similar decisions will he made in relation to wheat and other primary products. To fulfil our contracts, there must be an increase of mercantile shipping, as it is reported that the tonnage available to-day is smaller than the tonnage of 1914-18. Added to tbe necessity for increased transportation, an augmented mercantile fleet is essential as an auxiliary to our naval strength. It is necessary for Australia to develop its mercantile shipbuilding industry, so as to meet the demand which must arise from Australia's position as an exporting nation, and from the part it is playing in this war. As to the methods of developing the shipbuilding industry, it appears that the first factor is to maintain continuity of shipbuilding. I do not believe that such continuity will be derived from private enterprise; but reasonable continuity could be guaranteed by the building of a Commonwealtli mercantile fleet. Australia is capable of building vessels 1932 to 1938 inclusive:up to 10,000 tons, and possibly more. This is substantiated hy the SS. Ferndale and the SS. Fordsdale, two 10,000 tons refrigeration vessels, which were constructed in Australian shipyards. Australia is favourably placed in comparison with overseas shipyards in regard to costs. It is reported that steel can be produced in Australia at prices which are 25 per '-nut. under British prices. This is due very largely to the fact that the BrokenH ill Proprietary"" Company Limited is advantageously placed in regard to the supply of raw materials and other essentials, in that it has its own coal mines, and its own iron ore deposits and deposits of fluxing materials. This steel industry is more self-contained than probably any o'her steel manufacturing concern in the world. At this stage, I draw attention to a report which appeared in the Sydney Sun on the l l t h September last, stating that an increase of freight rates by 25 per cent, would apply forthwith on all vessels sailing from Australia. Doubt'.ess, honourable members are aware that r jch skyrocketing freight charges will add tremendously to the cost of shipping Australia's products to the United Kingdom. This sljows how foolish was the action of the Nationalist Government in disposing of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers which saved this country in inward and outward freights approximately £18,000,000. There is urgent necessity for the development of the shipbuilding industry in Australia. An essential contributing factor for the development of the industrv is the continuity of orders, and reasonable continuity of orders could be guaranteed by the introduction by tlie Government of a wellplanned programme for the building of a Commonwealth mercantile fleet. The construction of such a fleet would not only increase employment in this country, but also save this country millions of pounds in excess freight rates.

W it h respect, however, to vessels of 5.000 tons and under which have been im% £ £ £ ported into Australia, from 1919 to 1937, the 5 16.919 gross tonnage was 137,238 or an approximate 8 70,407 322,952 300,000 yearly average of 7,223 gross tons. If the above is the ease would it be possible for you to move that:( i) The Federal Government pay a bounty of 5,000 gross tons or under. ( i i) Tho bounty to be paid up to a limi t of 1,500 tons. ( i i i ) The rate to be £12 10s. on the first 750 tons and to be gradually reduced so that when 1,500 tons was reached the rate would be £10 per ton. This, in effect, wouldmean that the bounty would lie paid on vessels of 1,500 gross register or under, at the rate set out in the Government's proposal and vessels up to 5,000 tons would be subsidized up to the same amount as vessels of 1,500 tons, or, put another way, a vessel of 5,000 tons would be subsidized at a rate pei< ton on 5,000 tons of approximately l-3rd the rate on a vessel of 1.500 tons. I think this will be of considerable assistance in influencing shipowners to have vessels up to 5,000 tons built here. Certain objections may be raised against this suggestion but 1 send it along for your consideration. This proposal should have been brought down years ago. The need for it is amply demonstrated hy the statement of the Prime Minister that the Government is worried at the moment by the' upward trend of freight rates. It is not too lale even now to get on with the job. I welcome the bill, but I regret that it does not go f a r enough to provide continuity of employment, or to encourage the construction of large ships in this country. Many of the small vessels which would be covered by this bill are no longer being constructed. I trust that the Minister w ill give due consideration to our representations on behalf of this important industry. support the bill, though I regret that it does not go far enough. In common with other honourable members, I should like to see provision made in it for the payment of a bounty in respect of -vessels of much greater tonnage. 1917, the firm of Poole and Steele, of Port Adelaide, was engaged in the manufacture of ships but I regret to say that it was given no encouragement and ""finally went out, of business. This hill progiven to the ship-building industry vides for the payment of a sliding-scale bounty for a period of three years, in accordance with the tonnage of the ship constructed. Reference has been made during this debate to the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited. That great organization has been an invaluable help to Australia, and its value in time of war is incalculable. Some time ago a bill was brought down in this House providing for a bounty on the production of motor car engines. A special duty of 0.7d. per lb. was imposed on all chassis coming into this country to establish a fund to meet the bounty payments. Although there is at present"" in the k it t y "" over £1,500.000, not one engine has yet been manufactured in this country. will be used. The. Government would act wisely by making a decision on the No those tenders. The shipping industry could be developed with advantage to Australia, particularly in wartime. There are not sufficient docking facilities in Australia. A vessel coming from England via the Suez Canal has to reach Sydney before decent docking facilities can be provided for it . Docksat Fremantle and Adelaide are necessary, whether they _ be graving docks or floating docks, especially if the shipbuilding industry is to be developed. We are already building aeroplanes in Australia, and I see no reason why the motors for sea vessels should not also be built here. I support the bill, because it is a step in the right direction, but I hope that in the near future the Government will see the wisdom of applying this bounty to vessels of more than 1,500 tons.

258,Mr Makin (Hindmarsh) [12.11,"bring before the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Harrison) the case of Henry Herbert Tilby. I shall be brief, although 1 have a statement fully setting out the details of the case. This man enlisted iu September, 1914, and fought at Gallipoli. He received a bullet wound in the left elbow which necessitated ampuvernment to a matter which was brought tation of the arm from ahove the elbow, at the clearing casualty station on the beach. It took about ten weeks before the healing of the wound could be regarded as in any way satisfactory. In 1930 gangrene manifested itself. He told Dr. O'Brien that he had pains in both legs similar to 'the pains that he was suffering in his arm. He thought that there was an association between the condition in the arm and the pains in the legs. The doctor thought that there could be no such relation, but ultimately, after a conference, a leading Adelaide surgeon, Sir Henry Newland, found it necessary to amputate both legs. It is thought that there is a direct association between the amputation of the legs and the amputation of the elbow at Gallipoli in 1915, but the Repatriation Department takes the view that it has no obligation to the man in respect of the amputated legs, although it recognizes ite obligation in respect of the amputated arm. This is a most distressing case. The Repatriation Department, I know, has given very earnest consideration to this man's case, but it finds that the present Repatriation Act is not wide enough in its scope to enable it to do anything for him. I take the view that the medical report on this man's condition is more than harsh. I submit to the Minister that he give this case his personal attention. I suggest either a compassionate allowance dr an amendment of the Repatriation Act in order that this man shall receive the justice which he deserves. A man who lost an arm on active service and then lost intends to use them to give handouts to both legs warrants special consideration. I ask the Minister to examine this case thoroughly. I shall be glad to furnish him with details of it, although I understand that there is a very full statement of the claim on the files of the Repatria14. He is entitled to refer to a particution Department. I hope that at least the Minister will be able to make some helpful suggestion as to the best way in which this applicant conld be assisted by the department, either by means of a Mr Makin. compassionate allowance or by an amendment of the act to permit of the more generous expression of the department's views. a.m.] I direct the attention of the Goto my notice during the dinner adjournment of this House to-night. I received a telephone call from Brisbane informing me that the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner had authorized an increase of the price of bricks by 10s. 6d. a thousand. That is tantamount to an increase of 10 per cent. Nat many months ago the State price-fixing authority, after making a very exhaustive inquiry, in consequence of' continual applications by the brick manufacturers, refused an application for an increase of the price of bricks by 5s. a thousand, yet this is an increase of 10s. 6d. a thousand. Obviously it is an attempt to secure a return to tlic conditions that operated during the last war, when building prices rose tremendously. The passing of the Profiteering Prevention Act in Queensland in 1920 at. least had the effect of preventing building costs from rising any further, but the Commonwealth Government apparently is now prepared to permit a repetition of the profiteering of 1914r-18 by giving to its greedy supporters-the brick manufacturers do not support the Labour party-opportunitie s to profit as much as possible from war conditions which actually do not affect their industry. The Government has intimated that it will not on any pretext permit anybody to make undue profit out of this war, yet the brick manufacturers have made this increase on the authority of the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner. It appears to me that since the Government has been given special powers it its wealthy supporters. Order!

261,Mr Riordan,"This increase of thewill the earnings of building trade workers, such as painters, plasterers, bricklayers and other artisans, be depleted, but also thousands of men will be thrown out of employment. In 1932 the Queensland Government instituted a building revival scheme, because it realized that an increase of building activity would create more employment than any other trade revival. The action of the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner in this case shows definitely that the Commonwealth Government is not seriously concerned about unemployment; if it were it would not permit this form of exploitation. When the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Spender) delivered his Financial Statement this afteremergency existed which warranted the noon, he said that the country was passing through a period of business repression. The increasing of the price of bricks in Queensland will certainly cause business repression, because people will not now be prepared to erect brick houses or buildings. The war has already had an adverse affect on the industry. I can see no reason to justify the increase. In recent cases of price increases the argument has been advanced that the higher freights and insurance rates have been responsible; but on this occasion that argument will not apply, because freights and. insurance rates do not affect the building trade Neither has there been any wage increase to warrant a price increase. If the Government intends to stand by its promise to peg prices at the levels obtaining on the 31st August last, it must prevent the manufacturers from increasing the price of bricks in Queensland. a.m.] I bring to the notice of the Government a very serious matter concerning interference with industrial conditions in New South Wales on the meagre plea that certain information has been passed on by the Commonwealth Government to the Chief Fire Officer in New South Wales, Mr Richardson, to the effect that a state of emergency exists. The hours of labour of fire brigade officers 'a New South Wales have been unduly -.i.ercased. Those officers have no award, Jut they work under an agreement which arose ""from a declaration made by the full bench of the Industrial Commission in 1.938. ' The weekly hours fixed by the agreement were 112. On the 25th August, 1939, Mr Richardson, on his own initiative, increased the total to 168 hours a week. That meant that fire brigade officers were to be on duty for 24 hours a day on every day of the week. Those hours were subsequently reduced to 144 a week. The Fire Brigade Officers Association then applied for an award in the terms of the agreement of 1938 for a total working week of 112 hours. This application was heard before the full Industrial Commission in New South Wales. Counsel for the board stated that abnormal times existed and that the Chief Fire Officer had in his possession information on which he had decided that a state of fixing of a working week of 144 hours. Mr Richardson was then asked to go into the witness box to be cross-examined, but he said that although he was in possession of this special information, he was not able to divulge it. A suggestion was acted upon that Mr Richardson should retire with the bench to discuss the matter. It was later stated that he had been able to satisfy the bench that a state of emergency did exist. The only persons who could inform Mr Richardson authoritatively that a state of emergency existed were the Commonwealth authorities. The Minister for the Army( Mr .Street) has, under the National Security Regulations, power to declare by order that certain conditions exist and to make stipulations with regard to the working hours of fire brigade officers, but the fact that the Minister has not made such an order indicates that the state of emergency which Mr Richardson claims to exist, does not, in fact, exist at all. I ask the Minister to inform me whether any special information was passed on to Mr Richardson to justify him, on his own initiative, introducing a working week of 168 hours. The Prime Minister has repeatedly given undertakings in this chamber that industrial conditions will not be interfered with by the Government and that any alterations will only be made after a complete and open inquiry. There has been a distinct departure from this procedure in the case to which I have referred, in that the commission actually went into camera during part of tbe proceedings with the result that counsel representing the Fire Brigade Officers Association did riot have",89,Adjournment

In the main, the position is as set out by the honourable member. serious and sympathetic consideration to the question of how it may be able to help this unfortunate returned soldier, and the Repatriation Commission and the War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal have reviewed the case exhaustively. Both before coming to decisions and after making their primary decisions, they have referred the matter to specialists in order to pee whether some indication could be given as to the origin of the disease known as Berger's from which the applicant is suffering. Only recently, notwithstanding the decision of the Appeal Tribunal, which, prior to making its second decision, referred the case to an Adelaide specialist, the commission referred the applicant to its own medical advisory panel, a body of specialists. Apparently, the onset, of this disease did not, take place until fourteen years after the return of Tilby from active service in the war zone. Unfortunately, the medical advisory panel could not give any indication to the commission that the disease was actually a war disability. I know that the honourable member for Hindmarsh will agree that the commission is not empowered to grant pensions in ci)?o where the disability fro m whioh B the applicant is suffering cannot be definitely classed as being due to war service.

The Commissioner made his decision after a study of a carefully, compiled report which was furnished to h i m by. the Deputy Prices Commissioner in Queensland, Mr Lindsay, who is particularly well qualified to give an opinion on such matters since he enjoyed for a number of years the fullest confidence of the Government of Queensland when he was deputy commissioner and later Commissioner of Prices under the State legislation. He was appointed to his present, position as the nominee of the Premier of Queensland, Mr Forgan Smith. Mr. Lindsay has reported as follows:That some relief should be jrranted to the brick industry in Queensland.
