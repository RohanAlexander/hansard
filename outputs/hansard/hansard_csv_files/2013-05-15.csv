I expected that there is no shortfall in revenue. Next year he would identify the reasons why the budget revenue will be $80 billion higher than the was in a mess and would admit that he had last year of the coalition government-no basically got the numbers very wrong-very shortage there-but spending will be $120 wrong last year and the year before and the billion higher than the last year of the year before and the year before.

Wednesday, 15 May 2013 Vietnam War bring justice to the more than 450 doctors, nurses and anaesthetists who served as members of the SEATO civilian surgical medical teams that operated in Vietnam between 1964 and 1972. These volunteers all suffered the hardships of war while tending to the wounded and should not be denied repatriation benefits similar to those provided to ADF personnel serving in Vietnam during the same period. Because it is alleged these volunteers were not technically under the control of the ADF but under the control of the Department of External Affairs, they have been denied justice for more than four decades. This is despite the fact that these civilians were awarded the Active Service Medal for working in a warlike situation. Justice Mohr, in his report in 2000, found that these nurses: …were integrated with the ADF and performed like functions. The Weekend Australian has recently revealed a previously hidden document, which indicated a chain of command between the ADF and the hospital of Bien Hoa, where hundreds of Australian civilian medical staff were located at the time. The result of this bureaucratic blockade is that the physical pain these civilian volunteers have suffered, including lymphomas, thyroid disease, autoimmune disease disorders, multiple sclerosis and posttraumatic stress disorder at higher rates than in the general community, has been compounded by the emotional anguish of being ignored by the government. Dot Angell says that she is angry, very angry; Ted Kremer says that he feels betrayed; and Maureen Spicer says that she is outraged. I have met some of these brave people, including former senior nurse Caroline Coventry, who went with the first Alfred Hospital team to Vietnam in 1966 and is also a Kooyong constituent. I have taken up their case by writing to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Warren Snowdon, but to no avail. Today, Mr Deputy Speaker, I give voice to their case in the parliament and join with such distinguished Australian military figures as General Cosgrove, who supports their case and calls for an act of grace by the government. As a former Vietnam veteran, General Cosgrove has said: Very plainly, the men and women of the Vietnam surgical teams, there at the behest of the Australian government, were no more 'free agents' than was I. It is never too late to right a wrong. I hope that an Australian government, whatever its political affiliation, can bring justice for these Australian patriots, who selflessly risked their lives to help others. In doing so, we will be not only properly dealing with our past but strengthening our future.

Our state government's inadequate mining laws leave us and our farmers unprotected from this assault-not just farmers, but particularly farmers. It has been left to the federal government to protect our water. I expect the amendment to our Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, our national environment law, to pass the Senate today. Of course, that is up to them, but it is listed for debate again this morning and could become law within a few weeks. This amendment will bring coal seam gas mining and large coal mining projects within the ambit of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The mining companies and the state government, who have given approval and who are issuing the mining licences, will have to demonstrate that both water quality and water quantity are not negatively impacteda tall order given how difficult that would be to prove. I do not see how they will be able to do that. When I read the National Water Commission position statement on coal seam gas mining that articulates 11 principles to be followed if it is to be done, it appears to be nearly impossible to do it. I have read other reports that they have issued as well. The CSIRO publication on water in 2011 had a chapter on water, coal seam gas mining and large coal mining, actually says that they do not know some of the impacts of this type of mining on water. The member for Richmond Mrs Justine Elliot and I have joined forces to fight this threat. We are saying we have done what we can to protect us and our area in the Northern Rivers with the amendment to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and now it is up to the state government to make an exclusion zone in our area. It has introduced some type of an exclusion zone but it really is inadequate and there is a lot of outs in it. It needs a blanket exclusion zone to make sure that coal-seam gas mining does not happen in the Northern Rivers. It is not an area that can sustain coal-seam gas mining. The honourable member for Richmond and I have a petition going and we are seeking 10,000 signatures. I thank the people for signing. National Broadband Network fast and affordable broadband to all Australians. It is important to remember that both major parties have the same goal, to deliver fast broadband on an equitable basis. However, there is a fundamental difference in our approach which speaks volumes about the way the coalition and the Labor Party manage public funds. The coalition have a plan to get fast broadband to all Australians much, much sooner than later and at much less cost to taxpayers. The coalition' s broadband rollout requires funding of $29.5 billion compared to Labor's plan which is tipped to cost $94 billion. Despite throwing an astonishing sum of money at the National Broadband Network the Labor Party cannot even undertake a timely rollout of the scheme. Labor's NBN will likely take at least until 2025 to complete. The coalition' s NBN will be completed by 2019. Labor's NBN will be lucky to meet 15 per cent of its targets by June 30. In fact, it has only connected about 10,000 people nationally through its main brownfields fibre rollout.

NBN Co now claim in April it is ready for service update and Mandurah consumers will be connected from December 2013, two years from the commencement of the work and 18 months behind schedule in total. Because Labor's NBN rollout is failing to meet any targets, it has been unwilling to engage in any factual debate and has instead resorted to misrepresentation, distortion and outright falsehoods when speaking of the coalition's plan. One misleading claim is that the coalition's broadband policy will cost $5,000 to connect. This is false. Whether it is Labor's NBN or the coalition's NBN, customers will still have to pay a monthly fee to access live internet connection. The difference here is the fee consumers have to pay. Estimated retail price in 2021 for the coalition's NBN will be $66 per month. Labor's NBN cost will be $90 per month. Another false claim being made is that Australia must go all fibre because everybody else is doing it. On the contrary, data compiled by Point Topic in the broadband forum shows FTP accounts for only three per cent of the 644 million broadband subscriptions in the world. I know how desperately my constituents want fast broadband. I recognise that and the coalition's broadband plan requires NBN Co to build in readiness for the future upgrades to take(Time expired) Infrastructure investment in infrastructure for many years under this federal Labor government. This is because the Labor government has invested in infrastructure. In Queensland it has more than doubled annual infrastructure spending from $143 to $314 per Queenslander. I have spoken many times in this place on the federal Labor government's $3 billion investment in the Ipswich Motorway from Dinmore to Darra and I am pleased to see it is continuing to invest in the upgrade of this motorway. The continuing work is not in my electorate but is vital to motorists in Blair and that is why the Ipswich-based The Queensland Times celebrated this continuing investment on its front page today. We are continuing to invest in Ipswich Motorway with the instalment of $279 million for the Darra to Rocklea six-lane upgrade, an upgrade located mainly in the electorate of Moreton but used by tens of thousands of people in Ipswich and Brisbane. A section of that road floods regularly at Oxley Creek. This is an important road upgrade for the economy of the western corridor and for South East Queensland. It is important for jobs, for growth and for the economic development of South East Queensland. I am not sure that those opposite who represent communities in South East Queensland understand this. This morning I am also pleased to announce that work has finally begun on the Blacksoil interchange at the Warrego and Brisbane Valley Highway intersection in Blair. This government has committed $54 million to this $93 million project-we did it back in 2011. The project was delayed four times by the state LNP government. This has been a long and difficult process and I have spoken at length in this place in relation to it. It is a notorious intersection. Approximately 40,000 vehicles a day travel along the Warrego Highway with about 9,000 vehicles a day on the Brisbane Valley Highway and a further 6,000 vehicles a day on the Wulkuraka Connection Road in Ipswich. The traffic on all three roads is expected to",198,Constituency Statements
262,Mr Neumann (Blair) (09:38,"The electorate of Blair has seen the most significantmore than double by 2031 so it is vital to move now on this important infrastructure upgrade. The project is expected to be completed by late 2014; it is a big win for motorists. I am sad that those opposite voted against it, as they did with the upgrade to Ipswich Motorway, Dinmore to Darra, again and again. For three federal elections the coalition opposed the Ipswich Motorway upgrade and they opposed the Blacksoil interchange upgrade at the last federal election. I call on the LNP members in South East Queensland to support the upgrade of the Darra to Rocklea section of Ipswich Motorway-finally to get it; finally to realise that this upgrade is important for jobs, growth and economic development in South East Queensland. Wilson, Private Kyle of Castle Hill in my electorate who this year in the Australia Day honours received a Commendation for Gallantry. This brave 22-year-old received the Commendation for Gallantry, one of only 30 awarded over the past two decades. This is an extraordinary story of an ordinary Australian doing extraordinary things. Private Wilson follows in the military footsteps of his father, uncle, brother and grandfather, the latter of whom received the Order of Australia Medal in 1983. I note that Private Wilson joined the Army at the age of 17 for a gap year. Of course, he had such a great time after he enlisted that, when the 12 months were up, he sought further military service. I put on the record at this point my great support for the ADF gap year program. I was disappointed to see its cessation in the 2012-13 budget. Private Wilson is exactly the kind of person who had the experience at 17 to go on and do great things. His citation for gallantry reads: For acts of gallantry in action on 7 September 2011 while deployed on Operation Slipper as a member of Mentoring Task Force3 in Afghanistan. While attempting to apprehend a withdrawing insurgent commander Private Wilson and a fellow soldier came under intense plunging fire from an insurgent force numbering three to five on their southern flank as well as fire from their quarry. Despite facing extreme personal danger Private Wilson and the other soldier advanced over 100 metres with no cover, concealment or friendly suppressive fire to close with and neutralise the insurgent commander. Their actions also drew fire away from the remainder of their section enabling them to reposition and engage more fully in the battle. It is a fairly dry sort of citation but the true heroism of these young men is that they put their lives on the line for their friends and for the rest of their section without regard for their own personal safety and without regard for anything but the survival of their mates. Reading the full explanation of their story in the Australian Army newspaper is worthwhile. Private Wilson said that with the adrenalin pumping through his veins he really did not think about the danger until he saw the rounds falling around his feet. He looked straight over to his mate. He saw him 'with the rounds falling all around us' and he knew instinctively that it was time to take action. His training kicked in and he did not take any regard for his own personal safety. It is an amazing story of heroism. Just like all of our service personnel, young men and women, he does extraordinary things every day. Kyle Wilson is now back in Castle Hill, running his own business. He is a personal trainer at CrossFit Gym-something I know all members of this place could benefit from-and he is doing a great job re-integrating into our",199,Constituency Statements
263,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (09:42,"I rise today to praise the efforts of Private Kyle Wilsoncommunity in his own business. I congratulate him and his friends on his extraordinary service in Afghanistan and on behalf of this parliament welcome this great award of a Commendation of Gallantry. Racism greater than anti-Semitism. I was interested to read in the Australian today that Professor Rees of the Sydney Peace Foundation, who is on the staff of the University of Sydney's Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, which supports the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement that explicitly equates Israel with apartheid-era South Africa, attacked the Prime Minister and others for their opposition to the position that he takes. I call on the university to sack Professor Rees because in our society what we need is tolerance, understanding of diversity and respect for individual religious convictions. It is incredibly wonderful that the Prime Minister of this nation, the honourable member for Kooyong and so many other members of parliament have chosen to sign a document supporting the London Declaration on Combating Anti-Semitism. Regrettably, in three minutes one does not have time to read all of the London Declaration on Combating Anti-Semitism, but it is a wonderful initiative. Around the world at the moment we are finding increasing anti-Semitic attacks. We are finding, increasingly, that people are opposing those of the Jewish faith. We only have to cast our minds backwards more than half a century ago to the Holocaust, when millions of Jewish people were murdered because of their religion and ethnicity. The fact that the London Declaration on Combating AntiSemitism is receiving such strong support from both sides of parliament indicates that there are values that unite members of this parliament, and values that unite our society. Professor Rees, from the Sydney Peace Foundation, is out of step with values that this parliament represents. Professor Rees is un-Australian. His views are absolutely despicable and, in fact, the university ought not to be wasting public money paying a person who has such odious views and who supports anti-Semitism. He is, in my view, someone who has no place on the public payroll. All Australians should abhor what he has said, and I believe that members should sign this declaration. I have visited Israel five times-most recently as Speaker of the House of Representatives. It is a wonderful country, a tolerant country, and I think all of us should stand up against the evils of anti-Semitism. Child Care Ms O'DWYER (Higgins) (09:48): The electorate of Higgins has a long standing and deserved reputation as a wonderful place to raise children. As such, since becoming the member for Higgins, I have made it a priority to visit numerous kindergartens and childcare centres across my electorate. I have also done this in my capacity as deputy chair of the coalition's deregulation task force. During these visits I have had regular discussions on the progress and impact of the government's significant regulatory changes, notably the introduction of universal access in kindergartens and the introduction of the National Quality Framework across the sector. It is clear that the Rudd and Gillard governments' increases in regulation are leading to reductions in places, higher fees, decreased accessibility, capital expenditure in order to alter",200,Constituency Statements
264,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (09:45,"There are many evils in our society, but there is no evilexisting infrastructure, and significant allocation of paid and voluntary work and associated increases in stress. The mandatory introduction of many of these changes brought about by universal access in the National Quality Framework is a classic case of 'government knows best', whereby it is assumed that more regulation will lead to better outcomes. This is not necessarily the case. I am particularly grateful to my colleague the member for Mayo and shadow parliamentary secretary Jamie Briggs for joining me in two round tables in April with three of my local councils-Boroondara, Stonnington and Glen Eira-and 18 representatives from kindergartens and childcare providers in my electorate. There were three key concerns raised, and I will cover them very briefly in the time available. First is the loss of kindergarten and long daycare places. Within the City of Boroondara, in order for kindergartens to provide the mandatory 15 hours a week for four-yearolds, one kindergarten has reduced its three-year-old intake by 17 places. This represents a significant diminution of service to the local community and a significant loss of income to the community-run kindergarten. The changes of staff-to-child ratios in 2016 from one to 15 to one to 11 will see either a reduction in class size or an increase in fees-or of course a combination of both. The City of Boroondara has provided advice that, if kindergartens in the suburbs of Ashburton and Glen Iris choose to decrease their group sizes to 22, thereby maintaining current staff levels of two staff per room, there will be a total loss of 32 four-year-old kindergarten places in these two suburbs alone. It is unlikely that the kindergartens will consider the alternative-that is, to pass on the increased costs-because typically fees at these kindergartens are already in the order of $2,000 a year. This is more than three times the cost of the local government primary school for just 15 hours per week. There are also significant costs of infrastructure upgrades. The City of Glen Iris has spent more than $1.5 million altering the physical layouts according to regulations, and there has been a significant increase in childcare costs. The government promised there would only be an increase of 57c per week; yet we have seen more than $100 per week added to the bills of parents. This is simply not good enough and makes it more difficult for families in Higgins. Corio Electorate: Commuting night, so too has the issue of ballooning commuting time, both on the roads and on public transport, when travelling to and from Geelong. Last week's announcement by the state coalition government to fund the eastern part of the East West Link totally ignores the more pressing issues regarding the western entrance into Melbourne. Being the key transport link between the city and the west, the West Gate Bridge is being subjected to ever-growing strain. An article in the Age of 18 March not only describes that there are 'no specialist bridge engineers managing the West Gate' but also 'warns if the bridge continues to deteriorate, the government will be forced to impose load limits and lane closures, leading to ""severe disruptions"", including traffic jams several kilometres long'. The impact this would have on Geelong would be nothing short of disastrous. But the pain for Victorians will not stop there. The Victorian state coalition has announced it is ripping nearly $50 million from the arterial road management program, slashing $100",201,Constituency Statements
265,Mr Marles (Corio) (09:51,"As the Cats climb to the top of the AFL ladder on Fridaymillion from the road maintenance program, cutting the integrated transport system planning from $51.8 million to $26.7 million and has already sacked more than 400 VicRoads staff, forcing the customer service telephone waiting periods to blow out by 800 per cent. They are barely keeping their heads above water conducting day-to-day service. It is a sad sight to see Premier Napthine happy to sit by and let these vital roads, such as the Geelong Ring Roadmade possible by the Bracks-Brumby state Labor government-not being paid the attention and funding that it needs. The other issue that must be brought to the attention of this place is the substandard public transport services between Geelong and Melbourne. If you look at the V/line Geelong Twitter account, it is bombarded with words such as 'delay', 'cancelled', 'carriage fault' and 'operating at reduced capacity'. As I read those last words, a thought comes to mind: is road congestion and a jammed-up public transport system holding Geelong back from flourishing in all it has to offer? Is our city also being delayed, and is the thought of being packed in a train carriage like a sardine for an hour making the thought of train travel unpleasant even at the best of times? Why should commuters be getting in cars and having to drive in the opposite direction to a station across town for the sole purpose of securing a seat? Boarding a train has now become akin to Boxing Day sales with people desperate for a seat hurling themselves through the train door. Where is the hope of getting people out of cars and into trains when the state coalition refuses to upgrade stations such as North Shore or Corio? Lucky for Premier Napthine, Regional Rail Link, a project championed by the previous Brumby government and this current Gillard federal government and due for completion in 2016, is set to ease public transport demand, but what is happening in the meantime? Under the Napthine government, our public transport continues to rot. Petition: Mobile Phone Coverage in order by the Petitions Committee. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House inadequate mobile phone coverage at Lake Tyers Beach. The lack of coverage compromises the safety of beachgoers and recreational boat users while limiting growth in the small business sector. It also restricts communication between local residents and emergency services during emergency events. We therefore ask the House of Representatives to take steps to rectify mobile phone coverage at Lake Tyers Beach from 287 citizens. Petition received. This petition highlights ongoing concerns within my community about this government's failure to improve mobile phone coverage in regional areas. There is a lot of talk in this place and plenty of debate out in the community about the National Broadband Network-which communities will miss out, what download speeds will be available-but to the best of my knowledge no-one has ever died because they could not download a movie fast enough. In my",202,Constituency Statements
266,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (09:54,"I rise to table a petition which has been found to becommunity, lives are at risk everyday because of this government's failure to improve mobile phone coverage in some of the areas most prone to natural disasters in particular. There are areas in my community located a long distance from medical assistance and people who sustain serious injuries have no prospect at all of calling for assistance because the mobile phone coverage is simply non-existent. There are areas of the Princes Highway and the Monaro Highway where there is no coverage whatsoever. These are sections of highway where there are high speeds, regular crashes with wildlife and also run-off road crashes or serious accidents involving two vehicles. These are isolated parts of the state and people have no capacity to call for help. The petition before the House from the Lake Tyers Beach community highlights both the social and the economic impacts of the government's failure to assist the industry to provide mobile phone coverage. It is a popular beach and recreational boating location. The principal petitioner is a local tourism industry operator and he makes the point that, in terms of his business, it is difficult when his customers cannot call either family or friends when they are visiting in the community and they cannot call for taxis if they visit his establishment. There are many people who have signed this petition who do not live in the immediate community but visit the region over the holiday period and they are frustrated by the experience of not being able to use their mobile phones when they are visiting. There have been significant improvements made in mobile phone coverage across the Gippsland region over the past decade, but they are all funded by the previous coalition government in partnership with the telecommunications industry. The Rudd and Gillard governments have failed miserably in relation to the mobile phone coverage. The government should have introduced a mobile phone black spot program to work in partnership with the industry and also local and state governments to improve safety and boost regional productivity. For a very modest investment, the federal government could have delivered major returns in terms of productivity and the safety of my community. More broadly, I would argue that this government's failure also extends to its lack of responsibility in relation to the emergency alert warning system, which the government has spent $26 million rolling out across Australia so that people can receive a text warning in the case of a natural disaster, such as a bushfire or a flood. I do not condemn the system because I believe that it has a great deal of merit. But I want to make the point that you should not depend on that system because in vast areas of regional Australia you simply will not receive any warning whatsoever, because this government has failed to improve mobile phone coverage across our nation. Kingston Electorate: ANZAC Day Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston-Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (09:57): April 25 is an extremely important day in our national calendar as we mark ANZAC Day each year. It is a day to recognise the sacrifice of those defending our country and to commemorate those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Local dawn services are an important feature of the day, giving the community an opportunity to pay their respects in their local communities. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the local RSLs, who worked hard to put on these local services in my electorate. I would also like to highlight another important ANZAC tradition in addition to the dawn services that occur in my local electorate-that is, the annual youth vigil held at the Onkaparinga Memorial Gardens. This is an important activity in which young people in our community stand guard around the memorial in shifts of 10 people from 6 pm on the evening before ANZAC Day until the beginning of the dawn service the next morning. During this time, these young people march around the memorial every three minutes. While they stand still, they reflect on what ANZAC Day means to them. This vigil stems from the military tradition of holding ground, whereby a reconnaissance patrol would find and hold a strategic position in preparation for the arrival of their army. This would often involve all night vigils, keeping awake on watch, alert that the area of the battle is secured against threat. The young people standing guard this year came from a number of youth organisations, including St John's Ambulance Operations Branch, Girl Guides South Australia, Squadron 619 of the Australian Air Force Cadets, SA Country Fire Service Cadets and the Scouts Australia. In addition to this, an official commemoration service does occur, involving representatives from 25 local schools, with young representatives from each of these schools laying a token at the memorial. We also have many, many other local organisations that support this important event. The ANZAC Day youth vigil in the south has become an important part of the way that young people respect and participate in the ANZAC commemoration service. However, this year was an important milestone for the ANZAC youth vigil. It marked its 10th anniversary of the youth vigil in the south. I would like to thank many of those who have ensured that this important event continues to be a part of our traditions in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. I would like to make mention of the chair of Youth Vigil in the South, Brian Holecek, and all the members of the organising committee, and Gay Thompson MP and Mr Frank Owen OAM, who originally worked hard to take this concept to make it a reality. I would also like to thank the sponsors, the City of Onkaparinga, the family, friends and supporters, and particularly the young people for participating in and supporting this event not only this year but for the last 10 years. This has become an incredibly important event and I look forward to its continuing success into the future. (Time expired) the time for constituency statements has concluded. Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Compliance Measures No. 2) Bill 2013 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Compliance Measures No. 2) Bill 2013, bearing in mind that we do, of course, agree with the government in terms of the changes it is making. Offshore petroleum safety is paramount. The changes that are being introduced under this amendment are changes which not only do we support but come from the 2010 Montara commission of inquiry report together with other policy and technical",203,Constituency Statements
267,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Owens,"Order! In accordance with standing order 193,",205,Bills
268,Mr Ian Macfarlane (Groom) (10:00,"I shall not keep the House long on theamendments. This is part of the process of ensuring that the Australian and global communities are confident in the operation of offshore petroleum assets, particularly in the oil and gas industry. Offshore petroleum is a very important part of Australia's economy, though you would not know it from the budget last night, and I will come back to that later. The reality is that our gas exports at the moment come virtually entirely from offshore petroleum in Western Australia, with some also from offshore petroleum in the waters north of Darwin. As a Queenslander, I have to say the industry is expanding onshore in Queensland, but it is also expanding offshore in Western Australia. We see the introduction of the latest technology in the world, the technology of floating LNG, where the plant is actually placed on what could be called a ship, though it is bigger than an aircraft carrier. In fact, one of the executives of the gas industry says it is a pretty handy par 5-it is about 490 metres long. That is a hell of a big ship. On top of that, you put the LNG plant and that plant then produces LNG and exports it to the world. It is imperative that as Australia moves into the next phase of offshore petroleum production-liquids, condensate and oil, and also gas for the LNG plants to supply the Asian markets in particular-we have the sort of legislation that ensures that those operations are done safely and in an environmentally sustainable way. We all know that there have been some unfortunate, and in fact disastrous incidents in recent times. Montara was the incident in Australia that caught the public's attention. Far bigger tragedies have occurred: the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico on 20 April 2010 and the death of two drill workers in the Otway Basin off the Victorian coast in 2012. They are salient reminders to the oil industry that it needs make sure that its operations are not near-perfect but actually perfect. The bill will amend the act to implement a number of findings in the legislative review conducted into Montara and will aim to strengthen the implementation of polluter pays principles in the offshore petroleum regularity regime. I hope we do not get to that. I hope the industry operates in a way that is safe but also prevents the escape of any molecules into the environment. The amendments in this bill will: introduce alternative enforcement mechanisms enabling inspectors appointed by NOPSEMA to issue environmental improvement notices; introduce a statutory duty on petroleum titleholders in the event of the escape of petroleum; provide an ability for the regulator to take up the necessary actions to recover costs from the titleholder; and, finally, improve the effectiveness of insurance requirements in the act to ensure that titleholders are in a financial position to comply with the new statutory polluter pays duty and other extraordinary regulatory costs that they may incur. As I said, the coalition supports these amendments and is of the view that the offshore oil and gas industry can operate in a manner which allows it to grow without exposing either the workers or the environment to unnecessary risks. I know from my discussions with industry that this is an issue they are very engaged in and they are very keen to make sure that it works. We need to learn from the lessons of the past. We need to make sure that we have the right set of amendments and legislation to ensure correct and safe operation. But I think the onus is on the industry to go above and beyond the requirements of the legislation, to do everything they can to make sure the safety of their workers and the protection of the environment are paramount. The thing that disturbs me and which continues to be exposed by this government is not the sorts of amendments they are making today, which we do support; it is what we saw in the budget last night, which continues to be a full frontal assault on the oil and gas industry and on the resources industry in general. The changes we saw in the budget last night may leave these amendments unrequired-that is, if this government were to be allowed to continue in its assault on the oil and gas industry, exploration and development of oil and gas offshore and onshore would basically grind to a halt. We saw last night some of the most short-sighted policy I have seen handed down by a government in my mere 14½ years in this place, perhaps even in my political lifetime going back probably three decades-that is, to make it more difficult, more expensive for multinational companies, which in the end are responsible for most of the oil and gas development in Australia, to invest here. When the oil and gas industry in Australia today is responsible for 30c of every private-sector dollar invested in Australia, it is beyond me why a government would be turning on this industry simply to desperately try to get dollars in to balance its wasteful spending. The industry is currently investing around $200 billion over five years, which is around $1,200 per second. On top of the $200 billion it is investing, it will pay billions of dollars a year in royalties and taxes to the government and create more than 100,000 new jobs. On top of all that-if that was not enough-the industry is considering investing many tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars in future projects. So when we see a change in the thin capital rules that means it is now more expensive for companies to invest in those projects, we realise that this government really does not get it. On top of that, the government changed the exploration rules. The increases in costs associated with trading or buying exploration permits will be a further deterrent to investment in Australia. Everyone, surely, wants to see investment in Australia. Everyone, surely, wants to see the amendments we are discussing today being there for an industry that is thriving, prospering and investing in Australia, as well as growing jobs, growing exports, putting extra revenue into the coffers. The changes that were introduced last night by the government to both thin capital and exploration allowances was, as I said, the most short-sighted thing I have seen for a long time. The coalition will continue to work with this government to ensure that offshore safety and protection of the environment is maintained. I had a very fruitful and useful working relationship with the previous minister, Minister Ferguson. I thank him and congratulate him for what he did for the resources industry in Australia. His replacement, the Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism, Minister Gray, is someone I have known for a long time through the corporate sector prior to him coming into politics. I have the absolute confidence in him that I had in his predecessor. I wish the minister well. I look forward to working with him over the months ahead. The outcome of our cooperation will be to the betterment not only of the industry but also of the community of Australia and better for jobs in Australia. Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Compliance Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. I commend the member for Groom for the first two-fifths of his speech and the last one-fifth of his speech. There were two-fifths there during which I drifted off, but I commend him for his contribution and for the bipartisan support that the opposition has given this legislation.",205,Bills
269,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (10:10,"I rise to speak on the Offshore Petroleum andObviously, as an island nation we have always taken a particular interest in our immediate surrounds. We have a troubled and a proud history as a federal government in being a little bit adventurous. I will particularly mention my predecessor as the member for Moreton, the Hon. James Killen, who did so much back in his time in the 1970s in terms of looking at federal responsibilities. He had a barney or two with the states working out those federal responsibilities. We can also look at the PRRT and some of the debates that went on in this place about that. Obviously, it is now well established that the PRRT is a good tax. We have a sustainable industry there that is also giving a responsible return to Australia. If you look at the Hansard debates at the time that that legislation was introduced by the Hawke government, you could swear that it was going to be the end of that industry. But we have obviously seen a significant offshore petroleum industry since, and it continues to have a healthy outlook-despite what the member for Groom said about the tax avoidance manoeuvres undertaken by some large multinational companies that work in this area. I particularly commend the Labor government in both the 42nd and 43rd parliaments for the work we have done in declaring parts of our surrounding waters marine parks. As a Queenslander, I am very proud of the Great Barrier Reef, as all Australians are. We have declared some of the other marine park areas in recognition of the important contribution that our oceans make, as a source of food but also in terms of their impact on global climate change and maintaining temperatures. If you go north-west of Australia, you are getting into an area called the Amazon of the oceans. We are only just exploring some of the scientific and health benefits associated with the marine flora and fauna. I would like to commend the work of the famous Australian writer Tim Winton, who has done much to focus Australia's view on the south-western part of Australia. And on cue a Western Australian walks in! I commend Minister Gray for the work that he has done in recognising that important interplay between industry and the environment. Sadly, over recent years we have seen a number of tragic accidents due to serious risk within the offshore petroleum industry. I first encountered this industry when I was on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industry and Resources under the member for Lyons, Dick Adams. We did a review of the draft Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Bill. We were looking at productive fields changing to be more useful in a carbon constrained world. This is offshore and sadly it is dangerous. There have been incidents. We have all read about the Montara incident in the papers. I also recall the two deaths in the Otway Basin. These can be dangerous environments and it is important to get the health and safety legislation and support well established and controlled. Those two incidents indicate that there is a need to develop strong, effective regulations of our offshore petroleum regime to ensure the health and safety of our workers as well as protecting the Australian marine environment. The compliance measures contained in the amended bill will include a range of alternative enforcement mechanisms, such as infringement notices and adverse publicity orders, and continuing penalties. It is a stepped-up scheme of common sense and it allows for a bigger stick to be hauled out slowly. The agreed recommendations from the whole-of-government polluter-pays report include: an express polluter-pays obligation and an associated third-party cost-recovery mechanism; clarifying the insurance requirements to ensure that maintenance of sufficient financial insurance is compulsory without a direction being given and to clarify the compliance role of the regulator; enabling NOPSEMA inspectors to issue environmental prohibition and improvement notices to require petroleum titleholders to take action on removing significant threats to the environment; and requiring the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority to publish occupational health and safety and environment improvement notices and prohibition notices on its website-the naming and shaming side of things. The upstream oil and gas sector is a significant industry for Australia, generating around $35.6 billion in the 2008-09 financial year. It employs over 10,000 people. Australia is in danger of marine damage and risk to worker safety within the oil and gas industry, but unless new oil discoveries are made in Australia there is legitimate concern about the long-term fall in production as ageing oilfields decline. As a Queenslander, I know that there are significant developments onshore, but offshore we look forward to new exploration and development leading to new production. The petroleum industry has been acutely aware of the environmental issues for many decades. Geologists, geophysicists and production engineers have been taught to protect and conserve the natural phenomena which surround them every time they venture into the field to initiate and build a project. As a consequence, through their work the petroleum industry has been taking steps to minimise its disturbance to flora and fauna both onshore and offshore for a number of years prior to the media hysteria about the Montara incident. With this in mind, the government has maintained a regulatory body to ensure this protection is upheld and in some cases improved. That is why we introduced the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority to police the petroleum industry's safety and environmental standards. The regulatory body was set up as a direct response to the 2009 oil and gas spill into the Timor Sea. As a result of the inquiry it was recommended that a single independent regulator look after safety, well integrity and environmental management of the Australian offshore petroleum industry. It effectively consolidates the current state, territory and national regulation for health and safety, structural integrity, environmental plans and day-to-day operations associated with petroleum activity in Commonwealth waters. As I mentioned, it will be supported by the opposition. The bill under debate today has been introduced as a necessary action to further maintain the safety of offshore petroleum workers and to enforce those further environmental standards on the industry, so that all Australians can be assured about the sustainability of our environment which is a big asset for our tourism industry as well as the enjoyment of the nearly 90 per cent of Australians who live within 100 kilometres of the ocean. Our marine environment is worth protecting by strengthening the application of polluters-pay standards. By forcing industry to stop, contain, control and clean up spills that occur we are giving our fragile environment a chance to survive and grow for future generations. Environmental protection and the conservation of biodiversity are exceptionally important for Australians, and the international community is watching us to make sure we get it right. Every Australian wants to see our economy grow and prosper. As the Labor Party we are all about jobs, but we need to get the balance right and ensure we do not do so at the expense of our environment. Stringent environmental controls must be in place across the petroleum industry. Greenhouse gas storage is significant in reducing environmental impacts, but there are also a number of measures that must be monitored to ensure maximum protection is upheld, including drilling fluids. Drilling muds must be ecologically tested to ensure there are no toxic effects on the surrounding environment. Disposal of the chemical and heavy metal content of waste material should strictly adhere to government regulations, particularly in offshore locations. Land clearing, including clearance of vegetation for tracks and drilling sites, should be further controlled to ensure any disturbance is kept to a minimum. Oil spill control is hopefully not something that the minister will ever have to worry about, but obviously this would be detrimental to our environment. The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Compliance Measures No. 2) Bill is focused on implementing improved industry standards for clean-up and reduced environmental impact. The bill is also a reflection of our commitment to our Clean Energy Future. Obviously the Australian Labor Party is moving Australia to a low-emissions economy while upholding our commitment to protecting jobs and growth. Despite the doom and gloom and the relentless jeremiad coming for those opposite, the reality is that since 1 July and the introduction of the carbon price, the emissions in the national electricity market have fallen by about 10 million tonnes and renewable energy generated in the NEM has increased by almost 30 per cent over the same period. This is while the economy has continued to grow close to trend and we have created around 160,000 new jobs. I particularly commend the government for the Carbon Farming Initiative by allowing additional land-based abatement projects to generate credits. Despite those opposite, we have got a multi-pronged attack, which is what a price does. Obviously their mechanism will be a complete disaster. Heaven forbid if they do get a chance to implement it. I commend the legislation to the House. Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Compliance Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. Let me proceed in three brief steps. The principles which we uphold in relation to offshore oil and gas are very clear. The first is about the economy and energy security. We unashamedly seek to support energy security for Australia and the capacity to be an oil and gas producer and, potentially-certainly in the case of gas-exporter. These are good things for Australia and for the world. It is about human development. It is about the access to heating and cooling and all of the benefits which come with modern society. Encouraging and supporting a viable flourishing offshore oil and gas industry, with a particular focus on gas, is good for Australia, is good for human development and is one of the drivers of bringing not just tens but hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in India, Indonesia and China. That is a profound historic contribution. The second of the principles is in relation to environmental safety, security and sustainability. Whilst we want to see genuine energy security and all the human benefits that flow from it, we do not want to make the trade-off where our environment is lost. That means we need strong, clear standards. This bill fairly and squarely addresses those standards as a consequence of the Montara incident and the Montara commission. We, for example, are categorically, clearly and implacably opposed to mining and offshore petroleum and gas exploration in the Barrier Reef. In my judgement it will not change in my lifetime or, beyond that, in generations. I think that that is something which will be an Australian standard for the entire foreseeable future across the full political spectrum. So our duties are clear on that side. The third of the principles is to make sure that we try to minimise our emissions footprint. To the extent that gas replaces other forms of energy generation around the world, that is a",207,Bills
270,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (10:21,"It gives me great pleasure to support the Offshoreway of doing this, but we also need to make sure that we have adequate measures. Where this broad bill addresses greenhouse gas storage-the act itself-is one way of reducing our overall national footprint. Let me then move from the principles to the bill. The bill is a response to the Montara incident. I disagree with the member for Moreton, who made the point that it was a wild public overreaction. It was a very serious incident with very serious environmental consequences. I think it was well responded to by the authorities in general, but let us not understate the environmental incident nor overstate it. It was a serious incident. Having said that, we support the amendments which are proposed as a consequence of the commissionin particular, the alternative enforcement mechanisms, infringement notices, daily penalties for continuing offences; it is a tough regime. But our Australian companies have been, for the most part, outstanding. This was a case of negligence, and it is appropriate that there are consequences when there is significant damage to the environment. Let me restate that principle. We support the inspection regime. We support the statutory duties on petroleum titleholders. We support the regulator having the ability to take the necessary action and recover costs from the titleholder, and we support improving the effectiveness of insurance requirements. Against that background, we also think that, in the future, there should be a one-stop shop for federal and state environmental approvals and assessments. In particular, I think we also ought to look-and here I move from policy to a personal view-at a single, horizontal, onestop shop within the federal environment so that there is only one point of negotiation between a firm and the federal government rather than multiple agencies. I think a single coordinating agency for approvals, assessments and other activities would be far preferable to a multiple agency regime. That is a personal view as to how we can take the one-stop-shop concept in terms of federal-state relations to a true, national, one-stop-shop assessment. That would make the difference on projects, I think, such as Olympic Dam and Browse, where they had to run the clock for five or six years to get approvals and, in the meantime, the economic circumstances changed, the cost profile went up and the projects were lost. That brings me, lastly, to the contrast between this bill and what we saw last night in the budget. The contrast is this. This bill is an example of good cooperation, and I thank the minister and his predecessor; they have both been very good partners in working across the chamber. By contrast, the entire carbon tax process has been a debacle. We saw a write-down of $5 billion of revenues because they had phantom revenue projections last night. However, there are still phantom revenue projections. The 2015-16 price of $12.10 in the budget and the 2016-17 forward carbon price of $18 in the budget are more than double and triple what the market is saying the price will be. In other words, there is still phantom revenue built into the budget, and that means a $2 billion black hole in 2015-16. The surplus is gone-evaporated; toes up; it no longer exists. And, in 2016-17-using, again, the forward price of the market, as opposed to the government's inflated phantom revenue projections-there is a $4 billion black hole. What we have there is the same thing as last year: phantom revenue, predicted, spent, but ultimately unlikely to eventuate. It is exactly what we said last year. Nothing has changed. Compare these two examples of phantom revenue with the way this bill was done on a cooperative basis with industry and across the chamber. There should be more examples such as the offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage amendment bill and fewer examples of phantom revenue for political purposes which is spent in advance and which ultimately evaporates. Integrity) (10:28): I rise to sum up this debate on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Compliance Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. In so doing, I want to pay tribute to my predecessor, the member for Batman, for the work that he did in dealing with the immediacy of Montara and then the outstanding public administration work that has given rise to this piece of legislation. It is impossible to make that statement without giving due credit and acknowledgement to the opposition and, in particular, the shadow minister, the member for Groom, for his tremendous insight and support of good industry practice, leading to good environmental regulation and a safer and better offshore working environment for Australian workers and for this extremely important growing industry. This bill amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to strengthen the offshore petroleum regulatory regime, continuing the Australian government's work to implement the lessons learned following the uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons from the Montara wellhead platform in August 2009. Recent incidents such as the tragic accident on the Stena Clyde rig in the Otway basin located in the Bass Strait which resulted in the deaths of two employees, one a 32-year-old man from the Northern Territory and the second a 60-year-old, during drilling operations in August of last year further emphasise the need for a strong, effective regulatory framework to promote and encourage the safe best practice that we have in our industry and the continuous improvements in the operations of the offshore petroleum industry. The amendments in this bill help to achieve this goal by introducing a range of alternative compliance and enforcement tools to strengthen the ability of the regulator and the courts to enforce critical safety and environmental management requirements, including adverse publicity orders, injunctions, infringement notices and continuing offences to help protect the Australian offshore workforce and the marine environment. The bill also inserts a new polluter pays provision in the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to both impose an express statutory duty on titleholders to respond to an escape of petroleum as well as provide a legislative guarantee that all costs of responding to an escape of petroleum, including clean up, remediation of the environment and environmental monitoring, will be met in full by the polluter should they fail to fulfil their statutory duty. A number of additional policy and technical amendments in this bill will also strengthen the operation of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006, including enabling NOPSEMA inspectors to issue environmental prohibition notices and environmental improvement notices to require titleholders to remove significant threats to the environment and to require NOPSEMA to publish environmental and occupational health and safety prohibition and improvement notices issued by inspectors so that lessons from offshore inspections can be shared across the offshore petroleum industry in support of continuous operational improvements and improved occupational health and safety and environmental outcomes.

Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Inbound Cargo Security Enhancement) Bill 2013 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. makes two unrelated amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004, the bill which governs our aviation security arrangements in Australia. Following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 the former coalition government took action to improve aviation security regulations in Australia. The coalition announced a complete restructure of the aviation security system in December 2002 and over time we implemented further amendments to modernise the act to better respond to emerging threats and new technologies. Developments in aviation security have largely received bipartisan support and the coalition has previously supported sensible changes to aviation security arrangements proposed by this government. The current bill is no exception and will receive the coalition's support. Turning to the amendments contained within the bill, the bill makes two different changes, one to correct a drafting error and one substantive change designed to strengthen our aviation security regulatory arrangements and to supervise their operation. To deal firstly with the technical amendment, the drafting error, the bill before the House corrects a drafting error contained within a 2011 amendment to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004. This earlier bill incorrectly amended paragraph 65(3)(b) of the act instead of paragraph 65(3)(c). The more substantive amendment contained within the bill will introduce provisions to allow the minister through disallowable instrument to prohibit the carriage of certain types of cargo into Australia on aircraft. This change will enhance Australia's ability to respond to ongoing threats in aviation security. In October 2010, terrorists operating from Yemen concealed improvised explosive devices inside printers and sent them as air cargo consignments to the USA. Thankfully, intelligence information led to the successful interception of the packages in the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates, and they never reached their intended recipient. In Australia, the government responded by increasing security requirements for cargo from Yemen and Somalia using a special security direction issued to regulated air cargo agents. This required the screening of all inbound air cargo arriving from the Middle East. Later, special security directions were used to ban the carriage of cargo from Yemen and Somalia altogether. However, special security directions were designed as a measure to deal quickly and efficiently with new security threats. They were not intended as a means by which the government could address the longer term, ongoing threats to Australia's security. For this reason, special security directions have a maximum duration of six months. Under current arrangements, the ongoing prohibition of air cargo consignments from Yemen and Somalia has required all aircraft operators to amend their transport security programs. This entailed each aircraft operator manually amending their security documentation, which was then assessed and individually approved by the department. This is",212,Bills
272,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Leader of The Nationals) (10:33): The bill before the Housea cumbersome task and not suited to a timely or cohesive response to a serious ongoing national security threat. To address this concern, the bill will introduce a new mechanism whereby the minister can propose a disallowable instrument to prohibit the carriage of certain types of cargo into Australia. The instrument may be so broad as to prohibit all air cargo entering Australian territory or be limited to a particular type of cargo or types of cargoes, depending on the nature of the threat proposed. As the minister noted in his second reading speech, the disallowable instrument could cover cargo originating from a particular country or countries, cargo packaged in a particular way or cargo weighing between particular amounts. The bill also creates a strict liability offence for failing to comply with an instrument made by the minister under this mechanism and imposes a penalty of $17,000 for individuals and $34,000 for aircraft operators. As a general principle, I am concerned that the current government has developed a propensity to introduce strict liability offences in aviation and I do not consider this to be best policy. But I have come to the view that, even though I have some concerns about that from a philosophical perspective, to delay the bill and to seek a better way to deal with any breaches of the legislation would in fact delay it unnecessarily. This amendment will ensure that current and future governments are able to respond appropriately to emerging but also ongoing security threats and would reduce the administrative burden on industry. For these reasons, the coalition will support the bill. (Inbound Cargo Security Enhancement) Bill 2013 makes two different amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004, the bill which governs aviation security in Australia. After the terrible terrorists attacks of 9/11, the Howard-Anderson coalition government took the necessary and prompt action to strengthen aviation security regulations in Australia. The coalition announced a complete restructure of the aviation security system in December 2002. Over the course of time, the government has implemented further amendments to modernise the act to respond faster and more effectively to new technologies and emerging threats. Developments in aviation security have generally received bipartisan support, as they should, and the coalition has previously supported very necessary changes to aviation security proposed by the Labor government. The current bill is no exception to that. As you have just heard from the shadow transport minister, this will also receive coalition support. The bill makes two unrelated changes: to correct a drafting error and a substantive alteration which is meant to strengthen our aviation security regulatory arrangements. To deal with the technical amendment initially, the bill before the House remedies a drafting error which was contained within a 2011 amendment to the Aviation Transport Security Act as you just heard from the Nationals leader. The earlier bill incorrectly amended subsection 65(3)(b) of the act instead of 65(3)(c), so it is obviously necessary to alter that. The other more substantive amendment contained within the bill will introduce provisions to allow the minister of the day, through disallowable instrument, to stop the carriage of certain types of cargo into Australia on aircraft. This is obviously very necessary because of emerging technologies and because of the ever present danger as there are many mad and bad people out there who would threaten the security and peace of Australian society. In October 2010, terrorist operating from Yemen concealed improvised explosive devices inside printers. There is no stopping these people. They sent them as a cargo consignments to",213,Bills
273,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (10:38,"The Aviation Transport Security Amendmentthe United States of America. Fortunately, intelligence information led to the successful interception of these packages in Great Britain and the United Arab Emirates, and they never reached their intended destinations, their targets. They were meant to maim and kill people and it was necessary to stop them, and fortunately that did happen. In Australia, the government responded by increasing security requirements for cargo from Somalia and Yemen using a special security direction issued to regulated air cargo agents. This was absolutely essential. This required the screening of all inbound air cargo arriving from the Middle East. Later special security directions were used to ban the carriage of cargo from Somalia and Yemen altogether. However, special security directions were formulated as a measure to deal efficiently with new security threats and, as we know, they are ever present. They were not meant to be a way by which the government could address longer-term ongoing threats to Australian security, because the special security directions have a maximum time frame of just six months. Under present arrangements, the ongoing prohibition of air cargo consignments from Somalia and Yemen has required all aircraft operators to amend transport security programs. This entails aircraft operators to manually amend security documentation to be assessed and individually approved by the department. This is an onerous task and it is not suited to a timely or fast response to a serious ongoing national security threat which obviously needs to be nipped in the bud instantly. To address this concern, the bill will introduce a new provision whereby the minister can propose a disallowable instrument to prohibit the carriage of certain types of cargo into our country, and obviously our security is paramount. The instrument may be so broad as to prohibit all air cargo entering Australian territory or be limited to a particular type of cargo or types of cargo depending on the nature of the posed threat. As the minister noted in his second reading speech, the disallowable instrument could cover cargo originating from a particular country or countries, cargo packaged in a particular way or cargo weighing particular amounts. The bill also creates a strict liability offence, as we heard from the member for Wide Bay, for failing to comply with an instrument made by the minister under this mechanism, and imposes a penalty of $17,000 for individuals and $34,000 for aircraft operators. This amendment will ensure that current and future governments are able to respond appropriately and necessarily to emerging but ongoing security threats and will reduce the administrative burden on industry, and therefore they are supported by the coalition. Airport security in regional areas is also obviously of paramount importance. If you fly from Wagga Wagga on a Rex plane, you do not go through security measures but if you fly Qantas then you do. This has caused a bit of a problem for the Griffith community, which has lost its connection to Melbourne. The President of the Griffith Business Chamber, Paul Pierotti, has hit out at Dubbo City Council's decision to charge all users of the regional airport security screening fees, describing it as short sighted in the extreme. Mr Pierotti said Griffith was desperate to get a Melbourne flight link after Rex closed its service in June. He said Rex flew between 60,000 and 90,000 passengers a year to Sydney but closed its Melbourne service because of cost pressures within the company. It was unfortunate to lose the service because many people in Griffith need to fly to Melbourne for business and other purposes. Hopefully, a resolution can be forged between the Griffith and Dubbo councils and hopefully that will be soon. It does concern airport security. It is a necessary thing for the people of Griffith and I urge the minister to do whatever he can to help that process along. Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (10:45): I thank the members for their contribution and I thank the fact that this legislation will receive the unanimous support of the House. The introduction of the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Inbound Cargo Security Enhancement) Bill 2013 is an important step in strengthening Australia's air cargo security measures. The attempted cargo bomb plot on 29 October 2010 involved improvised explosive devices hidden in printers on air consignments sent from Yemen to the United States. I was in London at the time and, with my officials, had briefings on the incident from the appropriate British authorities. There was a concern that the consignments potentially could explode over British air space. The incident clearly demonstrated the potential for terrorists to stage attacks using the global air cargo system. In responding to the Yemen incident, my department issued special security directions to prohibit air cargo originating in or transiting Yemen or Somalia from being carried to Australia. Upon the expiration of those directions, the prohibition was continued, with my department directing relevant aviation industry participants to vary their transport security programs. Although this additional measure achieved the desired affect, varying security programs is cumbersome and creates an excessive administrative burden for both industry and government. The new powers conferred by this bill change that. The ability for the minister to prohibit certain inbound cargo from entering Australia through the use of a disallowable instrument provides the government with a mechanism to respond effectively and efficiently on a national basis to security threats. In preparing this bill my department consulted extensively with other government agencies to ensure that all security, trade and foreign affairs issues were explored. No decision to prohibit inbound air cargo will be taken without consultation with the ministers for foreign affairs and trade, and that is appropriate. Additionally, a disallowable instrument created under this legislation is subject to an appropriate level of scrutiny, transparency and accountability by the parliament. The government is committed to ensuring the safety and security of Australians and Australian interests. We wish that this did not have to occur but we have to deal with the world as it is rather than as we would like it to be. There are threats to our security and the consequences for our economy of a security incident on an Australian aircraft mean that we need to put in place measures which ensure diligence, which ensure appropriate overview and which ensure a legislative framework that gives confidence to the Australian public that the government ensures their safety is the first priority. The passage of this bill will provide the government with a sound, transparent and effective legal basis to mitigate specific threats that may arise in the global air cargo system.

Court Security (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013 Court Security Bill 2013 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Security (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013. The bills seek to implement a new framework for the security arrangements of all Commonwealth courts, including the Family Court of Western Australia and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It removes the courts and tribunals currently covered by the provisions of the Public Order Act and replaces it with an updated security framework. The Court Security Bill 2013 responds to concerns raised by the heads of jurisdiction of the federal courts. The current Public Order Act does not meet the security needs of the modern court environment. The bill aims to ensure that the courts are able to reduce the risk of security incidents where possible and, if needed, respond appropriately to incidents as they arise. The consequences from a breach of security in these circumstances are a serious issue and it is vital that all cases before these courts are heard without fear, intimidation and/or violence. The Court Security Bill 2013 seeks to amend the current legislative framework for the Commonwealth court and tribunal security arrangements as would expand the range of powers available to security officers and authorised court officers. Current security at most of the federal courts and tribunal premises has been provided through security guards, but under current legislation it assumes that there is a presence of police officers on the court premises, which is most often not the case. As a result, security officers are uncertain of their powers to temporarily detain people of concern or confiscate certain materials. The current legislative framework does not contain an appropriate range of powers and the necessary safeguards when exercising these powers. The bill seeks to implement a comprehensive framework which will enable the federal courts and tribunals to manage a wide range of security issues that they face. The courts will be able to appoint security officers and authorised court officers and clearly establish the powers that these officers are able to exercise. The powers outlined in this bill include search and screening powers, powers to give directions and limited powers to use necessary and reasonable force. However, only appropriately trained and licensed security officers will be able to use force in clearly defined circumstances as outlined in this bill. As well as the safeguards of appropriate training and licensing, this bill also provides safeguards in the form of identification requirements, complaints mechanisms and oversight by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The bill allows that for times when security officers are not present at all courts-especially the case at regional courts-the court officers may exercise a limited range of basic security powers when necessary. The range of powers that may be exercised differs between security officers and authorised court officers. Only security officers will be able to exercise the broader range of powers. The bill prescribes certain offences related to non-compliance with the exercise of the powers of security officers and",216,Bills
275,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (10:51,"I rise to talk on the Court Security Bill 2013 and Courtauthorised court officers. Security officers are provided with the power to escort people to and from court premises as a protective measure. Given the different security needs of the courts and tribunals, this bill seeks to implement flexible security arrangements to cover a range of different guarding arrangements. The bill balances a person's right to enter and remain upon court premises with the rights of judicial officers, court staff and members of the public to a safe and secure environment. The Court Security (Consequential Amendments) Bill replaces the current security framework for federal courts and tribunals under the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971. The current framework is outdated and does not meet the security requirements of our current courts and tribunals. The bill allows for the implementation of this new framework, and will achieve this by removing the existing provisions in the public order act, in order to prevent the provisions from overlapping with the court security bill. The government contends that the bills have been developed in consultation with the Commonwealth courts and tribunals. As I have previously noted, concerns have been raised by the heads of jurisdiction of the Commonwealth courts that the existing framework for court security does not meet the needs of the modern court environment. It is unclear how frequently security incidents are arising on court premises and how adequate are the current security arrangements. However, the consequences of a breach of security in the circumstances are very serious issues, and the measures proposed in the bill seem reasonable and proportionate. It is important that cases are heard without fear, intimidation or violence. These bills provide the necessary powers so that the security needs of the modern court environment are now sufficiently clear. These bills ensure that our courts and tribunals are safe and secure places for members of the public to have their disputes heard, and they are therefore worthy of support by this House. minister, most importantly, as he stated, that the existing framework for court security does not meet the needs of the modern court environment. That was a concern raised by the heads of jurisdiction of the Commonwealth courts, following consultation with the government in relation to this bill and in relation to the provisions of current court security arrangements. Certainly, our courts are the hallmark of our democracy-as is the parliament-and the people working in those courts, whether they be officers of the Crown, police officers, or whether they be defendants or people involved in cases, need to have proper security and adequate security measures. They need to know that when they attend court they can do so in a safe environment. This bill goes part of the way, or all of the way, towards helping to improve these arrangements so that people can have that safety and security in the knowledge that they can attend court in a safe environment. The consequences of a breach of security in these circumstances are a serious issue, and the measures proposed in this bill seem adequate and proportionate. It is important that cases are heard, as the shadow minister just related, without fear, violence or intimidation. The powers that appointed security officers and authorised court officers may exercise in respect of screening, giving directions or removing a person from court premises appear, according to this bill, reasonable and necessary to enhance the security of the federal courts. Furthermore, the measures proposed in the bill may go part of the way to providing court users-particularly those who reasonably fear attending court proceedings and unfortunately",217,Bills
276,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (10:56,"I rise to support the words of the shadowthat is a great number of people-with improved certainty that their case will be heard in a safe and secure environment. The Court Security Bill 2013 and the associated consequential amendments bill make substantive alterations to security provisions by the Commonwealth courts and the tribunals. Unfortunately, it is a necessary bill that we need to implement. It seeks to implement the current legislative framework for Commonwealth court and tribunal security arrangements, and would expand the range of powers available to security officers and authorised court officers, who need to know that their work is important and that the important work they do can be conducted in a safe environment. The new security arrangements will be uniform across all Commonwealth courts, including the Family Court of Western Australia and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Family courts, as we all know, are places where tempers can rise. They are places where there is a lot of emotion and sometimes emotion boils over into fear, intimidation and violence. Hopefully, this bill will make it a far more secure and safe environment for all those people attending the court whatever the necessity. Presently the legislative framework for security at Commonwealth courts and tribunals is contained in part IIA of the Public Order (Provision of Persons and Property) Act 1971. This legislation is outdated. It needs to be improved upon. It needs to be regulated such that it brings it up to speed with 2013 expectations. This bill and amendment do just that and the coalition therefore supports it. measures contained in the Court Security Bill and the accompanying Court Security (Consequential Amendments) Bill help to make sure that federal court and tribunal premises are safe and secure for people to resolve disputes. Those people using courts are often under stress and in distress. Court processes can be daunting and financially costly, particularly for those matters involving family law. I can say, with more than two decades of practice in the jurisdiction of family law, that you see from time to time the stress, anger and hostility that people face in the courts. Everyone who goes to court should go there without fear of intimidation, violence or abuse. This right forms a critical part of any civil society and is also important in ensuring the integrity of the court processes. I stress that these security arrangements and enhancements will not quite make court buildings or rights of entry more difficult or arduous for members of the public, rather they are there as a necessity to ensure that people, even in the most trying of difficult circumstances, can be confident that they can go to the courts and have their disputes resolved in a safe and amiable environment. This Court Security Bill is a product of the government's close consultation with the federal courts and tribunals to identify a more effective security framework. That framework established by this piece of legislation is comprehensive. It will support the federal courts and tribunals in making sure that any serious security issues they face across the various locations across Australia are addressed. They will be flexible enough in different security arrangements to deal with those. The enhanced powers conferred on security officers and authorised court officers by the bill will prevent security incidents from arising on those premises. Where they arise, they ensure that those particularly appointed officials and officers can deal with them expeditiously and appropriately.",218,Bills

These include: licensing, training and identification requirements. These safeguards are important. They ensure that the powers authorised by the bill are used responsibly in appropriate circumstances by people with good training, appropriate skills and education. The courts will still call on the police, as they should, in the most serious situations. However, given that security incidents can arise with little warning, almost a moment's notice, and can erupt very violently with tremendous anger and abuse, it is important that the courts have security and safety at the forefront, and ensure that the safety and security of the premises are secured before the police arrive on the premises. The bills appropriately modernise the legal framework for the courts and tribunal security arrangements. They ensure that those accessing our courts and tribunals can be confident in the safety and security of the premises they attend to have their cases heard and can have their arguments heard before a court without abuse, intimidation and violence.

The items to be amended in schedule 4 are items 20, 21, 27, 30 and 35. The bill makes technical amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to specifically reference goods as part of a batch repair process in item 20, to remove reference to industrial processing in item 21, to remove reference to 'value' and 'amount' in item 27, to reinsert 'wheelchairs' and remove reference to 'invalid carriages' in item 30; reinsert 'tons' and remove reference to 'tonnes' in item 35. The bill also streamlines the assessment of concessional duties in relation to goods imported for industrial processing and subsequent export. The proposed amendments will alter wording and fix typos in the bill so it is consistent with the intentions of schedule 4. This bill makes necessary minor amendments to the Customs Tariff Amendment (Schedule 4) Act 2012, and the coalition supports these amendments as uncontroversial. Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (11:09): I thank the member for Stirling, who did his best to make this bill Dickensian, Austenian or Shakespearean. I thank him for speaking on the bill. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill will amend schedule 4 of the customs tariff. Schedule4 delivers a wide range of tariff concessions which have the effect of reducing or removing the normal rate of customs duty that would otherwise apply for imported goods. Following a review of the schedule by the Better Regulation Ministerial Partnership, the Customs Tariff Amendment (Schedule 4) Act 2012 was passed by the parliament in 2012. This act sought to simplify the schedule and to consolidate items with similar coverage. Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2013, tabled in the House of Representatives during February 2013, gave effect to minor amendments to five items: 20, 21, 27, 30 and 35 in the revised Schedule 4. These amendments were necessary to ensure that the scope and duty rates of the concessional items were preserved. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2013 will formally incorporate these amendments into the Customs Tariff Act. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. National Measurement Amendment Bill 2013 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment Bill 2013 I note that the government is arguing that the principal reason for the introduction of this legislation is to correct deficiencies, obviously identified during the first two years of operation of the national trade measurement system. Assuming that that truly is the intent, the coalition is prepared to provide support for the bill. On the face of what is being presented to us, through the bill and the associated explanatory memorandum, we do not have a problem with the six sets of changes listed on pages 4 and 5 of the explanatory memorandum, and if the changes that the government proposes to legislate through this bill",220,Bills
279,Mr Neumann (Blair,Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing and,221,Bills
280,Mrs Mirabella (Indi) (11:11,"In rising to speak on the National Measurementdo genuinely overcome a number of unforeseen problems, and in fact improve the practical operation of the act, then naturally those are outcomes that we support and that are completely uncontroversial to us. However, I do want to point out that it is now nearly three years since the introduction of the national trade measurement system and it is therefore something of a concern that we are still having to consider multiple changes to the provisions that accompanied its introductionnot to mention that this is not the first time that this has happened. But I suppose we should not be particularly surprised about that! When the coalition asked very specifically, through a Senate estimates question on notice in 2011, about what problems and unforeseen consequences had arisen following the transfer of state responsibilities to the national level through the new trade measurement system, we did not receive a clear answer to that question at all. Instead, we got what now seems to pass as a largely meaningless, stock-standard estimates answer from this government that completely avoided the question, albeit that I suppose we should probably have felt privileged to have even received an answer at all, given that, from the most recent estimates round, there are something like 150 out of 184 questions that still have not been answered after around three months of waiting. And it is not as if the government has been preoccupying itself and the bureaucracy with good policy and a vision for this country. But hopefully the Australian people will be relieved of the burden of the worse administration at the national level since Federation. But going back specifically to the question at hand, that answer back in 2011 to question B1-85 was: 'A report on the transition to a national scheme has been prepared by the NMI in consultation with other Australian, state and territory officials. The report, which covers all aspects of the transition, was released in July'-that is 2011-'and is available on the website at www.measurement.gov.au.' In other words, the department and the government were not interested in going anywhere near answering the direct question of whether there were specific problems with the rollout of the system. Reading between the lines of that answer, it was not hard to draw the conclusion that the problems clearly were being experienced at that time, but it is only much later down the track that we are learning exactly what they are. It is very poor that the government was not up-front with us back then-again, no surprise. If there are further problems that have not been identified as part of this bill or a predecessor version at the end of 2010, now is the time for the government to finally stop hiding from scrutiny and publicly spell out some of these issues. And it should be very clear about how and why some elements of the system have not been working. In closing, let me restate my earlier comment that the coalition will support changes that genuinely eradicate unforeseen problems and improve the practical operation of the act. But I am increasingly concerned, each time a bill such as this is presented to the House, that we can be completely sure that that is the case or that there is not a range of other problems that are also still waiting to be addressed even after three years. Measurement Amendment Bill 2013, which deals with an area of our economy that does not get much newsprint attention but that is a deeply important area for the way Australia works. I will deal with the specifics of the bill first. This is a bill that deals with a number of technical amendments to the National Measurement Act, specifically through clarifying the offence and non-compliance approaches associated with ensuring the application of particular offences",221,Bills
281,Mr Marles (Corio) (11:16,"I rise this morning with pleasure to support the Nationalbeing directed to appropriate persons. To clarify, at the moment it is an offence to adjust or repair an instrument in a way that affects its measurement accuracy without also obliterating its verification mark. This amendment will separate the offences so that the offences will apply separately to the person who carries out the adjustment and to the person who causes the adjustment to be made. It is a technical measure but important nevertheless. The bill will also better empower trade measurement inspectors so that they are able to deal with and resolve minor issues by providing, under the act, 28-day periods in which traders can resolve the issues that have been raised by the inspectors. It also empowers inspectors to deal with vehicles, for example, and have them moved to particular locations. There are also a number of definitional alterations in this bill. For example, the definition of 'use for trade' will be amended to embrace the determination of fuel tax credits under circumstances to be prescribed in regulations following consultation amongst the Treasury, the ATO and the National Measurement Institute. Also, the definitions of 'reference standard of measurement', 'certified reference material' and 'certified measuring instrument' will be altered to bring them into alignment and to clarify the period for which the standards are in effect. Having articulated the significance of this particular bill in the context of our framework around national measurement, I will make the point that this occurs as a result of a COAG process that was undertaken by this Labor government to simplify the measurement framework of this country by taking eight trade measurement systems that used to exist under the state systems and bringing them down into one. Trade measurement is at the heart of $4 billion worth of trade in Australia's economy every year. As we have sought to reduce regulation in this country, sought to reduce red tape and sought to harmonise our system of laws, this has been an unsung measure but one that has brought enormous benefit to people throughout the economy so that they are now dealing with one system of trade measurement throughout Australia. The amendments today are important technical amendments associated with that bigger push that was achieved back in 2009. Weights and measures are at the foundation of our economy. In this context I would also like to say something about the National Measurement Institute, the agency that oversees trade measurement in this country and our system of weights and measures. The National Measurement Institute is the custodian of deep science. For example, it is the National Measurement Institute that houses Australia's three atomic clocks, which are Australia's contribution to the very definition of time in this world. It is the National Measurement Institute that houses Australia's kilogram, which is based on the original kilogram in Paris and is the fundamental measurement of weight in Australia. It is interesting to note that the measurement of a kilogram is the only significant measure that exists in the world today that is still based on an artefact-that is, on a reference point of the original kilogram. There is an international effort to try to redefine mass based on a constant of the universe, such as the speed of light. In this case a couple of approaches are going on, one of which is to try to define precisely Avogadro's constant. It is all very scientific, and it is all work that is being undertaken by the National Measurement Institute and which forms part of the international collaborative effort to try to redefine the very nature whereby we define mass. If you go to the laboratories of the NMI you see dedicated Australian scientists undertaking fantastic work, and you realise the significance of that entity as well as just how important the National Measurement Institute is to the science infrastructure of our country. You can see it in an esoteric way, if I can put it like that, when you look at the person-and I met him-who goes to work every day to try to work out Avogadro's constant; he has a great job. And you see it in the way, as this bill talks about, the National Measurement Institute oversees trade measurement, which is absolutely fundamental to our economy. When you go to the supermarket and you measure the weight of your vegetables, the weight of your apples or the weight of your bananas and when you go to the petrol station and take out a volume of fuel, all of these involve measurement instruments that form part of our trade measurement system. That is what we are talking about when we say we have unified all those systems of trade measurement into one national system, and that is what this particular amendment seeks to do in relation to that. In commending this particular bill to the House, I would also like to commend the harmonisation of trade measurement laws in this country that has been undertaken by this Labor government. I would also very much like to commend the fantastic work undertaken by the National Measurement Institute. I commend the bill to the House. parliamentary colleague the shadow minister for innovation, industry and science-who, I might add, was in Wagga Wagga on 11 April at a manufacturing forum with business leaders of the region discussing their problems, their concerns and their issues. It is always important that parliamentary secretaries, shadow ministers and indeed ministers hear the words from the mouths of those business leaders who-let's face it-are the engine room of the Australian economy. The National Measurement Amendment Bill 2013 might not sound important in the scheme of things but indeed it is, because, as consumers, we need to know, when we go to the supermarket or when we go to a hardware store, that what we are purchasing is in fact the right size and does in fact weigh the right amount. It is very, very important. This bill makes a series of uncontroversial changes to the National Measurement Act 1960 to correct deficiencies identified during the first two years of operation of the national trade measurement system. The amendments will provide discretion for trade measurement inspectors to permit measuring instruments which do not meet the strict requirements of the act to remain in use for a limited time of up to 28 days, provided there will be no material detriment to any affected person, generally the consumer. It will introduce a new offence to ensure trade measurement inspectors can access business vehicles to undertake inspections in accordance with the intent of the legislation; clarify the offence of not obliterating an existing verification mark if an instrument is repaired or adjusted in such a way as would affect its performance; clarify the definition of 'use for trade' to include instruments which may be used to determine a tax, regardless of whether it is the imposition of a tax or determination of a tax credit; ensure that where goods are purchased based on measurement the purchaser either can see the result of the measurement or is provided with a written statement identifying the actual measurement; make other minor and technical amendments to facilitate the working of the act; and importantly, and finally, allow trade measurement inspectors to carry out investigations in public areas without first announcing their presence to the proprietors of the business. On that last point I add a word of caution. We have seen all too often in the past that sometimes people-bureaucrats, even, dare I say, union officials-could barge into businesses and workplaces around the country and halt production in order to carry out their",222,Bills
282,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (11:23,"It is always good to follow on from mybusiness. Often this was with good intent, but all too often we saw business people's production stopped and people downing tools because these people were on their premises without the business owner's knowledge. I air a word of caution that that provision of this bill will need to be spelt out very correctly and finely in the final detail of the bill to ensure that we do not see bureaucrats, bovver boys and people without good intent coming into business places and stopping production just to ensure that they tick their boxes and fill out their time sheets to make sure that they are doing what they are doing. We need to make sure that businesses are advised and are aware. Obviously, we cannot afford to have dodgy businesses and dodgy operators selling people materials that are underweight or under measure, but we certainly need to ensure that business is able to carry on with the great job that it does on behalf of this nation. Change and Energy Efficiency) (11:27): I thank all of the members for their contributions to the debate on this amendment bill concerning national measurements. The government is very pleased with the progress of the national system of trade measurement since it came into operation in July 2010. Obviously, that was an important and common-sense reform, because moving from eight trade measurement systems to one national system is an important business regulation reform. It makes it simpler for business and more straightforward and sound for consumers. The advent of the new national system has removed the previous inconsistencies in trade measurement and has reduced costs to companies operating nationally. The National Measurement Amendment Bill 2013 will amend the National Measurement Act 1960 in order to correct some minor issues identified since the commencement of the trade measurement provisions under the Commonwealth legislation, so that the bill, as we have heard in a number of the contributions and in the second reading speech that I gave in introducing the bill, will facilitate the work of trade measurement inspectors in dealing with cases of non-compliance with the act. It will clarify the controls an inspector can use to ensure that businesses do comply with the act and its regulations and how the inspector can go about determining whether a business is compliant or not, under the act. There will in fact be greater flexibility in allowing businesses to resolve minor infringements in a reasonable time frame, which addresses the concerns raised by some of the previous speakers on the other side. This will especially benefit remote communities with few retail outlets, without detriment to consumers. It allows more flexibility in the sorts of constituencies that the previous speaker was referring to. The bill will also amend several minor or technical definitions of the act so as to clarify its interpretation and streamline the operation of some of its provisions. In summary, the National Measurement Amendment Bill 2013 brings legislative certainty to aspects of the trade measurement inspector's role. It will increase the effectiveness of the operation of the national system of trade measurement and its flexibility. I commend the bill to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.",224,Bills
283,Mr Combet (Charlton,"Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for ClimateVeterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Military Compensation Review and Other Measures) Bill 2013 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. the Campbell review of military compensation arrangements. The review was a 2007 Labor election commitment. Regrettably, it has taken six long years-or 120 days until the election-for Labor to conclude this. Clearly, veterans are not a great priority for this government. The review made 108 recommendations and the Labor government has adopted 94 of them. A further two will be enhanced. The total package is worth about $39 million over the forward estimates, at a net cost to the Commonwealth of about $17.4 million. There are 16 schedules, 13 of which deal directly to 13 recommendations of the review that require legislative amendments. The Campbell review was chaired by former secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs Mr Ian Campbell PSM. It principally investigated compensation arrangements for the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, the MRCA. By way of background, regrettably, in March 1996 outside of Townsville an Army training accident involving a Blackhawk helicopter led to the death of 18 personnel and the serious injury of a further 12. At the time it was found that the death and ancillary compensation arrangements for peacetime training accidents were inadequate. It followed the Tanzer review, which recommended a new modern compensation scheme be adopted for military personnel wounded, injured or incapacitated during their Defence service. The previous coalition government consulted extensively about the legislation. It was tabled in parliament in 2003. At the time of its introduction former Minister for Veterans' Affairs Ms Vale said that the new bill combined the very best elements of the older Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the VEA, and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. The new legislation placed a heavy focus on rehabilitation, encouraging those able to do so to re-enter the workforce following acceptance of conditions under the legislation. Unlike the older VEA, which pays a pension for life, the MRCA gave affected ex-service personnel and their families the choice of a lump-sum payment or enabled a mix of a lump-sum and weekly payments. Under this legislation eligible ex-service personnel continue to have their health care covered at Australian government expense. That is the history. That is where we came from. In the election campaign in 2007 Labor promised to review the MRCA. However, despite their good intentions in 2007, suffice to say that the process has been slow. The review process began in 2008, and in February 2011 the government was handed the outcome. They did not formally respond until the May 2012 budget, and the introduction of the legislation in March 2013, five sitting weeks before the scheduled dissolution of parliament, is disappointing in the extreme. When asked about the government's proposed time line, Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Senator David Feeney told Senate estimates that the pursuit of a non-existent budget",225,Bills
284,Mr Robert (Fadden) (11:31,"This bill implements the adopted recommendations ofsurplus was more important than delivering improvements to military compensation sooner. It is disappointing for everyone. We are pleased to see the review and that it has found that MRCA is operating soundly and is in need of only minor improvements. The improvements being made in this legislation are important. They have our support. Following the introduction of the legislation the coalition quite rightly initiated a Senate inquiry to ensure that the veterans and ex-service community, and indeed the wider community, had an opportunity to comment on this important legislation and its review. The wider the comment, the sounder the outcome. That is a lesson we should all learn. Submissions acknowledged that the proposed legislation mirrored the recommendations adopted by the government and for the most part supported its passage. Our concerns-and they should be tabled-are that it has taken the government until now to partially adopt recommendation 25.1 regarding the extension of non-liability mental health care treatment to veterans and ex-service people. We also note that this entitlement will not be available until 1 July next year. Recommendation 25.1, and the position preferred by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, by Defence and by the independent analysis from Peter Sutherland, said that the government should consider providing non-liability health cover under MRCA for certain psychiatric conditions to all former members of the ADF and part-time reservists who have served after 1 July 2004. Typically, Finance, Treasury and DEEWR preferred a wait-and-see approach, saying that more information was required before a final decision was taken. You have had only six years: how much more information do you want? This occurred over the last 12 months and resulted in an announcement on 3 May in the Defence white paper of a limited increase in entitlements back to 1994, but only when the ex-service personnel had a minimum of three years equivalent full-time service. This $14.6 million extension, whilst welcome, is at odds with the original recommendation from DVA and Defence, and further information will be sought through the Senate estimates period coming up shortly. Similarly, the budget does not provide any funding for additional advocacy funding support, which unfortunately continues Labor's neglect of grassroots veterans advocacy in the community. Labor's decision two years ago to strip $4 million from the BEST funding will only make it more difficult for younger veterans and their families to access independent advice and support for making claims. The government's announcement of additional taxpayer funds to reduce administrative process times in the department is surely an admission that their cuts to the BEST program and advocacy funding have had an impact on the timely determination of compensation claims, and I fail to see how it can be taken any other way. The gaping hole in this budget was, however, the lack of commitment by this government to fair indexation. It is a fair point and it should be made. For those veterans and ex-service personnel and their families listening to this or reading it, let me reaffirm the coalition's commitment: we will deliver fair indexation in the coalition's first budget. The Leader of the Opposition has signed that pledge twice, first at the Bendigo RSL and second at Queanbeyan only one or two months ago, where I joined him for the signing, and personally signed myself to it. If there is a change of government, the unfair, unjust and inequitable indexation arrangements facing DFRDB and DFRB military superannuants aged 55 and over will also change. This can only happen with a change of government. If elected on 14 September, in next May's budget we will deliver fair indexation-no ifs, no buts. Under our changes, on 1 July next year the pensions of those in DFRB and DFRDB will increase by the same factor as age and service pensions. Having gone through the history of the bill and some of its flaws, and having reaffirmed the coalition's position on the indexation of military superannuation, it is important to look at the 16 schedules, 13 of which relate to adopted recommendations of the review. As I said at the start of this, the coalition will provide the minister with support for the bill. Schedule1 is on rehabilitation and transition management. The amendments enhance rehabilitation services and transition management. Chapter7 of the review dealt with transition management between Defence and DVA. It found that a greater consistency in transition across the services is more likely if the CDF was coordinating transition rather than leaving it, as is the case, to the chiefs of each individual service. The amendments will also give part-time reservist personnel access to transition management assistance for the first time under any legislation, which is a good thing. These amendments will redesignate the responsibility of the service chiefs for the rehabilitation of our soldiers, sailors and airmen and airwomen to the CDF. Schedule2 is on compensation for permanent impairment. The amendments in schedule 2 make the date of effect for periodic impairment compensation to be on the basis of each accepted condition rather than all accepted conditions and to incorporate a lifestyle factor in the calculation of interim permanent impairment compensation. Under the current arrangements, compensation is paid only once all claims for compensation have been assessed. This has been found to be a somewhat lengthy process. By paying compensation from the date at which liability for each condition is accepted, compensation will flow to members and former members of the ADF presumably much sooner. The schedule also relates to compensation offsetting arrangements. This amendment will grant those already assessed under the old offsetting formula the ability to have their compensation reassessed under the new compensation offsetting formula methodology. This is supported by the veteran and ex-service community and clearly by the coalition. Schedule3 will see expanded lump sum options for wholly dependent partners. The amendments expand the options for lump sum compensation for wholly dependent partners of deceased members. Chapter9 of the review dealt with the death benefit provisions of MRCA. It recommended the simplification and streamlining of current arrangements. Currently, where a member's death is service related his or her wholly dependent partner is eligible to receive a lifetime periodic payment, a war widow or war widower pension, an additional death benefit, a repatriation health card for all conditions-let us call it a gold card-and a range of other benefits, depending upon their circumstances. This amendment simplifies the payment arrangements by combining the current age based lump sum, an actuarial calculation of the war widow or war widower pension against life tables and the additional death benefit to create a new combined lump sum, making the package simpler and demonstrably easier to understand. It will also give partners a choice of converting their pension into a lifetime lump sum or into 25 per cent, 50 per cent or 75 per cent as a lump sum, with the balance a weekly pension. Schedule4 is about weekly compensation for eligible young persons. The amendments put in place a one-time increase in the rate of periodic compensation payable for dependent children so that the rate aligns with similar payments under SRCA. In 2004, the rates of payment under MRCA were the same as those under SRCA. However, changes made in 2008 to SRCA broke this nexus, if we can call it that, and they increased dramatically. Currently, SRCA payments are about $130.89 a week, whereas the MRCA payment is about $87.57 a week. Aligning these makes sense. Schedule5 is about compensation for financial advice and legal advice, with the new limit rising to $2,400. In schedule 6, the amendments expand the eligibility rate for special rate disability pensions. The expanded criteria will include a person who would otherwise meet the criteria in section 199 of MRCA except for the person having received a lump sum incapacity payment under section 138 or for the person receiving a nil rate of incapacity payment because the amount of the incapacity payment is fully offset by Commonwealth superannuation. Schedule6 does not relate to a specific recommendation of the review but rather an observation found in paragraph 11.43. The ex-service community strongly endorses these changed arrangements and they certainly make some sense. The amendments in schedule 7 make changes to certain superannuation provisions so they apply equally to both serving and former members and amend the definition of 'Commonwealth superannuation scheme'. Chapter 12 of the review considered the interoperation of military superannuation and the military compensation arrangements. The committee noted that this was not an in-depth analysis but 'did note the complexities of administration of invalidity and death benefits' and recommended an analysis across government of how to streamline the administration of these arrangements. The government accepted this recommendation. But no information about the progress of this analysis has been forthcoming. Suffice to say, Minister, we will further examine it at Senate estimates. I ask the minister for further details on the progress on this particular recommendation. Schedule8 is about the remittal powers of the Veterans Review Board. They provide the Veterans Review Board with an explicit power to remit a matter to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission for needs assessment and compensation. The streamlining of the claims appeals process is certainly welcomed by the veteran and ex-service community. It will make it easier for veterans to appeal decisions about their compensation and give veterans with claims under MRCA largely the same appeals system as those under the VEA. Schedule9 amendments increase the membership of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission from five members to six. We note that the review recommends that the additional appointee be someone like the Director of Joint Health Command. Our view is that this would be for the most part a sensible appointment and we look forward to the government confirming this particular appointment to the compensation commission. The amendments in schedule 10 require all claims for conditions accepted under the VEA and aggravated by Defence service after 1 July 2004 to be determined under the VEA rather than there being a choice offered between the VEA and MRCA, which is currently the case. We agree with all of that. The amendments in schedule 11 will enable the issuing of repatriation health cards for specific conditions to part 11 Defence related claimants under SRCA-let us call them white cards. This initiative is intended to achieve consistency in treatment arrangements for all former Defence Force members. SRCA members with an injury accepted under SRCA as being related to SRCA-let us call that a SRCA related injury-will be entitled to treatment for a SRCA injury either under MRCA or the VEA in accordance with arrangements established under those various acts. This change is supported in principle. Concerns have been raised about the operation of these proposed new arrangements. Similarly, providers are worried that they will be forced to charge lower rates for services that they are currently providing at higher rates. DVA has informed us that the consultation with the industry is ongoing and this will be pursued at Senate estimates, Minister, to alleviate our concerns on exactly how this would operate. It sounds all right. The devil, as in many cases, will be in the detail. The amendments in schedule 12 define Defence members undergoing career transition, personnel holding honorary ranks and authorised representatives of philanthropic organisations as members under MRCA. That is fair enough. The amendments in schedule 13 clarify the appropriation of costs for certain aged care services between VEA, the Australian Participants in Nuclear Test Treatment Act and MRCA and the Aged Care Act 1997 and the Aged Care (Consequential Provisions) Act 1997. That is fair enough. The amendments in schedule 14 will extend the entitlements for travelling expenses to the partner of certain eligible persons under certain conditions. The VEA currently only provides for the veteran to be paid a travelling allowance when attending medical appointments to treat accepted conditions. In circumstances in which the veteran's attendant, a carer, needs to accompany the veteran, travelling expenses may be met. The amendments in schedule 15 will clarify and streamline the administrative arrangements for the payment of pensions, compensation and other pecuniary benefits under the VEA and the MRCA into appropriate bank accounts. The amendments in schedule 16 include a minor and consequential amendment to the Social Security Act 1991 that clarifies which payments made under MRCA are excluded income for the purposes of the Social Security Act. Suffice to say, the coalition is happy to support the passage of this legislation through the House. It will go to the Senate and be further considered at the end of June. We will not in any way seek to hold up the passage of the legislation, which we believe provides benefits to veterans, ex-service personnel and their families. We look forward, Minister, to the swift passage of the legislation through the House and the Senate, noting that there are only four and a little bit weeks left, of which two weeks are for the Senate estimates, which literally leaves only two weeks for legislation to be passed in the Senate. I will leave that to you, Minister, to sort through. Amendment (Military Compensation Review and Other Measures) Bill 2013. This bill is a further step in implementing the recommendations of the Campbell review of military compensation agreements. It has taken two terms of this Labor government to conclude. That review was commissioned to investigate compensation arrangements under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. The last coalition government tabled the legislation as a measure to improve previous legislation that covered military compensationnamely, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the VEA; and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988.

The new legislation placed a heavy focus on rehabilitation, encouraging those able to do so to re-enter the workforce following acceptance of conditions under the legislation. The most recent review process began in 2008 and has been very slow. In February 2011, the government was handed the outcome but did not respond formally until the May 2012 budget. I understand that the total package of amendments is worth over $39 million over the forward estimates, with a net cost to the Commonwealth of $17.4 million. This bill contains 16 schedules, 13 of which deal directly with the 13 recommendations of the review that require legislative amendment. I have spoken several times before in this House on many issues that affect the veteran community. Although today's bill comprises mainly minor amendments, it is worthy of our consideration. I note that this particular bill was only introduced on 20 March 2013 and the coalition initiated a Senate inquiry to ensure that the veteran and ex-service community and the wider community had an opportunity to comment on the legislation. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the many constituents in my electorate who work tirelessly with ex-service organisations to get a better deal for veterans. This has been an ongoing issue for the veteran community across several ministers. For more than 12 years, Roderic Thompson in my electorate has held voluntary positions within both the RSL and the Veterans Support and Advocacy Service Australia. He has been a level 4 practicing advocate and has held the national executive position of National Entitlements Officer for the Australian Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Veterans Association. One important measure is the adoption of recommendation 25.1 of the Campbell review regarding the extension of non-liability mental health care treatment to veterans and ex-service people, which will not be available until 1 July next year. In relation to today's bill, I know that Rod continues to have concerns about how we treat veterans who may fall under different versions of veterans compensation legislation-for example, whether a service man or service woman falls under MEA, SRCA or MRCA. This relates to recommendation 25.1 regarding the consideration of providing non-liability health cover under MRCA for certain psychiatric conditions to all former members of the ADF and part-time reservists. TodayI want to reaffirm my commitment and that of the coalition to fair indexation. The Leader of the Opposition first announced our commitment to fair indexation on 27 July 2010, more than two years ago and prior to the last election. Since then, the coalition in the Senate has introduced legislation so that we could finally and effectively deal with this issue. That was on 18 November 2010. On 16 June 2011, in what can only be called a day of disgrace for the Senate, the Labor Party and the Greens combined to vote down the coalition's fair indexation legislation. On that day, the Australian Labor Party and the Greens demonstrated that they do not care about the lives of military superannuants and their families. Since then, the coalition has maintained its strong commitment to fair indexation. Last year, I signed the coalition's pledge to deliver fair indexation. This pledge has also been signed by the Leader of the Opposition on two occasions, the shadow minister for veterans affairs and many other members of the coalition, including my colleagues here today. That pledge says: 'The coalition will ensure DFRB and DFRDB military superannuation pensions are indexed in the same way as age and service pensions. All DFRB and DFRDB superannuants aged 55 and over will benefit.' This a firm coalition commitment and will occur in the first term of any incoming coalition government. The coalition will support the passage of this legislation through the House of Representatives. It will then go to the Senate and be further considered at the end of June. The coalition does not seek to hold up the passage of this legislation because it provides benefits to veterans, ex-service people and their families. I therefore commend the legislation. Ryan, who I know has such a passion for and commitment to Defence people, not just within her electorate but also of all other electorates. I commend her for her work with the Boer War memorial commemoration. I know she is a descendant of a Boer War soldier, and full credit to her for pursuing that very noble cause. And her son is coming back from Afghanistan today, she tells me. That is wonderful news, and we wish him all the very best as he returns to Australia after such important work on behalf of our nation. I rise to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Military Compensation Review and Other Measures) Bill 2013. This bill implements the adopted recommendations arising from the Review of Military Compensation Arrangements. The review, a 2007 Labor election commitment, was finalised in early 2011 and the government responded in the 201213 budget. This is important, because our defence is critical to our nation. As the minister is here, I would like to note the $25 million in last night's budget for health services for veterans. That provision is for returned servicemen and women, for peacekeepers as well as for people engaged in humanitarian relief efforts. It is very important that the government has set aside $25 million to help meet this need in the 2013-14 budget. That is commendable. Not commendable is the fact that in last year's budget $5½ billion was stripped out of the military, and I know what effects that had in my electorate. I come from the tri-service city of Wagga Wagga, where every soldier recruit goes through the Blamey Barracks at Kapooka. We also have a Royal Australian Air Force base at Forest Hill at which there is also a Navy base, even though we are a good 350 kilometres from the nearest drop of seawater. It is a very important naval institution and training base, working in coordination with the very important Army and Air Force bases in Wagga Wagga. May their work long continue. As I said, in 2007 Labor promised a thorough review of military compensation arrangements, specifically focused on the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. This review, which was chaired by the then Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, Mr Ian Campbell PSM, found that 'the objectives of the MRCA are sound.' It also confirmed that the unique nature of military service justified rehabilitation and compensation arrangements specific to the needs of the military. The military is a unique organisation; it is a unique sector, as we all know. The review made 108 recommendations, of which 94 were adopted in full or with modification enhancement, with a further two recommendations replaced with favourable outcomes. Nineteen of the recommendations need legislative amendment and are covered by 13 schedules in this bill. The bill has a net cost of $17.4 million. The total package of reforms will cost $39.6 million, offset by savings of $22 million through the provision of treatment cards to SRC Act clients. The coalition supports this. We did, however, insist that a Senate inquiry into the legislation be conducted. The coalition requested that all members of the Ex-Service Organisation Round Table be contacted about the review and invited to make a submission, because we felt that was necessary. We also know that all too often this Labor government",230,Bills
286,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (11:55,"It is always a pleasure to follow the member forrushes legislation through this parliament without the proper consultation of industry, without the proper consultation of stakeholders. The committee has reported to the Senate. Submissions were received from the Royal Australian Air Force Association, the Returned and Services League of Australia, the Australian Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Veterans Association, the Defence Force Welfare Association, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, the Financial Planning Association of Australia, Slater& Gordon Lawyers, KCI Lawyers, Mark Raison and John Goldsworthy. So, the stakeholders have been consulted; the committee has reported to the Senate; the coalition is giving in-principle support; and, finally, while the minister is present and whilst I have acknowledged that there is $25 million for the mental health welfare of returned servicemen and women, and others, I would again implore this government in the weeks and months remaining to look at a fair indexation legislation for our returned veterans. They put their life on the line for this nation. They are not being properly indexed. The coalition has said that it will properly and fairly index DFRB and DFRDB recipients. They need to be indexed to the same level as aged and service pensions. They are not at the moment. It is a disgrace-indexation is necessary. I know how much Robert Bak, who lives in Bethungra in my electorate-he is the head of the Integrated Service People's Association of Australia-wants this particular fairness to be enacted for the veterans who he serves. AndI know how passionate he is-like the member for Ryan-about our veterans and the efforts they have gone to on behalf of this country. All too often when they return to Australia the financial aspect of their life is ignored by this government. We look forward to a coalition government, hopefully after 14 September, which will properly index those veterans' superannuation entitlements. and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (12:02): I thank all of those who have made a contribution to this debate. I know that there is uniform support for this legislation-I will go to the comments on military indexation at a later part-but I want to make an observation about the reference to the Senate committee. There was a very extensive consultation around the review and during the course of the review. DVA met with the ESAs in March of this year to discuss the outcome of the review and this legislation. There has been considerable discussion through the process and whilst we have no difficulty with having a Senate committee, in terms of the requirement for additional consultation, it is not necessary. Having said that, the measures in this bill, as others have said, will enhance the repatriation system in providing access to compensation and health care for our Australian Defence Force members, former members and their families. The bill will achieve this mainly through amendments to the Military Rehabilitation Compensation Act 2004 otherwise called, in short, the MRCA. The MRCA provides rehabilitation and compensation for injuries, diseases and deaths caused by all types of military service on or from 1 July 2004. These amendments will ensure that the MRCA, as the act covering all contemporary defence service, continues to best meet the needs of our members and former members now and into the future. These amendments are the result of an extensive Review of Military Compensation Arrangements and involve comprehensive consultation with the defence and veterans",232,Bills
287,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari,"Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Sciencecommunities. The report concluded that the objectives of MRCA are sound. Importantly, it also confirmed that the unique nature of military service justified rehabilitation and compensation arrangements specifically to the needs of the military. The initiatives in this bill form part of the government's response to the Review of Military Compensation Arrangements. The introduction of a repatriation health card for specific conditions, known as the white card, will benefit former members of the Australian Defence Force with conditions accepted under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, or SRCA, needing long-term treatment. SRCA members issued with a white card will no longer need to claim reimbursement for treatment costs related to their SRCA injury or ask their healthcare provider to invoice the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This measure will streamline arrangements for treatment for SRCA members and will result in a consistent method of access for all former members of the Australian Defence Force with long-term treatment needs. The bill will give wholly dependent partners of deceased members more flexible options for the compensation payments provided under the MRCA. Instead of a single choice between receiving ongoing compensation payments or a lump sum payment, from 1 July 2013 wholly dependent partners will be able to choose to convert 25 per cent, 50 per cent, 75 per cent or indeed 100 per cent of their periodic compensation amount to an age based lump sum payment. This increased flexibility will enable a wholly dependent partner to better meet their immediate and long-term financial priorities and applies to the future partners and existing partners who are yet to make their choice as to how to receive their compensation. The amount of compensation paid for financial advice will be increased for those persons who are required to make a choice under the MRCA about the nature of the benefits they receive. The maximum compensation available will increase from $1,592 to $2,400 and legal advice related to that choice can be also covered within the new limit. There will be a one-off increase to the rate of ongoing compensation for eligible young persons under the MRCA to match the rate payable for a dependent child under the SRCA-an anomaly we are pleased to have fixed. Rehabilitation and transition management services under the MRCA will be enhanced to improve consistency across the three branches of the Defence Force and increase flexibility and rehabilitation management. Improved consistency will be achieved by giving the Chief of the Defence Force overarching responsibility for rehabilitation of serving members, which we think is fundamental. Transition management services will also be made available to part-time reservists. The bill will allow payment of compensation for permanent impairment for claimants with more than one condition accepted under the MRCA. Additionally, DVA will make greater use of the payment of interim permanent impairment compensation and will be able to include a payment for an imputed lifestyle effect when determining the level of interim compensation payable, which will result in increased compensation payments. From1 July 2013 the eligibility criteria for special rate disability pension under the MRCA will be expanded to include certain persons who are not currently eligible because the person converted their incapacity compensation payments to a lump sum or because the incapacity payment is fully offset by Commonwealth superannuation. As a result of this measure, the person will also be entitled to additional benefits that are associated with the eligibility for special rate disability pension including a gold card, education assistance for eligible young persons and a MRCA supplement. Amendments in the bill will simplify the claims process for conditions accepted under the Veterans Entitlement Act that are aggravated by service covered under the MRCA. Currently, a person must choose whether to claim the aggravation under either the VEA or the MRCA. If this sounds complicated, it is. Currently, they must make a choice. The existing process is complex, resulting in confusion for clients and is administratively resource intensive. From1 July 2013 a simplified arrangement will be introduced resulting in all such claims being determined under the VEA. The initiatives in this bill are the result of a comprehensive review of our modern repatriation system and will result in improved outcomes for many in the defence and veteran communities. They clearly demonstrate the Australian government's support and high regard for our Defence Force members. It is a credit to successive governments that the review concluded that our repatriation system required only relatively minor legislative adjustments to meet the ongoing needs of veterans and serving and former members and their families. These changes will continue this country's proud tradition of caring for those who served and the families of those who have fallen. Briefly, I will refer to the comments which have been consistently made about indexation of military pensions. The first observation is that people are linking a superannuation payment-an entitlement as part of their employment-to income supplements or income support payments as a pension, which they are not. They are in no way equivalent to a pension; they are a superannuation benefit. I think people are either deliberately obfuscating or confusing the two issues. I am not going to go to the merits of the arguments because I do not agree with them, but I do want to make one observation. I think the member for Riverina gave the impression that this proposal for indexation was about the impact on the lives of people who are currently serving. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. This will not impact at all on at least 150,000 serving men and women who are under the current MSBS superannuation scheme. They will not be impacted at all. I had a meeting quite recently with a senior, very venerable returned serviceman who was in discussion with a very venerable serving man who has recently come from Afghanistan. The retired veteran said to me, 'What are you doing about our pensions?' I said, 'We're not doing anything about your pensions.' He said, 'Well, you need to.' I said, 'Why?' He said, 'It's all about these young blokes.' This young serving veteran said, 'No, it's not. It has no impact upon us at all.' Let us understand what is happening here. This is about dealing with a retirement benefit which people could take after 20 years of service. Many took it in their early 40s, got a lump sum and an annuity for the rest of their lives, and they are now asking the Commonwealth to index that lump sum to the equivalent of a pension, which it is not. Let there be no confusion here. I am surprised at the dishonest way in which this debate has been repeated around the country by some elements of the returned services community and promoted by the opposition as if in some way it is going to impact upon current serving veterans. It is just really dishonest. I would say to them: I have no problem with you having the argument but let us be clear about the intent, who it is meant to address and who it is going to exclude. We do not agree with you. You have got every right to promote your view, but let us do it in a way which actually demonstrates very clearly who you are talking about rather than confusing the discussion about this indexation as if it is going to impact upon people who are MSBS members because it will not. That is all I have to say, and I am pleased that the opposition has chosen to support the legislation. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Aboriginal Land Rights and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Other Legislation Amendment Bill. The bill makes amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act to allow the township of Jabiru, two parcels of land near Jabiru, as well as a parcel of land near Tennant Creek to be included in schedule 1 of the act and to be granted an inalienable Aboriginal freehold title, subject to a 99-year lease back arrangement being put in place. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 12:14 to 12:36 that this bill makes amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act to allow the township of Jabiru two parcels of land near Jabiru as well as a parcel of land near Tennant Creek to be included in schedule 1 of the act and to be granted as inalienable Aboriginal freehold title subject to 99-year leaseback arrangements being in place. The bill also amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to ensure that the World Heritage natural and cultural values of the Kakadu National Park continue to be protected with respect to Jabiru. The bill will provide security of tenure to business and landowners in Jabiru. This will further provide Energy Resources Australia security to continue operations and investment in Jabiru and the Ranger mine. All interested parties support this legislation. My colleague the shadow minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Nigel Scullion, has consulted with the Mirarr people, traditional custodians of the land, as well as the mining company which currently holds the lease in that area. In line with the long-held practice of Aboriginal land grants, given that the relevant parties agree, the coalition will support this bill. In this case the local traditional owners, the Kakadu Land Trust, Northern Land Council, Energy Resources Australia and the Northern Territory government all agree that these parcels of land should be scheduled. In the case of the township of Jabiru, land tenure issues will be resolved because a requirement would be leaseback of the land to the Northern Territory government and others prior to the handover taking place.",233,Bills
288,Mr Andrews (Menzies) (12:14,I rise to speak on the Aboriginal Land Rights and,236,Bills
289,Mr Andrews (Menzies) (12:36,"Prior to the division in the chamber, I was indicatingFinally, it has always been the coalition's approach to encourage land tenure reform on Indigenous townships in the Northern Territory to support home ownership and business. Accordingly, the coalition will be supporting this bill. and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (12:38): I first say that I am pleased that the opposition is supporting this legislation. It does, as the honourable member has said, add to existing Jabiru town and certain adjacent portions of Northern Territory land in schedule 1 of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976. It also provides a further parcel of land for the Patta around Tennant Creek to schedule 1 of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976. Five portions of land known as Patta in the Northern Territory were previously scheduled by legislation in 2010. This new amendment will enable the further parcel of land to be granted to the relevant Aboriginal land trust, something which I very strongly support. I do, however, want to concentrate my remarks on the bill adding to the existing Jabiru town land and adjacent portions of Northern Territory land to schedule 1 of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976. You would know, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Murphy, that both the Patta land trust and the land trusts around Jabiru are part of my electorate of Lingiari and this legislation and its passage underscore again the government's commitment to reconciliation with Australia's first peoples and rights a historical wrong put in place over three decades ago-that is what I think is fundamentally important. By adding this land to schedule 1 of the Land Rights Act, it allows for the land granted as Aboriginal land to be handed back to the traditional owners, the Mirarr people. There has never been any question that the Mirarr people were the traditional owners and are the traditional owners of Jabiru. Their connection to this country goes back many, many thousands of years. In fact Australia's oldest human occupation site, you might be interested to know, known as Malakunanja II, is the traditional lands of the Mirarr, as is of course the Ranger uranium mine and the site of the proposed Jabiluka uranium mine. The Mirarrs' native title claim to the traditional lands at Jabiru is one of Australia's oldest native title claims. The Mirarr have always indicated that their ultimate aspiration to own the traditional country to be recognised and that aspiration was entirely lost-indeed, one might say ignored by the previous coalition government. It has been the Australian Labor Party that has listened to the Mirarr people, initially under then Attorney-General Robert McClelland, who was here earlier this morning, and Indigenous Affairs Minister Jenny Macklin, and later progressed further by other colleagues, and in 2009 a solution was arrived at to the longrunning native title claim. The solution recognised-and it was very important that it did this-Aboriginal ownership and averted years of disputation in the Federal Court and possibly High Court of Australia. They took the view that native title existed and that what we should do is sit down and negotiate rather than try and affirm or have you prove, in the case of the Mirarr, your rights to that land in the courts. It also gives government and business security, security of tenure and security for future planning and further investment. The solution from the Labor government was to schedule Jabiru as Aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act in exchange for the withdrawal of the Mirarr native title claim and the issuing of a long-term lease for Jabiru township under section 19A of the Land Rights",236,Bills
290,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari,"Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence ScienceAct amongst other things. This is very important. They have used the Land Rights Act as a vehicle to deal with an issue around native title and give people absolute certainty in a form of inalienable freehold title about ownership of that land-it is very, very significant. All the surrounding lands, including Kakadu National Park, are inalienable freehold title and that parkland has been leased back to the Commonwealth for the purposes of a national park. Once the offer was made, all parties, including the Northern Territory government, set out to make it a reality. I want to acknowledge the former Labor government in the Northern Territory for its strong participation and support for this program. During the negotiation process, the Mirarr people came to a common understanding as to Jabiru's future. That is in itself significant. As a consequence, and flowing directly from that ALP government's initial 2009 offer, a new settlement was proposed whereby the land once branded Aboriginal land will be leased to the Northern Territory government. In both scenarios the land at Jabiru remains part of the Kakadu National Park and will be managed in sympathy with the World Heritage natural and cultural values the park is famous for. What we have really done is spread the impact of that Kakadu National Park across the whole region. The settlement at Jabiru that this amendment facilitates is not just a practical form from a political, community and economic perspective; it is just the right thing to do. In the 1970sit is worth knowing this, and I was around the Northern Territory at the time-the Ranger uranium environment inquiry or the Fox inquiry's very famous report recommended that Jabiru not be made Aboriginal land for the stated reason that the customary development veto enjoyed by traditional owners and all other land rights cases in the Northern Territory be denied the Mirarr in the case of the Ranger proposal. This was a way of overcoming the rights of Aboriginal people to ensure the future of the development of the Ranger site. This has led us, ultimately, to the Ranger mine. On this basis, Commissioner Fox said on pages 270 and 271, 'If the whole clan area becomes Aboriginal land, the Northern Land Council will have the right to refuse consent to the regional centre Jabiru as proposed. They could in this way stop the mining project.' The direct intention here was to override the interests and rights of Aboriginal people for the purpose of ensuring the development of the Ranger uranium mine. Recognising this threat to the development, the commissioner recommended that the area remain Crown land and become part of a national park. So, as I said, the reason that Jabiru was not recognised as Aboriginal land in that instance and scheduled in the Land Rights Act is an absolute historical anachronism and an indictment of the then government for proceeding in this way, because Ranger has now been operating since 1980. This fact was entirely lost on the Fraser and Howard governments, as was the moral dimension in this case. I commend the bill to the House because it establishes a certainty, genuinely engages with Indigenous aspirations, is good for the community, good for business and paves the way for an ongoing effective dialogue between the Mirarr, as the traditional owners, other local Aboriginal people, government, business and industry. I might just say for the purpose of this discussion that the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, passed as it was by the Fraser government in 1976 and originally drafted by the Whitlam government prior to their demise, is a really significant piece of legislation. It is the strongest piece of law in this country to recognise Aboriginal rights to land. It transfers to them, once recognised, land in an unalienable freehold title-it cannot be sold. It can only be secured, but it can be leased for the purposes of commercial development under section 19. This is very important, and as they have done here in the case of the Jabiru town. For many, many years it has been seen as an impediment to development, because people wanted to see it as an impediment to development. It is not an impediment to development. There are now many commercial arrangements with Aboriginal people for Aboriginal land and the development of that land as a direct result of their capacity under the land rights act to negotiate. That means that there are commercial opportunities which are being developed by non-Aboriginal and non-Torres Strait Islander interests in this case; for their own benefit, but sharing the benefits in some way or another-directly or indirectlywith Aboriginal people. That is a really positive thing. I am very pleased to be supporting this legislation. Debate adjourned. Sitting suspended from 12:48 to 15:59 Social Security Legislation Amendment (Disaster Recovery Allowance) Bill 2013 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. number of momentous and devastating natural disasters. Local communities in every state and territory have faced physical, emotional and financial struggles in the aftermath of these disasters, with the pressures themselves exacerbated by a government that all too often focuses on its own political agenda in complete disregard of disaster resilience investment. The coalition understands the importance of ensuring disaster assistance not only reaches those individuals and communities affected by disaster for clean-up and recovery purposes but also reaches workers, employees, employers, small businesses and farmers who have lost income as a result of the devastating event. Whilst constitutional responsibility for disaster prevention, preparedness, response and recovery is primarily vested with the states and territories, the significant detrimental effect large-scale disasters have on communities, households and individuals often calls for the provision of further assistance from the Commonwealth government. The coalition does not take disaster assistance mitigation or resilience measures likely. We will help small businesses get back on their feet more quickly after a natural disaster by providing the additional support they need. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Disaster Recovery Allowance) Bill 2013 will establish a new payment, the disaster recovery allowance, by replacing the current disaster income recovery subsidy. The bill amends the Social Security Act 1991, the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to implement the assistance. The disaster recovery allowance consists of a short-term fortnightly income support payment for an individual whose income has been affected by a major disaster",237,Bills
291,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (15:59,"Over the last several years, Australia has witnessed awhether natural or otherwise. If passed, the measure will come into effect on 1 October this year. The disaster recovery assistance package seeks to formulate the payment of ongoing assistance following a major disaster, which has until now been done by way of ex gratia payments and is separate from the Australian government disaster recovery payment. It is intended that either or both disaster recovery assistance and the Australian government disaster recovery payment could be activated in the event of a disaster, depending on the nature and effect of the particular event. The disaster recovery assistance is payable for a period of 13 weeks. If a person is still in need of income support after this date, they will need to qualify for another payment such as special benefit or Newstart allowance. At this point, I would like to note the coalition's plan for small business emergency assistance. The coalition's plan recognises that small business, with the local community, plays an essential role in the recovery from natural disasters. There are three crucial aspects to our plan. Under our plan, a small business that has not experienced physical damage as a result of a natural disaster but still suffers a loss of income as a consequence will be eligible for a loan up to $100,000. Eligible businesses will be able to pay back these low-interest loans over a period of up to seven years at an interest rate of four per cent, consistent with the existing commonly used guidelines. The second aspect of this plan is that the coalition will provide a GST and pay-as-you-go tax holiday to small businesses in disaster affected areas. Under current arrangements, small businesses are required to provide quarterly business activity statements by set dates each year. Instead, these businesses should have the option of a three-month extension for filling their business activity statements and not be required to remit their GST and pay-as-you-go payments until that time. The third aspect of this plan is that a coalition government will waive, for a period of six months, any penalty interest for disaster affected small businesses failing to estimate their pay-as-you-go obligation accurately. This plan will help to stop viable and profitable businesses going bankrupt and keep local people employed. These are practical steps to assist disaster affected areas get back on their feet. We certainly look forward to having the opportunity to implement that plan to help small business if we do win the forthcoming election this year. I am about to conclude my contribution, which makes me think that the Labor Party might want to get a speaker in here at some stage in the not-too-distant future. This particular bill is worthy of our support and it receives it. We look forward to being able to enhance disaster recovery assistance, in particular for small business, should we get a chance to form the next government after the election. Amendment (Disaster Recovery Allowance) Bill 2013. I thank the member for Stirling for his contribution and also the opposition for the bipartisan support for this piece of legislation. As a Queenslander, I say that it is important that there be bipartisan support. My electorate of Moreton was particularly heavily hit in the 2011 floods. I saw the damage that occurred. Literally, the water was at the end of my street. I had over 5,200 properties affected. Many small businesses in my electorate were affected back in 2010. In fact, I have",239,Bills
292,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (16:05,"I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation19,000 small businesses and arguably all of them suffered economic loss, so that is a $1.9 billion commitment that the member for Stirling has just made for the future if there were a similar disaster. Remember, the water in the 2011 floods in my electorate was one metre lower than the 1974 floods. The member for Stirling has introduced this new financial commitment where businesses that suffer economic loss can access up to $100,000 in loans locked in at four per cent. Obviously that is a significant financial commitment and I look forward to the Leader of the Opposition detailing tomorrow night the offsets for such a financial commitment. The reality is Queensland is one of the states that are more prone to disasters, particularly when you get above the Tropic of Capricorn. We had that double whammy 2½ years back: there were floods in Toowoomba, the Lockyer Valley, Brisbane and other areas-my home town of St George, Emerald and many others were hit by floods-and then we had Cyclone Yasi as well, a category 5 cyclone that crossed over the coast near Tully and Mission Beach. It ripped through North Queensland leaving significant economic damage. If you have your entire banana crop wiped out, $100,000 will not be the compensation; it will not set you up for that. Nevertheless, I will be interested to see what happens tomorrow night when the Leader of the Opposition does respond. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Disaster Recovery Allowance) Bill 2013 is a piece of legislation that has bipartisan support for a number of reasons. The purpose is to create a new income support payment for individuals affected by major disaster. It is certainly a very Australian response and I note the member for Mallee, who would have had people go through hisMr Forrest interjectinginsurance problems that flowed after these disasters. He well knows the problem with too much water coming down the river, or no water coming down the river if it is a drought. We need to get these disasters right. We are a sunburnt country, a land of floods and too many droughts. The problem with Australia is we do have a range. It is hard to get insurance right and it is hard to get the compensation right. But a good government that makes decisions in the national interest looks at the payments that are available to people after a major disaster, and that is what we have done. I did indicate the support of the opposition for this. At the moment there are two types of payments. The first is the lump sum payment known as the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment. I particularly commend Centrelink for the great work they did in my electorate after the floods. They were on the ground, basically, with mud on their feet, making sure that people had money. They learnt a horrible lesson from the Victorian bushfires when they realised that some of the identity safeguards mean nothing if your house has been washed away or burnt to the ground. The Centrelink personnel did a great job. There will always be the odd crook, but I do not think we should respond to natural disasters by treating everyone as a crook. The second response is by way of ex gratia payments made on an ad hoc basis to those requiring ongoing assistance following major disasters. The new income support payment, the disaster recovery allowance, the DRA, will formalise the payment of ongoing assistance following major disasters, which have until now been by way of ex gratia payments, and is",240,Bills
293,Mr Perrett,"I remember, I think we went to your electorate when we were looking atseparate from the AGDRP. It is intended that either or both the DRA and the AGDRP could be activated in the event of a disaster, depending on the nature and effect of the particular disaster. It is a piece of legislation that is supported by both sides or the chamber. I see the member for Blair, the parliamentary secretary, here in the chamber. His electorate was particularly hard hit. He was on the same committee as me. It looked at insurance response after disasters, so we have been all around the nation looking at how people were treated, insurance-wise, but we also incidentally received evidence on the various government responses. This is long overdue and I commend the legislation to the House. Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (16:11): I thank the honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Disaster Recovery Allowance) Bill 2013. I particularly thank the member for Moreton. He was the chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs. It looked at the response of the insurance industry and other organisations to natural disasters around the country. We went around and looked at floods in Western Australia, cyclones in North Queensland, floods in Victoria and bushfires in Western Australian in relation to this. We went all round the country. This is important legislation. The member for Moreton and I have seen the benefit of financial assistance that the federal government provides for disaster management-not just to councils but also for income support. Passing this Social Security Legislation Amendment (Disaster Recovery Allowance) Bill 2013 will ensure that there is legislative backingsupport-available to individuals whose incomes are temporarily affected by disasters over the coming seasons, whether they be fire, cyclone or flood. The disaster recovery allowance, the DRA, will replace the ex gratia Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy, known as the DIRS. Australia is a disaster-prone country, vulnerable to bushfires. We have had disasters in South East Queensland and about 17 major floods in the Brisbane-Ipswich area since 1840. The ex gratia Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy has been highly successful and provides valuable support to employees, business owners and farmers whose livelihoods are threatened by disaster. This summer alone, the Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy was activated across 35 local government areas in response to four natural disaster events. The federal Labor government is committed to protecting the jobs and businesses of Australians and to the recovery of communities that have been impacted by natural disasters. No Australian should lose their income or be forced to permanently close their business because of bushfire, flood or cyclone. Legislating the DRA will greatly improve the quality of disaster assistance that the Australian government is able to provide. It will ensure more efficient and responsible governance and economic management of the Australian government disaster recovery. It will ensure consistency, with clear eligibility criteria and activation processes. It will allow for review processes to be applied to other social security payments that are not currently available for an ex gratia payment. It will also allow for fraudand debt-recovery processes in the Social Security Act to apply to those very few who try to take advantage of this sort of assistance. Passing this bill will ensure support is delivered to disaster victims quickly and effectively.",241,Bills
294,Mr Neumann (Blair,"Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing andNatural disasters are devastating, unpredictable and inevitable. The full impact of any disaster is not felt straight away, particularly the economic impacts, and recovery is a very complex process. Disaster assistance provides support to where it is instrumental to community recovery. The federal Labor government consistently tries to improve the disaster recovery assistance it provides. This bill represents a very significant step to improving support to communities affected by disasters. The DRA will ensure that people whose income has been hit by a disaster will not need to worry about putting food on the table or whether they will be forced to end their hardbuilt small business. The DRA will assist not only individuals but also entire communities in getting back on their feet and putting their lives back together. By debating and voting on this legislation now we ensure that all preparatory work done by the Attorney-General's Department federally and the Department of Human Services is completed in time for the 2013-14 summer and that the payment is ready for when Australians will need it most. I take this opportunity to thank the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, the member for Lilley; the Minister for Human Services, Senator Jan McLucas; the Minister for Families, Community Services, Indigenous Affairs, the Hon. Jenny Macklin MP; and their departments for their invaluable assistance in the preparation of this bill. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Forced Adoption Debate resumed on the motion by Mr Dreyfus: That the House support the apology given earlier today by the Prime Minister to people affected by forced adoption and removal policies and practices in the following terms: Today, this Parliament, on behalf of the Australian people, takes responsibility and apologises for the policies and practices that forced the separation of mothers from their babies, which created a lifelong legacy of pain and suffering. We acknowledge the profound effects of these policies and practices on fathers. And we recognise the hurt these actions caused to brothers and sisters, grandparents, partners and extended family members. We deplore the shameful practices that denied you, the mothers, your fundamental rights and responsibilities to love and care for your children. You were not legally or socially acknowledged as their mothers. And you were yourselves deprived of care and support. To you, the mothers who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice, we apologise. We say sorry to you, the mothers who were denied knowledge of your rights, which meant you could not provide informed consent. You were given false assurances. You were forced to endure the coercion and brutality of practices that were unethical, dishonest and in many cases illegal. We know you have suffered enduring effects from these practices forced upon you by others. For the loss, the grief, the disempowerment, the stigmatisation and the guilt, we say sorry. To each of you who were adopted or removed, who were led to believe your mother had rejected you and who were denied the opportunity to grow up with your family and community of origin and to connect with your culture, we say sorry. We apologise to the sons and daughters who grew up not knowing how much you were wanted and loved. We acknowledge that many of you still experience a constant struggle with identity, uncertainty and loss, and feel a persistent tension between loyalty to one family and yearning for another. To you, the fathers, who were excluded from the lives of your children and deprived of the dignity of recognition on your children's birth records, we say sorry. We acknowledge your loss and grief. We recognise that the consequences of forced adoption practices continue to resonate through many, many lives. To you, the siblings, grandparents, partners and other family members who have shared in the pain and suffering of your loved ones or who were unable to share their lives, we say sorry. Many are still grieving. Some families will be lost to one another forever. To those of you who face the difficulties of reconnecting with family and establishing on-going relationships, we say sorry. We offer this apology in the hope that it will assist your healing and in order to shine a light on a dark period of our nation's history. To those who have fought for the truth to be heard, we hear you now. We acknowledge that many of you have suffered in silence for far too long. We are saddened that many others are no longer here to share this moment. In particular, we remember those affected by these practices who took their own lives. Our profound sympathies go to their families. To redress the shameful mistakes of the past, we are committed to ensuring that all those affected get the help they need, including access to specialist counselling services and support, the ability to find the truth in freely available records and assistance in reconnecting with lost family. We resolve, as a nation, to do all in our power to make sure these practices are never repeated. In facing future challenges, we will remember the lessons of family separation. Our focus will be on protecting the fundamental rights of children and on the importance of the child's right to know and be cared for by his or her parents. With profound sadness and remorse, we offer you all our unreserved apology. Ms KING (Ballarat-Minister for Road Safety, Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories) (16:17): I am very proud as the member for Ballarat and a member of this parliament, which has recognised and apologised on behalf of the Australian people for the shameful policies and practices of forced adoption. I have heard from a number of my constituents who have been affected by these practices. All were moved by the apology and particularly by the very heart-felt words of our Prime Minister. For many, it provided a time to share their grief in the open without the stigma of the past and to begin a process of healing. Nothing will ever make up for the hurt, betrayal and loss caused by these practices. But, as a nation, this acknowledgment speaks to our common humanity and to our moral obligation. I do not think anything can be more powerful than the words of those mothers, particularly, who have been directly affected. SoI would like to take the opportunity here to use most of my contribution to read to the chamber a letter handed to me by one of my constituents, Lyn Kinghorn, who details her own heart breaking story, a story that is replicated many, many times across this country. I quote from Lyn's letter: In 1963 I was single, 16 and pregnant. My parents bullied my child's father to stay away. My mother put pressure on me to have an abortion. They were willing to pay £400 for this. I refused and a place was found for me at Berry Street. I was happy to go to Berry Street and continually thought my boyfriend was coming with his Mum to rescue me, only to find out years later-he was threatened with jail if he came near me. My beautiful daughter was born on 24/12/1963. I took care of her for the week that I was in hospital. I had free access to spend all of my time with her. On 31/12/1963 a nurse was sent from Berry Street to the Women's Hospital to collect me. I begged and screamed for help not to be separated from my daughter. I was told to go home and be a good girl. When I got back to Berry Street distraught and screaming – the Matron came out and said in a cruel voice ""I hope you have learnt your lesson."" I certainly did, no way would I ever get into such a situation again. I married and two members of the family I married into had been single mothers in the decades before me. I believed I had been weak and something was wrong with me that I had been unable to be a Mum like they both had … I am shocked and distressed to learn the role the medical profession took to separate me from my child. Between the mid-1950s to mid-1970s the policy was that the medical profession, in its bid to heal infertility forcibly removed babies from single Mums. What became of Doctor/patient care and relationship?? The medical profession used me and other Mums like me as a cure for strangers. Why was their need more important than mine?? I have been profoundly injured by this policy that is now known as Forced Adoption. I strongly expose this as ABDUCTION for adoption. My human rights were abused. I was forced to sign consent 8 days after separation, as I was told I would never see her again and if I refused to sign she would be raised in an orphanage. By this time. I had turned 17. I was unable to vote, get a loan or a drivers licence, but without an advocate present able to sign consent to lose my child. My first child after I married was stillborn another daughter. I was heartbroken but was able to move on from that without the continued trauma of loss the abduction has caused throughout my life. I am so blessed to have had 4 more children and 4 step-children. My next daughter recently said ""Mum, this has consumed your life."" I do wonder how this abduction has directed my life as a wife and mother. Many years spent involved with numerous groups trying to understand and uncover this truth. So hard to believe in Australia, this crime was committed against more than 200,000 Mums and babies. Yet in the previous decades care and protection was the usual outcome. I thank you for the opportunity to tell a small part of my experience. I do not think any of us can imagine the incredible hurt that Mrs Kinghorn must feel but, because of her strength, resilience and determination, and the determination of the many mothers like her not to let this go, we can be here today to have this apology. We can also ensure that we understand what happened, say sorry for what happened, acknowledge all of the people affected and never again preside over policies and practices that will cause such unbearable hurt to families. Whether it is the mothers, the fathers, the children who were taken or their siblings, they all were and continue to be deeply affected by what happened to them. Hopefully some in later years have, at the very least, had the opportunity to find out what happened and to meet some of their family members. Many simply will just never know. For all of that heartbreak, it is fitting that we offer, as this parliament, the most heartfelt apology. We are sorry. is often the case that, when we are doing things in the parliament, it is the personal stories that people bring in here that can really frame these issues in our minds, and obviously that story is one of the ones where we can see just how tough these policies were on people and the enormous human toll that they took. I will not use all of my time but I just want to take the opportunity to add my voice to the national apology for forced adoptions and removals. It is astonishing to find, when we look back, that it is actually not that long ago and how cruel these policies were for the people who were involved. For the parliament to come together, as we did in the last sitting period, and offer an apology on behalf of the people of Australia for what occurred is a very important thing that this parliament has done. I will confess that, in the past when the parliament has come together to issue some of these apologies, I have sometimes been a bit, I suppose, cynical about the benefits of them. But when you see the effect they have on people who have been affected by the policies, and the effect that the national apology can have, any of those thoughts are dispelled. I must admit I felt the same way about the national apology that was given by former Prime Minister Rudd on behalf of the country to Aboriginal people in Australia. To see the effect that had on the people and what it meant to them. I think would dispel even the most cynical of thoughts about the importance of the national parliament taking these stands and saying on behalf of the nation that we are sorry for some of the things that have happened in our nation's past. When we are talking about forced adoptions we are really talking about policies which, certainly to our eyes today, seem unimaginably cruel, and the institutionalised nature of the fact. We need to understand that the standards were so different back then. Even though it is not that long ago, the way people were treated was different. If you were a single mother in the 1950s and 1960s social stigma was attached to that. There was inability really to have any power over the situation. If you were a single mother it might be that your family would not want you to have contact with the father, perhaps the father just refused to take any responsibility and there was nothing at the time to ensure fathers would be forced to face up to the consequences of their actions. You could certainly impregnate somebody and then disown your responsibilities, and that happened to a lot of women, unfortunately, during those times. Then the stigma attached to them by society for being single mothers was crushing. A lot of families would not have anything to do with a daughter who found herself in this situation. They had so few options because it was not the case back then, as it is the case today, that you could rely on the social security system for support, for instance. If you were a single mother and you found yourself in these circumstances, your options for how you would support yourself and support your family would be incredibly limited. Obviously, for mothers facing these circumstances it was incredibly difficult. I join with the parliament and say that I think this is the right motion on behalf of the country. I think it is good that the parliament has come together to apologise for forced adoptions and I add my voice to the parliament's motion. I think it is a very worthy thing for the parliament to have done. Ms COLLINS (Franklin) (16:27): What a privilege it was to be in the Great Hall on 21 March when the Prime Minister issued the national apology for people affected by past forced adoptions. To be in that room and to have the privilege of the people nearby to share their",242,Bills
295,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (16:23,"Thank you to the minister for sharing that story. I think itexperiences with you was incredibly moving. They were so resilient, but you could see that the pain and the sadness affected every single one of them, and that was just people who were able to be there on that day. No doubt the experience of the past adoption practices affected them very deeply. It was a very long journey indeed for many of these people to make it to Parliament House to hear that apology, which acknowledged the past wrongs and the dreadful hurts which were caused. That we are here today acknowledging this terrible hurt is testament to the courage, persistence and determination of many but particularly the mothers who fought for so long to have their voices heard. Saying sorry is such a vital first step towards recognising the trauma we caused and beginning the journey of healing. However, it equates to just hollow words unless there is also swift and tangible action to accompany it. That is why immediately following the apology the Prime Minister announced that the government would fund measures of $11.5 million over four years. We know that there were approximately 150,000 forced adoptions in Australia. The constant message during the consultations on the forced adoption apology was that unless the apology was backed up with specific practical measures it would be just words. Almost all of the people consulted wanted counselling by appropriately trained staff, with an emphasis on mental health services. They wanted a cost-free, one-stop shop for searches for birth certificates, deaths and marriages and to ensure hospital records were preserved and available to be searched without cost. Another frequent request was for a lasting commemoration. The government, of course, responded. Our response was: $5 million for improved access to specialist support services, $5 million for training and guidelines for mental health professionals and $1½ million for the National Archives to deliver the Forced Adoptions History Project. The Attorney-General's Department will progress resolution of the issues relating to integrated birth certificates and will investigate the harmonisation of and access to judicial birth, death and marriage registers. The package of measures also includes an immediate investment of funds for the Access to Allied Psychological Services program, where, through their GPs, people who were affected by past forced adoptions will have priority access to a mental health professional. The package also includes funding to develop guidelines and training for health professionals to increase awareness of forced adoption issues. Awareness of this shameful chapter in Australia's history among the broader population is also paramount. For this reason we will be funding the National Archives of Australia for a public education and awareness exhibition and a website which will allow people affected by past forced adoptions to give voice to their experience. But we know that people who have lived through the trauma of past forced adoptions need much more than this. They need services to support them to gain access to the information which tells their experience-the information from hospitals, maternity homes and other places where records are held. We also know that people affected by past forced adoptions need peer and professional support to help them with their journey of understanding and healing. We need to design services that strengthen, complement and enhance what is already available to ensure we can meet their needs and expectations. This means making sure that people who have experienced past forced adoptions have a voice in the development of these services. I will soon be announcing a process to ensure we have representation from these people-including mothers, fathers and adult adopted persons-so that their experiences can positively contribute to an improved system. If we are going to make a lasting impact on people's lives by helping in the process of healing from the terrible injustices which have occurred, we must take the time to get this right. We need to find out what currently exists; where there are strengths, weaknesses and gaps in services; and how a system of support can best meet the needs of people affected by forced adoptions. Through these measures, the government is committed to ensuring that the voices of those affected are heard and continue to be heard, and that those people are supported throughout the difficult process of healing. We are sorry. speech. This is obviously a subject which is very difficult for people, and she gave an excellent speech. On that note, I also congratulate the member for Swan for his speech in the chamber on this issue. For those people who did not have the privilege of hearing the member for Swan in the chamber when we last sat, which was, I think, seven weeks ago, it was one of the best speeches that has been given in this term of the parliament. I commend that speech to anyone with an interest in this issue. As someone who lived through the reality of this issue, the way that he clearly, concisely and emotionally dealt with the issue was an absolute credit and testament to him. In that regard also I think credit is due to the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, who also spoke extremely well on this issue. Both sides of the parliament came together to recognise this issue and to work in a bipartisan way to make sure that there was a national apology for forced adoptions and removal policies and practices. By making that apology, we were able as a parliament to recognise the errors that occurred. It is absolutely vital for those who have suffered to have the reassurance that the national parliament has recognised that what went on was wrong and that it has been prepared to do the right thing, admit that and make this apology. The government has also put revenue towards trying to help deal with the situation, and I commend the government for doing that. Obviously that was supported by the coalition, rightly, and hopefully those policies which have been put in place as a result of this national apology can help those people who are still dealing with this issue and in many cases have had to deal with it for most of their lives. I would like to go back to the member for Swan's speech because, having not lived through this, I think it is difficult to understand what the consequences would be. He talked about being reunited with his brother and the emotion of that and also what his brother and he had had to live through until they were reunited and until, slowly, other members of the family were also reunited. I think it is extremely telling. As someone who grew up as one of six children, I cannot imagine what it would have been like to discover members of your family when you were at the age of 45 or 51, as was the case with the member for Swan. I commend all members of the House for the national apology, and I commend all those who have made statements on it. I think there have been some very moving speeches from our two leaders and, most importantly, from someone who has lived through this and to whom this meant so much. It is an honour for me to stand here to support this apology and to commend those who have also done so.",246,Motions
296,Mr Tehan (Wannon) (16:32,"I start by congratulating the previous speaker for herMs RISHWORTH (Kingston-Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (16:37): I am pleased to speak to the motion moved by the Attorney-General in the House of Representatives on Thursday, 21 March, to formally apologise for past practices and policies that forced the separation of mothers from their babies. These policies and practices are a shameful part of our past and resulted in such sadness, pain and suffering for so many mothers, fathers and children as well as brothers, sisters and extended family. I am pleased that the government and the parliament in a bipartisan way is taking responsibility and formally apologising for these practices. I hope that this apology will be a step in the healing process for many Australians who have had their children forcibly removed from them and for the children who grew up not knowing their parents. When listening to the experiences of mothers who had their children forcibly removed, it struck me that they not only experienced and continue to experience the grief and trauma of losing one's child and not only were denied the fundamental rights and responsibilities to love and care for their child but they were also treated so badly-being shamed and shunned by our society. One of these mothers is Roslyn Sponheimer. In 1963 Roslyn fell pregnant at the age of 17 and was immediately made to feel shameful. Her parents and GP mapped out her future, which she had no say in. She was to resign from her work and lie to her friends and family, saying that she was leaving to work in the country. Instead, she was to enter the Kate Cock's Home for Unmarried Mothers in Brighton, Adelaide, under a false name. She was to live there until the baby was born and then return home, leaving her baby behind. When Roslyn reflects back to her time at the home she says that there was no concept of informed consent and it was just accepted that after giving birth mothers were to leave their babies behind. No alternatives were ever discussed. In Roslyn's words: So there we were. A bunch of society outcasts, brainwashed into submission and suffering feelings of such low esteem and low self worth that I can say it has impacted on every decision I have made in life since. After a long and difficult birth, Roslyn was able to see her son for five minutes. She recounted that she could still remember every detail of his face as he looked up at her. After the birth Roslyn was sedated and confined to bed for five days as a result of toxaemia. On the seventh day, when she was able to get up and move around, Roslyn recounts: … the Deaconess called me into the waiting room. She said, 'I have a form for you to sign.' She then asked me if there was any request I had of the adopting parents. AllI could think to say was, 'Don't make him learn the piano if he doesn't want to.' She then asked me if I wanted to name the baby. I said I didn't want to remember a name, thinking it would somehow be easier if she named him instead. She said she would name him after her own husband. She then handed the form to me to sign. After two weeks in hospital, Roslyn was given tablets to dry up her milk and told to go home. Roslyn's family never mentioned the birth of her son, and for a long time Roslyn went along with that silence. She said that it was only when she had her daughter and son later on that she understood what had been stolen from her. Roslyn said: To survive mentally, I had to put it to the back of my mind. Due to the laws of our land, I couldn't search for my son until he turned eighteen and so I just had to grieve in private. Even my husband didn't seem to have any understanding of what I was going through. Roslyn attempted to search for her son when he turned 18, but to no avail, as there was not any support to do so. Despite a desperate search she found only dead ends. To add insult to injury, a social worker from the Department of Community Welfare at the time called Roslyn to inform her that there had been a complaint from the Methodist mission which had been responsible for the adoption, and that she had to stop looking for her son. After 22 years, Roslyn was able to locate her son via a government department and was reunited with him in 1986. Since the reunion, however, Roslyn has attended various counselling sessions but has been unable to completely come to terms with the loss of her baby. Even though her son is now 49, is married and has his own children, it has taken most of the 27 years since her reunion with her son for her to feel that she could be herself around him. Looking back on what happened to her, Roslyn feels that she was denied the opportunity to express normal feelings of anger, hurt and emotional pain and that she has been left with an aching void which will never be filled. Unfortunately, Roslyn's story is one of so many mothers around the country who had their babies forcibly removed. Approximately 150,000 to 250,000 babies of unwed and mostly teenage mothers were forcibly removed from the 1950s to the mid-1970s in Australia. These mothers and fathers were betrayed by a system that gave them no choice and subjected them to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice. These actions deeply damaged not only the mothers, fathers and families but also the children. The motion before the House also apologises to the children who were adopted or removed who were led to believe that their mothers had rejected them and who were denied the opportunity to grow up with their family and community. These children grew up not knowing how much they were loved, and many still report a constant struggle with their identity, uncertainty and loss and feel a persistent tension between loyalty to one family and a yearning for another. One of these people is Annette from Aldinga in my electorate, who was taken from her unmarried mother in 1954. Born out of wedlock, Annette was a child of the forced adoption policy. Annette finds solace in the fact that her mother hung on to her and refused to sign the forms to release her from her custody for six weeks. Annette says that what happened next has impacted her entire life. After being separated from her mother, Annette was adopted in 1954 by a family that needed more hands on their farm, and she spent her time after school not relaxing or socialising with her peers but performing manual labour for her adoptive family. At the age of five, Annette was given a book titled The Chosen Baby, but Annette did not feel lucky for being chosen, as she said she had to deal with the grief of believing that she was not wanted by her biological mother and of having an unhappy childhood with her adoptive family. As Annette grew older she attempted to conduct research into where she had come from, to heal the pain she had from not belonging. But as if to rub salt into the wounds, Annette was incredibly upset that she was made to pay for any information that you could find in the state records. Everything that happened to Annette as a child still affects her today. But she worries also for her own children, who, because of the lack of a family-they have no uncles, aunties, grandparents or cousins-will not appreciate the role the extended family plays. Because of the forced adoption policies that removed Annette from her mother, her children have been denied the opportunity to have a family network. They lack the support that an extended family provides. These are just two stories from my electorate, but I know there are many more right around a country. We can never make up for the trauma, pain, loss, disconnection and separation that has been caused by the forced adoption processes, policies and procedures. We have heard from the Prime Minister that the government, and indeed the parliament, is committed to doing what we can to help those affected by forced adoption practices, to help families reconnect and to help adoptees find their families. The government will provide funding towards support services and recognition of the people affected by forced adoption policies and practices. This includes the Allied Psychological Services Program, which will give families high priority in accessing important mental health services, and funding for the National Archives of Australia to undertake a history and recognition process for those affected by forced adoption policies. The government is also establishing a Past Forced Adoption Practices Implementation Working Group, whose members will represent the mothers and fathers of the children of past forced adoptions. This group will perform a key advisory role to the government on the implementation of services and projects. It will also provide a platform for national consultation and communication between the government, advocacy groups, peak bodies, non-government organisations and service providers in the time leading up to implementation. We all expect the right to determine our own direction in life, and part of that is enabling us to nurture, care for and love our children. But during this dark period our society has deliberately denied many this opportunity. While we can never fully make up for what has happened to these families in the past, we will make sure that these practices are never repeated. To Roslyn, Annette and all those who have been affected by these practices, we say sorry. speech. I know how passionate she is about these issues, and we could see the emotion in her face as she related to us so very well that harrowing story about Roslyn, which we would all concur is a rather tragic tale. I also commend the member for Swan for his 21 March speech to the House of Representatives on this subject. I think you could have heard a pin drop while he was speaking, and that is a rarity in the House of Representatives. The words he expressed and the emotion he showed that day were a lesson for all of us about how important this is, how wrong the practice was and how far we have moved as a society. Adoption emerged in Australian legislation in the early 20th century. In the early stages it was generally an open process and often involved the adoption of older children, as opposed to infants. After World War II, society changed its perception of adoption, and the idea of the adoption of infants became more acceptable. Adoption was seen as the solution to the societal stigmas of infertility and illegitimacy, and also spared these children from spending their childhood in institutions. In the 1950s, adoption legislation was amended throughout Australia to remove the openness of earlier legislation and ensure adoptions occurred through a closed process. It was thought at the time that this would help the adoptive parents to ensure that they were seen as, and felt like, the natural parents of their babies. This was referred to as the 'clean break theory', which was developed by Sigmund and Anna Freud. It was seen as the best outcome for both the birth mother and the baby. Furthermore, those who supported this theory believed it was important in ensuring that the bonding between the adoptive mother and the child was",248,Motions
297,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (16:47,"I thank the member for Kingston for her movingnot interrupted. Whilst many women willingly placed their babies up for adoption with religious organisations, adoption agencies and through other measures, the sad and shocking reality is that a number of women were forced to place their babies up for adoption usually because they were unmarried. Young women and their families, and indeed society, felt they were not fit to take care of their children. The Senate Standing Committees on Community Affairs released a report in 2012, entitled 'Commonwealth contribution to former forced adoption policies and practices' after an extensive inquiry into former forced adoptions in Australia's history. The report states it was incontrovertible that forced adoption was common, but it was not possible to estimate the number of forced adoptions that had taken place as statistics from the era do not indicate why a child was placed for adoption, nor whether the parent or parents had willingly consented. Previous parliamentary inquiries into past adoption practices have been undertaken by the New South Wales and Tasmanian parliaments. Both parliaments found such practices had caused a considerable amount of pain and suffering, especially for parents who had been pressured to place their child up for adoption. The New South Wales report went as far as to say there had been a number of practices which were unethical and even unlawful. Forced adoption occurred in Australia for more than 50 years, from 1930 until 1982; however, most of these adoptions took place from the 1950s to the 1970s. Society at that time held different views than those of today. White, married couples with a secure income were seen as the ideal family unit and regarded as the most capable of providing the necessary care for children. On the other hand, having a child out of wedlock and the lack of financial support for single mothers meant there was a widespread view that adopting the babies of these unmarried women was in the best interests of the child. There are numerous reports of women who were forced to pass their baby up for adoption gaining access to their hospital records later in life to find their file had been automatically stamped 'BFA'-baby for adoption-due to their being an unmarried woman, before they had even given birth or signed any adoption papers. Lina Eve was one woman who discovered her files have been stamped. She said: My medical records have “BFA” stamped on them...even though I had said from the start I wanted to keep my baby. So its clear to me they had the adoption of my child as their intention all along. Most mothers were unmarried at the time they gave birth and were sent to maternity homes for all or some of their pregnancy, a decision usually made by their parents. Many did not have pleasant experiences in these homes, having their possessions removed and being prevented from having any outside contact with supporters they had. They were made to work without pay and were subjected to pressures to put their babies up for adoption. Ann Allpike made a submission to the Senate committee stating: The emphasis was always on adoption being what was ‘best for the child’-‘if you love your baby then you will give it up for adoption’. … I was not treated as an expectant mother but rather encouraged to think of my baby as not being mine but belonging to some perfect deserving married couple. The experience of giving birth was also not pleasant for many women who were considered to be putting their babies up for adoption even if they had not already given consent. Women recall being medicated, strapped to the bed and ignored or abused by medical staff. Jan Kashin stated to the Senate committee: Certainly by 1963 the practice of hiding the baby from the mother giving birth was well established. The sheet went up on cue. The drugging was mandatory for unmarried women, as was … the shackling to the labour ward bed. Babies from unmarried mothers were quickly whisked away, with most never touching and many never seeing their baby. It was remarkably traumatic for a woman who had been shunned by society and quite likely by her family to not be allowed to have contact with the child she had been carrying for nine months-the reason she had been shunned in the first place. Medical staff at the time, and indeed midwives and nurses who submitted evidence to the Senate committee, believed it was kinder to remove the baby from the start than to allow the mother and baby to bond before the baby was removed from the mother at a later date, which would have caused further and, in some people's opinion, 'unnecessary' distress. Following the birth of their child, these women were left to get on with their lives as if nothing had happened. Many returned home and were treated as if they had been on vacation, but described having a strained relationship with their parents often for the rest of their parents' lives. Others started over somewhere new, holding what they felt was a shameful secret inside. No matter what, all these women got on with their lives still longing for the baby they knew had been wrongfully taken from them. The effects of forced adoption are immeasurable. This practice affected not only the mothers and babies but also the fathers of these children and the families which these people have gone on to have later in life. While some women shared their past with husbands, partners and children, others have held onto this secret for a lifetime. Indeed, some women stated to the committee that their submission was the first time they had spoken about their past since the incident had occurred. For some women the pain of their past was too much to live with and, sadly, they have taken their own lives. How tragic is that! For some, searching for their lost children has consumed their lives. For others, the trauma of what they went through has caused strain on relationships and family dynamics. Some women have lived normal lives but held this pain inside for a long, long time. No two women have dealt with their grief in exactly the same way. In the same way, no two people deal with grief in exactly the same way. No matter what, though, all these women have had to deal with a horrific experience to which they should never have been subjected. The Senate committee reported that they received a number of submissions regarding how adopted people felt about their adoption. An overwhelming majority described unhappy childhoods-being placed in abusive families and struggling with their self-identity and a need to know who they were. Whilst they were in the minority, submissions were received by the committee from people who held no bitterness towards either their birth mothers or their adoptive families. I also read a comment from Kristene Wood, a child who was placed into forced adoption, on the Facebook page of my parliamentary colleague the member for Dawson, George Christensen. Ms Wood wrote: I am a child of forced adoption, and I wouldn't have had it any other way. I was lucky. I have biological brothers and sisters who were not so lucky. And in saying this, I do not take away from them the love that they have for their/our mother but as a result of circumstances they grew up as products of the system, in orphanages, foster homes and the abuse that entailed ... I thank you for the beautiful parents I received, for their love and support throughout my life. Although they are now both dead, I wish that I could have them back every day. I was lucky I was able to thank my biological mum before she too passed away ... Ms Wood was lucky to be able to meet her biological mother and pass on her eternal gratitude. AndI am sure there are many children from this era who would also want to let their mothers know that they have had a good life and are grateful for the life they have lived. This does not excuse the fact that these children were taken away from their mothers, but I hope knowing their child still received a happy and loving upbringing can bring their mothers some comfort. On 21 March this year, the Prime Minister apologised for the 'policies and practices that forced the separation of mothers from their babies, which created a lifelong legacy of pain and suffering'. This apology was issued following one of the recommendations of the Senate committee's report. And, whilst it cannot change the past and it will not take away the anguish and trauma of these events, hopefully this formal recognition can assist in the healing process for all those affected by forced adoptions. Barbara Maison said in her submission: We need to be respected in this country's history as mothers who had their babies taken forcibly from them for no other reason than to satisfy the ideals of others. We need to be respected in this country's history as mothers who were unjustly abused, betrayed and punished by all governments, hospital staff, welfare workers, religious hierarchies and society because of their inhumane, obscene prejudice towards us. To Ms MaisonI say: we do respect you and all the other mothers who went through similar experiences to yours. This apology will help ensure your part in Australia's history is acknowledged and recorded as you would like it to be. May it help to ensure nothing of this nature occurs again. As the Leader of the Opposition stated: Whenever adoptions take place, they have to be chosen and they have to be for the right reasons. People have a right to make choices and they deserve our love and respect whatever choices they make. Whilst there can be no excuse for forced adoptions in the past, before I finish I would like to note that not all adoptions were carried out under such circumstances. I was contacted by a constituent from a small town in my electorate, who requested I do not use her name so as to ensure her family's privacy is protected. She wished for me to make this point clear. This constituent and her husband adopted children during the 1970s-two children who have grown up knowing about, as she put it, their natural backgrounds. When they approached the adoption agency it was made clear to them that the agency would be looking for parents deemed to be most suitable for the children and not the other way around. They were extensively interviewed, and filled out countless forms, which required answering a number of very personal questions-rightly so, as this ensured children were only going to be placed in loving, caring homes. My constituents were overcome with joy when they found out that they had been successful in gaining approval to be adoptive parents to two children they love and cherish. I am sure these constituents are not alone in wishing to be acknowledged as parents who gave their children a loving home. Not all adoptions which occurred during a certain period of the Australia's history were carried out through unethical measures. attend the national apology for forced adoptions in the Great Hall on 21 March in the company of many of those who had undergone a forced adoption experience. It was certainly a very humbling and touching event. I am glad that we, as a parliament, had come together in a truly bipartisan way to support this apology. We saw the same happen with the apology to the stolen generation. I think it is very important that we do reconcile some of these less compassionate periods of our history. At times there was a different thinking. I believe that many of those involved in these particular events genuinely in their own way believed that they were doing the best for both the child and the parent. Clearly, with the benefit of hindsight, we know that this was absolutely not the case, as we have seen in this particular initiative. As we have seen, as a result of the policy of the day there were literally hundreds of thousands of Australians adopted. In many of these situations the mothers had no meaningful choice and, even worse, were absolutely and totally denied any choice at all in what occurred with their child. We as a society have been left with that legacy-hundreds of thousands of mothers who never knew their children and those same children were left not knowing who their mothers or fathers were. As opposition leader, Tony Abbott, said in his address, this is a tragedy for them. It is also a tragedy for our nation and we must atone for it. I hope for those affected by the forced adoptions, whether they are the mothers, the fathers or other family members, that the apology has helped to provide some level of healing and some level of closure. I do accept, however, that these issues and impacts surrounding forced adoption are complex and for some will never be resolved. For mothers having their babies that they have loved and nurtured, carried for nine months and given birth to, taken from them without even a look or a touch would be truly heart breaking. Surely a cry from the child at this point must echo with them for the rest of their lives. The children, who were often taken so young that they did not know any different, still had to come to terms with the knowledge later in life that they were adopted. Even the most loving stable childhood-and I have to congratulate those adoptive parents who provided this-could not prevent feelings of disconnection for many of those children. This is an issue that is very close to my heart. I would like to highlight two special people that have their own stories to tell. Rae Whitbourne is a grandmother from my region who featured recently in the Cairns Post, the local newspaper, on the day before of the national apology. Her story is not unusual amongst forced adoptions but that does not make it any less distressing. Rae fell pregnant at a young age after running a bit wild in country Victoria. She was taken to a Church of England home in Melbourne where there were a number of other girls in a similar condition. As their due date drew near, the girls were transferred to the Queen Victoria Hospital where Rae said that they were treated with near contempt by the staff. There was a stigma around them that they were 'bad' and that they had 'got into trouble'. Rae was just 14. After a dramatic delivery, she gave birth to a son, James. She wanted to hold him, but he was whisked away. 'I could hear him crying and I wanted to go to him, but I wasn't allowed,' she recalled. Rae was very vulnerable and certainly very confused and she did not know how to resist the next day when authorities came and forced her to sign adoption papers, saying it was 'best' for the boy.",251,Motions
298,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Chief Opposition Whip) (17:00): I was certainly privileged toMore than two decades later, when her youngest child was 16, Rae eventually told her other children about their older brother. The long journey started in trying to track him down-writing to different organisations, but always coming up against a brick wall. Luckily, her son was also looking for his mother. They eventually reunited and now have a positive relationship. Rae was fortunate in that she had the opportunity to eventually meet her son. But for others, the failure to connect with their roots is frustrating and very heart-rending. Peter Gries is a constituent of mine in Cairns. He was born in 1956 to a 16-year-old unmarried mother in a country town. While waiting for her due date, his mother was put into a home for unmarried mothers. In Peter's words: 'My adoptive parents were phoned a couple of days before my mother was due to give birth and were told ""The next one's yours."" My birth mother was not allowed any contact with me, whatsoever.' He is one who had a very happy childhood with his adoptive family. When, at the age of about five, he asked his parents where he had come from, they celebrated the fact that he was adopted. He said, 'With my adoptive parents I was made to feel very special. They said they had me because they really wanted me'. He recalled: 'I had a brother four years older, who was adopted in the same circumstances. But different people handle things differently. I felt I was very special but my brother had very strong feelings of abandonment.' In later years, Peter did feel a void when it came to his family history. When he went to his local doctor and was asked if he had a history of heart trouble or other genetic diseases he had to answer that he just did not know. He registered with Jigsaw, the post-adoption support organisation, but found it very limited in the amount of information he could access. Unfortunately, at the time, information-sharing was only possible if both sides had registered with the organisation. Peter's brother also had no luck in finding his mother. It has certainly had an effect on him and on his experiences as a parent. Peter told me that after receiving no information through Jigsaw or other agencies he had 'hit a brick wall'. He said, 'I tried to put it out of my head and forget about it-but then the apology brought it all back to the surface.' Recently he contacted my office. He asked: 'Now that the adoption apology has been made, what assistance will be given to those desperate to make contact but who have been met with closed doors? At 57 years of age there cannot be much time to connect with the birth mother I was taken from.' He was desperate for help. Peter would like to see more accessibility for people wanting to find out about their families. 'I wish there were a helpline that could guide me in the right direction-a mediation service or something like that,' he has reflected. This is a very important point for us to recognise. Given that the apology may have brought these repressed feelings to the surface, I certainly urge this House to make sure that as a society we are providing an appropriate level of support for those affected. This includes not just emotional support but also help to reconnect these families that have been divided for so long. I understand that this apology is just one step in a long journey to healing, understanding and getting those affected families back in touch with each other. Nevertheless, I have to say that I am very pleased to be able to stand here today offering my very, very strong support for this motion for those in our community who have been affected so adversely and profoundly by these forced adoption practices of the past. Let us learn from this dreadful experience and make sure this type of thing does not happen into our future. speakers to speak on this motion in relation to the national apology on forced adoptions and, on behalf of the people of Gippsland, get our voice to the people affected by the forced adoption policies of the past. In doing so, I do not intend to quote the entire apology, but I think it is worthwhile to quote a couple of the extracts. I quote: Today, this Parliament, on behalf of the Australian people, takes responsibility and apologises for the policies and practices that forced the separation of mothers from their babies, which created a lifelong legacy of pain and suffering. We acknowledge the profound effects of these policies and practices on fathers. And we recognise the hurt these actions caused to brothers and sisters, grandparents, partners and extended family members. … … … We say sorry to you, the mothers who were denied knowledge of your rights, which meant you could not provide informed consent. You were given false assurances. You were forced to endure the coercion and brutality of practices that were unethical, dishonest and in many cases illegal. … … … We offer this apology in the hope that it will assist your healing and in order to shine a light on a dark period of our nation’s history. … … … We resolve, as a nation, to do all in our power to make sure these practices are never repeated. In facing future challenges, we will remember the lessons of family separation. Our focus will be on protecting the fundamental rights of children and on the importance of the child’s right to know and be cared for by his or her parents. As a personal message to the many people in my community who have contacted me in relation to this national apology I simply assure them: 'You did nothing wrong. You had the misfortune of living in a severely judgemental era of our nation's history and you did nothing wrong.' The background to the national apology on forced adoptions is important. In February last year, the Senate Community Affairs References Committee released its report into those practices, and the report found that the policies and practices that resulted in forced adoptions and the removal of children were widespread throughout Australia, particularly during the mid-twentieth century. The Senate committee inquiry received submissions from hundreds of individuals who had suffered from the effects of forced adoptions and found that there were many different ways in which these forced adoptions occurred. The accounts provided in that report are shocking and graphic for anyone who has read them. They range from experiences of mothers being drugged and physically shackled to beds, to social workers failing to advise mothers of government payments that may have been available to support them to keep their child. These forced adoption practices impacted a large number of Australians and caused significant ongoing effects for many people, particularly the mothers and also the fathers and the adoptees themselves. The report concluded that it is impossible to know the exact number of people who have been affected by these forced adoption practices but that it does number in the tens of thousands of Australians.",255,Motions
299,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (17:10,"It is with a heavy heart that I rise to join the previousWhileI accept that an apology, no matter how well framed, how well meant, how well intentioned and how well supported by members of this place, cannot undo suffering that has been experienced by those who have been affected by forced adoptions, I hope that the apology will be accepted in the way that it has been offered by members in this place in the hope that it will provide a significant step in the healing process for the mothers, the fathers, the adoptees and their extended family members who were adversely affected by these practices. It is a great example of this parliament at work when we have such bipartisan support for an issue of such importance, and I do commend the leaders of our two major parties, the member for Warringah and the member for Lalor, on their speeches in the Great Hall. It was a great occasion, befitting the Great Hall. I will quote the Leader of the Opposition, who said: But hundreds of thousands of Australians have been adopted, often, because their mothers had no real choice or were denied any choice and that means that there are hundreds of thousands of mothers who hardly knew their children and hundreds of thousands of children who hardly knew their mothers. He went on to say: We were hard-hearted and we were judgmental and that’s why we should apologise. We did inflict pain on those we loved and on those we had a responsibility for. For some, we turned what should been the wonderful experience of new life into something filled with shame. Instead of love, there was reproach; Instead of support, rejection; Instead of celebration, silence; And instead of justice, there was wrongdoing. And from the Prime Minister: Today’s historic moment has only been made possible by the bravery of those who came forward to make submissions to the Senate Committee and also of those who couldn’t come forward but who nurtured hope silently in their hearts. Because of your courage, Australia now knows the truth. I will talk about the courage of one brave woman in my electorate, a woman by the name of Brenda Coughlan, who has been a fearless supporter and campaigner for people who have been affected by the policy of forced adoptions. Brenda has helped to lead the fight for this apology. Her baby was taken from her without her consent when at just 17 she fell pregnant and delivered her baby. Even though she was in a loving relationship with the child's father she was coerced into giving up her child for adoption. In her evidence provided at the Inquiry into the Handling of Child Abuse by Religious and Other Organisations held by the Victorian parliament's Family and Community Development Committee, Brenda said: My body was forcibly examined without consent, not by 1, not by 2 but by up to 12 male medical students at a time different hands, without consent, brutally and cruelly thrust inside my body one after the other, over and over again; at the same time, strangers’ hands cruelly pulling at my breasts, pushing at my stomach, with the excuse given that … it was just part of medical students’ training. She went on to say: I was eventually able to train my mind to visualise on an item in the cubicle so that the pain and the trespassing on my body by a group of males could be endured. I was barbarically and criminally tied down with shackles. I was torturously treated during labour. I was entrapped. I was defenceless. I was petrified and frightened. I make no apology for the graphic nature of the evidence, because it needs to be told. The hurt, anger and disillusionment with the medical profession resulting from that treatment obviously lingers with Brenda today. Brenda is not someone who has pursued this case for any material gains-she is not interested in compensation-but she wants to make sure that such atrocities never occur again. She said to me during a recent discussion in my office: This is not about money, because my daughter was never for sale. Money can never compensate me for the pain and loss my daughter and I have endured. It is a remarkable tribute to Brenda that in addition to working so hard campaigning for victims of forced adoptions she has found the energy within herself to open her heart to orphans in Asia and has actually organised ongoing practical support for those less-fortunate children. I must say that Brenda has been through an emotional roller-coaster, and it is fair to say that she was disappointed with some aspects of the national apology. It was an intensely emotional time for all the people involved in this issue. She was disappointed because she was concerned it did not include a specific reference to the mistreatment that I have just highlighted in relation to the medical profession. I wrote to the Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus, on her behalf to raise her concerns in relation to the failure of the apology to identify that specific reference to the medical profession. I thank the Attorney-General for his most recent reply, which I will put on the record: Although the national apology did not specifically mention the treatment of mothers in Victorian hospitals, it did acknowledge the manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice that many mothers experienced as a result of forced adoption policies and practices. It also acknowledged that many mothers were denied their rights, given false assurances and forced to endure coercion and the brutality of practices that were often unethical, dishonest and in many cases illegal. Not including references to specific situations ensured that the apology included the widest possible range of people affected by forced adoption practices. The Attorney-General went on to point out that there has been a formal statement of apology from the Victorian government and that Melbourne's Royal Women's Hospital and Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital issued apologies on 23 January and 20 March this year for their involvement in forced adoption policies. I think it is important that it is on the record, because, for people like Brenda, the abuse and the violence that she endured will live with her for the rest of her life. The national apology for forced adoptions is obviously not the end of the story for the people who were hurt by these policies. We cannot, by any stretch, pretend in this place that we can take away the pain or the suffering that they endured and that was inflicted on our fellow countrymen and countrywomen, but we can resolve to ensure that such atrocities are never repeated and to support those broken-hearted souls during the remainder of their lives. I do hope that through this apology, through the extraordinary support across both sides of politics, we can give some comfort to people like Brenda as they continue their life's journey. I commend the apology to the House. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (17:21): I am very pleased to join all the speakers on this very important motion. Like many contributors to this discussion, I joined Prime Minister Julia Gillard on 21 March this year when she apologised on behalf of the Australian people for the policies and practices that forced the separation of mothers from their babies. As we have heard so much, these policies and practices did create a lifelong legacy of pain and suffering for the mothers, the fathers, the daughters and the sons. As a government, we recognised and acknowledged the profound effects of these policies and practices, and offered the apology in good faith and with very deep humility. I saw first hand how moved people were to hear the Prime Minister's deeply held and deeply felt words, recognising the wrongs that happened in the past and committing to ensuring they do not happen again in the future. To redress the shameful mistakes of the past, we are ensuring that all those affected get the help that they need, including access to specialist counselling services and support, the ability to find the truth in freely available records and assistance in reconnecting with lost family. Following the national apology, we tabled our response to the recommendations of the Senate inquiry and announced $11½ million in concrete measures and actions the government will be taking to assist those who have been affected. This includes $5 million so that mental health professionals can better assist in caring for those affected by forced adoption. It includes increased investment in the access to allied psychological services-a program in the Department of Health and Ageing-to make sure that people are connected to mental health professionals. To make sure that the survivors of forced adoptions can receive the support to cope with past pain and hurt, this increased availability to psychological services has already started and people can access this service through their general practitioner. To support those affected towards healing and recovery, the government have also invested $5 million to improve access to specialist services and supported records tracing. We will also work closely with state and territory governments to consider how best to invest the government's support to complement and enhance services. It is vital that current and future generations are made aware of this terrible chapter in Australia's history. To address this matter, we have provided $1½ million for the National Archives of Australia to develop an exhibition and a website to share and raise awareness of the experiences of those affected by forced adoption. That way this chapter in our nation's history will not be marginalised or forgotten again. We plan to launch the website on the first anniversary of the apology in 2014 and the exhibition on the second anniversary in 2015. The involvement of the people who have been most affected-the mothers, fathers and the now adult children-is critical in informing our approach to these measures. We are establishing a Past Forced Adoptions Implementation Working Group to give advice to the government on rolling out these measures and also the other actions in response to the recommendations of the Senate inquiry. The government wants to develop these important support programs and so avenues will be made available for people to have a say about each of them. Through the national apology we have acknowledged the shameful mistakes of the past and the importance of people speaking out about these past injustices. Through the strength and resolve of those affected, the time of neglect is over and we can now look forward to healing. Dr STONE (Murray) (17:26): On 21 March 2013 I sat down next to one of the victims of the forced adoption policies in the Great Hall of this parliament. We had a while to wait for the commencement of the ceremony and so we talked about his life, the sad life that he has had. He has had even more tragedies visited upon him since the initial trauma of his removal from his mother as a newborn. It seems that this incredibly courageous and stoical man, now in his fifties, was one of the many who, perhaps because of diminished responsibility or care, became one of the great many who were subject to medical experimentation, and so he now has serious ongoing health problems. Michael explained that a series of invasive procedures and the administration of dangerous and, as it turned out, sometimes contaminated drugs left him sterile, stunted and with prostate disease. This he developed when he was still a teenager. He has also had cancer since he was 25. He has suffered, and continues to suffer, a great deal. This very special man, who has given me permission to use his name and pass on his story, has been advocating for proper compensation for himself and his fellow sufferers who were also used as medical guinea pigs in the 1960s and 1970s. More than 200 boys were subject to these treatments, usually prompted by them being short. It was then referred to as 'a failure to thrive'. Michael O'Meara was born to his then unwed mother in 1961 at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne. His mother wed a few months later. Michael did find and meet his mother in 1989, but tragically she died of cancer shortly after. When his mother was in labour delivering Michael, she was administered LSD as a sedative. This further complicated the birth and affected the baby's kidneys. Michael was recruited into the growth hormone clinic at Prince Henry's Hospital in 1972 when he was just 10 years old. He was subjected to deep sleep therapy in April 1972. At this time he was administered the human growth hormone using products from cadavers. It has since been found that some of this material was contaminated, with a number of young recipients subsequently contracting and dying of the deadly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD. On Monday, 16 June 2008 the Hon. Fran Bailey MP put a private member's motion into the House calling on the government to recognise the 'unapproved' recipients of hormone treatments, including the young men and boys like Michael, who received the human growth hormone treatments between the 1960s and the mid 1980s. The motion acknowledged that the report commissioned in 1993, known as the Allars inquiry, found that approved female patients receiving the same treatment, but for infertility, suffered similar negative effects and as a result of that report received compensation from the Commonwealth. Finally, Ms Bailey's motion called for the compensation of the male victims, both 'approved' and 'unofficial', who received the same hormone treatment but usually for growth stimulation purposes. During the decades of this extraordinary period of medical experimentation on vulnerable young people, some were officially recognised and therefore were designated as 'approved' recipients of the drugs and procedures. Others, however, and that would seem hundreds, were not officially approved victims who received, however, the same treatment by medical practitioners. These unapproved recipients now have great difficulty obtaining their medical records or proper regard for their plight and their need for compensation. The disease CJD, one of the deadly consequences of experimentation with the human growth hormones, has a long incubation period which may extend for years. When it manifests itself, the dementia progresses rapidly until the patient dies a terrible death. It is one of the most terrible of human diseases. There is no easy test other than a brain biopsy that can confirm CJD. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 17:30 to 17:57 Dr STONE (Murray) (17:57): There is no easy test other than a brain biopsy that can confirm CJD, so these young boys-now men in their 40s and 50s-live with a time bomb, suffering this uncertainty at the same time that they suffer from the other health impacts of the treatments they received years before. In Michael's case he must spend many dollars each month buying medication that treats his conditions. Surely it is time that these injustices are recognised. The 800-page report of the Allars inquiry made a very clear case for compensation for victims. I refer to the remarks of Dr Mal Washer MP, who participated in the 2008 debate on the Fran Bailey private member's motion. He highlighted how the Allars inquiry had identified … failures in the production of product, including the collection of pituitary glands; failures in supervision of the product and programs by government agencies, including the health department, the National Biological Standards Laboratory and the Human Pituitary Advisory Committee, or HPAC; and failures of appropriate action undertaken by the department following suspension of the program in 1985. There were inadequacies in tracing the recipients, the information provided, the epidemiological studies, and blood and organ donation. Successive governments have failed to take up the cause, although Fran Bailey's motion received bipartisan support at the time. It is Michael's view that his status as an adopted child born of an unwed mother made him more vulnerable to this careless use of his young body. As well as being treated with human growth hormone, an unknown number of pre-pubertal and adolescent boys who were short were treated with synthetic androgens or steroids to accelerate their growth after being primed with human growth hormones. This causes prostate disease for some and sterilised an unknown number of these boys. Many of these boys fell into the 'unapproved' category of patients, given that they were treated by medical practitioners who did not officially record all the details of the children they treated. I was deeply moved by the story told to me by Michael O'Meara in the Great Hall on the day of the formal apology for survivors of governments' forced adoption policies in our country. I am in awe of Michael's dignity and patience as he strives to bring justice for himself and his fellow victims. No doubt Michael will continue to suffer as no human should because our nation failed in its duty of care in regard to his well-being. Sadly for Michael, he did not only suffer the ultimate tragedy of separation at birth from the woman who was his mother and who undoubtedly would have loved him. She was drugged and she could not ever know the struggles of her newborn just to draw his first breath. But her baby went on to suffer as a child and then as a man because governments failed to do the right thing by him. I call on the government to revisit the Allars inquiry and offer the same support and compensation as that which was offered and gratefully accepted by the women who were treated at the same time. Obviously Michael's story is just one of the many human tragedies that make up the thousands of stories that deal with the forced adoptions that took place in Australia over many decades in the 20th century. I think the official apology we gave was long overdue. It was magnificent in the way that it was addressed, I believe, in the appropriate ceremony and with very carefully chosen words from both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott. I stand by that apology, as I think most Australians would. Let us hope that that episode in our history is never repeated in any form and that we never again treat some children as less valuable or their mothers as having less value simply because of their marital status. I very much commend this motion to the House. adoptions. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition both spoke on 21 March this year in relation to forced adoptions and removal policies and practices, and the member for Swan gave us a very personal insight into these practices. TodayI join our nation in apologising, and in so doing I would like to put on record the story of my friend Sue, who did not find out that she was adopted until much later in life after both her adoptive parents had passed away. As I speak today I will use the words 'birth mother' and 'mother' because those are the words that Sue uses. Shortly after Sue's mother passed away her brother told her that she was adopted. Hearing those words irrevocably changed Sue's life and she began questioning who she really was. Everything that she had known about her biological identity or thought she had known was now changed. It was different and it was false. Sue embarked on the task of finding out who her birth mother and father were-a long and arduous process that took many years. Eventually she did meet her birth mother but her father had passed away, so she did not meet him. She has also met one of her brothers and a cousin. She still knows very little about the circumstances of her birth but she does know that her birth mother was an Ipswich teenager who was sent to a home for single pregnant women in Brisbane, where she gave birth to Sue. Sue's birth mother signed the papers for her adoption and they were not to meet again for about 40 years. In the time. I have known Sue the circumstances of her birth and adoption have weighed heavily on her mind and I am not sure that she will ever be totally at peace. In her words, she carries the shame of her adoptive parents in not talking to her and telling her that she was adopted. When I have asked her what she meant by that, she said that she never had the opportunity to ask her parents why they adopted her, whether they were not able to have children. But she does know that they hid her adoption from her and she does not fully understand why. After finding out that she was adopted Sue spoke to an aunt, as it turned out that most of the family knew that she was adopted. The aunt said that Sue's mother just turned up one day with a baby. When the aunt asked whose baby it was, Sue's mother said, 'Mine.' When the aunt asked Sue's father when he would tell Sue that she was adopted, her father replied, 'Never, she'll never know.' Sue talks about the adoption triangle of the birth parent, the adoptive parent and the adoptive child. She makes the point that it is not just the pain of the relinquishing parent that needs to be acknowledged; it is also the pain of the adoptive child and adoptive parent. Sue has pushed the issues of her adoption to the side. But, again, in her words, 'There is a little scar in her heart.' Her wish is that her adoptive parents were still alive so that she could hug",257,Motions
300,Mrs Andrews (Mcpherson) (18:01,"I rise to speak on the national apology for forcedthem and tell them that she loved them. To Sue, and everyone else affected by forced adoption, I say: sorry. history that cannot be simply forgotten. Forced adoption policies and practices were widespread throughout Australia during the 1950s and on to the early 1970s. The practice of forced adoption affected many members of society. It was not restricted to a particular class, race, region or area. This was a time when many women were made to relinquish their children, a step that went against every instinct within them, breaking one of the most precious bonds that we have, that between parent and child. This was a time of deep distress and confusion for many young women. I stand here today saddened, particularly for those men and women whose lives were marked by this practice and the impact that it had not only on them but, particularly, on their children. For many, the grief has impacted their lives to this day. We know the role played by a mother and a father is invaluable, often setting the platform and foundation for a child's future. More important, it allows a child to understand where they come from, who their mother and father are. Many who have been impacted by forced adoption have questioned whether they were loved, whether they were wanted. A nation now understands the ripple effect of policies which did not put the needs of children first. The experience of every mother and child who endured this heartbreak was unique and very personal. We have heard some of those stories in this chamber today. All of us were touched and impacted to the depths of our being when we heard the stories, particularly throughout the Senate inquiry. We heard from mothers who were stigmatised and disempowered. Many mothers were shunned by the very people who should have been protecting and supporting them. I am sure the secrecy, the shame and the confusion was overwhelming for many at times. Of course we also heard the stories of children who, after years of struggling, asked the question, 'Why?' We heard about their questions of identity and their struggle to accept themselves and their past. In my own electorate of Macquarie there are quite a few brave people who have been touched by this issue. I would like to relate the story of one such man, a man by the name of Erik Spinney. Many of us know him. He is better known by his tribal name of Standing Bear. Erik was adopted as a baby through the forced adoption practices and he gave evidence at the Senate inquiry as well as writing several submissions. I have met Erik many times and have spent some time talking with him, not only in my office but over coffee. Last year I was touched by his own story. I was touched by his determination to reach out to others who have had the same experience. He spoke about the resulting emotional, physical and psychological effects for those who were part of forced adoption. Erik speaks weekly with people who have gone through the same experience. He mentioned to me that he has been in the position where he has had to talk down several people, mothers of adopted children and adoptees, from committing serious self-harm. While living in Canada for a few years Erik became ill but was unable to access his family medical history. This added complications to his treatment. These are just some of the ramifications for those men and women who were impacted by forced adoption. Erik's message to me was that we must ensure people do not fall through the cracks. We must ensure that every story counts. It is pleasing that one of the recommendations of the",263,Motions

The Australian government is funding the National Archives of Australia, over three years, to deliver a forced-adoptions experience history project. We all know that the national apology to those involved in forced-adoption practices is only a beginning of the healing process. We need to be diligent to ensure that the proper support services are available to the thousands of men and women in our electorates across this nation who have been affected by former forced-adoption policies. They need to continue to be given a voice. I echo the sentiments of the Leader of the Opposition in honouring those who have borne the hurt of the mistakes of this era. I wish to honour the parents who have always loved their children. I want to honour the parents-including the fatherswho have always loved their children and were so hurt by the decisions taken out of their own hands and made for them. It is important also to mention those adoptive parents who have tried to do the right thing by the children who were placed in their care. It is also important to honour and acknowledge all the children who have tried, in their own ways, to find their own place in a less-than-perfect world. That has, particularly at the instance of their birth, let them down. I congratulate and acknowledge their bravery and courage, and hope that their journey of healing does move closer towards wholeness. apology on forced adoptions. I commend both our Prime Minister and our opposition leader for their very wise and thoughtful words on that day. I will quote a few paragraphs from the Prime Minister's speech. She said: We deplore the shameful practices that denied you, the mothers, your fundamental rights and responsibilities to love and care for your children. ……… To you, the fathers, who were excluded from the lives of your children and deprived of the dignity of recognition on your children’s birth records, we say sorry. We acknowledge your loss and grief. ……… To each of you who were adopted or removed, who were led to believe your mother had rejected you and who were denied the opportunity to grow up with your family and community of origin and to connect with your culture, we say sorry. ……… We offer this apology in the hope that it will assist your healing and in order to shine a light on a dark period of our nation’s history. ……… To redress the shameful mistakes of the past, we are committed to ensuring that all those affected get the help they need, including access to specialist counselling services and support, the ability to find the truth in freely available records and assistance in reconnecting with lost family. Finally, the Prime Minister said: We resolve, as a nation, to do all in our power to make sure these practices are never repeated. In facing future challenges, we will remember the lessons of family separation. Never to be repeated.

302,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (18:11,"I rise to add my comments to the nationalmost primal and sacred bond there is-that between a mother and her child-and the bullying arrogance of meddling bureaucrats who believed that they knew best. While we say the words 'This should never be repeated', I would like to use this opportunity to highlight two situations in our society where those mistakes of the past are being repeated. The first is in our child protection agency. Currently, we have over 39,000 children who are in the care of the state. In Australia today we have more children who have been removed from their parents than we have people in prisons. This has developed into a $3 billion industry. Currently there is a child protection inquiry in Queensland, conducted by Commissioner Tim Carmody. I think some of his comments are very enlightening. Commissioner Carmody has accused some child protection officers of 'over-reacting', by taking children away from parents instead of giving families the help that they need. Commissioner Carmody said: There are some children in very dysfunctional homes but the answer is not to just take them out. Removing a child at any age from a loved environment-even if it is inadequate or even risky-can give long term problems to that child. The impact on some children will be the same as the stolen generation. Commissioner Carmody went on to criticise an 'over-reaction' in reporting cases of neglect and abuse and said that our child protection system should not be about 'social engineering' or supposedly 'giving them a better chance in life'. He said the 'system is over-responding to over-estimated risks' and said that children must be removed if there is a danger at the home, but he criticised removal on so-called 'emotional abuse'. Commissioner Carmody noted that in Queensland today 70 per cent of children removed from their homes are removed due to so-called neglect or emotional harm. He said that the definition of 'emotional harm' was subjective and that there is not even consensus among child welfare professionals. Commissioner Carmody concluded: If the answer is taking that child away from a loved parent, even if it's a violent home, and putting them with someone they don't know in someone else's home, how is that the right answer? We seem to have lost the point of the emotional harm that is caused to a child who is removed from their family-from their mother or from their father. Child protection agencies seem not to consider the emotional harm that is done to a child who is taken from his or her parents. I have had many cases of parents coming to my office and telling me stories of child protection officers chasing children like common criminals through the street, catching them and locking them up as though it was something from a Starsky and Hutch movie. I have heard stories about child protection officers telling children that their parents had abused them, alienating the child from their parents. We need to take a close look at this. Our children are most special and they must be protected. But if we today have more children being taken from their families than we have people in prisons I say that we have something drastically wrong and we need to look at it. The second area is in our family courts. I know the family courts sometimes need the wisdom of Solomon to work out how to handle disputes between parents. But many cases have come to me in my office from both mothers and fathers, and I think that our family courts are failing badly and that we are making those same mistakes that our Prime Minister said should not be repeated. I would like to make a little comparison. There is a strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law where, if a female alleges that she is raped, when she goes before the courts she must produce four male eyewitnesses. Of course, when going to the courts and making the allegation of rape they are in fact making a statement that they have engaged in a sexual act. Unless that person is able to provide the four adult male witnesses, the case is reversed on them. They are shown to have made it up, to have fabricated it. And then, because they have made an admission of sexual intercourse, they face being charged with adultery if they are married or with fornication if they are not married, which in itself carries the punishment of death by stoning. We nod our heads and say what a travesty of justice such a situation is. According to the National Commission on the Status of Women, an estimated 80 per cent of women currently in jail in Pakistan are there because they failed to prove rape charges and were consequently convicted of adultery. We say that is wrong but we have a similar situation occurring today in our family courts. What is happening in our family courts is if a parent makes an allegation that their child has been the victim of abuse, and that can be either a mother or a father-it is not about mothers' rights or fathers' rights but about the rights of children-when they go before our family law courts the bar is so high it is impossible to prove. So we are seeing a similar situation to what we see under Islamic sharia law, where the burden of proof on the parent who the child has made the allegation against is reversed, and the courts find that the child has been coached to say those things. Without the evidence, the parent that has through good intentions been concerned about the child being abused and often sexually abused finds the courts are turning against them and they are having their child taken from them. This is not an isolated incident. I have many cases. I have spoken to Emeritus Professor Freda Briggs, who brought this to my attention. We do have a serious problem with the way our laws are being interpreted in the family courts. It is something we need to have a close look at because we do not want to be here in this parliament in 10 or 20 years time making the same apology after seeing the hardship and suffering that has been inflicted upon many parents of children in our society. We do not want to be making that same apology again. We must learn from our mistakes in the past and ensure that we honour the Prime Minister's words-that we resolve as a nation to do all in our power to make sure these practices are never repeated-and make sure they come true.

303,Mr Stephen Jones (Throsby) (18:23,"by leave-I move:assets. It is something the western half of my Riverina electorate is built upon. It is important that we as a parliament acknowledge this as one of our nation's strengths. I commend the committee and I note the presence in the chamber of the member for Makin, who sat on the committee which produced this report, Inquiry into Migration and Multiculturalism in Australia. The committee was chaired by the member for Calwell. I commend the committee on its report into migration and multiculturalism in Australia. The report we are discussing tonight has 32 recommendations which seek to highlight what Australia is doing well and where we can improve. These recommendations range from the antiracism framework and multiculturalism to religious diversity and the nation's social inclusion agenda. The coalition supports these recommendations and working with communities to ensure Australia remains a vibrant and inclusive multicultural society. Multiculturalism is vital and is something we must continue to support, but the cost of implementing programs is something that requires restraint from the government. In my electorate the city of Griffith is a great example of a multicultural community. At Griffith High School, where I recently visited to award my ANZAC writing competition certificates and a prize, there are many different ethnicities and nationalities. One hundred flags proudly fly at Griffith's annual Australia Day ceremony. An article in this morning's Area News highlights that immigration figures have more than doubled in Griffith over the past 12 months as migrants choose the lifestyle Griffith and surrounds offers. A citizenship ceremony in Griffith just last week highlighted that some 148 new migrants have moved to the city, an increase from 61 in the period of 2011-12. As an irrigation community established prior to World War I, Griffith is now a proud city. The Murrumbidgee irrigation area is built on migration, multiculturalism and water. Today, Griffith and surrounds has a population of 27,000 and encompasses people from many nationalities and ethnicities, with Italian, Indian, Pacific Islander, Middle Eastern and Sudanese populations well represented. Most recently, the Filipino population is growing the most. With each of these communities comes a range of skilled and unskilled workers who make the Murrumbidgee irrigation area's economy prosper further. Mr Deputy Speaker Windsor, I know you visited Griffith. You were very welcomed there. You would have noticed the number of different nationalities. You would have also noticed the vibrancy that city has and the important part it plays in our economy and our nation. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be welcomed back anytime, becausethat the farmers and communities in the MIA are producers in the nation's greatest food bowl. I have no hesitation in saying that. I say it proudly. I know we have many food bowls in this nation but none better than the Riverina, none better than that around Griffith. The food bowl we rely on every day is aided incredibly by migration and multiculturalism and this is why I support the report's recommendations. Margaret King, who is the Griffith City Council's cultural services projects officer, told the Area News that such migration is 'critical to the economic development of Griffith'.

306,Mr Mccormack,"You are welcome anytime. Members will know from my speechesit,' she said, 'our farmers would be in dire straits. Who would pick the oranges, for example?' And Mrs King is right. That is why the government's current stance on 457 visas is, I believe, misguided. For communities throughout the western half of my electorate, it is migration and multiculturalism-the very notions this report commends-that help farmers in the Riverina with picking and harvesting; 457 visas underpin Australia's regional economy. We heard in the chamber today a very passionate address about 457 visas and the need to always make sure that Australians get the jobs first. I agree. However, where Australians cannot or will not take up those jobs on offer, particularly in the busy fruit-picking and harvesting seasons, we need to rely on 457 visas to fill the gap. Certainly there are some jobs which require migrants on 457 visas to fill that gap in Australia. The government needs to understand the needs of regional people and their communities, especially as far as 457 visas are concerned. Farmers, horticulturalists and local business owners are concerned what impact the government stance on 457 visas partnered with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan will have on the economies of Griffith and the MIA. I share their concerns, because 457 visas are vital to Griffith's economy as well as to towns such as Leeton, Coleambally, Hillston and Narrandera and all the other towns within the MIA. Any move to take them away will place the nation's food bowl in further jeopardy. The people of Griffith are strong and resilient, as you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker. Their city is vibrant and multicultural. They are what this report seeks to highlight: inclusive communities of many ethnicities and nationalities, living and working together harmoniously for the greater good. Multiculturalism is what makes Griffith, the MIA and this nation great. It is a community I am proud to represent and values which I commend here today. That is why my coalition colleagues and I support the report's recommendations. inquiry into migration and multiculturalism in Australia. At a time when the movement of people around the world has never been greater, when religious differences are causing conflict in so many places, when global refugee numbers continue to rise, when population sustainability is a topic on the national agenda, the report's findings are timely. For Australia, the intake of people from new countries has always been, and continues to be, a cause of anxiety. Not surprisingly, submissions to the committee very much reflected the cross-section of views that I believe today exist throughout Australian communities. It is important, however, that perceptions and opinions are based on facts and not misinformation. By most measures, Australia has managed its migration program and cultural diversity issues well. Resettlement of new migrants has not, however, been without problems. Nor should we assume that today's migration is the same as the post-war World War II migration when some three million people came to Australia between 1945 and 1975. Australia today is a much different place than it was in the years immediately after World War II, when the Australian population was only 7.5 million and Australia was embarking on a major growth phase. It was a different era. Being part of the post-World War II migration, I can speak with personal experience about the post-World War II migration and how that migration has contributed to shaping Australia today. Whilst heavily influenced by its British heritage, Australian culture uniquely reflects the collective characteristics of the new settlers who have come to Australia since 1788 and their adoption to the physical and climatic conditions of the Australian landscape.",268,Committees
307,Mr Zappia (Makin) (18:30,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the report of theIt was during the post-World War II years that Australia changed most, both in population and in physical construction. These were the years that transformed Australia and this is the period I will focus my remarks on. In doing so, I acknowledge the Australians who were already living here and who had, through their own toil and hardships, opened the way for the people who followed. They were the pioneers whose place in our history will never be diminished. It is often said that citizenship is a common bond which unites all Australians. For the people who came to Australia after World War II, it was much more than citizenship which united them. They had a common dream and a common interest in seeing Australia prosper. Not only had they mainly left war-torn Europe and were seeking a better life for their families but also their personal future was dependent on Australia's future. They shared a common desire to make Australia a better country. Regardless of where they originated, people saw each other as equals and the emerging national identity was equally owned by all of them. They came at the invitation of those already here and were grateful for the opportunity to do so. Their future was very much dependent on their right attitude and their commitment to Australia's national interest. They clearly understood that. They came with nothing, they asked for nothing and, having left the poverty and devastation of World War II, they were thankful for the opportunity to work and to live in peace. For them, there was a light on the hill. They embraced their new homeland and the spirit enshrined in recommendation 1 of the committee's report, which reinforced Galbally's vision of multiculturalism as 'an inclusive policy which respects diversity and fosters engagement within Australian values, identity and citizenship within the framework of Australian laws'. I particularly emphasise the phrase 'within the framework of Australian laws'. That is a point that I will come back to later if time permits. People chose to come to Australia and in doing so were appreciative of the rights and protections Australian law afforded them. They were people mainly from the European region with significant numbers coming from the UK, Greece, Italy, Macedonia, Poland, Hungary, Serbia, Croatia, Malta and the Netherlands. In Australia, their hard work, their skills and their resourcefulness were welcomed by the broad Australian community. They did any work that was available and quietly and respectfully made their contribution to Australia's productivity. When at times they were confronted by racism they turned the other cheek. Over time, the people who came to Australia earned the respect of the Australians who preceded them. It was this wave of migration that made Australia a multicultural success story, that was first acknowledged by the Whitlam government with the abolition of the White Australia Policy in 1973 and, subsequently, the enactment of the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975. In truth, however, it is not laws which matter most. Laws may force a change in behaviour but they do not change the inner character or prejudices of a person. That comes from life experiences which, in turn, lead to a change in attitude and mindset. It is only then that prejudice, racism and discrimination are truly eliminated. In embracing their new Australian identity, at no time did the new arrivals turn their backs on their heritage. The region I was raised in and which today I have the privilege of representing in this place is a shining example of a multicultural success story. People from most parts of the world now live within the region and new settlers have integrated into the community remarkably well whilst remaining proud of their heritage and their homeland. Over time, they established their respective cultural and sporting facilities. Today, many of those facilities have become important community resources for the broader community. The Para Hills Community Club and the many sports facilities in the Para Hills Paddocks area are a credit to the British migrants of the 1960s. The Campania Club at Modbury, built in the 1970s and recently expanded and modernised, is an initiative of the large Italian community in the region. Similarly, the Croatian Sports Centre at Gepps Cross, the Dutch Club at Greenfields, and the Greek club, Florina, at Ingle Farm are all testaments to their respective cultural identities. In more recent years the Vietnamese people established their much-needed community facilities at Pooraka. The Maltese, Polish, Serbian, Hungarian, Macedonian and other communities with significant numbers in my region have established similar facilities in other places in Adelaide. I have no doubt that similar stories of cultural settlement can be found in most places in Australia. One of the very visible benefits of Australian multiculturalism is that it has enabled Australians to experience international culture without having to travel overseas. By way of example, in recent weeks I have attended cultural celebrations of food, customs and entertainment at events organised by the Middle Eastern, Vietnamese, Italian, Greek, Indian and Dutch communities of Adelaide. In South Australia, hardly a week goes by without a cultural event being held somewhere in the state, and events such as the German Schutzenfest, the Italian Carnevale, the Greek Glendi festival, the Indian Mela festival and the Croatian food and wine festival are now major annual events on South Australia's community entertainment calendar. Of course, one of the important economic benefits arising from Australian migration has been the trade and business links set up by new settlers to Australia with their homelands. Having personal links and a knowledge of both countries has proven invaluable for enterprising people from both sides of the trade. Earlier in my comments I referred to recommendation 1 and the Australian law, and I will follow up my earlier comments with some comments about recommendation 6, which links into recommendation 1. Recommendation 6 states: The Committee does not support legal pluralism and recommends that the Government promote the message that multiculturalism entails both a respect for cultural diversity and a commitment to the framework of Australian laws and values which underpin social cohesion. This is an important recommendation because it goes to the heart of Australian values. The laws of Australia, or of any democratic country for that matter, reflect the values of the people and the standards which all people of that country are expected to adhere to. Not all laws are agreeable to all people, but they nevertheless express majority sentiment. Where they do not, public opinion will eventually cause a change to them. Our laws also seek to ensure that the virtues of justice, fairness and equality are the bedrock of Australian beliefs. Our cultural freedoms arise from those laws, but cultural freedom should not extend to the point where behaviour is clearly in breach of Australian law. The post World War II migrants who came to Australia respected and accepted that view, and that is what made Australia's migration program a multicultural success story. In the moment I have left, I will take the opportunity to commend the members of the committee from all sides of parliament in this House who worked together and cooperatively in trying to bring to the House a committee report that truly reflects the issues that are relevant to this parliament and to the nation in respect to the multicultural nature of our society today, and I believe that the report and its 32 recommendations pick up on the matters that we ought to be aware of and perhaps as a parliament at some point need to address. I also thank the secretariat for the terrific work that they did in assisting the committee with its work. I also want to thank the chair of the committee, the member for Calwell, for her leadership in guiding us through what were sometimes touchy subjects and touchy areas of debate. But we got through it together and have presented what I believe is a bipartisan report that does justice to the work of the committee. Debate adjourned. Wilson, Hon.

Ian Bonython Cameron Wilson, AM. Ian was a friend. I last saw him on 5 March at his home in Burnside. Very tragically, he was dying of cancer. On2 April, that took his life. Ian, interestingly, was first elected to this parliament in 1966. He held his seat for only three years. WhatI remember of him is the campaign he undertook in 1972 in the election that Gough Whitlam won and Bill McMahon lost to regain the seat of Sturt. That was a very memorable campaign. I joined the parliament in September of 1973. I went to the Old Parliament House and was assigned an office. The office was at the back of the building in what was ostensibly the new block, where you had the largest rooms. But they were shared with three others. Ian Wilson had the window, David Hamer had the middle of the room and I was left closest to the door. WhatI know is that he was a great mentor, albeit having only been in the parliament for a relatively short time. He was an extraordinarily intelligent man. He had been a Rhodes scholar, a barrister and a solicitor. His achievements in the law were considerable. I remember his ministerial career, but I will not regale people about that. I also remember the extent to which he spoke-and if people take the time to go through the notes the Parliamentary Library has prepared they will find the press comments on this-about issues that he took up personally. He was very much involved in the arguments in relation to income splitting in families. All of that has budgetary implications. But he was one who was out there running the arguments very positively when it was not necessarily the most popular thing to be doing. Given some of the matters we are discussing today, I will also mention that he was involved in debate about whistleblower protection, which I thought was another fascinating area of activity in which to be involved. He was one of those who, when I make a judgment about my own political career, I know was on the same side. The most difficult time for me was in 1988 when I crossed the floor and voted for a motion moved by Bob Hawke affirming that Australia's immigration programs should be non-discriminatory.

On those matters, Ian Wilson and Michael MacKellar also saw fit to make known their concerns and they were not prepared to vote on that issue-they abstained from it. When I look at that time when I served in the parliament, I served with a person that was a friend. I am glad I had the opportunity to be at his funeral. It was, in a sense, a celebration of his life. For me and my family there were other aspects of his life that brought us together, and they are recorded in the material that is before you. In 1999 he was the foundation chairman of the May Gibbs Literature Trust. With his wife, he worked as part of a team that saved and restored May Gibbs' home, Nutcote, in Neutral Bay. Where the Ruddocks became involved was that my wife Heather was invited to serve on the committee relating to the literature trust and involved in Nutcote and its continuing use. They were able to give awards to numerous young people for writing. The literature trust was about encouraging young people who wanted time and a secure location to be able to think about the issues that they were involved in and to be able to produce their works. This, I think, was a great credit to Ian and his family and was a great opportunity for him in his post-political career to contribute positively. I have not mentioned all the matters raised by the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition. I do not want to repeat them. I just want it to be known that Ian Wilson was a friend, that he was a considerable contributor to this parliament and that he was a man of principle.

Ian Wilson during his time in parliament in the House of Representatives. Mr Hicks, who lives in Griffith, wanted me to pass on his very best wishes to Mr Wilson's family and to record his reminisces of Mr Wilson. I was very interested to hear the member for Berowra talk about the way that Mr Wilson commanded respect in debates and certainly got his point across. Mr Hicks's recollection of Mr Wilson was of a quiet, reserved man who got things done in a very good fashion, who got things done because he knew there was a piece of legislation that needed his expertise and who knew that his constituents needed something to be done-and he certainly was in there fighting for them, sometimes in a very unassuming fashion but in a very effective fashion, as Mr Hicks wanted the parliament to know in his condolences remarks. Mr Hicks remembered Mr Wilson as a gentleman, a thorough gentleman and a true gentleman, and somebody who was, as he said, really nice. That comes from a person who was also regarded by this parliament as a gentleman. Mr Hicks certainly is a gentleman, and I am sure the two of them had many a great discussion on policy, on legislation and on the way that the nation should go forward. Mr Wilson retired from politics in 1993, having held the seat of Sturt from 1966 until 1969 and then losing the seat and regaining it again despite the overwhelming tide of the Whitlam election.

He was also the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in 1982, and he held that position until the coalition was defeated at the 1983 election. In 1993 Mr Wilson retired. Certainly, whilst he has passed from this life his efforts in this House and in this parliament are not forgotten. I commend the father of the parliament for his eloquent words, and I know that the fine words of my other two South Australian colleagues, who are due to speak in a moment on Mr Wilson, will also bring some comfort to the family of Mr Wilson. He did a great and honourable job, not just for his electorate and for this state but indeed for this nation. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (18:50): I, also, would like to speak on this condolence motion for Ian Wilson. I would like to put some other perspectives, without focusing on his parliamentary career. I first met Ian Wilson when I was on a trip to Canberra as a school kid. It was a year 7 trip, and we visited Old Parliament House. Ian spent some time with us; it would have been a small part of his day, but I remember him keeping the attention of 11-yearold school boys. At the end of it he gave us loose-leaf Hansards, as well. We were a pretty rowdy group and we found this thing called 'parliament' fascinating. Some of his sons were at the high school that I attended and I remember, during the 1980 campaign, one of them-Richard-plastering 'Wilson for Sturt' stickers all over the prefects' year 12 room at St Peter's College. SoI was certainly familiar with Ian Wilson. The book Liberal Movement Story has an excellent chapter about the 1972 campaign. As the previous speaker said, Ian lost the seat of Sturt in 1969 to Norm Foster. In 1972, while there was a swing to the Labor Party and the Whitlam government came in, Ian retook that seat. The seat of Sturt was a different seat to the one it is now. I think it incorporated parts of Modbury, so it went into what is now the seat of Makin. So that was a tremendous political achievement, and it was through a lot of very hard work using all of the resources that the Liberal Party had to throw at it, the best of campaigning techniques and lots of visitors. Other people have touched on Ian Wilson's parliamentary career, and I will leave that to others. My involvement with Ian Wilson and my getting to know him happened after he left parliament. I often saw him at various functions. The father of the House mentioned May Gibbs, and I remember seeing Ian Wilson at functions involving children's literature. He also had a long involvement and long interest in the area of aged care and retirement villages. Ian's faith was very important to him, and he had an involvement, I think, with St Matthew's Church at Kensington. I last spent a fair bit of time with him about 18 months ago, at a meeting of the Pioneers Association of South Australia. Ian had just come from a commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the sixth trip of John McDouall Stuart, who I think was also one of his forebears. That sixth trip was the successful trip, which crossed the Australian continent from south to north and back again. Ian was a good attender of functions in the electorate of Boothby-as was his mother, Lady Wilson. Most recently he had an involvement with us in taking up our consignment of wine. And we were very pleased to receive, in return, the Wilson wine, which was called Kerijani after the first two letters of the names of each of his four sons. I probably knew Nigel best when I was at school and I had a number of mutual friends with Nigel. But in more recent times, I have got to know Keith really quite well. His daughter and my son have been in the same class. His daughter and my daughter have been in the same softball team. SoI have got to know Keith, the oldest son, and his wife, Sheree. I was very pleased to attend the funeral at St Peter's Cathedral. It was a tremendous celebration of Ian's life. Baden Teague and Jennifer Cashmore spoke at the funeral-both retired politicians who had been involved with Ian from the start. There were many people there, including Pam Oborn, someone who was involved in setting up the Young Liberals in South Australia with Ian. Each of his four sons spoke. I would like to, again, give my condolences to Mary, Keith, Sheree, India, Richard, James and Nigel. I will miss Ian Wilson. He was a true gentleman and his contribution should be recognised. my colleagues the member for Boothby, the member for Berowra and the member for Riverina in speaking on the condolence motion to my predecessor, Ian Wilson. I knew Ian Wilson very well since I was a child. In fact, my mother and father were members of the branches in Sturt, the seat that I represent. I grew up knowing the Wilson family, the legacy of his father, Sir Keith, and his mother, Lady Wilson, and the contribution that the Wilson family, the Bonython family and the Bray family have made to South Australia since 1836. I have a very high regard for the Wilsons and all of their relations-anyone who has been associated with that amazing strain that have had such an indelible impact on my great state. In fact, we are distantly related. John McDouall Stuart led an expedition across Australia and one of the members of that expedition was a man called Stephen King. Stephen King and the Wilson family were related. Stephen King is a forebear of mine as well. That is the nature of South Australia of course. The relationship is so distant that it barely bears repeating, but it did mean that we were both members of the John McDouall Stuart Society. Only relations of those on the expedition were able to be members of the John McDouall Stuart Society. I joined the Liberal Party when I was 17 and I joined the Burnside branch and I joined the Young Liberals-both in Sturt. I was president of the Young Liberals and president of the Burnside branch. I was treasurer of Ian's Sturt federal electorate council, or committee as it was called then. I was his campaign manager in 1990 and I was also the vice president of the Sturt federal electorate committee. I worked on every campaign in Sturt from 1987 onwards, which was the first opportunity that I had to run. I defeated Ian Wilson in preselection in 1992 and became the member for Sturt in 1993. Ian Wilson and I had a very close relationship because of the fact that I followed him in Sturt. We had a very chequered relationship. I think it is fair to say that I certainly was not the flavour of the month in the Wilson household for about 21 years, but I was pleased to attend his funeral and honour his commitment to public service. His commitment to public service was one that he inherited from his family and it was a very genuine one. He was a very good Liberal, in the small 'l' sense, and contributed to making sure that our party is a party that represents both the conservative and the liberal strains of political thought in this country. He was also a courageous man in politics, and one of the things that was not mentioned in any of the eulogies given at the funeral was that he crossed the floor against the party-with the member for Berowra, in fact-to defend a non-discriminatory immigration policy in Australia, which did not make him popular with the powers that be in the party. But Ian Wilson was a man who put principle before preferment, in the great tradition of the small-L liberals in South Australia, who have had a real impact on our party for 60 years. I am sorry that Ian Wilson's and my relationship never recovered from a bruising preselection-that is the nature of politics. I bear him and his family no animus. CanI say that",273,Condolences
310,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Manager of Opposition Business) (18:56): I am very pleased to joinhis greatest achievements were his four sons and his marvellous marriage. His wife, Mary Scales, and his four sons, Keith, Richard, Nigel and James, gave marvellous speeches at the funeral. It spoke volumes for the kind of father, parent and husband that Ian had been that he has produced for remarkably great sons and South Australians, and I was pleased to be there to witness it. I thank the House for indulging me of this condolence motion on Ian Bonython Cameron Wilson. personally, but I certainly knew him by reputation and by the history of his family. It is a great privilege for me to have sat and listened to the contributions of the honourable members in this debate, particularly-at the risk of singling one out-that of the father of the House, the member for Berowra. It is never appropriate for anyone to say that they enjoyed a condolence debate, but it is certainly a great thing for me, as a relatively new parliamentarian, to sit and listen to the stories and histories of those who have come before us. As parliamentarians I think we are enriched by learning about the lives of the stories of those who preceded us, whatever the political party they have come from, or none. What can be said about an individual can certainly be said about the entire parliament. members to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places.
