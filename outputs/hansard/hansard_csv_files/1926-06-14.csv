Debate resumed from 11th June (vide That the bill be now read a second time. Last Erida3 , before the House adr journed, I drew the attention of honourable members to the danger of passing the bill, because, if it were passed and endorsed by the"" peojue, the Commonwealth Government would, in case of a strike, have power to call out the military forces to quell it . All my life I hnve done my utmost to prevent the military forces of the Commonwealth from ever coining into conflict with the civil populace, and I implore honourable members to do everything in tbeir power to reject the bill. Tlie right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) last E n d ay said he was not satisfied that the Commonwealth should be given the drastic powers proposed under the b ill ; but. as a result of the conversation across tbe nhamber which took place between him and the Attorney-General( Mr Latham), his opposition became half-hearted. The Attorney-General gave the assurance that, even if the bill were passed and endorsed by the people at a referendum, it would be subject to the interpretation of the H i g h Court before it could be put into oxieration. TheH i g h Court would have to determine whether this law conflicted in any way with other portions of the Constitution. This report was contained in a Sydney newspaper of Saturday last:The Federal Attorney-General( Mr Latham), said to-day that there appeared to be a misunderstanding in some quarters as t'o the nature of the constitutional amendments which had been accepted by the House of Representatives. The supposition that the proposals would deprive the States of their present powers was without foundation. If that is so, then we certainly arc wasting our time in discussing these proposals.

19,Mr West (East Sydney),"even if , ia so doing, they act against their own interests. I commend to the Government the example set, in 1910, by the Labour Government, in bringing about virtual constitutional alterations. The platform on which it was returned to office by a large majorit y vote, contained such planks as the discontinuance of the per capita payments, the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, and the payment of defence requirements out of revenue, instead of out of loan, as before. Those questions were easily understood by the people; but how many of thorn understand what vices "" are? Under this bill, if there were a stoppage of essential services, say, in the coal and shipping industries, the Government would have power to take control of them, did Honourable members on this side of tbe House, who have had a long experience of disputes between employers and employees, know that they are not capable of hasty settlement. The eagerness of the Government to do an in j u r y to the trade unionists has led it to act indiscreetly. provides that in the event of serious disturbances, the Government of a State may ask the Federal Government to make the services of the M i l it a r y Forces available. The constitutional provision is hedged about with precautions, and is not likely to be used rashly. honourable members who support this bill aav that if the miners will not work, the Commonwealth Government should be able to send other men into the mine.*. Knowing the spirit and determination of the race to which I belong, I say, God help any government that, attempts anything of that kind. would join in resisting the attempts oi any men to usurp the place of othere who were endeavouring to got decent conditions of living for themselves and their families. The Commonwealth Government won the last election, not because of any statesmanlike programme submitted to the people, but because o misleading cries. Drunk with power it now brings forward this insulting proposal. There is no need for the extreme measures for which it provides. Australian people would he the last to Mr Weill. resort to the destruction of property or the taking of human life. Unfortunately, some men in politics get an exaggerated idea of their own importance, aud that breeds a desire in them to dominate others. If that spirit is allowed to prevail it will bring about Australia's downfall as it brought about the downf a l l of the Roman Empire. I am confident that the electors w ill not support this proposal. In my electorate during the week-end business men of standing asked me the meaning of the Government constitutional amendments, and told me essential serthat they could not be bothered with machinery of the character proposed. They admitted that industrial unrest cannot be prevented by mere repression; we must probe to the root causes, aud as the British Government then find a remedy. Men who are in England during the war. coerced into the acceptance of unfair conditions w ill never be contented. Give the people liberal laws, and they w ill be perfectly law abiding. I can find not the slightest justification for this bill. The States have the necessary authority to deal with disturbances, aud unless we are to have complete unification the The Constitution Commonwealth should not trespass on their domain. So long as the States have sovereign rights this Parliament must recognize them. I know that in voting against this measure I shall be What other power is necessary? giving effect to the wishes of the people of East Sydney. No doubt if the opportunity arose, Ministers would be I have heard some glad to demonstrate what great men they are: they would call out the soldiers with their gatling guns, and so frighten women and children. There is sufficient power at present to enable the law to be upheld. When trouble occurs in England the authorities endeavour to remove the cause in a Old as I am, T legitimate way. That has not always been the case. As a lad I remember troops being sent to Nottingham to quell disturbances. Both my father and grandfather came into conflict with the military because on Kenuington Common tlioy advocated adult suffrage, but such interference did not prevent the people f from obtaining the franchise. The Government would act wisely if it. refrained from submitting"" this proposal to the people. It is doomed to be defeated. The Where, is the necessity for the hasty passage of this legislation?

Immediately other nations realize the beneficent effect of laws that we pass they copy them. We should, therefore, be careful of the legislation that we place upon the statute-book. This bill will not be an inducement to immigrants to come to Australia. that there are so many people in Australia who will not obey the law that it is necessary to give the Government the power to employ military forces.

On the platform I shall use much stronger language than I am permitted to use in this House in opposition to the proposal. Do not lionorable members see the danger of it , and the tacit admission that those whom they represent are not likely to behave as good oitizens should behave? Frequently an election is swayed by issues that are two or three years old, and this may be a factor in deciding the next election. electorates should strenuously oppose the bill. There is no possibility of any disturbance occurring in any of our cities, because in every large gathering of men there are those who exercise a restraining All citizens in every well ordered community have a wholesome respect for constituted civil authority. They regard the prevented policeman as their f r i e n d ; but they deeply resent any attempt to overawe them. Several years ago, when the m i l i Such tactics tary forces were called out during a coal mining dispute in New South Wales, their Some honourable members have presence created more trouble than the original disturbance. The electors, at the first opportunity, removed the Government responsible from power. The function of the military forces is not to deal with law abiding trade unionists, who are following the recognized procedure to ensure a settlement of an industrial dispute, but to protect the country from aggression by foreign enemies. Nothing can That has been the justify the employment of the military forces in an industrial disturbance, because the civil authority should be supreme. I have nothing to say against military forces as such, but I hope the day is not f a r distant when they w ill not be necessary. All forms of government should be on humanitarian lines. ThereI n effect, we say should be as little interference as possible with the liberty of the people.

When there is an interruption of services due to an emergency which the States may be unable or unwilling to control, I agree that the Commonwealth should have power to intervene, but my Representatives of country acquiescence in the principle does not carry me so far as to say that I am prepared to invest, not the H i gh Court, but the Executive for the time being, with the right, to determine what is a "" probable "" interruption. the form of legislation which this House passes.

Mr 1JATIIAM -The Executive could not determine that finally. The High Court would have to say whether the facts amounted to an actual or probable interruption.

Lack of information is the frequent cause of suspicion, which a straightforward explanation will quickly remove. I suggest to the Attorney-General eliminated, or another word substituted. Until some change in that direction is made, I must reserve my decision regarding this bill. I regret that, while the bill is still before the House, the Attorney General should have spent the week end criticizing the opponents of these referendum proposals through the columns of a certain section of the press. merce Bil l has passed this House.

Of course, if he thinks that he was right in doing so, he is entitled to his opinion. I remind the Attorney-General that in referring to the marriage of extremists on this side with extremists on the other side he was censuring thousands of electors of Kooyong who are opposed to these referendum proposals. I suggest that he discontinue his propaganda at this stage, and wait until the bill has passed both Houses. should wait unti l the field is clear, and there is a proper understanding of the difficulties that exist. The Minister spoke of low-grade thinking, and added that these proposals were submited in 1919 hy tlie Nationalist party. gentleman's remarks were a contribution to low-grade thought, because he did not explain that the proposals submitted in 1919 were necessary to take the place of the War Precautions Act, which was about to expire by effluxion of time, although the conditions which called it into being had not passed. Personally, I shall refrain from making any statement, or attending any meetings iu support of any movement in counexion with these proposals while they are still before Parliament. That, I believe, is consistent with my parliamentary duties. I am anxious to assist the Government in connection with this bill, because I believe that the Federal Government should uo uiulhed with f u l l and absolute power to protect the Commonwealth in a grave emergency after the States have shown that they are either unable or unwilling to do so. But I maintain that such power should be that the word ""probable"" be held in reserve, and used only when the States have absolutely failed to protect essential industries of the Commonwealth. that I cannot conscientiously support this measure, and, as I shall probably oppose the referendum at a later stage, I regard it as my duty to express in this House my reasons for doing so. I rise solely for that purpose. I do not like the proposals for several reasons. Whilei t is admittedly desirable that the Commonwealth should have f u l l power in any case where a State Government is unable to meet an emergency that may arise, I maintain that that power should be exercised only when a State asks for the assistN o t regarding the bill ance of the Commonwealth, as provided for in the Constitution. Although there is much indefiniteness in certain matters regarding the allocation of powers between the Commonwealth and the States, there seems to be no vagueness regarding the duty of the States to preserve law and order within their own spheres. This is, and has been, up to the present time, one of the essential and characteristic duties of a State Government. If the Commonwealth stepped in and relieved the States of that responsibility, there would be a grave intrusion into He what, has hitherto been regarded as their unquestioned domain. It has been said by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) that, under the guise of this very small and apparently simple clause, vast powers could be taken The houorable by the Commonwealth. That is perfectly plain, when one realizes the various directions in which this power might be applied as occasion arose.

I believe that when disorder reaches a certain degree of intensity, the only way to overcome it is for the State, and not the Commonwealth authority, to intervene. in which it was alleged-I admit that it was so-that Government itself was in sympathy the forces that were behind a movement for the dislocation of society; but I maintain that such a crisis should be met, not by the intervention of outside with power such as that vested in the Commonwealth but by bringing the forces of disorder, whether assisted by the State Government with public opinion. wealth Government, vene in such a case, and had not the solid mass of public opinion behind it, would find itself in a very awkward position.

It is f a r better for the public Coming as I do generally to be made to realize its duty to bring pressure to bear upon the State unGovernment. If that Government is apathetic, and regards it as the duty of of the Commonwealth to pull the chestnuts at such a time. But out of the fire, it will show indifference regarding matters of public importance; and when the people find that the State Government is not doing right, they will discover means to bring pressure to bear I am now referring to a case upon it . They may be slow to act; but they do not have always moved in the end, and will the State continue to do so. STo better example of with this could be furnished than was afforded in the recent disturbance in GreatB r i tain.

To a certain extent that is true, or not, into close contact but not to anything like the same extent Even the Commonas has been suggested. The power and if it were to interability of the British Government to settle that trouble arose from the force and authority of concrete public opinion.

Under the power now sought the Government would have to determine whether a service was likely to be interrupted, and if it were interrupted, how long the interruption could be allowed to continue before action should be taken. The Attorney-Generai( Mr Latham) said that this would dti pend upon the legislation which this Parliament passed after the proposed power was given to it ; but the Government having a majorit y behind it , could tako what power it pleased. It has also beer said that this power is necessary if the Government is to carry out the mandate it received from the people at the last Had public opinion been election.

In addition to that, if any State Government finds itself powerless to deal with an emergency and admits it , the Commonwealth Government can intervene under other powers that it possesses.

They are not now willing to trust the national Parliament. believe in trusting it to the f u l l or in limiting its powers. They cannot have it both ways. In order that we may clarify the present position, let us carry our minds back for a few months prior to the last election. It will be _ within the recollection of honourable members that we were then in the throes of a maritime strike whicli had no reference to Australian conditions, and did not originate in this country. It was a strike by British seamen against British ship-owners, but it was engineered here by certain extremist officials connected with some of our own maritime unions. Certain action had to be taken at that time, and the Government was faced with a situation in which State authorities refused to give effect to Federal law. This created so serious a position that it was one of the primary reasons which induced the Government to bring about a dissolution of Parliament, and make an appeal to the country to clothe it with powers which it had found itself unable to exercise. true. honourable member believes what I have the electors, and in obedience to a dissaid to be untrue, he must have a very tinct mandate to pass legislation that will short memory.

I candidly confess that I am not very enthusiastic about these measures, and have not a great deal of faith that they will achieve the desired results. I recollect that the matters with which they deal were considered by the various Federal conventions. There was a great conflict of opinion as to the wisdom of the Federation entering into the industrial sphere at all, and at the earlier conventions proposals to enable it to do so were negatived by considerable majorities. Ultimately, a proposal which did clothe the Federal authorities with power to deal with industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of a State was carried, but only by a very small majority.

If those controlling labour organizations were to take a lesson from what is done in the United States of America by great labour organizations, they would find the solution of many of their difficulties, and we should have fewer industrial disturbances. The investment of union funds in large industries in which many unionists are employed is encouraged in America. In stead of being dissipated in strike levies and doles in the shape of strike pay, union funds are widely invested in the acquisition of shares in many industries in which unionists are engaged. As a result, the unionists annually receive their share of the profits of the industries in which they are employed, added to the wages they uninterruptedly receive during the year. leaders in the trade union movement in Australia American unions and acquire shares in large companies employing many of their people, the time would soon arrive when they might in a perfectly legitimate way secure a controlling voice in the direction of the affairs of the companies and corporations to which they look for employment. member admits that this bill is intended to apply only to working men? I am speaking of a solution for industrial troubles that may stop the wheels of progress, and, by cutting off essential services, menace the lives of the community. lets' loose the activities of the lawless element of the community, who see in such conditions their opportunity for mischief. Only recently we have seen in England how conditions of this kind may lead practically to civil war. T t is a great pity that honourable members opposite do not t r y to approach the discussion of measures of this kind without attributing base, ulterior motives to their introduction, as great a menace motives which I am sure have no existence whatever except in their own fertile imagination. I believe that the Government is imbued with a sincere desire to do its best to bring about industrial conditions of which we could all approve. I suppose it is not unnatural for an opposition composed of members who think they are direct representatives of Labour to view with suspicion proposals emanating from those to whom they are opposed, but I believe there is not the slightest ground for any suspicion of ulterior motives on the part of the Government in submitting these measures. W h a t we need to do is to eliminate the feeling of class hatred, which will never get us anywhere. We can never bring about better conditions by setting one class against another, or encouragiug a spirit of hatred between classes. W h a t this and other countries need at the present time is mutual forbearance, co-operation, and in creased production. W it h a better underunderstanding between employers and employees we should have increased production, and a better condition of things If we could persuade than prevails at the present time.

Barnes, a British Labour leader, who was a member of the War Cabineti n 1917. The Daily Mai l newspaper made an arrangement to send six working men to investigate the reasons for the prosperity of workers in the United States of America, and, in referring to this, Mr Barnes saidThe mission will enable workmen throughout the honourable Britain to learn the secret of greater production and higher wages. The British workman must cease to regard himself as a wage slave with a degrading view of life, and become a better citizen, abandoning the worn-out theories of class conflicts. The elimination of class conflict and strikes can largely be brought about by the workmen themselves acquiring a conWidespread industrial unrest. trolling interest in the companies by which they are employed.

This legislation is intended to instil fear in the hearts of the industrialists of this country. If the honourable member for Lang thinks that threat of imprisonment will prevent the workers from ventilating their grievances and claiming the rights that they are entitled to, he does not in the least understand the psychology of the true Australian.

No industrial disputes have ever been settled by force on the part of either one side or the other. They are usually settled by reasonable men conferring together. The object of this legislation is simply to meddle with little disputes that may arisei n anyState. We know that all disputes, more or less, interfere with transportation and with trade and commerce. The bill, if carried by the Parliament and endorsed by the people, will give the Government power to interfere in disputes in order to ensure the continuance of essential services. of Only the government of the day? This power w ill be interpreted and administered according to the views of the party in power. My opinion is that industries and essential services have been too much embarrassed by litigation and restraint. Trade unionists, particularly, have expended tens of thousands of pounds from -because of the delays that have occurred they have been forced to adopt other means of getting their grievances redressed. Yet they are the people against whom this b ill is directed. If the Government intended well by the other referendum proposal relating to the trade and commerce powers, in the Constitution out to the workers for the it would have been well advised to refrain from bringing forward this bill. AlthoughI believe that this Parliament should have much greater powers than it already possesses, I regard this bill as mischievous, and fraught with danger to The honourable member for Warthe peace, order, and good government of the people of Australia.

The honourable member and others seem This legislation to see the prison looming in the background of this legislation; but imprisonment is not mentioned in the bill. We are told also that this measure w ill imperil the other proposal relating to arbitration. It should not do so; the electors can vote for or against each proposal on its merits and without regard to any other issue. In any case, the proposal contained in the bill cannot be translated into law unless it first has the sanction of the majority of the electors. I agree with the Prime Minister that this amendment of the Constitution is vital. The powers now sought are such as every sovereign Parliament should possess, and the need for them has grown considerably in late years. There is no need to dwell Who is to be the interpreter upon the recent general strike in Great what is an essential service ? B r it a in ; but it is within the knowledge of a l l honourable members and the community at large that within the last few years there has. been a distinct increase in the aggressiveness of strong bodies formed outside Parliament.

In connection w i th the police strike the Arbitration Court, and in Victoria a few years ago, Sir John Monash said that his services were at the disposal of his country against any of its enemies, whether they attacked from in side or fro m outside.

69,The Bush Came Down And Mr Duncan,"HUGHES (Boothby)adopt. Do members of the Opposition suggest that the Commonwealth Parliament should have power to defend the country only against aggression from outside? W it h that principle in vogue no country would attack another from outside: and, further, an attack from inside is more difficult to resist. TheA t torney-General( Mr Latham) said that at present the Commonwealth has no power to intervene in a domestic dispute unaccompanied by violence, even if the State authority asked it to do so; therefore, if , by passive resistance, some of the from essential supplies, Commonwealth assistance could not now be invoked. Honourable members opposite seem to regard the trade unions as of more i m portance than the community at large; apparently trade union control is more desirable than control by Parliament, and the interests of a small minority are of much greater importance than those of the majority. From that view I entirely dissent. We have been warned that this bill may react unfavorably on the outside supporters of the Government. I am prepared to take that risk. fiteers and exploiters who will not be affected by this legislation? does not specifically mention profiteers or exploiters; it makes no distinction as to the people to whom it applies, and it can operate against the profiteers as effectively as against anybody else. I believe that the Commonwealth should have this power, regardless of what profiteers or exploiters may say or think. The honourable member for Warringah ( Sir Granville Ryrie) said rightly that in an emergency private individuals would probably be invited to assist the Government. That would be the most obvious course to adopt in a country which maintains a very small military force. Without desiring to be provocative, I remind honourable members that the military forces are just as liable to be called upon by the Government as are other citizens; the Government must in an emergency use such powers as it possesses to assert its authority, and probably large numbers of people would offer their help voluntarily, as happened in Great Britain recently. general public to come to the assistance of the Government would meet with a ready response, and the Australian capacity for initiative would quickly assert itself. We may reflect with a certain amount of satisfaction that when an emergency of this character has been successfully coped with, it is not likely to recur very soon; each time an effort to override the authority of the Government is thwarted, the possibility of future endeavours of the kind succeeding decreases. When the Northern Australian B ill was before the House, and I suggested that certain powers should be left to the commission, the honourable memsmaller States were cut off ber for East Sydney( Mr West) accused me of desiring to take away from Parliament the power that it now possesses. In the present instance, I am supporting a proposal to give this Parliament very wide powers which at present it lacks. What of the honourable member for East Sydney? Quite inconsistently, he opposes the grant of additional powers, and declares that they would be used tyrannically. I believe that, whatever may be the fate of the trade and commerce power, that to which this bill relates will be granted to this Parliament; and if at any time it should be necessary to enforce it-whic h we all hope wil l not be the caseI hope the Government will not hesitate to do so. not think that the world holds a parliament elected on a more democratic franchise than is the Commonwealth Parliament. Australia being a democracy, it is surely the responsibility of a parliaParliament ment elected by all sections of the community to govern. Any limitation upon its power to legislate for the people by whom it was created is Gilbertian. The honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) declared himself a unificationist in regard to most matters; but as the party to which he belonged fears that the legislative authority which we aTe now seeking for this Parliament might restrict the unlimited power of the unions to override the Government, he is a Staterighter in regard to this bill. He is agreeable to the Commonwealth Parliament having the power that this bill confers, only if it has complete power over everything; he is not prepared to accept a half loaf.

114,Mr Fenton,"The honourable memall went on strike, they could not hand their briefs to some one else. opposite have spoken of the magnificent work done by trade unions, and of their beneficial influence in the community. If they are sincere in their commendation, how can they believe that trade unionists to-day w ill bring disaster to the community? Should they not rather take the view that, when trade unionists take part in a strike, it is to redress some wrong. Although a young man at the time, I well remember the maritime strike. The authorities were a f r a id to call out the volunteers in Melbourne, knowing that many of them were members of trade unions; but they brought men from the country, and placed them under the control of Colonel Tom Price, who gave the historic order"" Fire low and lay 'em out."" ber for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) at that time took an active part in politics. I believe that he then had greater sympathy with the workers than he has now. Whatever the merits of the maritime strike, it led to the formation of the Labour party of Australia. It was urged that, instead of endeavouring to achieve their ends by striking, the workers should elect their own representatives to Parliament, and take political action. Since that time, in every Parliament of Australia, there has been a sprinkling of Labour members. In each of the States as well as in the Federal sphere, Labour Governments have been in office. The temporary wave of feeling whicli influenced the electors at the last election w ill pass, and again the Labour party w ill come into its own in this Parliament. Asi n the Old Country, there is, in Australia, a section of the community which is doing its utmost to divorce the industrial from the political Labour movement. When the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mr Baldwin, some time ago, addressed a conference of 2,000 persons in a conservative part of England, he had a mixed reception, because of his action in arranging for £15,000,000 from the public exchequer to ward off trouble in the coal-mining industry. From one part of the building if they came the cry"" W h y not act like Mussoli n i ? "" Mr Baldwin's reply stands to his credit. He answered, "" No ; the British people w ill never tolerate a dictator."" or an organization? danger of harm coming from an individual dictator than from an organization. I believe that in the multitude of counsellors there is safety; I am prepared at all times to trust the people. Sometimes they make mistakes; but in time they rectify them. A f t e r Mr Baldwin had lef t the conference another person who had taken a prominent part in the proceedings asked to be allowed to introduce into the House of Commons a private bill to prevent the trade unionists of Great Britain from contributing to the political funds of the Labour party. That spirit is to be found in Australia. I believe that both industrialists and employers should have the right to contriT h e honourable membute to the funds of any political party. Where would honourable members opposite be were it not for the contributions made to their f u n d by bodies of employers 1 Without such funds, they would not be able to engage in their expensive propaganda. Honourable members prate about the desirability of a ballot of members. The unions frequently resort to that means to obtain the opinion of their members. Matters of importance are discussed at board meetings, and sometimes at general meetings, after which, in some instances, they are submitted to a ballot of members. Action is taken in accordance with the vote. A ballot is taken regarding the amount which the union will contribute to the election fund of the Labour party. I admit that in such cases I always vote "" Yes "". I shall mention one incident to show that force is not always used to obtain justice. About four years ago there was dissatisfaction among the employees in the job printing offices in Melbourne. Failing to obtain satisfaction, the whole of the men, one Friday evening, gave their employers a week's notice. The master printers then realized the seriousness of the position, with the result that a round-table conference was held, and matters adthe payment of a subsidy of justed.

It is not often that I quote the Age newspaper with approval, but I thoroughly endorse the following sentiments in the leading article in its issue to-day: Almost daily the electors are being furnished with confirmation of their steaditygrowing fears that the destinies of the nation were at last election committed to a handful of amateurs. Bills are being produced pellmell, each bearing upon it unmistakable signs of the Parliamentary tyro. And just because the Federal Ministry seems to be modelling its strategy on the proverbial bull at a gate, the thoughtful elector is being driven to remember certain things he was magnanimously prepared to forget. The Government's attempt at deportation was a legal failure; it was also a humiliation to Nationalism, and to every party supporter. The Crimes Act, if it were put to the test, would probably fare not one whit better. Why should we be in such a hurry ? Seventy-five members of this House w ill remain in Australia after the PrimeM in ister leaves for England. If the matter could be reasonably and deliberately considered in a constitutional session at Canberra, it would undoubtedly be more satisfying. I shall oppose the b ill. The insertion of only seventeen words in the Constitution is proposed in this bill, but they are words of supreme importance. In_ my opinion, it is imperative that Parliament should have the power that is being sought. that, save for the war years, it has been denied it hitherto. expressed by honourable members on both sides of the House with regard to the desirableness of equipping Parliament with these additional p,owers may be suspect of party bias, I venture to say that, were an outside observer informed that if a situation arose here that led to the suspension of transport by road, r a i l , or sea, or the cutting off of supplies of food, water, light, heat, or power, on which the safety and health, if not the very lives, of our people depend, this Parliament would have no power to meet it, and could take no steps either to prevent such a tragedy or to restore the interrupted services, but could only i m plore the various State Governments to act in their own territory, he would say that this was a national Parliament in name only. He would see that it would be quite possible, in such a crisis, for a State Government to refrai n from taking action, or to act without regard to, and not in conformity w it h , the action of another State, and so render the intended remedy of little avail. A national Parliament w i th such limited power as this Parliament has under its Constitution is, in fact, not a national Parliament. This bill is complementary to the one that was under consideration here last week. The debate on that occasion centred in the question whether this Parliament should establish authorities to do certain things, or should seek power to act on its own initiative. Honourable members opposed to this measure who participated in that debate used every argument possible to show the advisableness of clothing this Parliament w i th the most sweeping powers. They assured us that it could be trusted to exercise its authority wisely. party for the time being in power. to-day they are vigorously opposing this bill, which is designed to equip Parliament w i th adequate power. The Constitution alteration bil l already passed, dealt w i th normal and everyday conditions; but this one deals with abnormal and extraordinary conditions. A most convincing case was stated last week by the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) and the It is incredible Attorney-General( Mr Latham) for setting up an independent and non-poliWhile the views tical body, capable of weighing evidence and formin g sound judgments, to deal with the ordinary normal conditions; but honourable members opposite stoutly argued that anything and everything should be lef t to the determination of this Parliament.

In effect, they say that Parliament can be trusted to make awards governing wages, working hours, and industrial conditions generally; but cannot be trusted to deal f a i r l y w i th an interruption of essential services, which may bring the whole nation to its knees.

It has been said by several speakers that it is useless to go to England for examples of what should be done in this country, for we are too democratic to submit to what British people stand. us go to a country which is said to be governed by the workers for the workers, and see what happens there.

147,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [6.20],"recall. It has done more than any other newspaper in Australia to promote this reform. The articleto which I refer very severely condemns the measures for the amendment of the Constitution proposed by the Government, and the haste with whicli they are being rushed through. There is no reason why, when tlie Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) goes to England, this Parliament should not deal with many measures of great importance whicli the country needs. I have confidence that Pratten), assisted by the Attorney General( Mr Latham), could carry on the Government business in this House in the absence of the Prime Minister. The country did not go to rack and ruin when the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) went to England, and in his absence the government was carried on by the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt). It seems to me a slur on Ministers to suggest that they are not fitted to carry on Government business in the absence of 1. out of 112 members of this Parliament. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) has justly said that this is a simple measure consisting practically of one short sentence. But honourable members are aware that the whole intention of an act of Parliament may be defeated by the inclusion or omission of the little word ""not."" I have recently addressed many meetings on the subject of the referendum, initiative, and recall, and these have not all been gatherings of Labour supporters. Some have been gatherings of Nationalists and members of the Country party, and they have admitted the force of the arguments I have used in support of the adoption of the referendum and initiative. Groom) I ask the honourable member not to discuss the general principle of the referendum. Dr. gathering of the ToeH , which honourable members are aware is uot a political party, and those to whom I spoke agreed with the views I put before them. Why do not honourable members opposite indicate that they are tired of this piece-meal legislation? In my experience, I have come across only one measure similar to that now under consideration; I refer to a bill introduced by Sir William Irvine into the Victorian Parliament, which was more drastic and severe in the penalties for which it provided than any coercion act of which I have knowledge. It was intended to deal with a strike of railway men in this State. ference with an essential service. for the introduction of the bill was the necessity for the suppression of the railway strike. That terrible bill was passed, but when its injustice was discovered, although at the time the Victorian Legislative Council did not contain a single member of the Labour party, the act was repealed unanimously by both Houses of the State Parliament. I have so many doubts about the measure under consideration that I shall do my best to oppose it. The Age of to-day saysThis Government is developing a craze for establishing bodies over which Parliament ami. by sequence, the Australian citizens are to have no control. If we were sufficiently advanced to adopt the referendum and initiative, the people would be able to control any Parliament it created. On the public platform, we all recognize that the people possess sovereign power, and there is no member of this House who will not claim that it is an honour to be elected as a servant of the people. Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to S p.m. feature of the bill before us is the uncertainty and lack of knowledge pertaining to it. The people of Australia have already rejected three bills for the alteration of the Constitution along the lines at present proposed, and I am afraid that they will not have time to thoroughly grasp what is now intended. The rush, we are told, is necessary so that Imperial Conference in England at an early date; but the people must wonder what is behind it all. Is there a nigger hidden behind the wood-pile?

Honourable members of the Opposition would give the people f u l l power to amend the laws at any time, and, in their hearts, many honourable members supporting the Government would be willin g to do so, but they w ill not say so publicly. I have no doubt that if they were asked on the hustings, "" Are you willin g to allow the citizens who create Parliament once in three years the right to make or alter the laws at any time?"" their replies would be very guarded indeed, particularly if there were many votes likely to be affected by the answers. Mr Duncan Gillies, who was a very astute man, once said, "" An y one can f a i r l y well explain away a speech, but it is very hard indeed to explain away a vote."" We are to spend £100,000 on this referendum. Why should we take so many bites at a cherry? Why not say to the people, "" You are the creators of Parliament. We who are elected are merely the creators of a Ministry. We are w ill ing to give you the sole controlling power. W ill you accept it? Why cannot we put a number of questions to the people have already shown that 45 questions were settled at one referendum in Ohio. Why do not we delay this matter u n t i l the people of Australia are seized of the f u l l import of the issue submitted to them? How different might the legislation of this country be if , on the eve of an election, the Leader of the Government, having a very difficult question to solve, could say, "" We w ill leave this question to be settled by the electors on polling day."" I had hoped before this to see carried into law the one plank on which I started my political life, because then I should have had no fear for the future of Australia. such a question as the basic wage. They could say whether it would be sufficient for a married man, and enough to enable a single man to mate, and go through lif e as nature and God intended he should. The people could settle the question of widows' pensions. that every woman should have enough to properly clothe and feed her children. fiisi Provision could be made by which any widow could go to the proper authorities, and say, "" I have so many children, and as my income is only so the citizens of Australia may much I cannot feed them properly.""

Groom) I ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the particular amendment of the Constitution which is before the Chair. alteration of the Constitution to permit of such a question being put before the people. I cannot understand why we should at this stage waste £100,000 or more on a referendum, in view of the assurance of the Prime Minister that at the first session of Parliament held at Canberra we shall consider the whole question of the amendment of the Constitution. I sincerely hope that during my lifetime the principle of adult suffrage will be embodied in the Constitution, and thus placed beyond the whim of party politics. It is within the power of the Commonwealth Government, if it so desires, and providing that it has a majority I iu both Houses, to take from every man or woman in Australia the right to vote. Of course, such a step would not be wise, and I do not suppose that the judicial minds would agree to it . But still it is possible. If the principle of adult suffrage were embodied in the Constitution, imagine the confidence that would be inspired in the people. There could be no alteration, except by their own vote. There are hundreds of questions that could be included in the bill for submission to the people, but I should be content, for the present, to include ten or fifteen. The bill contains only eighteen words, and, therefore, greatly The people could settle limits the discussion.

Again, I remember him sayingWe should be prepared to profit by experience, and to seek to provide for the needs of tlie present and anticipate, as far as possible, the requirements of the future. The Constitution is different in character and importance from the rules of a union or articles of an association or company, to which one honourable member referred. Any alteration of the Constitution may have a most profound effect upon the well-being of the people. We should not, therefore, speak or think lightly either of this instrument as it now stands or of the labours of its founders. I accept that statement as being sound, and even statesmanlike. member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) said this afternoon that he could not understand why for so long the Commonwealth Parliament had neglected to take power to control such essential services as light, air, foodstuffs, transport, water supply, &c. could not understand, but that an outside observer probably would not understand. interjection that the honourable member does understand it , but that he considers that none but a particularly brilliant person would do so. ently, this difficulty has itself to his mind only since the printing of this b ill ; it had not previously occurred to him in all the 25 years of the history of the Commonwealth Constitution. I do not know just why the Commonwealth has not taken these additional powers in regard to essential services, unless it is that the people have not experienced any need for their exercise. That strikes me as ono possible explanation of their abstinence in this matter. When the honourable member declared that in regard to these services and the safety of the internal life of the Commonwealth we depended upon the goodwill of each individual State, his conclusions were fairly right, but his premises were entirely unsound. Attorney-General( Mr Latham), in his speech on this subject quoted paragraph v i . of section 51 of the Constitution, by which this Parliament is given power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth "" w it h respect to the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth and of the several States, and the control of the forces to execute and maintain the laws of the Commonwealth."" The first part of that power may be taken to refer to defence against external aggression, but the latter part clearly does nothing of the kind, because it vests in this Parliament power to legislate to execute and maintain the laws of the Commonwealth. We have exercised that authority in many ways, perhaps most noticeably and recently by passing an amending Crimes Act to which fhe Labour party offered very stern opposition. But it follows from that general power under the defence paragraph that this Parliament has authority to police all legislation which the ConstiThe honourable tution gives it power to enact. Take, for instance, our industrial powers. While the distinguished gentlemen who occupy the Ministerial bench were sleeping on the job, the Labour party was advocating the extension of the Commonwealth's industrial powers. We addressed argument to them for about fifteen years before it percolated into their brains, and then, like a man who, starting suddenly from sleep, puts on his trousers back to front , and does not know whether I glean from that he is going forwards or backwards, they suddenly became alive to the need for an amendment of the Constitution in regard to industrial powers. I point out to the ApparGovernment that i u proportion as this presented Parliament has extended its industrial power, it has extended also its authority to execute and maintain any laws made in the exercise of that power. If honourable members opposite were to submit to a referendum of the people the question of amplifying this Parliament's powers in regard to trade and commerce, and other matters .which the Labour party has sought to bring within our legislative competency, they would, with the grant of that extension, incidentally, and to the same extent, augment the Federal policing power to execute and maintain the laws of the Commonwealth. Instead, they, as usual, put the cart before the horse. They now ask for police powers to execute and maintain The laws which this Parliament has not the constitutional power to enact. The power to police, execute and maintain laws should be concurrent with the power",40,Maloney I Addressed A Australia May Be Represented At The
163,Mr Paterson,"I said, not that I",41,Maloney I Addressed A Australia May Be Represented At The
164,Mr Brennan,"to make them; so long as this Parliament has the legislative power, it has the policing authority it requires. The' moment we take policing powers in excess of our legislative powers, we trespass in the domain of the States, and give to them cause for grievance-and I speak not as a States righter, or as one who would defend merely local interests on parochial grounds. In addition to our own power to execute and maintain the laws of the Commonwealth, the States may invoke the aid of the Commonwealth in domestic violence. The Commonwealth has power to use its defence forces to the l i m it for the protection of the Commonwealth and the States from external violence, but, in regard to domestic violences-som e disturbance which, by its very terms, must be confined within the boundaries of a State and in other respects is purely local in character-the proper authority to exercise control is the local authority. yet. Federal history the local authority has never failed to exercise that control. The Labour party has a policy for radically remoulding the Commonwealth Constitution upon a unitary system. We believe that there should be one sovereign national Parliament, but that local government is best conducted by local bodies. If there is one function whicli more than another has been satisfactorily carried on by the local authority during the history of the Commonwealth, it is the policing power exercised by the States. Although we have a system which, being uuitary in its character, would, if put into effect, vest in the Commonwealth in the first place an almost absolute power, yet it follows from what I have said that the first duty and desire of the Commonwealth would be to have that power exercised through the provincial authorities to be created in pursuance of its policy. But so long as we have a Federal system we respect it , and so long are we bound to maintain what the Prime Ministeri n his speech on the Peace OfficersB ill called the ""fundamental relationships of the Commonwealth and the States."" When the Labour party first sought an amendment of the Constitution it had had at least 10 years of experience of its working, and the pressure of that experience drove us to ask the people to sanction an extension of the powers of this Parliament. We profited by experience, and as broad Australians, regarding the Constitution, not as a sacrosanct instrument, but as a written document evolved by the wisdom of the statesmen of the time-and I give them f u l l credit for the work they did, although I think to a large extent it was done on a wrong principle we took the view that its enumerated powers should be subject to amendment from time to time to meet the needs arising out of the growth of the Commonwealth. As I have stated that principle from a hundred platforms and on the floor of this House many times, I can consistently apply it to-day in my opposition to this measure. The Government's proposal to amend the Constitution, as provided for in this bill, And it has not failed does not respond to any test of requirements to which we submitted other proposed amendments. It is designed, apparently, to enable this Parliament to set up a War Precautions Acti n time of peace. We had more than enough of the War Precautions Act in time of war. Moreover, we find that whenever this Government has set out toextend its police powers and to interfere in a sphere of law administration which has been satisfactorily occupied for 25 years by the State Governments, it has always done so for party purposes and in a bitter partisan spirit. We are aware of the antagonism that was aroused when the Commonwealth police were first appointed by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr. Hughes), as Prime Minister, and the antipathy which they created in every department of our social life. If we are honest judges of history, we must admit that they were a failure in every respect, except in that they stirred up rancour and ill will among the people. This Government passed tlie Peace Officers Act and the Crimes Act. Subsequent to the first and prior to the second, the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) delivered a policy speech, and the Governor General delivered a speech at the opening of this Parliament.

Honourable members opposite support the b ill because they picture the Government in a seamen's strike taking charge of the shipping, in spite of the sweated seamen, running the ships between Tasmania and the mainland, and, if necessary, overseas, and calling to their assistance, not only the regular military forces, but also a special army raised by the honourable member for Warringah ( Sir Granville R y r i e ). every other essential service which is threatened by an agitation on the part of the workers of this country being taken out of the hands of the workers, and placed in the hands of officers appointed under the Peace Officers Act, w it h the extended powers that are proposed to be given by this bill. It is designed, so we are told, to protect the interests of the community, but since it does not do anything with certainty, or, if it does anything with certainty, it has been no ascertained need during the history of federation, it is not attractive to me. What is meant by protecting the interests of the public as a whole in the Has the honorevent of an actual or probable interruption of any essential services? If the policy of the Government is given effect, and if the nation takes over essential services such as water supply, light or air services, I can see the High Court deciding that this law does not empower us to take over such services; that it only clothes us with brief authority to protect them, it may be, not only from the workers, but also fro m more or less distinguished marauders on the other side. I think it was the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) , who asked the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann), this afternoon, who will be the judge of what constitutes an essential service, and who will determine whether there has been an actual or probable interruption of an essential service ? The honourable member for Perth said that, of course, His Majesty's Governor in Council will decide that matter. The Executive Council will decide it , no doubt, as it decided certain matters in The honourable connection with the Peace Officers Act, and other legislation to suit the political He sees the exigencies of the case. But having done that, the position of the Government will be similar to that which it occupied when the deportation law came before the High Court. That tribunal will be asked to decide whether in fact there was an actual or probable interruption of any essential service, and it might well be held on the question of fact or of mixed fact and law under this Drovision, that there was no actual or probable interruption of any essential service.

They know it . The right honourable the Prime Minister did not say a word about the coal-mining profiteers. that there has never been a greater crime committed against society than that these men should be permitted to draw their hundreds of thousands out of the blood and tissue of their fellow men in Britain. If the right honourable gentleman was at heart a Britisher as he is superficially, he would rise in indignation, and tell this House and the country the real facts of the case concerning the general strike in Great Britain, what it meant, and what purpose it proposed to serve. If such a condition does not arise here, it will be because Australians, profiting by the experience and the histories of other countries, have set their faces against the degradation of their fellow men, and by their organization have resolved that this kind of thing shall never occur upon Australian soil. But if it did occur, and these gentlemen were in power, if ships were held up at the wharfs because the seamen were sweated below a wage that enabled them to live; if Australian shearers were sweated-fortunatel y they cannot be because of the organization that supports them-and had to accept a wage that did not enable them to live, or if they were called upon to work under conditions debasing to their common manhood; if , indeed, any Australian service were hung up as the result of an industrial dispute, at whom would these powers be directed? Judging by the experience of the past, by the policy of this Government and the speeches of honourable members opposite, it would be directed in every instance against the working class; it would bo used as an inspiration to revile the people who do the work which keeps them in the places they enjoy.

They have emancipated themselves from the degradation of the past, and have arrived at a condition in which they can square their shoulders like men, and take a man's part in determining the conditions under which they shall work and the wages they shall receive for their' serHe knows vices. In the last resort no constitutional powers or legislative authority which the Government might obtain w ill enable it to coerce the working man to sell his services for less than a living wage. If it becomes necessary in order to obtain justice for the workers for essentia l services to stop, I say let them stop. The nation as a whole would then know what the minority had been suffering. That would bring home to the people the sufferings which should be borne by the nation as a whole and not by one class only. It w ill not then be necessary to apply measures of coercion. I stand to-day where I stood in connection with the other proposal. I stand for amplified powers for the Australian Parliament along the lines laid down by the Labour partya unitary system that delegates power to local governing authorities.

I do not stand for any tinkering with the Federal Constitution unless such alteration has been shown by experience to be necessary.

When the honourable member is speaking on a subject that is near to his heart, he is always splendidly eloquent. But to-night, in discussing the bil l itself, he was uncomfortable and unhappy because his heart was not in what he said. And he is not alone in that respect. For the most part he was only "" beating the bush."" When the honourable member really became eloquent it was concerning something that happened long before he was born, politically. Thank God, those days have passed. The workers were rescued from the wretched conditions to which he referred before nine-tenths of the Labour members in the Parliaments were born, politically. yet. of those conditions, and the enduring foundations of reform were laid before there was an organized Labour party i u Australia. Then the Labour party of 30 years ago came into beinga party comprised of men following sound economic principles. Few men in Australia understood economics as did the men who comprised the Labour party at that time. They now rest from their labours, and others whose ideals are foreign to the best interests of the Labour party have succeeded them. During recent years we have had abounding evidence of that fact. has found a congenial subject. has been near to my heart for many years. The longer I am a member of this House mendations not carried out? the more my sympathy goes out to honourable members opposite. That is bewere made by men representing all seccause they need it .

If they were left to themselves, it would be better for the workers of this country. out all right in time. orable members opposite are by no means past redemption; but some people outside Parliament connected with the Labour party are. A few months ago an appeal was made to the people. I felt it to be a great privilege to take part in the campaign. I worked day and night in the interests of the Labour party. On numerous occasions since then sound . Labour men of the old school have said to me, "" Thank God your people saved us, because our people could not ! "" They meant it . The Government really received a mandate from the people to save the Labour party. This bill is to protect the interests of the people of this country. It is long overdue because neither the Commonwealth Parliament nor the Government has the constitutional powei to take action when the economic life of the country is threatened from any cause whatever. I appeal to the judgment and conscience of honourable members opposite, and I ask them whether they do not think that the national Parliament should have that power? Do they contend that in the event of a repetition of some of the happenings of recent years the Commonwealth should be powerless to act? Reference has been made to that unparalleled crisis in the Old Country, from which many of us came, and which 1 hope we ali love and revere. No statesman has ever shown a greater earnestness or desire to relieve a difficult situation than did Mr Baldwin, the PrimeM i nister of England, in connection with the coal crisis. No finer work was ever done than that performed by the royal commission which was appointed to investigate this very difficult and delicate question.

Now let us return to the position as we find it in Australia. I speak from the depths of my heart when I say that I desire to see this country saved from economic r u in. I look for the assistance of the Labour party, because I believe that there is an important place for it in the legislative halls. Commonwealth Ministry, in discharging the obligation placed upon it by reason of the recent mandate from the electors, has no intention to attempt to shake the solid foundations on which the Labour party stands. Each of the proposals is to be submitted to the people in the best interests of all parties. It is useless for honourable members opposite to hark back to the old days, to which they generally refer when they have no other argument to bring forward. Let us look at matters as they are. Every Government proposal that is to be considered this session is intended to consolidate, not to destroy. for instance? Bill?

The trouble port this bill. Our reply is that we are prepared to support any bill that will add to the permanent power of the Commonwealth; but we are not prepared to make a political placard of the Constitution.. We challenge the Government to bring down a bill with the object of amending the Constitution to give this Parliament, every possible power that can be taken; but it is proposing to take not permanent power, but only temporary power for use in a time of emergency. The Constitution has not been amended for 25 years, and it may be another quarter of a century before an attempt will be made to amend it. In that case we should not be wasting our time asking for temporary power to use in a time of emergency; rather should we be seeking an addition to our permanent power. Government has stated that it is not prepared to ask the people to clothe Parliament with the full power over trade and commerce which it should have, and yet it expects us to support a proposal for a grant of emergency power. That is, obviously, political placarding. Honourable members on this side of the chamber are consistent in opposing this bill, as any one may see who cares to examine our printed platform. We stand for unlimited legislative power for this Parliament to deal with all things pertaining to the development and progress of Australia in time of peace; and for unlimited power for it to use the military for the defence of Australia, subject to only one condition. We hold that no government should have power to enforce military conscription for oversea war service, and that that prohibition should be definitely fixed in our Constitution, and not left to the whim of a transient government. desire to limit the power of the Parliament to use the forces of militarism. It is obvious that in this case the Government is seeking power to use military forces, and all the forces at its command, not only to maintain laws of the Commonwealth-which, course, it is bound to do under its Constitution-but, the laws of the' States.

A pretence has been made tnat circumstances have arisen which justify this. The challenge to state the definite circumstances brought forth only two suggestions. The charge was flung about in this House last year, and also about the country during the election campaign, that the Labour Government of New South Wales would not give effect to Commonwealth laws. That allegation, notwithstanding that it has been repeated over and over again, is false at its very foundation. There is not one enactment of this Commonwealth of a legitimate, constitutional character which the New South Wales The Government has refused to obey. It is true that it refused to have anything to do with certain unlawful proceedings that were attempted. What was the refusal upon which was based the Peace Officers Bill? The justification for that bill given in the House by the Prime Minister was that a request made by him to the Lang Government to appoint a State judge to the tribunal in question had been refused. The Commonwealth Government would not ask one of its own High Court judges to do the dirty work of deporting men who had lived in this country for 30 and 40 years. hardly correct.
