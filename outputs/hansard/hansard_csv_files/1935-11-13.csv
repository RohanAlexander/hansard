In Committee of Supply: Consideration resumed from the Sth November (vide page 1484). Proposed vole, Â£731,500. I wish to reiterate a protest that I have made on a number of occasions iu this chamber respecting the arbitrary powers exercised by the Commissioner of Pensions in regard to tbe making of rules and regulations under the Invalid and Old age Pensions Act. The reply given by the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) to the last complaint I made on tliis subject was quite unsatisfactory to me. In my opinion, many of the subjects on which the Commissioner of Pensions issues regulations should be dealt with in a statute of this Parliament. I direct attention, on this occasion, to two regulations in particular. The first is one under which the Commissioner has power to declare I any institution in which old, sick, or invalid people are housed to be an asylum. The declaration rests entirely with the Commissioner, who is not hampered in any way whatever by the legislation of this Parliament. Grave disabilities afflict pensioners in any institution immediately it is declared to be an asylum. I have in niindj in particular, inmates of which -are returned soldiers. I have no desire, at the moment, to make any differentiation between returned soldiers and other pensioners. I simply remind the Government that returned men who suffer from the effects of this regulation, were promised, in most fulsome language, before they went to the war, that their interests would be safeguarded in every respect. These men are in the Waterfall Sanatorium to-day 'because the Repatriation Department doctors who have examined them declare that their disability is not due to war service. The men ware suffering slightly from the effects of gas when they returned from the war, and the passage of the years has accentuated their disability until to-day many of them are the victims of malignant tuberculosis. Some of the pensioners spend two or three months at a time in institutions and then return to tlieir homes. While they are in the institution, the larger part of their pension is paid to the management of the institution and the pensioners themselves receive only 5s. or 5s. 6d. a week; 'but, immediately they return to. their homes, they again receive their f u l l pension. Upon such institutions being declared asylums, however, the pensioner inmates have to surrender their pension altogether. When they leave the institution they must make a fresh application for a pension. This means that, in some cases, the same person may have -to apply twice in twelve months for a pension. A degree of delay invariably occurs. Sometimes, in these circumstances, the pensioner loses his pension altogether for a month or six weeks. I consider that it is entirely wrong that such a disability should be placed upon them.",14,Civil Aviation Control Of Hazardous Flights

30,Mr Lane,"I s this true?the honorahle member persists in refusing to admit that what I am saying is correct, I can produce evidence that the Treasurer admits the existence of 't)he cause for my complaint. These men, after making application on leaving the Waterfall Sanatorium, have sometimes to wait for two or three weeks for the pension to be granted. Superimposed on the regulation which classes that institution as an asylum is another regulation under which the Commissioner of Pensions is empowered to determine from what date a pension shall be paid. Invalid and old-age pensions are paid under a Commonwealth statute which makes these definite provisions (1) when persons over a definite age are under certain conditions of penury, they are entitled to the old-age pension, and (2) when persons are suffering from illness which prevents them from earning a living and they are also under certain conditions of penury, they are entitled"" When applicants for pensions have satisfied the Commissioner that they have tlie Commissioner should not be entitled to withhold from them for three or four weeks. Previously the pension operated from the date of application. plaint at present, however, is against what is happening to inmates of the Waterfall Sanatorium. tions are similarly affected-the honor-, able member for Reid( Mr Gander) could cite examples from his own electorate, and among them is the Old Men's Home at Liverpool, but the inmates of old men's homes are not so seriously affected as the inmates of the Waterfall institution because most of them remain, in the homes for life. The men at Waterfall are only returned soldiers who are dying from tuberculosis contracted in the service of their country. Ministers at the table engaged in conversation are not concerned about them; they are concerned only with the young fellows who arc healthy and will be used in the next war. Patients at Waterfall are not placed similarly to the inmates of old men's homes, because frequently they are temporarily discharged from treatment at the institution; but under the arbitrary power exercised by the Commissioner, a tuberculosis patient who leaves this institution has to surrender his pension rights and make application again for the pension. The Commissioner then decides on what date the pension shall commence to operate. I know of cases where men have been denied a pension for a month after leaving the Sanatorium. make application for new pensions immediately after their discharge? applied the moment they left. AlthoughI have made several approaches to tlie Commissioner of Pensions in regard to this matter, I have been unable to receive satisfaction. The Treasury has saved thousands of pounds as the result of th ; 1 Commissioner robbing the pensioners of the pension for a month. Before anything is done to rectify the many anomalies in the Pensions Act, even to the to the invalid pension. extent of granting an increase of the rate of pension, the matter I have raised should be rectified. If the Government fulfilled these requirements, wants to save money and pile up a surplus by robbing the pensioners to whom the pension I have referred, it should do it under a statute, for then the Minister responsible could be pilloried in this House. My main comThe Government, however, by the use of regulations, is at present evading its responsibility. As a inatter of fact the Other instituwhole trend nowadays is to shelve responsibilities. In this instance the Government is able to claim that the matter is in tbe hands of the commissioner who, I have no doubt, has been told that it is his job to effect savings as best he can. The commissioner himself, however, has nothing to gain or lose by adopting the policy. The the honourable member paid any attention to the pensioners in his district, he would know tliat the conditions I have outlined do operate. My sole objective to-day is to enter a strong protest against the continued existence of the two regulations I have named. Many other anomalies in the pensions administrations could be cited, but I desire to focus the attention of the House on those two",15,Department Of The Treasury

The patients at the Waterfall Sanatorium are allowed by the New South Wales health authorities to leave the institution for two or three months and return to it ; but during the period in which they are away fro m the institution they are penalized by the withdrawal of their pension. They have contracted tuberculosis from-the poison gases which they inhaled while on active service in Europe, and they should not be denied a pension. The Government, therefore, should either amend tlie act and deprive the commissioner of the power to decide on which date the pension should operate, or direct the commissioner to withdraw his recent decision that the Waterfall Sanatorium and other similar institutions arc to be classed as asylums. The conditions of which I am complaining are new. When I was previously in this House the Waterfall instito be made available. tution was classed as an. ordinary hospital, and I have had these cases brought to my notice only since my return to this Parliament, after the last election. Shortly after receiving the first batch of complaints, I approached the Commissioner of Pensions in the belief that be was acting in error, but he showed me the act and told me that he had the power to do what he was doing, and that be proposed to exercise it . It is wrong to give any public servant power which enables him, on behalf of the Government, to take thousands of pounds out of the pockets of the indigent. The Government indulges in much talk about balancing its budget, getting back to prosperity, and turning the corner. It has no need, in order to do so, to extract a few shillings from the pensioners and then say that the commissioner i.s responpector should receive the old-age pension. sible under the powers and rights conferred upon him by the act. sions in question should be repealed. If they are not repealed, I urge the Government to tell the commissioner that it is not its wish that these institutions should worth Â£50 or Â£100. In conformity with hp termed asylums, thus putting the inmates to financial loss when they leave them. desire to direct the attention of the Treaof pocket compared with the position in surer ( Mr Casey) to the paragraph in his budget speech dealing with local government works, which reads:A3 a result of further investigation into means whereby the Commonwealth can assist in tlie problem of relieving unemployment, it has been decided, subject to satisfactory arrangements with the States, -to make provision from revenue for an amount of Â£100,000 in 1035-30, to be used in the form of contributions towards interest and sinking funds or loans for the public works of local authorities. It is known that many local governing bodies a.re debarred from proceeding with public utility schemes by reason of the consequent debt service being beyond their rateable capacity. It is vitally important that these works should be put in hand as quickly as possible. The local governing bodies concerned are anxious to proceed with them, but they have no information in regard to the proposal beyond what appears in the budget speech. They wish to know how the money is to be allocated, and the terms and conditions upon which it is subject of a special appropriation. I shall furnish the honourable member with particulars when I reply to the debate. I direct the attention of the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) to the case of old-age pensioner prospectors.

A study of the act will show that it contains no reference to total incapacity. vided for by regulation. honourable member. A section of the act provides that regulations may be promulgated from time to time. But the actalso says that the regulations made under it must not be inconsistent with it. A regulation that conflicts with the spirit of totally and permanently incapacitated. the act should not be tolerated. Actually when this young woman was sent into a sanatorium, and the Pensions Department refused her a pension on the ground that, though she was suffering from tuberculosis, she was not totally incapacitated, the then Minister for Health( Mr Hughes) was publishing in the press statements warning the public of the dreadful consequences likely to result from associating with people afflicted with tuberculosis. He went so far as to say that he would, if he had the power, prevent. tuberculosis sufferers from marrying, while in the case of those who had married, and who had children, he would take the children away from their parents. The relatives of this young woman, were not in a position to assist her financially. If the department grants her application for a pension, it will involve only the payment of 12s. 6d. a week to the State institution, and 5s. a week to the patient herself for the purchase of clothing and other necessaries. All the patients in sanatoriums of this kind are not confined to their beds, so that it is necessary for them to provide themselves with clothing, and 5s. a week is little enough for clothing and other purposes. This girl is in such a position that she must either stay in the institution, lacking the things she needs, or return to the workshop, where she will be a danger to the health of fellow workers. Thus, while the Commonwealth Health Department is warning the public of the dangers of contact with tuberculosis sufferers, the Pensions Department, by its refusal to grant a pension, is likely to compel this sufferer to associate once more with the public. I asked the then Minister for Health, in view of his public utterances, to interest himself in the case, and to use his influence to have the girl's application granted. He wrote to the Treasurer, and the Treasurer wrote to the Pensions Department, with the result that, after the lapse of nearly two months, I received a communication from this department in almost the exact terms of the previous one, namely, that, although the applicant was suffering from tuberculosis, she was not It was further suggested' that she make representations to some State department for assistance, but it must have been well known to tie Commonwealth Treasurer that there was no State department' to which such an application could be addressed with any hope of success. The great majority of those who become infected with tuberculosis do not regain their health, and become less and less able as time passes to support themselves. I believe that all such sufferers who are prepared to enter a sanatorium, where they will no longer be a menace to the health of the community, should be granted pensions if they apply for them, and that it should not be necessary to prove that they are totally incapacitated. Municipalities in which are situated Commonwealth properties receive no raites in respect of them, and I think that the Treasury might well make a grant to compensate the councils for this loss of revenue. In my electorate there are four municipalities which have gone heavily into debt in order to provide money for relief work, and in some of those electorates are extensive Commonwealth properties from which no rates are received. I understand that although the Commonwealth Bank is not obliged to pay rates, it nevertheless makes a grant to the municipalities concerned as an offset to the loss thus entailed. The Commissioner of Pensions should be allowed greater discretion in respect of claims foT the payment of the maternity allowance. In the case of many applicants, it is discovered that the husband has, during the previous twelve months, earned perhaps f l or Â£2 over and above the permissible",18,Department Of The Treasury
53,Mr Geobge Lawson,That is pro,19,Department Of The Treasury
54,Mr Rosevear,"I agree with theincome,, and the application is refused. I realize that, no matter where the margin is fixed, there must be some injusStatesi n seeking means of simplifying tice in the border-line cases, but if the Commissioner were given discretionary power, as is done in the case of old-age and invalid pensions, he would be able to consider the financial position of the family, and their probable earnings over the following twelve months, and grant the allowance in deserving cases. There appears on the Estimates an item for the financing of valuers to purchase motor cars for their own use. Eor 1934-35, a sum of Â£800 was voted for this purpose, and Â£390 was expended. This year the amount has been reduced to Â£200. As this seems to be an unusual item, I trust that the Treasurer ( Mr sideration. To give a further illustration Casey) will be able to enlighten honourable members regarding it. In view of the large amount provided for medical examinations of pensioners which, this year, is increased by Â£600 to ! a total of Â£7,000, I desire to know whether medical officers are paid by results; that is, by the number of pensioners they write off the -pensions registhree times in the State sphere. Honorter, or by the number of applicants sent to them for examination. Are examination fees charged by doctors, in respect of cases in which they have made obvious mistakes, deducted from the bill which thoy render to the department ? We all know that in a large percentage of cases applications rejected by these medical examiners are ultimately approved by other departmental doctors. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [4.22] -In connection with division 22, Income Tax Board of Review, I desire to bring under the notice of the responsible Minister, the taxation imposed on the income of a married lady who, because of incompatibility of temperament, is separated from her husband. This case was brought before the Income Tax Court of Review; but, because of the present legislation and rulings made under it, her request for consideration was turned down. Possibly, I should not have brought this case before the -committee had I not been interested in the remarks of the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Price) in regard to the necessity for a simplification of our taxation machinery. Some time ago, this case was brought before a commission which was appointed to act conjointly with the taxation legislation. I now bring it before honourable members that they may gain some knowledge of the complex forms of taxation that are imposed upon an all too unsuspecting public. This lady was in receipt of a certain sum of money from her husband as a separation allowance, together with an allowance for her daughter, a minor! The original income from the husband was assessed for taxation and the separation allowance of the wife was also assessed; thus, the original income of the husband was, in effect, doubly assessed. But, under the then existing legislation, the Court of Review was unable to take this fact into conof how the complexity of taxation legislation imposes difficulties on the unfortunate taxpayers, this lady had to pay not only federal taxation, but also State unemployment tax in respect of the daughter's allowance. In other words, the original income of the husband was assessed twice in the federal sphere and able members will, I am sure, agree that the continuance of such a state of affairs is not desirable, and the Government should give greater attention to the simplification of our taxation legislation. Has any appointment yet 'been made to the position of Commonwealth Commissioner of Pensions? Since the position has become vacant, an officer has been acting in it, but I think it is usual to fill important positions such as that without great delay. If no permanent appointment has yet been made, I suggest for the consideration of the Government, the wisdom of making such an appointment from the existing staff of the Pensions Department. Generally speaking, we all agree that in the conduct of their duties the officers of that department are not only capable and experienced, but also sympathetic. Therefore the avenues for promotion should not be closed to them by the appointment of an officer occupying a responsible position in another department. In the administration of a department like the Pension? Department, an intimate knowledge of the pensions aet and an understanding of the frailties of human nature are very",19,Department Of The Treasury
55,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [4.26],"necessary. Although these positions are often filled with a degree of success by senior officers from other departments, sympathetic consideration of individual cases cannot be brought to bear by some officer transferred from another department whose training does not fit him for the position. In any case, it is unfair to a week. the senior officers of the Pensions Department not to promote them to the highest positions in the department. If I were in order in discussing the operation of the Invalid and Oid-age Pensions Act, I would move an amendment that the rate of pension bo increased from 18s. to 20s. n week. I hope, however, that the Government will take that step. I support what has been rightly said by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr week allowed to old-age pensioners. A Rosevear) in regard to the claims made for invalid pensions. I think every honourable member has brought to his notice instances in which people suffering from tuberculosis have made application for invalid pensions only to find tlieir applications refused -because in the opinion of the doctor the applicants were not premanently and totally incapacitated for work. Many of them in order to earn a living are forced to return to their trades.

On visiting a sanatorium in my electorate not long ago, I was surprised to learn from the matron the likelihood of contracting tuberculosis from people with whom one is closely associated, particularly in a badly ventilated workroom. The honourable member for Dalley has done a great service iu bringing under notice the propaganda put forward by the former Minister for Health( Mr some reason to ask that the department Hughes) in regard to the necessity for wiping out this disease and the failure of the Pensions Department to assist in a practical way. In the administration of the Pensions Department greater sympathy should be shown to applicants suffering from tuberculosis.

It is unfair that people suffering from heart disease should be prevented from earning the 12s. 6d. a number of border cases are also refused pensions because the applicants eannoi prove that they are permanently and totally incapacitated for work, and 1 want the department to he more sympathetic when considering them. honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) has mentioned, pensioners who leave an institution and do not apply for a pension for a fortnight, should have the pension dated back to the time of their leaving the institution, instead of from They are the date of the application. Many of these pensioners are elderly men-som e of At any them are over 70 years of age-and unless they have a member of Parliament or some other person to advise them, they arc frequently unable to appreciate the necessity for making application promptly. In many cases, pensioners have to wait weeks and months before approval i> given for the payment of the pension. A great deal of hardship is caused to pensioners because of the stand the department takes in these matters. If there is need to place the onus on the pensioner to prove his claim, there is also should be required to deal with cases expeditiously. In my opinion, all the needs of the situation could be met without allowing the Commissioner the wide discretionary power that he now has. Once a pension has been granted, it should, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, be payable, not the date on which a medical practitioner certifies",20,Department Of The Treasury

Such a provision would place a check upon the administration, and limit the number of ca3cs of hardship. I have a case in hand in respect of which I have been endeavouring to get a decision for six months. I am perfectly sure that the claimant is fully entitled to institution, and not pay it in respect of a pension, and I know that the department will reach this conclusion sooner or later. It is unfair that the claimant should have to suffer because the department, makes its decision later and not sooner. T had brought under my notice at home on Saturday the case of a mentally-deficient boy, who has been refused a full pension on the ground that he is not totally and permanently incapacitated; but abundant evidence has been produced to indicate that the boy could not possibly earn his living. The medical officers will not, in many instances, take the trouble to examine claimants properly. If a pensioner is unfortunate enough to come before a doctor who is suffering from "" liver "" or from some temporary temperamental upset, he is very likely to be examined in a most perfunctory fashion. Frequently, the doctors do not give pensioners a proper opportunity to explain their troubles, with the result that the claim is rejected. an inmate of an institution applies for and Such cases often come under the notice of members of Parliament, who, after considerable, trouble, obtain a reversal of the previous decision. Why should pensioners, in such cases, be denied the pension for the period from the date of application to the date of approval by a medical officer? If pensioners were business men, accustomed to submitting matters to a judicial body, it might be satisfactory to oblige them to prove their circumstances in every respect; but in many cases the claimants are aged people who are incapable of presenting their cases with justice to themselves. I hope that the Treasurer will give careful consideration to the representations that are being made to him this afternoon on this subject. direct the attention of the Treasurer ( Mr 'Casey) to certain anomalies of our pensions law, and also to certain adminisindividuals who may know that they are trative defects. I shall refer first to inmates of benevolent institutions, who are granted pensions after their entry into the institutions. It is most unfair, to my mind, that the Pensions Department should.pay 13s. a week maintenance in respect of pensioner inmates of benevolent institutions who were in receipt of a pension before they entered the inmates who obtain the pension only after they enter the institution. This is an entirely unjustifiable discrimination. I have received a letter on this subject from Miss Ivy Quinton, the secretary of the Maitland Benevolent Committee, and subsequently made representations upon it to the Commissioner of Pensions. The reply the Commissioner sent to me, dated the 26th October, read as follows:With reference to your personal representations of bhe 30th October, forwarding correspondence as per copy attached frotu MissI . J. Quinton, secretary, Maitland Benevolent Committee, West Maitland, on the subject of payment for maintenance of pensioner inmates of institutions, I have to advice you that, whether a person WHS a pensioner or a claimant for pension at bhe date of his admission to the institution, payment is made by the Commonwealth for his maintenance at a rate equal to the difference between the amount of -pension paid to him in the institution and the amount of pension wQiidt lie would receive if he were not an inmate. 'Where, 'however, a iperson who is already is granted a pension, no responsibility is accepted by the Commonwealth in respect of payment for his maintenance in the institution. I am amazed that such a differentiation should be allowed to continue. There are ways of overcoming the difficulty. The persons concerned could leave the institution temporarily, obtain a pension while away, and then return to the institution. In such a case the department would pay maintenance to the institution unless it was satisfied that the action had not been taken for the specific purpose of enabling it to obtain payment for maintenance. But I cannot understand why there should bo any need to adopt such a procedure. Many people enter benevolent institutions in entire ignorance of the fact that they are entitled to social benefits. They obtain their information on the subject from fellow inmates. Other",21,Department Of The Treasury

The department is not consistent in its attitude it-o pensioners who are inmates of institutions. A person who is granted a full pension while a patient of a hospital receives only 5s. a week, the remaining 13s. going to the management of the hospital. When this practice in regard to hospitalshasbeen brought under the notice of the department on the occasions when we have endeavoured to obtain a similar procedure in respect of benevolent institutions, we have been informed that the maintenance payment is made in such cases because the hospital is not the permanent place of abode of the pensioner, whereas a benevolent institution is usually the permanent place of abode. It appears to me, however, that there would be much more justification for making the payment in respect of the pensioners' permanent place of abode than in respect of his temporary place of residence. honourable member that he is entitled to discuss only the administration of the Pensions Department. what I am doing. I am directing attention to an administrative defect. My request that the procedure in relation to hospitals should also be followed in respect to benevolent institutions is entirely reasonable. In passing, I express my regret that the Treasurer is not in the chamber while this subject is being discussed, for this is one of the few opportunities that honourable members have to bring such matters prominently under his notice. I admit that an Assistant Minister( Mr expired and when I wanted to complete Hunter) is at the table trying to take shorthand notes for the purpose of submitting to the Treasurer the case which I am making. The point is, however, that he may miss quite a lot of what is being said and, therefore, be unable to convey to the Treasurer the real purport of what has been discussed before the committee. On the ""6th November, I followed up questions asked by me in the House with two letters to tlie Treasurer. I have as yet had no reply, either to the questions or to the letters. When the Treasurer is not present in the chamber, how can I now get a reply to matters which I have previously placed before him without the satisfaction of an answer? The same complaints as I unsuccessfully placed before the Treasurer I brought to the notice of the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), who recommended that I await the return of the Treasurer from the Loan Council.

In regard to the complaints that have been made concerning the date from which pensions operate, I understand that the Commissioner in each State is restricted by regulations under the Pensions Act. He ca.n go back for only a certain period in granting pensions. That restriction acts unfairly in many instances, but I do not blame the Pensions Department. I must say that the officers of the department in Queensland do everything in their power towards expediting the granting of applications for pensions. A person who might make application for a pension from Uraiidang, Camooweal or Bouilia, or any other place,, from where the mail takes a fortnight to reach Brisbane, is certain to be subjected to disadvantages compared with an applicant in the metropolitan area. Before investigations into a claim have been comreceive their rights and should bo paid pleted, three months or more may elapse. In the meantime, the applicant lives on credit from the storekeeper on the understanding that when he receives his pension he will be able to settle the debts that he incurs. The Pensions Department will make the pension payment date hack three weeks ov a month from the day on which it has been decided to grant it. But, as I have pointed out,, three months or more may have elapsed since the dato on which the application was made, and the pensioner is, therefore, a heavy loser. An applicant in the metropolitan area may lodge his application one day and appear before the magistrate on the following day, and a pension is probably granted forthwith. Another matter which causes a good deal of heart-burning among pensioners ia the way in whicli the pensions system penalizes those who have been thrifty and who have taken out insurance policies of .â¬200 or perhaps Â£250. The pension is reduced by Is. 6d. a week for a man and his wife. The premium for a Â£200 or a Â£250 policy depends on the period in which it has been in force, but a fair average is Â£14 or Â£15 a year. In respect of the amount of insurance held, there is I suggest that on a reduction of Â£1 in Â£10 in the annual amount of the pension. Furthermore, immediately the insurance becomes payable if it amounts to Â£200, the insured person becomes ineligible to receive a pension until such time as the amount of the property he holds is reduced to less than Â£100, or Â£50 for a man and Â£60 for his wife. Persons who have been thrifty enough to make some provision which would help to keep them off the pensions register, therefore, are penalized, while those persons who have made no such provision receive the full benefit of the pensions system. In criticizing the pensions system, however, it would be well for honourable members to realize that it is not in the power of the Deputy Commissioner or the Commissioner to amend the act or the regulations. The weaknesses of the pensions system are not due to the fact that these officers are unsympathetic. The fact is that the act restricts the Pensions Department. If honourable members are anxious that the pensioners should the pension immediately they reach the age of 65, they should seek to have the act amended. [5.0] I should like that part of the Pensions Act relating to medical examinations to be amended. During the budget debate I brought before the committee a complaint which I considered was worthy of some investigation or reply. So far, unfortunately, I have not heard that the department or the Treasurer has taken any notice of it . The method adopted by the department, particularly by the medical referee, in examining applicants for the invalid pensions, is far too drastic, and, in my opinion, most unjust. I repeat what 1 have said on previous occasions in this chamber that the Government should institute a different method. Many applications for the invalid pension are rejected on the ground that the medical referee considers that the applicants are not totally and permanently incapacitated for work. Some of those rejected have produced as many as six or seven certificates from outside medical practitioners who have expressed their opinion that the persons examined were entitled",23,Department Of The Treasury
74,The Chairman,No point of order,24,Department Of The Treasury
75,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [4.55],,24,Department Of The Treasury
76,Mr George Lawson (Brisbane),"to and eligible for tbe invalid pension. I suggested two or three years ago, in speaking on the pensions question, that it was only reasonable that the Commonwealth Government should adopt the same method as is adopted by the Queensland State Insurance Office in dealing with workers' compensation. TheState Insurance Office obtains evidence from its own doctors and from outside medical men, but, if there is any disparity, the opinion of a referee doctor is sought, and the case is decided on a majority opinion. In order to give the unfortunate applicants for the invalid pension better consideration, the Commonwealth Government should so amend the Pensions Act aa to enable a similar procedure to be followed by the Pensions Department. ' If private medical practitioners give applicants for the invalid pension certificates that they are totally and permanently incapacitated, and the government medical referee takes a different view , a third opinion 7 should be sought, and the majority should prevail. said that where the medical evidence differed the benefit of the doubt would be given to the applicant. like to know whether that is also the interpretation of the present Treasurer, because I have one particular case which I brought up a few weeks ago and feel that it is worthy of being brought up again. My disappointment at not having received a reply is shared by many hundreds of my constituents. It is a case which shows how harshly and unjustly fhe existing medical system operates. It is the case of a youth, 21 years of age, who had never done one hour's work. His unfortunate parents were in very poor circumstances, his father being a relief worker and Ms three sisters being unable to secure employment. His application for an invalid pension was rejected. Six months later, I repeated the application in his behalf, and it was again rejected in consequence of the -report of the medical referee. I made a further application at the end of another six months. On the third occasion, he was examined on the Thursday. On the Friday morning, he was sent to hospital. On the following Monday morning, I received from the Deputy Commissioner the notification that the applicant had again been examined and it was regretted that the government medical referee had certified that, in his opinion, the youth was not eligible for a pension because he was not permanently and totally incapacitated for work. On the Tuesday morning I received a telephone message from the parents stating that their son had died in hospital on the previous night. I consider that the circumstances justify an inquiry by the Government into the methods adopted by this medical referee. They are unfair and unjust, and do not give a fair deal to hundreds of persons in my electorate who, 'because of his reports, are denied an invalid pension, to which they arc entitled. I am personally acquainted with persons who have never done any work and yet are unable to get a pension because the medical referee says that they are not totally and permanently incapacitated for work. I wholeheartedly agree with the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) that the administration of this particular provision is not in accord with the intention of the Act. The word "" totally "" or "" wholly "" has been inserted by regulation. That was never intended. A person must be as helpless as a child to secure an invalid pension. I have made this complaint many times previously, yet the practice is still continued. I do not attach any blame to the officers of the department. I have always found every officer, particularly the Deputy Commissioner in Queensland, sympathetic and courteous, and ready and willing to help in every way. I realize that that officer has to administer the act, and that he is unable to do many of the things that he would like to do. I hope that the Government will not allow the destinies of these unfortunate persons to rest in the hands of one individual who, in his examinations, is not as sympathetic as he should be. I wish to refer again to another matter that I have mentioned previously. It relates to the administration of the act in connection with married couples who are living apart from one another. Either the husband or the wife must obtain a divorce or a legal separation 'before he or she can become entitled to the pension.",24,Department Of The Treasury
77,Mr Riordan,A former Treasurer,25,Department Of The Treasury
78,Mr George Lawson,"I shouldQuite a number of persons are unable to comply witb tliat requirement, and consequently are denied the pension. A particular case that I have in mind is that of a male applicant who has been living apart from his wife for 25 years. She, having been fortunate enough to obtain a little money, purchased three houses, one of which she occupies, and from the remaining two of which she draws rent, which is sumcient to maintain her. The husband has not been able to do any work for a number of years. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr E. I "" . Harrison) -Order! The honourable member is getting a little wide of the item. endeavouring to prove that the administration is depriving these particular people of (she old-age pension. The department could administer the act more sympathetically without contravening any of its provisions. It could easily make a regulation to cover these cases. Buti f that is considered not possible, I hope that the act will be amended. [Quorum formed-\ 1. desire to refer to what I consider a derea young station hand who was liction of duty on the part of the taxation branch of the Treasury Department. It is well known that the making up of a tax return is quite an intricate task for (bo majority of people. The taxpayer may, in perfect honesty, make the mistake of omitting to include an item of taxable income. If the mistake is discovered, as it is likely to be in the course of time, he may incur the penalty of a fine of anything up to Â£25; and if the evasion has continued over a period of years, he may be threatened with imprisonment. On the other hand, a taxpayer may, through ignorance, return more than is required; yet, although this must be perfectly obvious to the officers of the department, he is assessed on the full amount. Evidently, the instructions issued to officers are responsible for this practice being followed. It approaches very closely to fraudulent practice. The taxpayer first learns of his mistake when he receives a letter from an ex-officer of the department who has gone into private practice in the belief that he can derive considerable profit from the mistakes of taxpayers, advising him that he has been overpaying for years, and guaranteeing recovery in return for a substantial percentage of the amount remitted. I could name men in Western Australia who have grown wealthy in this way. They left the Taxation Department, and, acting upon knowledge gained while in the employ of the Commonwealth, wrote to taxpayers who had been overpaying ths department for years suggesting that thoy could obtain a refund of tax provided a substantial percentage was paid to them. That kind of thing should not be permitted. It is apparently the set policy of the department to take advantage of the mistakes of taxpayers, and accept overpayments, but to prosecute where the mistake happens to be against the department. This practice has brought into existence a class of men who are using knowledge gained officially to enrich themselves. This could not happen if the department advised taxpayers who forwarded incorrect returns of the mistakes they had made. desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) the case of partly crippled as the result of an accident, and who applied for, and was granted, an invalid pension. He was given a home with a family, and in return for his keep, did what light work he could. He was not paid; indeed, had he asked for payment no one would have employed him. In answer to the inquiry of the department, he stated truthfully that he was doing a little work, such a cutting wood and milking one or two cows. On the ground that he was not permanently and totally incapacitated, he lost his pension. My experience is that the officers of the Pensions Department are usually sympathetic to genuine applicants, but they are bound by regulations which they must enforce. In this case, the officers, apparently, had no choice but to cancel the pension, although there was no doubt that the man was permanently incapacitated. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) this afternoon mentioned the case of a youn<woman who was suffering from tuberculosis, and was refused a pension because she was not totally incapacitated. If th;-",25,Department Of The Treasury

I should like to know why the appointment of a Commissioner for Pensions has been held up. appointments are made before an offit-e becomes vacant; but, in regard to the Pensions Department, which is one of the most important in the Service, the Government has not yet chosen any one to fill the first position. I also protest against the long delays which frequently occur between the application for a pension and the payment of it. approved, the pension is often made payable only from the date of approval, but I maintain that it should be paid from the date of the application. Very often the applicant secures credit on the strength of his or her expectation of a pension and, when approval is finally given, debts have accrued which must be paid. It is not always the Deputy Commissioner who is to blame for the delay; sometimes tlie delay takes place in the office of the Clerk of Petty Sessions. It would be more satisfactory if the Pensions Department would work through Commonwealth officers rather than those employed by the State. In even the smallest community there is a post office, and postal officials could quite well carry out work in connection with pensions. The State official is not particularly concerned with this class of work, because nothing he does in regard to pensions will recommend him to his superiors. It would be different in the case of postal or other Commonwealth officers. [Quorum formed.] protest against the action of tlie Pensions Department in declining to make pensions payable from the date of application. Sometimes the Deputy Commissioner makes a pension retrospective for a month or six weeks, but that is not enough; it should be made payable from the date of application, because inquiries arc sometimes unduly protracted by the department itself. The act provides that the applicant, if he possesses the necessary qualifications, shall receive the pension at the age of 65, and in most cases the applicants are considerably oveT that age before they apply. Under the provisions of the act pensioners should receive payment from the date of application. I desire to bring under the notice of In other cases, the Treasurer the ease of a man, 41 years of age, who applied for an invalid pension after having been six years out of work. I obtained for him the necessary certificate to the effect that he was totally and permanently incapacitated, but, because his father, who was 75 years of age, was adjudged to be capable of supporting him, the pension was refused. In assessing tlie father's income, the value of his home was put down at 15s. a week, When the application is finally and this brought his total income to more than the stipulated amount. The father was also supporting another son, 30 years of age, who was unemployed. I maintain that it was never the intention of the act that a father 75 years of age should bd responsible for the support of an invalid son, 41 years of age. When the act provided that children were to be responsible for the maintenance of their parents, the provision was made applicable only to those who enjoyed an income of Â£6 a week or more, but the father in this case does not receive more than the 'basic wage. The position in regard to the inconiy which invalids may possess is far from satisfactory. The act states that the invalid may have a separate income of 12s. 6d. a week, and this has been interpreted to mean that he may receive this income from property. If , however, he earns this amount, or, indeed, any amount, it is contended that he cannot be totally incapacitated, and a pension is denied I know of one woman in BrokenH ill whose pension has been cancelled on the ground that a new examination had disclosed that she was no longer totally and permanently incapacitated. Within a week of the receipt of thh notice, I obtained a certificate from the medical superintendent of the BrokenH i ll Hospital saying that the woman was not able to work, but I was not able to have her pension restored. The woman had stated in her annual return to the department that she was receiving frc*: board and lodging in return for services. Actually, she was given board and lodging out of charity, being able to do very little in return. The department should",26,Department Of The Treasury
82,Mr Clark (Darling) [5.28],"I alsoadminister the provisions in regard to permanent and total incapacity wi'th greater sympathy, because, under tlie present method, many persons entitled to pensions are denied them. My attention was recently drawn to the case of a woman whose invalid pension was, reduced because she had obtained a maintenance order against her husband for Â£1 a-week.. Her -husband' had deserted her, and was living in another State. She has been unab.le to. collect anything under that order, but because: of its existence the department assessed her annual income as Â£52, and reduced her pension to. Â£27 6s. per annum. In view of the fact that she is actually receiving nothing under'the maintenance-ordec, she should no.t be debarred-fnom receiving the full; rate of pension.. If the department maintainsitsi present attitude it should undertake the collectionof the money due under the maintenance order, and see that the pensioner is,paid the full pension to which she is entitled. I havebroughtunderthe notice of the department the case of an invalid pen1 sioner'whose-pension was stopped because ho had accepted the position of caretaker of an outback tank at a weekly salary of 10s. His duties are to collect fees from any person who use the supply at the tank. This jobcould be undertakenby a Blind, man or by any person unable to undertake any other kind of work. ""When the pensionslaw was framed I do not think it was ever intended that it. should operate so harshly asthis -The act provides than an old-age pensioner may-have an income of 12s. 6d. a week without suffering a reduction of his pension, and I maintain that an invalid pensioner engaged in non-laborious work should be permitted to receive the full pension while earning up to a similar amount. Another case in which harsh treatmentlias been meted out by the department is that of a man living-at Dubbo who had a sum of money left to him a few years ago. This man is living with his unemployed son and daughter and their families, and has utilized the legacy to assist in the upkeep of their home. As theresult of the father's' generosity while the money lasted, the son was not receiving the dole. This man's application for a pension was refused, and he [00] wasnotified that his application would be reviewed in October of this year. I have here a letter dated the 22nd. October advising the applicant that, his claim had been refused again on. the ground that he was in possession of property valued at Â£400. He has spent his. money and the fact that he once possessed it should not affect his application for a pension. He is so incapacitated that he. has to be conveyed' in a cart to collect the dole.. The police inspector at Dubbo has asked me to do what I . can. to secure a pension for him, and' is prepared to recommend that a pension be granted'; but despite this the department las turned him down. Such a case should receive more sympathetic consideration by the department X. know that the deputy, commissioners of pensions are tied by regulations, but wherethere is any doubt as, to the eligibilityof' an applicant for a pension the Treasurer ( Mr Casey), should.be prepared' to, give him the. benefit, of the doubt. I have called attention to. cases iu which applicants have been refused: invalid' pensions: on the ground that thoy are not: in, a-, sufficiently bad; state of 1 health. Five months ago, I brought under notice the case of a man. suffering from? tuberculosis whose application was turned down; on, the ground that his complaint, was not. in a sufficiently advanced stage to justify a pension being granted. I wasinstrumental in securing, a, further certificate, from Ms medical adviser stating, notonly that the, applicant's lungs were affected, but that. his. spine also w,as' affected.. But while the depar.tr ment was considering whether, this man was in a sufficiently advanced state of tuberculosis, he died from tuberculosis. The Pensions Act should be administered more sympathetically. On a previous occasion, I made reference to misleading statements made by the then AssistantTreasurer ( Mr Casey). I was obliged by the Chairman to withdraw, but I'said-, that I would take the first opportunity to prove the truth of my assertion. The Assistant Treasurer sai'd that invalid pensioners were entitled to earn, speaking fo>om memory, about 5s., or 6s. a week. About that time. I received a communication from the East",27,Department Of The Treasury

Would you kindly inform me if that statement is correct and if it would be safe to advise invalid pensioners entirely on the nature of the service rendered accordingly ? That letter was signed by J. McRae, honorary secretary to the association. I submitted it to the Treasurer and received the following reply:With reference to the attached copy of correspondence forwarded hy you on the subject of earnings of invalid pensioners. 1 have to inform you that casus have arisen from time to time in which invalid pensioners have received occasional payments of a fewshillings per week for small services rendered, notwithstanding that the medical evidence indicated that they were permanently and totally incapacitated for work.

""When they are compelled to pension cancelled, .1 have to advise that, in enter a public hospital for treatment, order to qualify for an invalid pension, the their hospital expenses are met from these claimant must be totally ""and permanently infunds, and these pensioners rightly believe capacitated for work. Obviously, if a pensioner is able to work, although he may not tliat in such circumstances their pension Mr Ward. be able to earn sufficient to make him ineligible for a pension if the income provisions of the law are applicable, he is not incapacitated for work. Cases arise, however, when an invalid pensioner receives a nominal amount by way of charity for performing light services, and the pension is not cancelled. It is not possible to state the amount which is allowed to bu received under these conditions. It depends and the circumstances in which it is paid. After reading the whole of the replies received to my queries, it is obvious to any reasonable person that it would be very difficult for any pensioners' organization or any individual pensioner to arrive at any conclusion as to exactly what the position is in regard to permissible earnings. In one reply the Minister says that, under certain conditions, pensioners are entitled to earn small sums, but in a later letter he makes it clear that, if an invalid pensioner is able to earn even 6d. a week, he is not entitled to an invalid pension. This is a matter which should be placed beyond doubt; because many invalid pensioners I have a vivid a week for such services as holding a horse for a traveller without suffering a Later, the I think, I desire now to refer to pensions paid and then to continue it at the rate of 5s. should remain intact. In some cases, the hospital fun d or benefit society pays the hospital up to Â£2 2s. a week for the maintenance of the pensioner. I took up this matter with the department, but found that it was not prepared to give consideration to cases where the pensioner happened to be a contributor to a hospital fund or benefit society. I thereupon communicated with the Treasurer, who advised me as follows:With reference to your recent remarks in the House of Representatives on the subject of invalid and old-age pensions, I have to inform you that the provision regarding the suspension of the pension on a pensioner's admission to hospital and the payment of not more than four weeks' pension on discharge was designed to enable pensioners leaving a hospital to purchase extra comforts necessary during the period of convalescence. hospital, the pensioner is wholly maintained, and, in these circumstances it is thought that a hospital pension of os. per week is sufficient. If li is maintenance is being contributed to by a friendly society or State hospital fund, the logical step to take would be to decrease the ex-gratia payment made by the Commonwealth to the institution. As the contributions by these societies arc, with few exceptions, only small, it is not proposed to take action in the direction indicated. Tho Treasurer missed the point that I Industry of Now South Wales indicates that was making. The case I brought under work do not constitute wages for emergency notice was that of an invalid pensioner or intermittent relief work in lieu of sustecontributing to a hospital fund who had nance or food relief within the meaning of the to enter hospital. If he had had only act and thore is no option, therefore, but to himself to care for, there might have been the amount of pension payable. Mrs. some force in the Treasurer's arguments; is in receipt of the highest amount of pension hut, unfortunately, the man had a wife payable, having regard to her husband's and young children dependent upon h i m, income and it is regretted, therefore, that it and the few extra shillings that would have come into the home, had the f u l l To my mind it .is entirely unfair, particupension been continued, would have been larly in view of the assurances that have of very great assistance, for the pensioner been given, that wages received for such was at that time subject to an eviction work as that provided by the Metropolitan order for the non-payment of rent. See""Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board at ing that the hospital was being paid from Maroubra should be taken into account in another source for the maintenance of the assessing eligibility for pension. I ask the man, and that the Government would Treasurer, in his reply, to indicate once have suffered no financial loss by again exactly how the Government continuing the pension at the f u l l amount, regards work of this description and how I consider that no reduction should have any differentiation can be drawn between hecu made. It is reasonable to ask that, the various classes of relief work. in all such cases, the Pensions Department should continue the pension at the normal rate. The method of assessing income to Formerly, such income was not taken into determine eligibility for pension also account. In these days, it appears that requires reconsideration. A lady in East every possible penny is brought under Sydney applied for an invalid pension, notice. The inclusion of war pensions as which was granted at the maximum rate. Her husband subsequently obtained relief wbrk for two weeks in five. Although undertakings have been given in this Parliament on several occasions that wages received for relief work or intermittent work in lieu of sustenance or food relief would not be taken into account in determining eligibility for a pension, the Pensions Department immediately took into account the amount that the lady's husband was receiving for his two weeks' work in five, with the result that her pension was reduced. I brought this case under the notice of the Treasurer and subsequently received from him the following reply:The definition of income in section 4(1) of Whilst he is in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act provides that income shall not include sustenance or fond relief or wages received for emergency work or intermittent relief work in lieu of sustenance or food relief except in cases where the pension is excluded from the income of the person for the purpose of determining the eligibility of the person to receive the benefits referred to. Pensioner's husband is employed by the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board on relief work at Maroubra. Advice received from the Department of Labour and wages which the husband receives on tluB take such wages into account in determining is not possible to approve of an increase. Another cause for complaint is that war pensions are taken into account in assessing income for pension purposes. income for the purpose ioÂ£ determining the income of applicants for pensions has imposed.great hardship on many people. I consider .that each case of this kind should he dealt with on its merits. .1 have in mind the circumstances of a lady whose young 'daughter could not go out to seek employment became her f u l l .time -was occupied .in. looking aÂ£ter i c r bedridden mother. The .mother was .in. such a .condition that bhe .services >of a .nurse had f requently to be obtained and'.considerable such persons would be treated much more expense had to he incurred in providing medical attention. She was in receipt of a war pension .and also obtained an invalid pension, but her financial position was nevertheless much worse than that of many people who had only one pension. After a good deal of correspondence and negotiation, the lady's war pension was increased by 3s. a week; but this advantage was immediately negatived because the Pensions Department, acting under the regulation which sets out that Â£78 a year was adequate for the maintenance of'One person, reduced her invalid pensi on by a similar amount. Eveni f Â£78 were sufficient to maintain persons in ordinary circumstances, which .1 do not concede, it is quite insufficient for people in serious ill health. became heavily indebted in various directions. The present attitude of .the department to husbands and wives who live apart from each other is also quite unfair to many 'people. It has been decided by the Commissioner that unless a husband and wife are living apart lunder the terms of an (actual legal .separation, the income of both must be taken into accotmt for 'the purpose of .assessing the pension of each. A case was brought under my notice of ia 'husband and wife who, by muitual agreement, had ''been -separated from leach other since 1905. The wife liwes in New South Wales and the 'husbamd in Western Australia. Eor some years the -husband contributed infrequently to the wife's maintenance, the average amount, it w.as agreed, being not more more than 7s. 6d. a week. Although that husband and wife had been separated for '30 years, the department declined to consider them 'separated on the ground that the husband had, at odd times, contributed to his wife's maintenance. Sir. Ward. intimated 'that the couple could not be considered separated unless legal proceedings were taken and a separation order -was obtained through the -court. That is an 'entirely unreasonable attitude. The regulations should be amended to provide that if husband and wife have been living japart for, say, 'three years or -more, they should be regarded, for pension purposes, as separated. If a regulation of this -description were 'made, fairly than =at present. -Grave complaints have been made to me on many .occasions about .the method .adopted for .the medical 'examination of claimants for pensions, and any investigations into a number of these complaints have .shown that they are amply justified. I understand that the practice of the department is to pay medical practitioners so much for each examination made. Many doctors with large private practices, being anxious to devote as much of ithe'ir time as possible to patients who pay more for iheir attention than is received for the examination of claimants for pensions, give very scant attention to the unfortunate invalid .people who come before them This lady, for .example, for examination 'for pension purpose3. One medical practitioner, whose name I shall -mention, has proved himself, in my opinion, .to -be absolutely unfitted to do work of 'this 'kind. .'In .support of my statement. I shall also mention the name of an applicant for a pension who appeared before him. Mr .P. Moyson, .of 21 Wilson Street, East Sydney, made an application for an invalid pension and was instructed to submit himself ""for examination to Dr. Ludowici. The name of this practitioner has been mentioned previously in debates in this .chamber, .and complaints have been made about the unsatisfactory manner in wnich he 'has .treated many pension .claimants who have appeared before him. The doctor examined Mr Moyson, diagnosed his complaint a3 neuritis, and reported that he was not entitled to an invalid pension. Shortly after the examination Mr Moyson became dangerously ill and went to the Sydney Hospital for examination. He was placed 'under X-ray at the hospital and it was discovered that he was sufferIt ing not .from neuritis, but from -i\ growth on one Jiang. His .condition was declared to be extremely :dangerous -foawe a itendency to send (claimants He tentered hospital for -attention and subsequently .a marvellous surgical operation -was performed on him.

Four days later, however, he -had -to return to hospital for .treatment. .It is interesting to notice that in this -case the department -followed its ordinary practice, -for it gr,anted tlie pension from the date of the fa-vorable medical examination, as is usually done, and not, as I believe should have been done, -from ,an earlier date on which I 'brought the case iimder notice, following .upon Dr. Ludowici's :cnrsory examination. isworn declaration by Mrs. Moysoni n which she complained about the manner in which her husband was treated by Dr. Ludowici. connection with the medical examination of claimants for pensions should be reviewed. Claimants should be allowed to choose the medical practitioner whom they desire to examine them. The practice of paying doctors according to the number of examinations they make is not satisfactory. A doctor probably gets .a reputation in the department for the number of rejections that he makes, and -departmental officers, acting under tthe Government's instructions, -would to such ;a .doctor, with the object iof 'avoiding 'increases -of pensions 'expenditure. It would :be far moiie -satisfactory to allow claimants to -choose their iown medical practitioner, if the (department feels that it could not ^accept the certificate of .a parties]ar doctor outside the government service, it 'should have a panel of government small electric .torch-tli e doctors, from which the claimant could select one to examine him. This system nvould give much more satisfactory results It would be unfair to give the largest ^number of examinations to the doctors who gain .a .reputation .for rejecting A t the hospital, an X-ray examination -claims. A doctor who examined -claimants fairly would soon build up ;a itako every care to see that deserving .claimants for invalid pensions shall not be denied a pension simply on account of a hurried and .unsympathetic examination. I ask the Treasurer to make a recommenFinally dation to the Government that it should give consideration to the proposal that at the full rate. He a panel of doctors should be established to carry out the examination work, and that applicants for the invalid pension should have the right to .nominate the doctors whom they desire .to make the examinations. I also ask that some inquiries be made .concerning the case of Mr P. Mqyson, of 21 Wilson-street, East Sjdney, and that consideration be given to paying a pension to him from the day on which he made application for it.

The report '.of that committee enjphasiaed that the'se pacts uio.t -only hampered agriculture in Great Britain, but also endangered empire relationships. Further, the report declared that these agreements should mot be .renewed on their expiration. "" In ;the past,"" said the committee, "" the pursuit of foreign trade has almost been :am obsession, and some people have regarded it as having ;i peculiar merit of its own. ""We must realize tliat there is no merit in obtain-operating in Australia, because the bulk ing from a foreigner something which can be obtained from a Briton at home or overseas."" My extract from the report of -tlhe committee has 'been taken from the -investment has an important influence Sydney Morning Herald of the 24th : March last. .The .agreement between Argentina and Great Britain provides for a 10 per cent, reduction of the quotas of chilled beef, and in respect of more than 10 per cent, for a corresponding reduction to be imposed by Great Britain on meat from other countries besides The Prime Argentina. The agreement also .stipulates .that .110 levies arc to be imposed .during the -currency of it . There is no -and redoubt that financial interests .are responsible for the action of the British Government in regard to meat. In this connection I cite the comment of the Premier of South Australia upon his return to -Australia from Great Britain. Expressing his views as to what the position amounted to, that gentleman said he thought that Australia should get a larger share of Great Britain's markets, -and .added that Argentina carried too through the investors in that country. In this regard I would say that the investments of British interests in Argentina are very considerable; they have been estimated at between Â£450,000,000 and Â£500,000,000. One can, therefore;, investors .to protect their investments. May I point out that, even if it be true aggregate between Â£450,00*0,000 and Â£500,000,000, Britain has invested Â£560,000,000 in Australian government securities. Thus, on balance, British investments in Australia are larger than -Britain's investments in the Argentine, -viewed purely from the financial aspect. The distinction, however, is that British investors in Argentina camnot look .to the taxable capacity .of the country as -a backing for their investments. They must look for a return on their money to the profits of the trading companies of Argentina. Thus, if :the companies ;do not .show -lai;ge profits, the investors (cannot Deceive large returns on their -capital. Therefore, Britain has an in terest in making .investments in .Argentina profitable, while it is .completely indifferent to the fate of British companies of British capital is invested, not in private ventures, 'but in government securities. For that reason, the nature of the in determining British policy in regard to the meat industry of Argentina and Australia. has been invested in loans to the Argentine Government. ber should know that there are three outstanding things as between Australia, Argentina, and Great Britain. One is that Australia is Britain's third, and sometimes fourth, best customer in the world. The second is that Australia has never defaulted on its interest payments; while the third is that Australia has granted preference on the Australian market to manufacturers in the United Kingdom for the last 25 years. Certain distinctions exist. One is that Argentina has never given preference to Great Britain; another is that it has defaulted in its interest payments to British investors; and another ss that British investmen'ts are predominantly in capitalistic enterprises unbacked by the Argentine Government. The fact that large sums of British 'capital have been invested in Australian securities has proved one of the most important facts in determining what shall be the internal policy of Australia, because wÂ« have set ourselves to make such sacrifices as may be required from time to time in order that we may not default on our overseas commitments. Thus, in order to avoid doing what Argentina has done, this Parliament has squeezed to penury large sections of the peopio of Australia. It has imposed sacrifices upon them in order that we might not default overseas as Argen tina has done. In spite of this distincexported to the United Kingdom goods tion between the conduct of the two countries, we have the remarkable spectacle that the Ottawa agreement-whic h never really did justice to the Australian meat industry-ha s been rendered almost sterile by subsequent agreements entered into by Great Britain. Argentina has defaulted in its interest payments on over Â£200,000,000 of debt. The Minister for Commerce, in his second-reading speech, stated with much Britain and Australia favoured Britain satisfaction that satisfactory arrangeby Â£46,000,000, whereas for the same ments had been made regarding meat experiod the trade balance between ports for the years 1935 and 1936. _ The Argentina and Great Britain favoured Minister knows, as the British Ministers Argentina by Â£500,000,000. These figures knew when the negotiations were taking place, that, owing to drought, even if we had. free entry into the British market, our exports must necessarily be limited. The Minister also referred to percentage increases of our exports of meat, but he made no comparison between Britain's imports from Australia and those from Argentina. To speak of a 75 per oent. increase of our exports of beef over 1932 is absurd, when we realize .that, for the year 1934-35, our exports of beef were 79,000 tons, as compared with exports from Argentina of 373,000 tons. The general trade position is summarized in the following table:1032. 1933. 1934. Â£ Â£ Â£ Argentine imports from United Kingdom 10,802,000 13,237,000 14,910,000 Argentine exports to United Kingdom. . 50,835,000 41,087,000 47,045,000 Thus, during three years, Argentina purchased goods from Great Britain valued at approximately Â£39,000,000, as against Â£67,000,000 worth purcliased by Australia. I remind honourable members that this occurred during a period when our normal imports were greatly restricted, both by our reduced purchasing power, and by action deliberately taken to enable us to meet our overseas commitments. A similar situation exists to-day, and it is becoming increasingly urgent that similar action will have to be taken.

There is the United Kingdom and Argentina, and no doubt that this is a violation of both the United Kingdom and Australia. He the spirit and the letter of the Ottawa showed that during a period of fourteen agreement. years Australia bought from Britain goods valued at Â£667,000,000, whilst Argentina bought goods from Great imports of meat into Great Britain Britain valued at Â£351,SOO,000. During clearly shows the scope for increased the same period the United Kingdominion trade without in any way interdom imported from Argentina goods fering with the home industry. The folvalued at Â£930,200,000, and imported lowing table sets forth the position for from Australia goods valued at 1934:Â£635,350,000. Thus, the trade balance for that period was against Australia to the extent of Â£31,700,000, and in favour of the Argentine to the extent of Â£578,400,000. These figures have been taken from an article appearing in the Melbourne Age of the 21st July of this year. Taking still another period of ten years from 1922 to 1932, we find that ForeignAustralia's exports to Great Britain amounted to Â£472,000,000, whilst its imports from that country were valued at British Â£537,000,000. Thus while Australia has provided a market for Great Britain of far greater value than that which GreatForeignBritain has provided for Australia, Great Britain has continued to purchase British Total foreign from Argentina goods valued at greatly more than those it has sold to that country. This shows clearly that Great Britain has treated Argentina, economically, much more favourably than it Foreignhas treated Australia. The figures I have ouoted show a balance in favour of Great Britain of Â£65,000,000 in the trade beBritish Countriestween that country and Australia, whereas, for the same period, Great Britain bought from Argentina goods worth Â£434.000,000 more than it sold to it. I have quoted figures covering various periods because I recognize that the position might not be accurately reflected in figures relating to the period of the depression, or to any other selected period. It is evident that Australia has been a far better customer to Great Britain that Argentina has been, yet Britain continues to purchase from three to five times as much from Argentina as it sells to that country; is so valuable that it must be protected.

It is significant that, during the last two or threeweeks, those newspapers which have a keen and almost prescient anticipatory power in respect of. the policy of this Government, are suggesting that migration isdue to he resumed, and I understand that the British Government is most anxious for Australia to take some of the surplus population of Great Britain in order to relieve that country of the burden of unemployment, although it is not so keen on taking the goods which its own people in Australiaproduce. In this connection, the remarks of the Attorney-General in his address "" Australia's Place in the Empire"" are rather interesting. Referring tomigration and production, the honourable gentleman saidJif the dominions are to receive immigrants, they must be in a position to receive them. They must beencouraged to develop their resources in order that they may receive them, and it is in that sense -that Great Britain's attitude -towards Australia is directly associated with Australia's attitude towards the problem of receiving immigrants from Great Britain. It is not a matter of saying ""We won't play in your backyard unless you can play in ours."" In a way it is a sheer matter of capacity, of our capacity to receive this stream,, whicli. we know is tlie condition of. our with the exceptionof Switzerland, Ausfuture life and our future growth. We ought to be in a position not merely to stand still but to develop our resources and to grow, and wo have reached a position to-day when one of the conditions of our growth depends upon what Great Britain is going to do about it. In an article on-, the British Empire, written, by Sir JohnM . Higgins, KCMG., with a foreword by theRight Honorahle Lord attention is drawn to the necessity of increasing dominion trade. Sir John Higgins makes the following commentAsfoodstuffs are of primary importance, and an ample, regular, and continuous supply is paramount, the first duty of the Government is to create the means and facilities for the people to obtain them, first by local production, and secondly by makinggood any deficit from British Empire resources. I say that there is room in Australia for more people; I do not believe that Australia can be effectively held by its present population; but, at the same time, I do not believe that mass migration or even assisted migration can be successful. I do not -believe that there can be any effective addition to the population of Australia unless industries can be found in which these persons can be employed usefully. The mere transfer of a man. from the unemployed register in Great Britainto the unemployed register in. Australiais good forneither' the man, nor Britain-, nor Australia. Because of the willingness of Australia to Buy extensively from Great Britain, obviously Great Britain must realize the obligation it is under to purchase extensively from Australia. I say at this point that,, after 25 years, of substantial preferences which this Parliament has givenin the Australianmarket to British manufacturers,, the time has arrived when there should be continued negotiations in respect of the marketing of meat and other, primary products in the United Kingdom, and when this Parliament should send a definite intimation, to Great Britain that Australiacan no longer extend preferences to Britain unless those preferences are definitely reciprocated by preferences being given by Great Britain on the exportable products which Australians must sell if they areto meet their obligations to Great Britain. There is a belief that: we candevelop markets on the continent of Europe. But ini respect of every one of those countries, tralia has already a favorable balance of trade. The Minister directing negotiation, for Trade Treaties has pointed out that ini all countries he visited, with the exception of Switzerland, he was met with ademand to know what goods Australiaintended taking front t3iem< if they were to take more Inverforth, P.O., from us.. Tke extraordinary situation exists that, while we continueto give preferences toGreat Britain, that country continues to extend greater consideration to the meat producers of Argentina than to those of Australia-.. This bill is not the outcome of the success of the Australian delegation overseas in securing better markets for the Australian meat industry in the United Kingdom; rather is it an acknowledgment of the small degree of success which attended the negotiations. The very regulations which are implicit in this bill owe their existence to the definite restrictions of exports which the bill contemplates, and which the machinery provides is to be set up to control. If there is not this bill is unnecessary. It merely sets up a meddlesome bureaucracy. If restriction is necessary, organized control over exports is inevitable. This situation arises solely because the delegaan imposing array of statistics intended tion overseas met with nothing like the success that its press representatives have claimed for it. I shall defer my consideration of certain of the clauses of the bill to the committee stage. I merely point out that if a trade union sought to regulate labour by the exercise of the tremendous power that this bill gives to the board, there would be so frantic an outcry from the ranks of conservatism in iVustralia, that one doubts if its echoes would ever die away. This bill definitely cuts the Gordian knot which bound the old Conservative party to the doctrine of no interference with trade. It buries the past with its policy of laissez-faire. No longer can honourable members opposite stand up and defend non-interference with private enterprise; no longer can they say that orderly marketing is something that should not be contemplated; and no longer can they deny that time has made necessary the adoption of the principles of collective action and association, and an increase of State interference with the trade and commerce of the nation. We shall not oppose this bill because, unlike honourable members opposite, we know that some form of regulation is necessary. Private interprise can no longer be left to go its own way without interference. The time has come when it must be subordinated to the major interests of the nation. This bill-althoug h I have no doubt that its sponsors will deny it-is undoubtedly an acknowledgment that we now live in au entirely changed world. We shall not dispute tlie principles that underly the bill, but we shall seek to make some of its clauses more representative than they nre. I should have been lacking in my duty to my party had I failed to indicate the reasons why this bill is necessary, and also its implications in respect of the orientation of the political parties of this exports by 35 per cent. If the Leader Parliament. We have just listened to an eloquent orawhat he would call a preference. No tion of mean deductions based on picked preference that we give in respect of facts not false in themselves, but, in their British manufactured goods equals the total, amounting to half truths. The to be restriction of export, Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) devoted the greater part of his speech to an attack on Great Britain for its treatment of the Australian meat industry. The honourable member introduced to show that the Commonwealth of Australia is a more valuable customer and a more valuable field fpr investment than Argentina, I will add, though, the honourable member, having in mind, no doubt, his attitude in regard to sanctions, did not say this: Australia is also a more valuable supporter and ally of Great Britain in these difficult days than Argentina or any other foreign country which has been sending meat to Great Britain. I feel sure that every honourable member will agree with these views, which were, I remind the House, the views put forward by every member of the Australian delegation to London in the course of its negotiations with the British Government. After the Leader of the Opposition had set out his array of figures, he declared, in effect, that Great Britain had given Argentina a preference over Australia, and that if this were not so the introduction of this bill to give the meat industry of Australia power to arrange its affairs to meet altered marketing conditions would not have been necessary. That despicably mean imputation is not in accordance with the facts. Great Britain has, in effect, given the meat producers of its dominions very substantial preferences. Exports of mutton and Iamb have not been curtailed from any dominion. The utmost concession that we have been asked to make is that there might be some postponement of exports so as to co-ordinate tlie arrivals from the different sources of supply in such a way as not to disorganize or disturb unnecessarily the markets of England. Up to the present we have not been asked to submit to any reduction of exports. ' We have been asked merely to submit to what may be called planned expansion. Argentina, on the other hand, has had definitely to curtail its of the Opposition does not call this an enormous preference to the dominions at the' expense of Argentina, I do not know",37,Earle Page
89,Mr Hawker (Wakefield) [8.47],"preference that we are now receiving in respect of mutton and lamb. While exports from Argentina are being curtailed, provision is being made for an expansion of exports from the British dominions. This bill has been really introduced in order that the producers and those most intimately connected with the meat industry shall be enabled to decide among themselves how the industry shall be co-ordinated. In his remarks regarding beef, the Leader of the Opposition said that although Australia and the other British dominions had been guaranteed, under the terms of the Ottawa agreement, an expanding share of the British market, subsequent agreements between Great Britain and other foreign countries had rendered those provisions of the Ottawa agreement sterile. The actual facts are that siuce the ratification of the Ottawa agreement a further curtailment has been imposed on exports of beef from Argentina under the Anglo-Argentine agreement. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition most definitely, however, when he says that the Anglo-Argentine agreement, which guaranteed the admission of certain quotas of chilled beef from tive of producers in the Northern Argentina into Great Britain provided also that only limited shipments of chilled beef, on an experimental basis, should be permitted from Australia. That provision Avas a breach of the provision of the Ottawa agreement, whicli accorded the British dominions an expanding share of the British market. It was one of the important points which the Prime Minister and the other members of the delegation took up with the representatives of the British Government in London. I am glad to say that they were able to obtain from the British Government an acknowledgment that Australia was entitled to more ' than experimental shipments of chilled beef to the British market. Following upon this, the Australian quota of chilled beef was increased to such an extent that this year we are entitled to send more chilled beef to Great Britain than we shall have available. Our shortage of supplies can be put down partially to the drought conditions whicli have existed in Queensland. Nevertheless, the fact remains that provision has been made for a substantial increase of shipments of chilled beef from Australia. This advantage was obtained definitely as the result of tlie representations made by the Australian delegation in London, and so the real situation differs considerably from the view of it presented by the Leader of the Opposition. I support this bill. I suppose no honourable member of the House has been more reluctant than I have been to consent to the imposition of shackles on private industry; but I freely ""acknowledge, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, that we are living to-day in a different world, particularly in connection with international trading. A substantial amount of planning and co-ordination is, therefore, necessary to enable us to get the best results from the markets open to us. The time has come when the meat exporting nations of the world, in particular, plan ahead. I welcome this bill, because it places the planning in the hands of the industry itself. The majority of the members of the meat board which is to be set up will be direct representatives of the meat producers. The board will include a representative of the pig producers, a representaTerritory, a representative of Southern Riverina, and a representative of the producers from each State of the Commonwealth. Nine representatives out of the seventeen will be appointed by the producers. The remaining members of the board will represent the publicly-owned meat-exporting utilities of the various States, the private meat exporters, and the Government. ber ought now to support a compulsory wheat pool. pool would go far beyond the degree of regulation that is necessary or desirable in the wheat industry. I am willing to support regulation in order to secure to tlie wheat-growers of Australia a home-consumption price for their wheat in accordance with Australian standards. In order that we may obtain the treatment that we have the right to expect in the British market, it appears to me to be desirable to set up a board, such as is provided for in the bill. As I have",41,Total Values Imports To United Kingdom

I look forward to the time when, through its -London -representative, the board will greatly strengthen a sentiment in England 'towards .Australia -whicli will igive this country, not an'expanding share , but market for .meat -exporters which Great Britain .presents. In addition to tihat main purpose of the board it will :be able to do a number of'Other'useful things.

The Leader of -the Opposition has spoken as though the ""establishment .of the proposed board will -be -an innovation.

Yet he is given no voice. hope that the Minister'will agree to the Australian Meat Industry Employees Onion and the Australian Workers Union being represented on the board. I am pleased with the bill. It embodies the right principle, and will meet with no opposition from the party of which I am a member. not proposed to discuss this measure, because I warmly support it ; but the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) in his opening and concluding remarks, and the honourable member who has just resumed his seat ( Mr Garden), appeared to suggest that it signifies a remarkable change from the traditional policy of the United Australia party. It is to that particular criticism that I wish to direct my remarks because, if left unanswered, it may convoy a totally wrong impression as to what has been the traditional policv of this party during the last 30 or 40 vears. I agree with the principle that underlies the bill. To suggest that the party of which T am a member has advocated a policy of "" rugged individualism "" is to emulate Rip Van Winkle. That policy is about as up to date as is the policy of the Labour party in regard to socialism, and is as rigorously adhered to by this party as is that policy by honourable members opposite. When the Leader of the Opposition refers to bureaucracies as "" meddlesome,"" and at the same time advocates State ownership and control of the means of production, distribution and exchange, thus making one giant bureaucracy of the State, he is more inconsistent than he can. justly accuse this party of being. In the legislation which has emanated from it during the last 30 years, it has adopted a realistic policy, not the idealistic but non-realistic policy of the Labour party. of It has been suggested that this particular bill involves the creation of a meddlehe some bureaucracy. The traditional policy of this party has been to recognize that trolled, and even owned, by the State. Examples of that are the railways, water supply, post and telegraphs, and other The social monopolies of a similar nature, which in Australia have always been owned and controlled by the State. I There are other industries in which the principle of State control has been recognized, ibut ownership has been divorced from control. It is the principle of control divorced from ownership which is embodied in this bill. That is totally different from the principle advocated by the Labour party in its socialistic programme, namely, State ownership and control of the means of production, distribution and exchange. Just as we have had other examples of government ownership divorced from control, such as the Commonwealth Bank, so we have also had fields of endeavour in which the Government has recognized that the interests of the community can best be served by leaving open the widest field for private enterprise and individualism. Therefore, in adopting the principle of marketing control, which has been supported by all primary industries that have had it applied to them, the hehaviour of the Government is in no way inconsistent, but, on the contrary, is in harmony with the policy it has always applied, of examining legislation, not from the view-point of whether it involves",45,Total Values Imports To United Kingdom

106,Mr Holt (Eawkner) [9.17j,"I hadinterference with private enterprise, and either supporting or-rejecting it according to whether it is socialistic or anti-socialistic, but in the light of whether it will or will not benefit the community' as a whole. This bill, which provides for the control of the meat industry, is supported by that industry, as all other marketing control schemes have been supported by the industries affected. It provides a further illustration of the traditionalpolicy of the party comprising the Government, under which all measures are examined from theview-point of their beneficial effect upon the community as a whole. Therefore, any criticism based merely upon considerations of whether the 1 measure is socialistic or involvesinterference with private enterprisemust, I suggest, fall to the-ground'. -The opposition that has been launched against this measure has mainly hinged upon the fact that Great Britain has felt disposed to give to Argentina greater consideration in. regard to imports of meat than it has seen fit to give to one of its dominions. Thefiguresthat have -been quoted establish that beyond any shadow of doubt. The most remarkable feature has reference to British investments in Argentina compared with Australia. There is. also the further consideration that Argentina, has failed to meet its interest payments on an amount of not less than ^OO/.OOOjOOO. To the casual observer, that is a. remarkable situation whicli Gau hardly be envisaged.. But it is established as a fact, and cannot be controverted. It -appears clear to me that sentiment played no part in the negotiations.. Whatever arguments may be advanced about the ties that bind together the different parts of the British. Empire, and about kinship,, fall to the ground when circumstances arise in which finance is the main consideration. Upon hisreturn to Australia, the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) attended a 'banquet i,n S.ydmey. I quote the following report of a portionof his address on that occasion:The-Argentine meat agreement was described be entirely free, in the main essentials, to to-day by the Prime Minister at a welcome home luncheon, at the Hotel Australia, as "" an honourable member did not follow closely arrangement totally inconsistent with the principles subscribed to by the British Government at Ottawa."" I gather from that statement that, when the British Government engaged in dis 1 cussions and madedecisionswith the various dominions', it had already entered into anagreement withArgentina that was quite-contrary to those decisions. TheMinister for' Commerce (Dr. Earle Page), speaking at Newcastle on the 20th July last, saidGreat Britain had madea prior arrangement for supplies of meat from tlie Argentine, without taking into consideration the points of view of Australia, which was now compelled to accept a short-term arrangement. I contend that this aspect of the matter cannot be brushed, aside by the Australian people-. If Australia ia to be called upon to maintain certain payments, about which many complaints have been made during the last four or five years, it is reasonable to expect that some reciprocal treatment will be extended to us by Great Britain. Apparently,, however, that is not forthcoming. It appears to me that the country which is prepared to put. up the stiffest resistance and use the strongest measures to enforceits own conditions, obtains the best results,, while, the country which isprepared to go cap in hand and beg forconcessions receivesonly the crumbs thatfall from the table. I wish to. refer briefly to that portion of the speech of the. Minister for Commerce' whichdeals with the setting upof aboard in connection with this, industry. This Government and the Government with which the Minister forCommerce was previously associated will, long be remembered for their boards, commissions and committees of inquiry. In 1928 and 1929', much of the criticism that was levelled' against the Government, of which the right honourable gentleman was a member, was based on that practice and, I believe,, largely assisted to bring about itsdownfall. The number of boards appointed by the present Government may figure largely in the campaigns that are to be waged in the future. The honourable member for pleasure at the establishment of this particular board, on the ground that it would conduct its operations.

On that point we have no definite Tie provision upon which the whole success, of the bill depends is contained in clause 17,. which states that no meat shall be exported from Australia except -under licence. The licence will be issued by the. Minister, or a prescribed person acting in his behalf; but the board will' have power to recommend to the Minister the terms and conditions upon which licences t'o-export meat should be granted. Although the board may be in a position to make inquiries as to the conditions under which licences should beissued, the real power will rest entirely with the Minister. Therefore, the. board will not be placed in the position claimed by the honourable member for ""Wakefield ( Mr Hawker).,, who said, that, in the main,, it would control the industry. 1 Dr.. EABLE PAGE.:-It will be in a simiseason's outputwas disposed, of. lar position to that of the control boards 1 appointed in connection with the dried fruits and dairying industries. maintained that the-. Parliament should be the final authority in these; matters, and I entirely approve of the: Minister havingtheright torefuse togrant a licence, or to disapproveof any conditions recommended by the board.. The honorahle member, for ""Wakefield, who has often expressed resentmentat any governmental action savouring of interference with private enterprise, found some crumbs of comfort, because he thought that, underthis measure, there will be very slight surrender of principles which he holds dear. pleased to know; however, that in the 1 practical application' of this bill,, the Minister will havepower t-o> override the decisions of the board. The Minister said that thecontrol by the boardwill, not extend beyond the powers necessary to regulate shipments within the limits of any export programme which may be fixed from time to time, whilst the control of other products goes beyond this point, and includes power not only to regulate shipments, but also to determine' through whom the products are to be sold. It is pointed 1 out: that, in. the case of dried fruits, canned fruits amd wine, there is power to require that those products shall not: be sold overseas-' for less than the authorized information, and I think that the matter might be elaborated. It seems that the board will have no voice in regard to the export price;, and will have to take the best figure, that can be. obtained. In regard to. dried fruits, however, the position is different, and there is room for doubt whether the Government considers that, satisfactory results will follow from this measure. It appears that the operations off the board will, be restricted, to. some extent by those of other authorities overseas. The Minister remarked that the. main objective of the Australian board would, be so to arrange clearances that market conditions overseas would be taken full advantage of, consistent with tlie need for, ensuring that the full He added that producers would not be compelled to export any part of their output. If producers are left free .to do. as they likeit. is difficult to see how the expected' regulation ca-n be' secured. Certain producers in Australia: may be able to dis=pose of. their meat locally; and it may suit them to do that rather than export it:. It is= narttBral' for-producers to secure the highest possibleprice whether they sell their meat in Australia or overseas. No provision is made in the. bill' for producers to accept an average of the home market and export prices. If certain, producers are not to be forced to export, naturally those who. exercise, the greatest influence, and can sell -through the local I am establishments which they control; will ham-, ah. advantage over the small growers who will have to depend on the export trade and take whatever price, is offering. It_seems_that_the weakest will have to go to the wall. The Minister stated that the producers themselves will decide whether they will sell, in Australia or on overseasmarkets, and that if they elect to. sell, in Australia they will not besubject to control by the board in any way. Whilst complaints have been made that some of the statements, made by speakers on the Opposition side' contain only half truths, it seems to me that that criticism may well be levelled against thespeech of the Minister, who gave little detailed",47,Earle Page Ther E Are To Be Some Forms Of Industry Are Best Con
109,Mr Beasley,"""We have alwaysinformation regarding the operations of the board. As the Government at least proposes to meddle with the industry, all possible information should be made available to the interested parties. In order to finance the operations of the board, a levy is to be imposed on meat this bill now. I have been preparing exporters, and we are told that Â£25,000 will probably be raised in this way. It is said that this amount is more than will be required to meet the ordinary expenses of the board, and in order to show that the money is to be raised for a commendable purpose, we are told that the overseas trade will be improved by means of increased advertising of Australian meat in the overseas markets. There is already in London a large organization which should be quite capable of handling work of this description. Trade Commissioners and Agents-General arc maintained by the various State governments, and the Commonwealth Government .has its High Commissioner. I have always understood that the duty of these officials is to encourage the sale of Australian products in Britain. Apparently the Government considers that this work has not been carried out properly in the past. If "" the present officials are not satisfactorily discharging the duties for which they were appointed, it is time the people were informed of the fact. If the biggest growers are unable to dispose of the larger portion of their meat on the Australian market, the smaller men will have to export their produce, and will be called upon to provide the funds, to be raised by means of the levy. I endorse the remarks of the honourable member for 'Cook( Mr Garden) that all interests connected with the industry, including the employees, should have a voice in the distribution of the products. The claims of the employees to representation have been recognized in the appointment of other boards, and we hope that the honourable member's suggestion will meet with the approval of the Minister. [9.44] I support the bill with certain reservations. It has been sprung upon ns suddenly, but we should have had a full opportunity to prepare ourselves for its discussion. notice-paper for over a week. ing the Estimates and due notice might have been given of the Government's intention to continue the discussion of a speech on the Sugar Agreement Bill, and in dealing with the present measure I shall have to rely on hurriedly-made notes. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) and the honourable member for Cook( Mr Garden) went out of their way to condemn the Government for interfering with private enterprise, as they termed it, but it seems to me that there is some confusion of ideas in regard to this matter. Surely the private producer personifies private enterprise if any one does, and the purpose of this bill is to ensure that primary producers, or at any rate the meat producing section of them, shall obtain a fair return for their labour. In this respect the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) is doing the right thing in trying to ensure that the private producer shall control his own product. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition when he says that something should be done to develop our cattle areas, and I would include, not only the rich tablelands of western Queensland and the Northern Territory, but also the cattle-raising country in the distant Kiinberleys. It should be the design of the Government to make the meat-raising industry in these outer areas a paying proposition. The economic occupancy of Northern Australia is the immediate job ahead of this Parliament. In order to understand this matter it is necessary to trace the ramifications of the industry from the markets at Smithfield right back to the great cattle areas of the interior where the stock is raised. I commend the Prime Minister, and the members of his delegation, for their endeavours overseas in behalf of the meat industry, but I look forward to the time when these contacts will be renewed, not by further visits of Australians to the United Kingdom, but by visits of Englishmen interested in the trade to this country. I should like to see, within the next three years, British representatives",48,Earle Page Ther E Are To Be Some Forms Of Industry Are Best Con

112,Mr Blain,"We have been discussof the industry in Australia studying the conditions under which the meat is produced, and getting into actual touch with the producers here. It seems to me that there is something wrong with the distribution of our meat in Australia and overseas. The Department of Commerce should create an organization in Great Britain under the control of a thoroughly qualified man receiving a salary of not less than Â£2,000 a year, and not a Â£500-a-ycar man. This association should direct the distribution and sale of our meat in the same way that the distribution of our butter is controlled now. We know that, on the British market, we have to compete with Argentine meat, but we are not taking full advantage even of the Australian market. A system should be introduced under which meat killed, in the abattoirs here would be graded on the hooks into three sections, and the buyers would have to pay a minimum price for it according to the grade. possible for the buyers in collaboration to depress prices against the producers from distant areas such as Central Australia and the far north. We should also give greater considerahas improved his pastures sufficiently to tion to the quality of our meat. We have been told by our representatives overseas that no more than 6 per cent, of our meat is equal to chilled Argentine meat. I doubt whether that is so, but, for the time being, we must accept the statement, and turn our attention to finding a market for our second grade meat. Small canning works at the mouths of northern rivers would go a long way towards solving this problem, and the profits from these operations would enable growers to produce the best meat. When prices go down, enthusiasm goes out. We should, chill it as a temporary measure, and mark it as second grade, for which I am convinced there would be a ready market overseas. I have been in London, and in the Tilbury Docks neighbourhood have seen children begging for scraps of meat. I know that there is a demand, not only for our second-class chilled meat, but also for the first-class frozen meat. There should also be a market for meat -of this kind in Europe and the East. The trouble is that much of the meat exported from this country is tied up to individual buyers, as is the case with that sent from Wyndham. At the present time, if meat is not qualified for the first grade, there seems to be no market for it at all. Small individual buyers are now endeavouring to purchase this desirable and wholesome product, but are being prevented from doing so because supplies are all tied tip. I have seen beautifully marbled meat, only slightly bruised, or perhaps with just the selvidge gone, sold for boiling down. It should be possible to provide for tlie distribution of this meat without injury to our reputation. If this can be done, it will be an added inducement to produce first-class meat, which at present is raised only in favoured spots such as the Murrumbidgee River flats where there are clover pastures. This bill does not do all it might do for the meat industry, and merely provides machinery for the distribution of quotas. I hope that the Minister has something It would not then he more up his sleeve, something which will be implemented by regulation. I do not think it is fair that the sum of Â£25,000 mentioned by the Minister should be .raised by a levy on tops only. This merely penalizes the good producer who produce the best meat suitable for overseas tastes. The levy should he collected on all meat killed for consumption, and the fund so raised should be used, among other things, to instruct the producers, particularly in the outback, how to improve the quality of their product. The growers do not want doles, but they are eager for knowledge. I suggest that the levy should be Is. a head on. big cattle, 3d. a head on calves, and Id. a head on pigs and sheep. On the basis of last year's killings, this should produce a fund of between Â£45,000 and Â£50,000 which the Commonwealth Government could supplement by a grant of a further Â£50,000. Probably the levy could be reduced after the first two or three years, as the number of stock killed increased. Part of the fund could then be used for advertising overseas, importing bulls, and organizing all abattoirs so that on matters relating to first-class meat Australia speaks with one voice. It is not of much use to advertise now, because we are assured that we cannot produce enough first-class meat to satisfy the present demand, or, indeed, to fill the holds of the ships carrying chilled meat. It is impossible to deceive 'the overseas 'buyer 'on these matters, and it is arrant foolishness if TO try to deceive ourselves. At the moment I am concerned with 'turning into profit Australia's nondescript cattle, and those just under chiller standard. -educate people to produce only the best, -and in descending order as the years go by the fund could be considerably reduced. It -is highly necessary that these people -should know exactly what a chiller is. A director of production and rural education is urgently ^required, and could be .provided 'for from this fund. The proposed 'system is much preferable to the present method of making available isolated grants. Meat farming, as carried out in Argentina-the .system of passing cattle on .from the inland breeder .to .the fattener on .the coast-rshoul d be .the 'ideal to be aimed .at. In conclusion, I -desire to refer to the criticism levelled against the Minister for Commerce by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr whole economic system. We cannot in future Beasley). ""The honourable member went -out -of his ""way -to criticize all that the 'Minister for Commerce ""has done in his sincere endeavours to put Australian 'pri niary production on its feet. I shall be -very pleased if , as the result of my efforts-and I have not a vote to enforce my wishes-anything can be done to bring about the economic production-of meat in the Northern Territory and North Australia, the rehabilitation of the mining industry by industrialization, profitable production sugar in the tropics -by white Australians.

114,Mr Nock,"Thos e were his verjas aresult of theOttawa agreement. I remind, the honourable member that, as. a result of the 35 per cent., restriction placed upon. Argentina meat by the Ottawa agreement, fat lambs,, which were previously worth 7s. and 8s. are to-day worth 17s. and ISs. each. The. Ottawa agreement has thus resulted in a rise of over 100 per cent, in the prices of fat lambs. It seems to me that the honourable member, for. WestSydney( Mr lambs have taken place from Australia Beasley) is rather under a misunderstanding as to the. objects of this bill. This is an. export control bill, and not a marketing; bill.. A couple of years ago it was necessary to limit for a period Australian exports of fat lambs. At tliat time no body was in existence to make representations to the Government in regard to this matter, and it was left to the exporters themselves to do so; but they were continually at. loggerheads as to which exporters, should have the major power to export and which should keep, his lambs back. conferenceof representatives of producers from all over Australia,, prer sided over by the then Minister for Commerce( Sir Frederick Stewart) was held in Melbouir-ne,, and resolutions were carried asking, the. Govecnment to set up an export control.board, so that producers themselves might have, some say with regard, to restrictions, that might become necessary in thefuture, and so that there would be uniform standards, with regard to meat exports from Australia. A t thai time Iamb from New Zealand brought top prices in the. London market, and lamb from Victoria brought a higher price than lambr fromany other State, even though many were of equal quality to the. best Victorian. The reason for this was a prejudice against lamb' from any State in which there was a majority of merino sheep, which sold at a iower price on the Londonmarket. Yeti f lamb from the western New South ""Wales was sold and shipped from Victoria, it brought top prices in London. That was a disadvantage to. the producers themselves, and it was recognized that uniform standards should obtain with regard to Australian exports of meat, so that overseas buyers could buy Australian lambby cable, knowing exactly what they would receive, whether the lambs came from Victoria,.New South Wales,. Queensland, or Western Australia. This will be made possible by this bill, the twamajor-clauses of which provide for the regulation of the export, of meat and the fixation of quality,, standard,, and grade. Ome of the difficulties associated with the-export of Australian meat in the past has beenthe absence of continuity of supply. In the past large exports of fat in. October, November, and. December, New Zealand supplying the British market during, other months, of the year. To> hold our cust.omcr.s-it is essential that these should be a continuity of supply, and to achieve that end it is necessary to set up a board as proposed by this bill. A glutted market is always a menace, yet it is not possible for the farmers to keep the lambs, on their farms, because the grass will not keep green, aud on dry grass the lamb loses bloom and value.. The only way to overcome A this is to slaughter the lambs when prime 1 and place them in Australian freezers, shipping them overseas as required to meet the needsof our customers. With the exporters, incontrol, as they were a few years ago*, and with the risk of. big American meat controllers setting up a monopoly -and combine in the Australian market, the danger to the Australian producer is obvious.. This bill will remove the risk. In. that respect alone, it will be of great advantage. good deal on the personnel of the board. are t'o have a majority of the representation on the board, and those controlling the biggest abattoirs in Australia can render valuable advice. The honourable mem1 referred to the risk of smaller producers being compelled to export. With the bill as drafted there will be-no complaint with regard to that. There is no intention to interfere with the ordinary marketing channel's; there will be no transfer of the eq.uity in the product; there is no power to take over or to control frozen stock. It is merely a matter of regulating the export by licence, no matter who owns the stock. Most of the stock will go through the auction markets at Flemington, Newmarket, and Enoggera.",51,Earle Page Ther E Are To Be Some Forms Of Industry Are Best Con

117,Ber For West Sydney ( Mr Beasley),"hasAsI have said, this is not a marketing bill. Although we had from the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) half an hour's discourse on the trade relations existing between Great Britain Australia, and Argentina, and the relative exports of the various countries, there is nothing in the bill concerning Argentina or quantities to be exported. It is simply a matter of regulating exports to the best advantage, and the fixing of grades, so that standards shall be stabilized and maintained. If New South Wales produces 10 per cent, only of first-grade Australian lambs, let them be sold at the top price for that grade; if Victoria produces 65 per cent, of first-grade lamb, let it be sold at the top price. But do not let all lambs from New South Wales be sold as second grade, merely because of prejudice. In Great Britain there is a growing demand for merino lamb. ""Every lamb that brings 16s. or 20s. into Australia is an asset to this country, but it should be sold in its own class and there should be no misunderstanding. The very fact that the producers themselves are fully represented on the board will ensure to exporters, whether large or small, proprietory, co-operative or individual, a fair deal. In South Australia exporters frequently export their lambs direct through the government freezing works. producer sells his fat lambs now and export is not made for three or four months? ference. able to obtain an advance. At present, fat lamb raisers can export direct or sell in the local market to exports buyers. The position will not be altered if this bill is passed. I can see no reason why the South Australian system should not bo adopted in other States. Practically all the big abattoirs are controlled as government instrumentalities or arc under a measure of direct government super' vision, and finance could easily be provided for individual producers. Returns have shown clearly that producers who sell at the abattoirs obtain results which are quite as satisfactory as those obtained by direct exporters. I am afraid certain honourable gentlemen opposite have confused the idea of a marketing bill with that of this export control bill. I am satisfied that this measure provides for practically all that the producers themselves 0 desire and I hope it will be carried. This bill should do much to develop and expand the live-stock industry of Australia. In recent years this industry has passed through very difficult times owing to the low prices offering for stock. The difficulties have been accentuated by reason of the severe droughts experienced in North Queensland for several years, and the subsequent years in which only a low rainfall was recorded. The live-stock industry has undoubtedly been a great aid to closer settlement in Australia. In Queensland, in particular, the cattle industry has been a big factor in the development of extensive areas adjacent to country towns. As the towns have developed, sheep have taken the place of cattle, and the cattle have occupied country farther back. We still have largeareas of land in Australia eminently suitable for cattle-raising; but owing to low prices, lack of suitable organization, and drought conditions the cattle industry has languished. I look forward now to an expansion of the industry, and feel that the application of the principles underlying this measure cannot be other than beneficial to it. The basic objectives of this bill are the orderly marketing of our products and the opening up of .new markets. The meat board which ie to be set up should be able to do a great deal to increase the sale of Australian meat in Great Britain, and also to imSuch a producer will be prove local marketing conditions. Our beef, mutton, lamb, pork and veal should all be marketed in a more efficient manner through the operations of such a board. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) had a good deal to say about the preference that had been granted by Great Britain to Argentina in regard to chilled beef, but in view of the concessions obtained for Australia by our overseas delegation there is very little need for us to spend further time in discussing the Anglo-Argentine agreement. Without doubt, the Australian meat industry benefited considerably through the provisions of the Ottawa agreement, and the",52,Earle Page Ther E Are To Be Some Forms Of Industry Are Best Con

It has been argued by some honourable members opposite that the Government has adopted a new political principle in this bill, but even a casual examination of the facts w ill show that the underlying principles of this measure were adopted by the Nationalist party twelve or fourteen years ago when the Dairy Export ControlB ill was introduced. Statistics could be produced to show that as the result of the operation of the Dairy Export Â£1,000,000 has ibeen saved to the primary producers in insurance, freight, and cold storage charges, and over Â£100,000 has been expended by the board in advertising Australian dairy produce in the United Kingdom. Control Board has operated to the distinct benefit of the dairying industry. The Dried Fruits Export Control Board has also been of great value to those engaged in our dried f r u it s industry. The advantages of the orderly marketing of our primary products overseas have beeu through the operations of these two boards. It has been said that if the proposed meat export control board is sot up the meat industry of Australia w ill be subjected to political control, but that is not so. The meat board, like the Dairy Export Control Board and the Dried Fruits Export Control Board, w ill consist principally of direct representatives of the producers. This bill provides, in fact, not for political control, but the industry itself and should also provide for producer control. An . examination of the provisions of the measure will show clearly that it is intended to enable the meat-export trade to control its owu export business. I support the bill because I firmly believe that an improvement is both possible and desirable in many directions in our ment export industry. A beard possessed of the statutory powers proposed in this bill should be able to do a great deal to improve the live-stock industry of Australia. Having regard to the very successful negotiations recently conducted in the United Kingdom by the PrimeM in ister and his colleagues, it is of prime i m portance to the producers of both Australia and GreatB r it a in that our beef, mutton, lamb, pork, and veal should be marketed in the most orderly manner possible. The case presented to the British Government by our overseas delegation, and the assurances obtained by it, have been entirely satisfactory to the meat industry. It must be clear to all of us that if the technique of large-scale organization is to be introduced to the meat export industry a start must be made, in the first instance, at some point between the producer and the consumer, and that the machinery necessary for the purpose must be all-embracing. Care Control Board more than must be taken to order our procedure so that we shall not smash the market in GreatB r it a in for the British producers, or smash the export trade of Australia for our own producers. Only when all the threads of the industry are gathered TheD a i r y Export into one hand, so to speak, can control be exercised and efficiency and economy be directed, back, on the one hand, to ' production, and forward, on the other hand, to distribution. The organization now proposed provides for the representation of the producers, the co-operative organizations, the pubdemonstrated beyond question licly-owned abattoirs and freezing works which deal in meat for export, the exporters, and the Commonwealth Government. It appears to embrace, therefore, all the interests engaged in the production and preparation of meat for export. Asi t can be assumed that the individual members of the board w ill be men of the highest qualifications in their different spheres of activity, the board should be an influence for good within a valuable advisory organization for the Government in respect of all matters relating to the meat export trade. U n doubtedly, that trade has now reached dimensions which justify the organization which apparently both the Government and the industry desire to see established. It is estimated that the supplies of meat from Australia to Great Britain this year w ill be as follows:Tons. Beef and veal 84,000 Mutton and lamb S2.000 Porl; .. .. 5,718 Total .. 171,718 This quantity will exceed the total for the Ottawa year .by almost 41,000 tons, or about 30 jper cent. It can readily be .understood, however, that a continuation of this rate of progress, or anything approaching it, must hinge upon ever-improving facilities for the 'better and more regular distribution of Australian meat products in the markets of the United Kingdom, and, in addition, upon the development of new markets. The United Kingdom obtains its meat from many countries within and without the Empire. It is interesting to note the source of these supplies. The following figures give the totals for the calendar year, 1934:' Tons. Bed anil veal35mpire countries 153,540 jFor.eign ^countries . . Mutton and lambEmpire countries Foreign countries . Pork, excluding baconEmpire countries . . Foreign countries TotalEmpire countries Foreign countries 535,020 In the main, the sources :of foreign supplies have, in the past, been Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. Seeing that mutton, lamb, .and pork are imported into England from all countries in a frozen condition, the advantage lies with Empire .countries, which furnish about 75 per .cent, of the total imports, the Australian figure being a'bout 22 per cent, of the total. Until recently, however, the geographical position of 'South American countries gave them advantages over the more distant dominions with respect to -beef. Foreign countries, for the year 1934, furnished about 74 per -cent, of Britain's beef and -veal imports, and Australia about 14 per cent, of them. The total imports into -.the United Kingdom for 1934 amounted to 973,870 tons, of which foreign countries furnished 55 per cent, and Australia 17 per cent. These are very striking figures and if , as it is reported, the British will, upon re-election, take steps to develop a more intensive inter-Imperial trade, there is assuredly an opportunity for it to promote a greater Mr Francis. development of the meat-export trade of the British dominions and, in particular, of Australia. There is 'no doubt in my mind that lamb and pork exports-could be increased, and there are undoubted possibilities of an increased beef export trade. Beef production :for export, -which chiefly concerns Queensland, the -Northern Territory, and the north-west of Western Australia, has heen an unprofitable undertaking .for many years, but the Commonwealth Council for ^Scientific and Industrial Research has recently discovered a means to .guide the industry out :of its difficulties. To-day >the industry is finding itself capable of exporting drilled beef .and this mew trade gives promise, for the first 'time for many years, of -acn extensive 'development of the Aus441,145 tralian cattle country, provided, first, that a satisfactory agreement is reached .. .259,110 with the British Government, and -04,840 secondly, that some special assistance is 20,200 given to the industry to lay the founda29,035 tions of better herds and improved pastures, in order that the lag in these 438,850 respects .due to -adverse ^circumstances in days gone by may be overtaken. In a public statement made recently by a leading authority in the Queensland meat export industry it was pointed out that -with the improved chilling equipment now 'being installed in the Queensland meat works, -and the efficient vessels now heing -provided for the transport of chilled 'beef, the -iime was approaching when, if cattle were supplied to Queensland meat works' of similar quality to those supplied to the works of ; Argentina, beef would be landed in England, from Queensland, 'equal in condition to that from Argentina. This, in my opinion, is a development worthy of support and I trust that the proposed board and the Government will give every possible consideration and assistance to the needs of the beef .cattle industry. It may he said fairly, that sthe enlistment of the -aid of science in industry has been successful in promoting Government a new a.nd better prospect for the Australian cattle industry, and I would recommend strongly that every possibility of incr-easing the -supply of improved cattle .should be-examined .closely by the Commonwealth'Government. If necessary, rt should render some constructive aid for a prompt movement towards the betterment of herds and pastures. I am glad -to see that it is intended the board shall appoint a London representative, 'which I firmly believe is very essential. The .New Zealand Meat Producers Board was established in 1922, and through its London office, I .understand, it has .continued without interruption an active policy of keeping New Zealand meat prominently before the consumer and meat trade in Great Britain. In .many other directions, the .board claims to have rendered service to and secured substantial economies for the benefit of New Zealand producers. I trust, in due course, that, in conjunction with efficient London representation, the Australian board will establish a similar record. I strongly support the establishment of an .Australian Meat Export Control Board and I sincerely believe .that the results of its efforts will be gratifying, not only to those whom it is intended to benefit specifically, but also to the country generally. I am confident that the board will have a good recordI trust as good a record as the Dairy Export Control Board has had in its efforts on behalf of the .dairy industry. I feel certain that the measure now before the House w""hen placed in effect will do much to develop the Australian livestock industry and place it on a more satisfactory basis than it occupies-at present. I conversion of members of the Government to the policy of pools and to the policy of giving to those engaged in industry the control of their industry. It is only fifteen years since tlie Queensland Government, when it introduced the maize pool and the butter pool, was criticized from one end of the Commonwealth to the other, allegedly for following a Russian example. then, the Commonwealth Parliament has followed Queensland's lead, and the dairying industry is now controlled on a 'Commonwealth-wide basis on the lines first applied in Queens'la nd. I am also pleased to see that the Commonwealth has put into operation a policy advocated by Labour. I welcome this bill .because of 'the benefit it will confer upon the pastoral -industry, especially the >beef side of the industry. .Since 1919, the industry has not received a payable return. There has been a consequent tendency to a decline of the quality of herds. An .export control board will certainly give ' the industry some form of control, but, unfortunately, it will last only until November, 1936, when the Anglo-Argentine meat agreement expires. Until then, Australia will not 'be ab'Ie to enter into any long term agreement with Great Britain. Reviewing the British agreement with Australia, New Zealand and Argentina, the ""White Paper on meat restrictions and regulation of Australian exports of meat to the United Kingdom market issued by the British Government, statedThat no import duty could be imposed on meat from any part of the British Commonwealth -with which agreements were made 'at Ottawa before August, 193.7,, without their consent. Similarly in the Argentina Agreement, no import duty on meat from that country could be imposed before November, 193G, without the consent of the government of that .country. The Commonwealth is a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations and, until recently, was Britain's second best customer. Since the Ottawa agreement was framed, I think New Zealand has taken the second place in the list of Britain's customei-3. The White Paper continuesAfter .Ottawa, tlie United Kingdom entered into negotiations with Argentina, a country which is not only at present by far the largest .am pleased to witness the source of her chilled beef supplies, but in which she has immense capital investments, and -with which she carries on .a -very valuable trade. In view of the statement in the Whito Paper that Argentina provides a valuable market for -Great Britain, it is fitting that I should place 'before the House the following statistics of British overseas trade for 1933. In that year the United Since Kingdom purchased from Australia products valued at Â£48,'600,000 or 7.19 per cent, of its total purchases; from Argentina, Â£41,700,000, or 6.17 per cent.; from Denmark, Â£35,400,000, or 5.24 per cent. The statistics of the United Kingdom's export trade show that it sold to Australia manufactured goods to the value of Â£21,300,000, compared with",53,Earle Page Ther E Are To Be Some Forms Of Industry Are Best Con
121,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [10.31],"Â£13,100,000 worth sold to the Argentine, and Â£11,S00,000 sold to Denmark. The percentages were: Australia, 5.80, Argen-, tina, 3.56; and Denmark, 3.21. The excess of purchases over sales 'by Britain to each of the three countries cited amounted to: Australia, Â£27,300,000; Argentina, Â£23,600,000. After Ottawa Great Britain went behind the backs of the Australian representatives and entered into an agreement with Argentina. At that time the Commonwealth was only in the initial stages of putting chilled beef on the London market. tainly given a preference in regard to frozen beef, which cannot compete with chilled beef; but for Australia fully to develop its beef trade, it should also have been given some consideration in regard to chilled beef. Since Ottawa the Australian chilled beef industry has developed greatly, but that development would have been greater if we had known where we stood in regard to the British market. agreement liable to expire at the end of 1936 because of a change of policy on the part of Great Britain. The position is, therefore, not too favorable to Australia and Australian beef producers are not encouraged to expand their operations or improve the quality of tlieir herds. years past cattle-breeders have been what they term "" in-breeding "" their herds, and if we are able to improve the quality of our beef we shall need to go further than establish a meat export control board. What the meat-grower needs is financial support over a long term, say, the next five years, which would permit him so to improve his cattle as to enable him to compete with his Argentine rival. A grant of Â£1,500,000 would enable the breeders to produce better quality beef It is worthwhile giving that assistance if by so doing this country will be better able to seek the British meat market. In the Northern Territory it is possible to travel for mile after mile without before the meat industry can be placed in seeing a fence. A person can enter the must Territory, travel across the Barkly lishment of a meat export control board. Tablelands to the Gulf of Carpentaria, In North and Central Queensland and and then to the Leichhardt River in the in the southern district of Queensland, Mr Riordan. northern portion of Queensland and not see a fence once in 100 miles. In such circumstances, high quality beef cannot be bred. In Argentina out of every ten acres one acre is under cultivation and cattle are fattened on pastures a yeair before sale. Australia depends upon nature Â£28,600,000; Denmark to provide pasture grasses, with the result that, instead of being able to maintain steady supplies of chilled beef to the British market, the marketing period is limited to the first seven months of each year when, following the monsoohal or wet season, natural grasses abound in the northern beef-raising districts. With the advent of dry conditions, f attening grasses The Commonwealth was cerare not available and the beef growers are not able to market their cattle. Accordingly, if Australia is to be in a position to guarantee the United Kingdom market continuity of supplies of chilled beef, fattening paddocks must .be provided near the abattoirs so that the cattle may be fattened in the monbhs from August to January, when dry conditions preclude the possibility of adequate fattening of the herds in the north. We had only a short-term Before slaughtering for chilling, cattle must be fattened for at least four or five months. Cattle must, therefore be brought in from the Northern Territory and the Gulf .country a considerable time 'before they are fit to 'be slaughtered for As a matter of fact, for many the .market. At present breeders in the gulf country are offered only Â£2 or Â£2 10s. a head for cattle while the market price is Â£10 or Â£12 a head in the southern markets. Gulf country cattle cannot be brought to the southern markets because the stock routes are closed for a considerable part of the year because there is no permanent water on the stock routes. Sometimes the dealers who are prepared or able to bring cattle to the market, offer the breeders Â£4 10s. and then sell for Â£10 to Â£12 a head. The man who produces the beef has to accept prices which are far below the cost of production, while the people in the south pay high prices for their meat supply. It can be seen, therefore, that a rehabilitated position, something more be done for it than the mere estabassistance must be given to aid in the improvement of herds, the cultivation and planting of grasses, and the irrigation of areas for fattening. All of this will have to be done if Australia is to compete on level terms with Argentina. The Government can give valuable help to keep the chilled meat trade going. On account of the low prices that prevailed in the cattle industry for a lengthy period, it will be necessary to provide, not only fattening areas, but also fresh -blood stock. improved if we are to hold the chilled beef trade in Great Britain. My electorate, which embraces an area of over 200,000 square miles, carries over 4,000,000 cattle. The figures for the different pastoral districts that are contained in it are as follows:Cattle. Sheep. Plga.

The Governments arc aware that, with the exception of about two or three months of the year, stock routes are closed because of lack of water; yet they have not contributed one penny towards the provision of a water supply. Over 30 years ago, when I brought cattle from the gulf country, a water bag had to be carried on the horse's neck, and packhorses accompanied the party packed with water for the use of the men on the road. The position is no different to-day. Yet the Government says that it cannot find work for the unemployed ! ""Why not give employment hy providing permanent water supplies on stock routes? The industry keeping the stock routes open when there If cattle are travelled for a couple of days without water, they quickly lose their condition. The export of meat from Australia has increased remarkably during the last three years. In 1932-33 the exports of pork from the different States to the United Kingdom were as follows:lb.

Only experimental shipments of chilled beef were made in 1932-33, the total exports to the United Kingdom in that year being ' 1,485 quarters from New South Wales, and 210 quarters from Queensland. In 1933-34 New quarters, Victoria 197 quarters; Queens? land 4,324 quarters, and Western Australia 2,414 quarters, a total, of 11,190 quarters. In 1934-35. the exports to the United quarters, an increase of 138,212 quarters compared with 1932-33. During the war Queensland supplied meat to Great Britain at. 4&d. per lb. At that : time the cattle-grower received for hisstockÂ£12: or Â£14 in Queensland, and higher prices in other States. Great Britain should not forget that when it was in trouble Australia supplied it with meat at a reasonable price, while Argentina exploited a more profitable market. make the following quotation from Empire Stocktaking published in 1930:Curing tlie Great War the Commonwealth made special efforts to help cater for Britain's home needs andfor the immense requirements of the fightingforces. Proprietors of meat works increased, their plant,, and cold, storage accommodation in. their endeavours to cope with an urgent demand""; but much of this abnormal capital out-lay in war-time has since proved anything but a profitable investment. Despite the increased slaughtering, and. output which then resulted from it , shipping space at that, timet was most difficult' to secure, and it able, member for the. Northern, Territory was inevitable that much of the frozen beef was. heldr for relatively long perjods in cold storage before shipment.

In some portions of the Commonwealth the pastoral areas are not suitable for head closer settlement, and. must always be used for the raising of stock. Those who talk about the prospects of closer settlement in the Gulf country and. on the Barkly Tablelands, which are practically a waterless, belt, should put their ideas to I a practical, test before recommending, the cutting, up of that country. The Barkly Tablelands will produce good, cattle, and may carry sheep, but sheep will not breed there, and they certainly will not do so in theGulf country. Sheep can be fattened at, Camooweal,. but will, not increase there: If we are to stock u.p the pastoral, areas, and recapture' the British market, the. board will' have, a full time jpb for the. next few years.

Margarine manufactured in Australia -may be classified into two groups-(a ) made from liecf fats and vegetable oils (such as cotton seed and peanut) of Australian origin ; (ii) made from imported vegetable oils (such as coco-nut and palm). This trade affords an outlet .for by-products of the cattle, cotton and peanut industries. 3.

Tbe conditions of sale of butter substitutes are controlled by the State parliaments. In each State there are laws imposing restrictions upon these products, tlie principal of such restrictions being-(i ) Limitation or prohibition of the inclusion of butterfat; ( i i ) prohibition of the use of colouring matter; ( i i i ) marking with word "" M a r garine"" in prominent characters; ( i v) incorhonorable poration of a percentage of Queensland arrowroot, potato starch, or sesame oil, for purposes of identification. The Australian Agricultural Council recommended that legislative action is necessary requiring that margarine, and margarine-like substances, made in whole or in part from imported oils, be marketed in white colour. This recommendation is being considered by the States. 5. The control of production and domestic sale of margarine is a inatter for the States concerned, nnd not for the Commonwealth.
