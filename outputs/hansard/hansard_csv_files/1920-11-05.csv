Whether it is a fact that some returned soldiers with increasing families require a further addition to, say, four-roomed cottages purchased by them, at less than the total sum authorized under the War Service Eomes regulations 1 2. If a returned soldier under clause 9, subclause (c), of the regulations obtained an advance less than his authorized borrowing power, would he subsequently, under sub-clause (e), be eligible for further assistance to meet the cost of such necessary addition required for an increasing family, but not exceeding the total authorized advance to returned soldiers? advises1. and 2. No. The object of the War Service Eomes Act is to provide returned Boldiers and their dependants with the means whereby they may acquire their own homes. If successful applicants could apply at any later period for further assistance there would be no end to the activities of the Commission, and this paint is closely related to the question of finance which, as the honourable member is aware, is very acute. However, the suggestion to make additional help available to those who have already been assisted to acquire a home will be reviewed when the applications already submitted by returned soldiers and others who have not yet been granted assistance have been satisfied. 6 November, 1920.",19,Setup

If so, why was this request refused? 4. Is it a fact that the Public Service Commissioner acknowledged recently, through his representative in the Arbitration Court, that these officers were "" professional engineering men "" ? 5. If so, why have these men been deprived of their status? 6. As these officers have received no war bonus, repatriation benefits, or recognition of any sort for their services at a time of great national danger, will the Government, at this late hour, in recognition of this service, and in view of the treatment now meted out to them, appoint a special tribunal to inquire into their case at once with their official representative? I promised that the information would be obtained, and the Acting Public Service Commissioner has now furnished me with the following information: 1. (a) Upon re-appointment to thc Public Service certain of the officers referred to have been classified in the Clerical Division.. The duties of these officers are not considered to be of a Professional Division character. Positions of an allied character in other sections of the Postmaster ^General's Department arc classified in the Clerical Division, and no good reason now exists for difference in divisional classification.

9,Mr Wise,"Yesterday the honorableclaims to these increments were not overlooked when assessing their salaries as omcers of the I'ublic Service, (c) While, owing to difference in system of classification in the Navy Department and in the Public Service, amounts paid as salary will in nine cases be less, there will be show concern for small nations other no reduction in actual remuneration; on the contrary, there has been a general increase. It must be noted that the Navy scale of salary covered all services rendered by officers on Sundays, on holidays, and for overtime, which, under Public Service practice, are compensated by payment in addition to salary. Furthermore, any reduction in salary has also been met by placing the Radio staff under similar conditions to those of the general body of officers in the grant of allowances to meet present conditions of living. Each unmarried oflicer will reeeive £30, and each married officer £45, in addition to sa'lary, and remuneration for Sunday and holiday work should amount to at least an additional thirty days' pay. Exclusive of Sunday and holiday pay, the officers of the Eadio staff will be paid during the current financial year a sum of £4,250 above what they would have received had they remained under the Department of the Navy, and received increments from 1st July, 1920. 2. It is not known whether any such instruction was given, but a request was received from the secretary of the institute for representation. 3. The request was refused on grounds of public policy. 4.

Five honourable members having risen it), their places, Question proposed. The participation of Australia in the great European war justifies the intervention of this Parliament in other matters of international importance. ""We fought for "" the liberty of small nations and to make the world safe for Democracy""; at least, so we were assured during the continuance of the war. That being so, we are entitled to than Belgium and Poland whose liberty is impaired and in which Democracy is not safe. Our intervention in this conflict, which, by the way, evoked much eulogy from persons who have since proved neither friends to one small nation nor to Democracy, establishes our right to a voice in international matters, and cancels any objection which might otherwise be raised to this motion. The people of Australia-puttin g aside a noisy but negligible faction -havin g taken part in the war, and having thus shown their desire for the liberty of small nations and for the triumph of Democracy, must be taken as cordially favouring removal of' the grievances of Ireland. We may, therefore, assume that they reprobate and reprehend the policy which has resulted in the tragic death of the Lord Mayor of Cork. That event has provoked amazement aud indignation throughout the civilized world. The public conscience is shocked by a policy which leads to such tragedies. Close obfear that a continuance of this policy will lead to strained relations between Australia and Britain. This fear is shared by some of the clearest thinkers and most eminent men, even in England. Among others let me cite Lord Denman, a former Governor General of Australia, I have received an who knows this country intimately. Writing to the London Times on 6th September last, be saidIf not too late, tbe Lord Mayor of Cork should be released immediately. His death in prison will probably defer hope of Irish settlement for many years, This is the part which I emphasize for the benefit of honourable members and those outside wbo may be inclined to object to the motionand will certainly have serious consequences in the self-governing Dominions. I take it that Lord Denman had several reasons for writin g in that strain.

54,Mr Mahon,"The Treasurer has beencharge or for political offences. Only two out of tlie sixty-eight have escaped the attention of our police. The normal residence of an Irish Republican member of Parliament is a British. prison. Let me remove one possible misconception. These Irish members of Parliament are elected by the machinery and methods established by the English Government in Ireland, which are practically identical with, the machinery by which are elected members of Parliament in England. are not in gaol oould enter the House of Commons to-morrow if they choose to do so, but they decline. Isi t not a shocking commentary on Britain's boasted love of freedom that the .elect of the nation find their place, not in Parliament, but in the gaols of the country ? I am confident that Australia will not stand for a policy so unrighteous, and that, if continued, it will lead to serious estrangement between the Dominions and the Imperial Government. I do not wish to quote much from the Australian press, but here is a summary of the position in the Australian Worker of the 15th July, which well expresses the position. We are toldThe situation in Ireland is without precedent in the history of any civilized people. No such barbarities were ever practised by the Germans in Alsace-Lorraine as have been perpetrated in Ireland within the past five years. To-day there are nearly 100,000 British troops and 11,000 armed police trying vainly to compel the Irish race to show respect for English officials, whom they loathe, and for English laws which they neither made nor sanctioned. And this criminal and tragic farce is costing the British taxpayers over £14,000,000 a year. For what? Do the Irish 'people desire to injure Britain or the British? Are they trying to undermine the British Empire? Are they attempting to annex any British territory or to invade England? Of course, they are not attempting any of these things. Ireland's only offence is that the peopio demand the right to make their own laws without the intervention of foreign bullies and foreign bayonets. An objection was made a few moments ago to the propriety of referring to the British Government in Ireland as a foreign Government. I repeat that any administration which does not exist by the free will and the sanction of the people over whom it functions is a foreign Government. Here, in this newspaper, I have an endorsement of that statementAnd Britain, being the bigger of the two, refuses to discontinue the bullying and the bayoneting. [255] Present writer, who is neither Irish nor Roman Catholic, is aware that there are a small number of people in Ireland who want to be governed from Downing-street, London. For the most part, they are either religious fanatics or capitalistic reactionaries, who see "" Rome"" or "" Bolsh"" in red letters whichever way they turn. We have quite a number of the same kidney in the Commonwealth, but we do not allow them to run the country as they do in Ireland, with the aid of British machine guns, tanks, and troops. Such of these members as What is there about Ireland which makes it so attractive to John Bull that he is content to incur the contempt of the whole civilized world rather than leave the place alone? What does Britain gain by keeping Ireland as a thorn in her flesh? Would it not be immeasurably wiser policy to have Ireland as a contented, happy and prosperous neighbour? I think I may f a i r l y conclude with these words. I regret very much the heat which has been imported into this discussion. It was not of my seeking. I had no intention whatever of saying anything to offend any hononable member, or, in deed, any person in the community. If I have inadvertently done so, I regret it , but the justification is in the uncalled-for provocation I received from the benches opposite. ter and Attorney-General) [11.32] I must confess to a feeling of surprise that, under the Standing Orders, such a matter as this can be treated as one of urgency. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (,MT. Mahon) can hardly expect us to believe that he has submitted this motion in order to do some good thing for Australia. If he would have us believe, as we Teadily can, that he has moved this motion to do some evil to B rita in and the Empire, then it does seem most amazing that it should be possible for him to do so with impunity under the .Standing Orders and procedure of this House, which recognise Australia as an integral part of the British Empire, and, in so many words, declare emphatically that the K in g of B r it a in is the K in g of this country. The honourable member has chosen as a peg upon which to hang his diatribe against England the death of Alderman MacSwiney, Lord Mayor of Cork. In this matter every man speaks for himself.

We have business enough of our own. Let us attend to it.

I have before me last night's issue of the Herald and this morning's issue of the Argus. In the Herald it is stated that in Ireland within the last forty-eight hours two policemen have been killed and two wounded; that one soldier has been killed and two wounded, two civilians killed and two wounded, and two "" black and tans "" killed. In the morning paper there appears a cablegram headed "" Sein Fern murders."" ""Seventeen constables killed."" "" Public will not help police."" The honthat he did not know of any policeman He then pro-' in Ireland who had been shot in the back. Sir, they shot an Irish Roman Catholic policeman while he was before the altar. The honourable member would have us believe that the police of Ireland are Protestants and Englishmen. They are mostly Irish Roman Catholics. This man was shot before the altara foul, sacrilegious crime. They shot another man on his way home from mass. . They waited for him, and as he left the church they shot him. The cablegram to which I have just referred states thatThe outrages have been spread over a wide area, and have been of a most cold-blooded character. Constable Maxwell, who went to a public-house with a friend, was followed by four masked men and shot dead. Seven other men were present, hut none raised a hand to defend the constable. Constable McCarthy, of Bruff, went for a cycle ride. His body was found in a drain practically naked. Serjeant Fulton was killed in the streets of Ballvmnte. He was surrounded by a dozen men, who fired a number of shots at short range, nnd then escaped by mingling with tlie crowd in the street. It is believed that the Irish people sympathize with the murder campaign, which is so em'iittering the constabulary and soldiery to increasing reprisals. Though the murderers must be known to scores of people, none will assist t^e police to track the murderers or p»ive warning of Hanger.",25,Adjournment Death Of The Lord May Or Of Cork

58,Mr Hughes,"They have perpeThe honourable member says that we should condone all these offences. It is nothing to shoot a man before the altar, because, although he is a Roman Catholic and an Irishman, he is a policeman. Because he is a policeman he is outside the pale, and may be murdered w i th impunity anywhere and at any time. We cannot agree to this motion. The cause of Sinn Fein, for which Alderman MacSwiney has died, is a cause which -cannot succeed, because it rests on force and is stained by bloody murder. Those priests in Ireland who have had the courage to tell the people what is right, have condemned it , but the honourable -member did not quote them. I deplore all these outrages and murders. I deplore the state of things in Ireland. Long before this latest development I have attempted to secure some sort of settlement of I r is h affairs. That, however, is beyond the powers of any one man. The trouble is embedded in tlie racial hatred or habits of mind.of the two peoples. It ' is beyond the power of this Parliament, the British Parliament, or any other Legislature to deal with. I do not justify anything that has been done; but if I am asked when a policeman is shot that the Government should do nothing, that his comrades should stand idly by, that licence to commit murder wholesale should be given to one section of the Irish people, while the opportunity for. justice is denied to others, I will not have it . If I am asked on whose side I am in this campaign, then I declare unhesitatingly that I am on the British side. the matter stands. It is not that I am attempting to j u s t i fy the manner in which the English have governed IrelandI do not believe that the English can ever govern Ireland properly. The English do not understand the Celts, and I have never hesitated to tell them that, but I shall not stand, quiet while certain people seek to establish a republic within gun fire of the English coast, and thus aim a blow at the very heart of the Empire. The Irish problem is one for Britain to deal with. to do with it . member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Mahon) in sists that we must express our opinion, I have expressed mine quite clearly; I am opposed to the honourable member's »iew. I do not regard Britain as a foreign country; if it were a foreign country, very few honprable members opposite "" [255]2 would have a right to be here at all, because they would not then be naturalized. When they speak of B rita in as a foreign country, they do not seem to recognise that everything they have they owe to Britain's might and power. They are very ready to avail themselves of British protection. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie quoted a statement from Lord Denman that there would be trouble in Australia; are we to understand that if we do not pass this motion the honourable member w ill attempt to recreate in Australia the state of affairs that exists in Ireland? Let him t r y it ; he w ill then find that the Australians are of a temperament altogether different from that of the English. Prime Minister said that honourable members on this side are not naturalized, and, therefore, have no rights in Australia. I was born in this country, and I have as much right to be here as has any other citizen born of Welsh parents. Unfortunately) I was not in the Chamber when the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr. Mahon) raised this question; had I been here I would have supported h i m in drawing attention to this matter. .

We have heard of a suggestion that 'a battalion of the Australian Imperial Force should be sent to France, and apparently it is right for one side to say what it thinks on this matter, but the other side must say nothing. Mr Asquith, who I presume is a non-Catholic, speaking in the House of Commons a fortnight ago on the motion of MrA r t h u r Henderson demanding an inquiry into the position in Ireland, said'We have nothing whatever there was prima facie evitlence that the police But as the honourable and military were going far beyond the limits of self-defence and had carried out reprisals whicli were a crime and an outrage against unoffending innocent people.

Speaking at Leicester on Saturdayi Mr Asquith .said he was amazed and ashamed at the lethargy and indifference of the British people regarding the policy of reprisals. The only hope for Ireland was complete and unrestricted self-government. Tbe Herald of 30th August contained this cable messageIn a letter, the Rev. F. B. Meyer, President of the National Federation of Free Churches, urges every congregation in Great Britain to telegraph to-morrow to the Prime Minister, petitioning for the release of Alderman McSwceney, who is undergoing a sentence of two years' imprisonment in Brixton Gaol, and is hunger-striking. That Federation comprises practically the whole of the churches in Great Britain, except the Anglican church, which is notoriously the most conservative body in the Old Country.

Even the very people who were so strongly opposed to Gladstone's Home Rule proposals are dissatisfied to-day with the Imperial Government's Irish policy.

Minister( Mr Poynton) knows, I have interviewed him on several occasions in connection with the recent Ballarat election. First of all I approached him in regard to the payment of the legal expenses incurred by both parties to the appeal case heard by Mr Justice Isaacs, and subsequently the Minister placed on the Estimates a sum of £800 to cover those expenses, both candidates having, I understand, agreed upon a certain amount which would cover their costs. This step I regard as only fair, in view of the decision of Mr Justice Isaacs that the election must be declared void on account of errors made by the officials of the Electoral Department, but if it was right for Mr Kerby, who was only elected by a majority of one vote, to draw his salary from the date of the first election until the election was declared void, I contend that the present honourable member for ceive payment for the period between the first election and the upsetting of that toral Officer says that with the card syselection.

There have been other disputed elections in the case of the Riverina, Melbourne, and Echuca divisions, but I do not think they were declared void on account of official errors. There are two matters in connection with the Electoral Office to which I should lik=» to draw brief attention. The first is the question of obtaining uniform rolls in State and Commonwealth elections. Recent events have revealed most extraordinary discrepancies between the rolls on which Commonwealth elections are held, and those upon which State elections are held.

Every one desires that the electoral rolls should be as nearly as possible correct, so that every person entitled to vote should be enrolled, and that no name should be on more than one roll. Recent investigations, however, have disclosed a certain amount of duplication.

In many cases electors do this and find that they are properly enrolled, only to discover on election day that some one has subsequently had their names taken off the roll. are printed every month, and I think that new rolls should be exhibited every month. Once a person is enrolled for a Eederal chises. The printing of "" S "" or "" F "" division, it is almost impossible for his name to get off the roll. In the old days, the trouble was to get a name on the roll. In the Queensland bush there was always a bunch of magistrates, composed mostly of squatters, who needed only an excuse to take a name off a roll. The elector might get it on again, but, in the meantime, he might be prevented from voting at an election. When a man applies for Eederal enrolment, he has to state on what roll his name already appears, and if he declares that he is not enrolled, he search is made in the head office of the State from which he said he came, to ascertain whether he is enrolled for any division in that State, and until the matter is satisfactorily settled, his name is not put on the roll for the division to which he has moved. He retains, howquestion is ever, the right to vote in any division for which he may have been previously enrolled. The electoral administration of the Commonwealth is almost .perfect, and reflects great credit on the officers of the Department, and particularly on the Central Branch. It seems to me that, with a view to lessening public expenditure, the Commonwealth and the States could come to an arrangement for the uniform compilation of electoral rolls. Tasmania; set a good example by combining her State rolls with the Commonwealth roll* years ago, and a similar arrangement should suit the other States. I think that were the matter pushed 'a little by the Commonwealth the States would accept uniformity. The Minister has said that he is sending the Chief Electoral Officer to the various States to try to bring about uniformity. was a conference in Adelaide, and I understand from the Chief Electoral Officer that practically every point in dispute was settled so far as South Australia is concerned, so that there should be a combined Federal and State roll for use at the forthcoming State election.

In Queensland the expenses of In places, on the administration were £ 2 , 5 4 1 , and in V i c toria £15,161, but there are no details given of the latter figures. We have, therefore, to make an estimate as to the, proportion that the administrative expenses bear to the election expenses. Ini. regard to Western Australia there is no information given, the amounts being shown under the Estimates for the Crown Law Department, w it h no details. If we assume that the Electoral Departments of the various States spend £30,000 a year in administration, that does not I know the case of a seem excessive, and, further, assuming: that Tasmania by her recent arrangement is saving 50 per cent., we may take it that £15,000 per annum would be 1 saved by the co-ordination of the Departments However, more important tham even this saying is an assurance thati; every man and woman entitled to the franchise shall be on .the roll.

An y suggestion is very helpful. that some one will come along with intelligence to indicate how something can be done; hut when I rose for the purpose of making a few innocent remarks about the Northern Territory, and to ask whether the Minister would make any definite statement in regard to the administration there, his attitude was such as to drive me into the position of becoming a hostile critic, and almost to become more and more hostile every minute, in order to maintain my position. There was no necessity for this. The only point I am raising now is whether the Government have anything in mind I agree that on the as to how the Territory can be dealt with . I want to know if they have any definite scheme which they propose to put into effect. If it be recognised, as it should be, that we have the northern part of Australia to populate, and if we are to make the fullest use of that portion of the Commonwealth, it seems to me that it is the obvious duty of any Government to tell us what their scheme is. If , however, they are barren of any ideas of the sort, it is the duty of the Committee to demand from them how they propose to run the Territory, on the present lines, ture. To return to the point which I I think it would be a was endeavouring to make when the M in ister interrupted, let me tell the Committee that there are 140 omcers in the Northern Territory drawing over £46,00 0 in salaries, and spending £60,000 on contingencies.

For instance, the Trade and Customs Department at D a r w in costs £1,370; the Railway Department, £40,000,; and the Post Office service, £28,000.

Before these Estimates are agreed to, I hope the Minister wil l give the Committee some idea as to the Government's proposals in this regard. W it h regard to the Ballarat election, it appears to me that the two candidates have been put to considerable expenditure for a reason thab no one can suggest was their own fault, and I certainly think they are entitled to be reimbursed for any additional expenditure they have been put to, which is expenditure that was not cast upon other candidates at the recent general election. been provided on the Estimates to meet those expeuses. have received a letter from an Italian resident of Sydney informing me that he has tried to bring Ei§ wife to Australia. He has been working in this country a number of years, and his letter contains the following: A few days ""ago I went to the Immigration Office in order to nominate my wife. After being told that it would have cost me £26 from Naples to Sydney, the officer in charge asked mc then whether she was able to speak English. I answered that I knew enough for tlie two of us. He told mo then that a regulation, recently passed by the Minister of Home and Territories, requires that an emigrant must know a little English before he or she embarks; not only that, but tlie form which he handed me (he stated) after being filled in will have to be sent to the aboveinontioned Minister for approval. What sort of a barbarian law is that? He wants to know what sort of a barbarian law that is ? one very much like it in Italy. that he would find very much difference between Italy an'd Aus'ralia in that respect. complaints from BrokenH ill miners about bringing men out to Australia who could not sneak English. when the Government sent interned Bulgarians up to BrokenH ill to take the jobs of the Britishers they were recruiting. It is no wonder the residents there squealed. miners in Western Australia complained. that the Minister's interjection is a very logical reply to the complaint of this Italian who has been working here, and seeks to have his wife join him in Australia, but is precluded from doing so by this regulation made by the Minister. If it is desired to increase the population of the country, surely a good way of doing so is to enable persons who have come here to send for the members of their families to join them. The man to AvhomI have referred is apparently a law-abiding citizen, because he has resided here for several years. What objection can there be to his wife joining him, even of £800 has though she may not be able to speak English? She could learn very quickly if living in this community. speak of has not come under my notice. I shall inquire about it . to the Committee the statement that has been made to me. It may not be correct, or the departmental officials may have made a mistake. By the midday mail I received from Sydney a letter in which the writer, an Englishman, and an ex-member of the Australian Imperial Porce, complains in quite a number of pages of his treatment since his discharge. He is so angry about it that he has written to the Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers Federation of the United Kingdom a letter in which he gives Australia anything but a good advertisement, pointing out that a number of ex-sailors and soldiers in Sydney are having a bad time. He has sent me a copy of that letter, and in it he saysThis Repatriation Department was organized to benefit returned soldiers, and to place them. I do not know in a condition to work"", and get them work. How they do it! They supply the ex-Australian Imperial Force men with letters to the Orient liners manager here for him to give the bearers a working passage to England, and thereby help the good work of repatriation along. Many avail themselves of the offer, glad to leave, while the Orient Line take advantage of their misfortune, and obtain their services at Is. per month, while we British seamen, with good' books, are stranded.

212,Mr Rodgers,"If the honourable memmember undertake that this man will stop at a job if one is got for him? are in receipt of a great number of similar communications, but I have not ventilated in the House all that have reached me. The present is a differentcase altogether; it is a case in which a man feels himself so badly treated that he has gone to the trouble of getting into touch with the official organization of the returned soldiers in Great Britain in order to prevent his mates from coming to Australia. His letter bears every impress of a truthful statement. tion ? However, I am satisfied with the assurance that the matter will be looked into. There is one other case which I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister. One of the Italian reservists was taken from Broken Hill. Whether he was killed or missing I do not know; but his wife, who is still in that city, has been deprived of the allowance which she.received whilst the war was in progress. At present she is in receipt of a very small sum at distant intervals from the Italian Consul. She has written to me, and I would like the Department to look into the case and explain why the allowance has been cut off. I wish to say a word or two in support of the argument, of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) and other honourable members on the case of the honourable The case is, I think, unique, so far as this Parliament is concerned. been clearly shown that it was through the gross carelessness of some of the departmental officers that the present member for Ballarat was deprived of his seat and remuneration .for a number of months. Whatever was the cause of the trouble, it lay with the departmental officers, and I think it would be only fair if the honourable member were paid the full salary as from the date of the first election. It is tbe rule, I think, -that if any member of the public suffers any disability 'through carelessness or mistakes in any Department he shall be' allowed compensation The result of the second election has shown that the honourable member for Ballarat was justly entitled to the parliamentary remuneration from the beginning of the Parliament. I was pleased to hear from the Minister( Mr Poynton) this morning that he is taking steps towards the provision of a uniform roll for the States and the Commonwealth. A Pederal election costs, I believe, about £80,000, and I suppose that in the same period a similar amount, or more, is spent by the different States. In my own electorate, at a recent State election, it was found that the ballot boxes of the State had become damaged, and though there were Federal ballot boxes which had been in use only a few months before in the same neighbourhood, new boxes had to be provided for the State election. Of course, the Minister cannot bring about this reform himself, because the State authorities have to be consulted, andmust be willing to adopt it. I hope, however, that sweet reasonableness will prevail, and that we will very soon have one electoral roll and one method of enrolment. We have been told to-day that in the case of Queensland there . are about 60,000 more names on the State rolls than on the Federal rolls, and the electoral officer of my own district told me the other day that the Federal roll there is much smaller than the State one, the latter having been issued later. I am quite satisfied that the State rolls of New South Wales show more . names than do the Federal rolls, so that I was not surprised to hear of the state of affairs in Queensland. Every honourable member knows that when the names have been collected by the policemen, the people think that they are duly It has enrolled; but Uhe two systems of collecting names are different. In the case of the States the police do the collecting, and the average person does not worry much about the matter, but is convinced that he is on the roll. In one part of my electorate 300 notices were issued recently asking the electors for reasons for their names not being on the roll. I understand that if the reasons given are good, only a nominal fine of 2s. 6d. is imposed. Out of the 300 persons involved, I think that all but two stated that they thought that the collecting of their names by the police officer meant",39,Joseph Cook What Another But W I Th A Very Much Decreased Expendi

218,Member For Ballarat ( Mr Mcgrath).,"that they would be on the Federal roll. Apartf r o m the economy of a uniform roll, much confusion would be avoided, and many people saved from worry. Tho average elector does not wish to keep his name off the roll, but is confused by the varying systems adopted. we do have a uniform roll, something ought to be done in the way of a uniform method of collecting the names. I hope it is true that South. Australia and Tasmania have consented to uniformity, and that the rest of the States will follow. We would then get a better expression of opinion at the ballot-box, and, altogether, conditions would he much improved for both Commonwealth and States. ter and Attorney-General) . [2.58] There are two points on which I desire to say a word. made that a sum of money shall be placed on tbe Estimates as a set-off to the loss of salary which the honourable member received had he been returned at the general election. The other question is that of a uniform electoral roll. As to the first .matter my right honourable colleague ( Sir Joseph Cook) has already in cost incurred in the case of Merton .v. formed honourable members that it is a matter which the House itself must decide; if the House is in favour of the suggestion, the Government w ill approve of it , and by placing an amount on the Supplementary Estimates pay it to the honourable member. the question ? to do this thing I do not know, but, speaking for myself and for the Treasurer, I would say, if I were asked, that the honourable membet for Ballarat has made out a primd facie case. The responsibility, however, must rest on the House-w e must have the authority of the House-and we shall give honourable members an opportunity of expressing their opinion before the session closes. We are all agreed, I think, as to the desirability of uniform electoral rolls; there is no question of party, or difference of opinion in that matter. I would only like to say that no blame attaches to the Commonwealth for this uniformit y not having been effected sooner. We have done everything in our power, and the Ministeri n charge of the Department ( Mr Poynton) informs me that considerable progress has been made, more in some States than in others, towards the end in view. But I think 1 shall not be doing any one an injustice Eveni f when I say that the"" principal cause of the delay has been the vested interests of the officials in the various State offices, who imagine, I think quite wrongly, that this is a blow aimed at their prerogatives or possibly at their pockets. I may be doing-them an injustice. If that is the case, I apologize to them. Uniform electoral rolls, however, are very desirable, and the Commonwealth,. I repeat, has made very considerable progress in the imatter. My honourable colleague informs me that he believes that in the case of one State at least the . next elections will be held on a uniform roll. tralia. have the support of all sections of the House in trying to bring about that uniformity. I may, perhaps, be permitted at this stage to give the information which I promised last evening, to supply as to the Hughes. The item on the Estimates is "" £ 3 , 0 8 7 , "" that amount being set down for ""expenses in America."" I have ascertained that the total expenditure, so far as we and our officers know, is £3,05 5 7s. 6d., London; and £3,400 6s. 10d., America. These are the total expenses, some of which have been paid, while .in the case of others only the accounts have been rendered. I think that is the whole of the information. The item itself w i ll be brought down, I presume, on the Supplementary Estimates, but the information is now in the possession of honourable members and of the public. [3.3] I had hoped that the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) might have included in his statement some information in reply to the case put by the. honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) with regard to the Northern Territory. not hear it . is high time that this Parliaiment had placed before it some outline of the work contemplated over a term of years in the Northern Territory.

227,Mr Hector Lamond,"I think i tthings necessarily were allowed to d r if t . The Territory has been a very expensive acquisition to the Commonwealth, and yet there is every reason to belieVe that it is a very rich portion of Australia, and that uDder wise government, instead of being tbe heavy responsibility that it is to-day, it might be converted, if nob immediately, as all events at a comparatively early date, into an asset. The information that one gets in regard to the Territory indicates that we have been inclined to pursue wrong lines in its administration. We are attempting to induce people to take up small settlements, which cannot be immediately profitable, whereas the policy indicated by the nature and the situation of the country is that we should, in the first place, encourage the pastoral industry, and give encouragement to prospecting, in the hope that some mining centres imay be discovered, which would help to attract population, and so make the smaller industries eventually successful. I hope before this session ends we may have from the Government a definite statement as to their intentions with regard to the future of the Territory. A strong man is needed .as Administrator to control it . He should be given very wide powers, and should be judged by the results he produces, instead of being continually interfered with by the Central Administration , which cannot have the intimate knowledge of the conditions existing in the north that the man on the spot, provided that he be the right man, must have. There is a matter that I desire to bring under the notice of the Miuister( Mr Poynton) and the Committee, although I am not optimistic enough to think that it w ill receive the attention it deserves. On page S9 of the General Estimates there is a small but ominous item of nearly £1,000 for clearing the rifle range at Warwick of prickly pear. I imagine that an area of that sort would comprise from 300 to 500 acres. If it w ill cost £1.000 to clear such an area, only a very easy sum need be worked to show what it will cost to clear something like 20,000,000 acres of badly infested pear country in Queensland. In that way we shall get an idea of the enormous sum of monev necessary to attempt anything like eradication of the pest. of the prickly pear pest? do not intend to take up the time of the Committee by going deeply into the question, although I understand it , I believe, as well as most people do. But I want honourable members to realize that it is probably no exaggeration to say that one-third of the enormous area of Queensland is more or less directly threatened at the present moment. The pest w ill very shortly-on e may say that it has already-becom e a menace in more than one State. The State Governments of Queensland right through have proved themselves quite unable to cope w i th it. been made to cope with it? say what is and what is not a serious effort , but there is no royal road to clearing the country of the pest. It is not a mechanical question, but an economic one. Land can be easily cleared, but it is the cost of carrying out the work which has to be considered. The present Government of Queensland-and I do not speak in any party sense-doe s not believe in the principle of freehold, and.that is an additional difficulty in the way of the solution of the problem. I say quite openly that so f a r all our Governments in Queensland have proved themselves incapable of handling the question. To put it broadly, the complete eradication of prickly pear today is no longer practicable. We can abandon all ideas of eradication or of clearing the pear-infested country. We now have simply to consider what steps should be taken to prevent the further spread of the pest. It may be said that this is not a question for the Federal Parliament, but it w ill be admitted that if a fire breaks out in one of a row of houses, it becomes a very important matter for the occupiers of the remaining houses that that fire should bo promptly extinguished. The Commonwealth is now the direct proprietor of a very large area .with an extensive frontage to the Queensland border. W it h a clear understanding of the position, I do not hesitate to say that the pear is gradually eating up a very large portion of Queensland and becoming an absolute menace to the whole of Australia. I am convinced that sooner or later it",41,Joseph Cook What Another But W I Th A Very Much Decreased Expendi

He had some harsh things to say concerning certain officials, but as one of the candidates I desire to state that, so f a r as Mr Anderhave only one division for each Sta'e son and the other permanent officials of the Department are concerned, no one could have carried out the work better than tbey did. complimented .them. MrM o GRATH make, that quite clear. Il should be glad if we could secure uniform rolls for State and Pederal elections. State elections, it struck me as peculiar that officials for the Federal electorate of Ballarat had nothing to do, although they arc trained men, while others who knew very little about electoral matters were brought in to conduct the State elections. Much greater satisfaction would be given if we had uniform rolls, and the permanent officials of the Commonwealth Department conducted both the State ancl Federal elections. They understand the law, and know exactly how to compile rolls, and to conduct an election. The reflections which Mr Justice Isaacs cast upon electoral officials in connection with the first Ballarat election related to men employed only for the day, who were not familiar with the Electoral Act. tain persons whose names had been i m properly removed from the rolls claimed the right to vote; but the presiding officers, in certain cases, knowing nothing of section 121 of the Act, refused to allow 'them to do so. That was practically responsible for the trouble which occurred. I repeat that the Electoral Department, and particularly the chief of the Department in Ballarat, did their work in conI nexion with the Federal election there in a splendid manner. If we desire to have a thoroughly satisfactory set of rolls, we should take care to have fewer subdivisions than at present. The State electorate of Ballarat West consists of two subdivisions. If persons remove from one side of Sturtstreet to the other, they may still be in I the same electorate, but in a different subdivision. Being unaware of the fact that they are in a different subdivision, they fail to get enrolled for it , and are either prosecuted for that failure, or find, when election time comes round, that they have no vote. The Department would be well-advised if it decided to electorate. Home and Territories) [3.14] -It is due to the 'Committee that I should make a statement with regard to the Northern Territory. Exception was taken to the in Yes ; ' I wish to terjection that I made, while an. honourable member was speaking on the subject, "" What would you suggest ?""

Reference was made to the number of officers employed in the Territory, ancl I may''say that I have been going very carefully into the whole question, with the object of making a reduction. Unfortunately, there are not many people in the Territory, but a number of Departments are necessary. If we did not maintain a certain number of officials there it would be necessary to drag the citizens of the Territory down to the other Statesf o r the redress of their grievances. No greater problem confronts the Ministerf o r Home and T e r r i tories than the administration of this CerTerritory, where, I believe, we bave a wonderful asset if it is properly handled. In my opinion it can be developed, not by following the lines of closer settlement, but only by adopting the more primitive method of stocking with cattle and sheep, which has been applied successfully in other parts of Australia that are now carrying large populations.

237,The,"Commonwealth permanent Mr POYNTON But I do not wishof this policy Ave have been putting clown a number of bores east and Avest from the WaveH ill district towards CamooAveal, and boring should also be undertaken south towards the Macdonnell Ranges, The land is capable of growing excellent grasses and edible herbage, and produces a very fine class of stock, particularly in tlie central area. The doubt as to Avhether permanent water exists we are endeavouring to solve by means of these bores, and later on I propose to ask for the expenditure of a considerable sum of money in this direction. However, excellent results have been obtained so far. The average depth of the bores put doAvn is 170 feet to 200 feet, and Avater of a very high character has been tapped. In No. 1 bore water was struck at a depth of 247 feet, and rose 170 feet in the bore. 32,000 gallons per day Avithout reducing that level. In No. 2 bore water was struck 1 at a depth of 180 feet, and the bore is capable of producing 32,000 gallons a day. At another bore a pumping test for twelve hours gave 29,000 gallons. On one pastoral station a number of bores have been put doAvn, and an excellent supply of water Avas obtained at a very shallow depth, varying from 42 feet to a little over 60 feet. At one of these bores 500 head of cattle are Av'atered. My idea of developing the Northern Territory is to provide railway facilities in conjunction Avith the policy of boring for water, not on every block, but in certain localities, in order to demonstrate that a permanent supply is obtainable. Where these facilities are provided I am satisfied a wonderful development Avill follow. Cook) is not so confident as I am about this, but when we realize that we have a Territory 900 miles long by-600 miles wide Ave can see that it is not a little proposition capable of being administered by one or tAvo men. The trouble is that all through, during the period of administration by the State of South Australia., and since the Commonwealth has taken over the Territory, Ave have been endeavouring to develop it from the Darwin end, which is the tropical portion 'of it. I do not think Ave sball succeed in any attempt to develop the Territory from the tropical end, but if it is. once bridged by a raihvay I am satisfied that thousands Mr Poynton. of people will settle there. The worse enemy of the country is the man Avho has never seen the locality, the man Avho Avould develop it from Bourke-street or King William-street; but here I have the testimony of a young fellow who went into the Macdonnell Ranges at seventeen years of age, and Avho, although not as well equipped as other men, through having a maimed foot, bas, according to a letter he has forwarded to me, made an unqualified success of his efforts to develop the pastoral industry in the Northern Territory. He commenced as a lad, earning 30s. a Aveek., gaining experience on stations, and after saving about £350 Avent to Western Australia, hoping to make his fortune there. Eventually he returned to the Macdonnell Ranges country, Avhich is so much conPumping yields demned by Melbourne newspapers and other critics. He writes as follows: I arrived back at Alice Springs about J u l ; , 1911, with £350 and a few horses. I then bought a fe-v cattle, and joined in a partnership on a small cattle ranch. After fighting the ordinary difficulties one has outback, and all tbe inconveniences one has to contend with in the bush, I am pleased to state that my success has been such as to enable me to invest the sum of £7,000 cash in a ranch in the same district, with the ultimate prospect of being able to pay off the £12,000 that represents the total cost There is room for thousands of people who are willing to work and put up with the rough conditions outback. There is an immense area of good stock country lying idle. This young man has the opinion that a great future awaits this portion of the Territory, but the attitude of some honourable members is like that of a man Avho takes up a property Avith a limited capital, and refuses to spend any money The Treasurer ( Sir Joseph on it. If Ave Avant to make anything out of the Northern Territory we must spend money on it. In the meantime Ave cannot do better than folloAv the course of putting doAvn bores, and demonstrating that permanent Avater is available. As soon as that is done young fellows, sons of pastoralists whose holdings are being cut up for closer settlement, and who are anxious to get out further back to continue their pastoral occupation, will be found going to. the Territory. There is every possibility of development on the primitive lines of settlement A\'hich have been so successfully applied in all the"" States. We shall not succeed by forcing closer settlement. Although. I have absolute f a it h in the future of the Northern Territory,, I admit ic is a very difficult question to handle. I have recently received a communication stating that the residents there are very much upset because a branch of this Legislature has refused to allow them to have representation in this Parliament. them have a representative in this Chamber. ther that could be done, but, at any rate, I think they ought to have representation in this Parliament. the Senate which said that they should not. forward in the Senate that the Terri tory should be represented by the senators of South Australia or Western Australia ; but that cannot be done under the Constitution. However, the matter will come up again. The honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) claims that my Department is keeping the wife of an Italian out of Australia because of a regulation which he says has been issued, stipulating that before she can enter the Commonwealth she must be able to read, write, or talk English. There is no such regulation in existence. The Committee should not too precipitately agree to the Home and Territories Estimates, because upon them' the question of immigration comes up for consideration, and it is one upon which much can, ancl should, be said. up with it is the settlement of the Northern Territory. I do not share the optimistic views of the Minister respecting the Territory, but I would not think of decrying it as a national asset, or of saying that it . is impossible to make it a productive white man's country. I agree with tbe Minister that it has to be populated, and from the south rather than from the north. It is idle, however, to suppose that we can populate it properly until there has been a very large increase in the population of the Commonwealth ' as a whole. No part of Australia is adequately populated yet, and we cannot, by artificial processes, populate the Northern Territory, and make it productive in advance of the development of more accessible areas. A short time ago the Prime Minister made a statement in this Chamber of the Government policy with respect to immigration. He told us the Ministerf o r Repatriation (Senator Millen), who is now abroad on a mission, was to interest himself in Londoni n the subject of i m migration, and that the Government proposed to appoint a Mr Barnes to act as emigration agent on the other side of the world. That appointment is obnoxious to every member of the Labour party, and to the great body of the community outside for which we speak. It is so obnoxious to the workers that the party will be justified-and indeed bound-to let organized It was your party in labour in Great Britain know that it should not rely on Mr Barnes as a spokesT h e claim was put man for Australia in the matter of im migration. the prosecution of a vendetta against this man, you would destroy out scheme of immigration. Minister for Repatriation is charged w i th the duty of looking into emigration on the other side of the world, and to that I offer no objection, because, though we differ in politics, I recognise that he holds his position as the result of the vote of the Australian people, and as a member of the Government, so that, apart from his personal qualifications, he is entitled to speak for a large section of the community. My objection to Mr Barnes is not personal, and not even political; it is based on the fact that he has neither the qualifications nor the capacity to speak Bound for Australia, and *hose whom the Labour party represent have no confidence in him. His public performances, utterances, and course of conduct are such that he has utterly forfeited, if he ever possessed, the confidence of that class to which he will have to appeal in England to make his mission a success.' An emigration campaign is not to be won by an appeal to the personal friends of members of the Government, or to those in high places; the appeal must be made to the bone and sinew of the country fro m which emigrants are to be drawn-the workers of Great Britain and Ireland, and the workers of other countries-if it is intended to prosecute our immigration policy outside the British Dominions.
