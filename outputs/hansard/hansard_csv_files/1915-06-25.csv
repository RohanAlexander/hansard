I do not wish to do so. the men. ber for Maribyrnong must cease interjecting. orable member for Maribyrnong hold his tongue as to what the men say and what they offer. I shall be compelled to deal w i th this matter in some other for m if I am not permitted to discuss it calmly and dispassionately. I do not wish to raise any party question, but I do wish to have tlie matter cleared up. Reference was made in the House a few minutes ago to Mr Lloyd George. May I remind honourable members of the difference between his action and that of this Government. Whereas Mr Lloyd George is trying to mobilize the workers at the other end of the world-endeavourin g to induce them to put every ounce of effort into the production of munitions-here , in connection with this matter of munitions, it is the Government who will not move, and the men who are trying to force them to do so. Here the position is completely reversed. It is the men who are protesting, on behalf of their confreres in the trenches, that the Government cannot be induced to take action and to institute a second shift for the manufacture of rifles at Lithgow. I wish to come to the point without beating about the bush, notwithstanding all the statements that have been made by the Prime Minister and his Attorney-General during the .last few days that the Opposition never make any suggestions-that , as the Prime Minister said, I think, we do nothing but "" nag."" I can only say that I shall keep on "" nagging,"" regarding this matter of rifles until some satisfactory decision is arrived at, no matter what the Prime Minister or any one else may say. I know Lithgow; T know, perhaps, us much as the honourable member for Maribyrnong does of the Small Arms Factory, and I make the statement deliberately that two shifts could have been put on there six or seven months ago. machinery there now than when the right honourable member went out of office? tion, which, of course, is quite friendly and. non-party, leads me to say that the Prime Minister, when speaking in this House a few nights ago, asserted that when he took office in the middle of September-and this, too, was a little non-party interpolation by the right honourable gentlemanNo steps had been taken to provide for the manufacture within Australia of either ordnance or ammunition there for. I should like to tell the right honourable member, using one of his own expressions, that three suns had scarcely gone down after the outbreak of Avar before we engaged the services of one of the best scientists of whom we knew, and who> happened to be visiting Australia in connection w i th tbe Science Congress. I refer to Dr. Rosenhain, whom we engaged to investigate this very matter of steel production. hain is a Melbourne-born man, a Melbourne University graduate. He was retained by the present Government after we left office, and was given, I understand, a fee of 200 guineas to report on the question of the local manufacture of steel, with a view to the production of rifles and other munitions. So much for the gratuitous, friendly statement by the Prime Minister, that when his party took oflice in September last they found that their predecessors had done nothing. I make this explanation in justice to that brave little man, Senator Millen, who has never had credit given h i m for his work, and who took prompt steps to secure,all the ability within his reach, not only to equip men and to send them oversea, but to deal with this great question of the production of steel for rifles and other munitions.",6,Adjournment Formal Small Arms Factory Second Shift

62,Mr Josephcook,"D r . RosenTo come back to this question as it stands to-day, the outstanding feature of the situation in these last few weeks has been that the Minister of Defence and the Government had to be forced by public opinion to take the step they have recently taken. Everything was going on quite complacently, and Ave Avere told by the Minister,, time and again, that, in the interests of the production of rifles, it was not advisable to start a second shift at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. He took that view, notwithstanding the deputations of the rnen who waited upon h i m in December, and again in January last, and asked him to institute a second shift. The Minister of Defence, after visiting the Factory, and having a conversation w i th the manager, decided against the men. Public opinion has had to force h i m and the Government upon this question of providing a second, shift at Lithgow. That cannot be denied. And what is the position now that an in son, Mr Davis, and Colonel Dangar visited the Factory, and noiv announce that the reports made by the Publio Works Committee i and the Public Accounts Committee, that two shifts could be worked, is justified on every ground and from every point of vieAv. They also say, as those Committees have already reported, that it is possible to work two shifts at Lithgow, and, further, that the present plant, owing to the additions that have been made to it , is capable of producing 20,000 rifles per annum, on the basis of an eight-hours'* shift per day. M u l t i p ly that output by two, and you find that the Pactory ought to be giving us 40,000 rifles per annum. make no deduction whatever, since I believe I am giving the Government a sufficient margin to Avork upon when I make them a present of one eight-hours' shift per day. Forty thousand rifles ought to be issuing from this Factory every year when two shifts are instituted. -serious, Avould they not provide for three shifts? hotter get, first of all, two shifts ? I attach great importance to the report made by Mr Davis, the Director-General of Works in New South Wales. He said that two shifts could be instituted, but that, under the proposal then in consideration, it would take three or four months. By this means, he said, men would be trained -not e the language-withi n three or four months to enable a second shift to be Avorking. On that report Senator Millen asked the Minister of Defence whether this three or four months could not be shortened to two weeks-whether , instead of taking the untrained men in the Factory and training them, the Minister could not make available for himself the trained resources already in possession of private employers and the Governments of the various States. We must remember that the State Governments had said that the Commonwealth could take their men from anywhere to be used in the manufacture of munitions. That is the offer made, yet, strange to say, here is the proposal of these experts, on the assumption that untrained men from outside are to be taken and trained i u the Factory. But when the question is put to Mr Ferguson as to whether, by taking trained mechanics from outside and putting them straight on to the machinery, the time could not be reduced to a fortnight, he answers, "" Yes . "" Here, then, we have Mr Ferguson forced by the ex-Minister of Defence to say that two shifts could be started in a fortnight if only the Commonwealth availed itself of the resources which were at its disposal. the skilled workmen in the Factory. selves say that there need not be any trouble, and on this point they have been insistent all along. They say that it is nonsense to suggest that there is anything occult or difficult in the machine, which can be worked by any ordinary trained man. But a further question was put to Mr. Ferguson by the Minister of Defence, and not a question suggested by SenatorM i l len, but evidently one that the Minister interposed on his own account. Tf ever there was a leading question, this is one. If the Government were The Minister asked Mr Ferguson to say whether he would recommend the institution of a second shift in a fortnight, in view of the effect it would have on the labour organization of the Factory; and to that Mr Ferguson answered.

A t the Pactory the rule is to train unskilled labour from the bottom unti l it becomes highly skilled labour at the to p ; and Mr Ferguson, in reply to this leading question by Senator Pearce, said that if trained men from outside were taken on for the second shift, it would prevent the unskilled men in the first shift from getting their proper promotion. time of peace. so; but ought a question such as that to be seriously asked or answered? As a matter of fact, the taking on of other men from outside need not interfere with the promotion of those in the Factory; and I make that statement without the slightest hesitation. keep these outside men on the second shift for ever, but only temporarily, if only for the reason that the States Governments will very naturally desire to have their skilled labour again. able gentleman say that what he has in dicated was the object and meaning of the question. clear enough. it? put by Senator Pearce was whether, assuming the answer to be in the affirmative^-that a second shift could be in stituted in a fortnight-and in view of all the circumstances connected with the organization of the labour at the Factory, he would recommend that course; and Mr Ferguson said, "" No , "" b u t he explained that there were machines there of minor importance, requiring very little skill, which could be manned by the lower-grade employees, who would be able to look to these positions as an avenue for promotion. son's reply to the leading question. question. was, and nothing else. Why bother about the promotion of these men, if it is going to interfere with the production of rifles in time of war?

The attitude of the Government is The idea is not to incomprehensible under all the circumstances. A second shift ought to beput on within a fortnight-quit e a. son. The Government ought to . obtain the best and most highly-skilled labour from anywhere-fro m State workshops, from private workshops-and this should, be done at the earliest possible moment, as a most obvious duty.

Personally, I could give the names of seven or eight men at Cockatoo Island* who have previously worked at the Small: Arms Factory, and could go back thereto-morrow to leading positions. Hundreds of men must have passed through that Factory since it was started; and it ought to be quite possible to have them mobilized and set to work again. These are men who know the Factory, and have had experience of the machines; and yet. the Government have never' tried to obtain their services. L e t them be advertised for and well paid, and we shall find them running back. Further, there areall the expert gunmakers in Australia, Small Arms Factories at Home; and thereI t was not a leading is uot the slightest doubt that these men if required would place their services at the disposal of the Government.

The fact that we are short of steel steel. able?

There was excuse, therefore, for him, though none for the honourable member for Wimmera, whose offence, however, I shall overlook on this occasion. statements of the Minister are correct, odium has been thrown on the Government which they do not deserve. honourable member for Wimmera, who, by his interjecting, is qualifying for a seat -outside in the wet, evidently thinks that he has some knowledge on the subject which should be made public, and I have been informed by a member of the Public Works Committee that a witness stated on oath that a supply of steel had been available for a considerable time. The Government, therefore, should make the facts very clear. If there has been a supply of steel available for any length of time, some one should be dealt with. In other countries the offender would be stood up against a wall and shot. I again urge the Government to adopt the suggestion to appoint a Minister of Munitions, the notwithstanding the fact that the suggestion comes from the Opposition. If the honourable member for Maranoa were sent to Lithgow, the second shift would be started there within ten days. He would not waste time making inquiries. Yesterday I questioned the Assistant Minister of Defence on this matter, and was asked to give notice of my question. This morning the reply furnished was "" As soon as possible."" It is only when he was pinned down by the Leader of the Opposition that the honourable gentleman told the House what he should have said yesterday, that the instruction had been sent to Lithgow that a second shift must be started forthwith. This dodging of questions is bad, because the public and honourable members are entitled to know these things. I was prepared to say some hard things about the Government and the Minister relative to the Small Arms Factory, but, after the Minister's statement, I shall not do so. Members of the Public Works Committee tell us tliat there is plenty of material available, but the Minister says that it is not so. It is, therefore, difficult to know who is to blame. The Minister accuses the Leader of the Opposition of raising the matter for party purposes, and has asked why he did not authorize a second shift. A report of some length, by the head of the Amalgamated Engineers at Lithgow, was published in the Sydney Morning Herald, in which it is stated that a second shift could have been started long ago, everything being available. Ministers and. others must have read these reports. Naturally those who have kith and kin fighting at the front ask, "" W hy is the Government content The merely to make inquiries?""

153,Mr Sampson,"I will deal with thatassociation with th© Home Affairs Department, which has a stock of seasoned timber on hand. We asked him if there was any mechanical difficulty, and that eventually was brushed on one side. It was only by the most searching inquiry and interrogation that we were able to drag from the manager of the factory an admission of the possibility of two shifts being worked, and to brush away one -after another the objections that were brought forward. We found that the material was there, that it had been possible to work the double shift for some time, and, that being the case, I think we have reason to be somewhat suspicious regarding the official statement of tlie supplies of material prior to our inquiry. The agent who supplied the steel, in his evidence before the Committee, did not give any indication that it would not have beeu possible to increase supplies if the Government had only given an order. He stated that there was a three-years' contract in operation for the supply of steel, and that, though he had only supplied the requirements of the contract, yet his firm was well in advance of supply, and had been for some time. In my opinion, the whole trouble is that the Defence Department has accepted the recommendation of the manager, and has accepted the objections raised by him as being sufficient for delaying the second shift instead of giving the definite instruction that the second shift was absolutely imperative, and that, if that management was not prepared to establish it , other means would have to be taken of doing so. difficulties in regard to the establishment of a second shift are those of men, material, and housing accommodation, but the Committee, as the results of its investigation, pointed out that all these difficulties may promptly be overcome. In its report the Committee state that "" it was ascertained, after evidence, that the factory has sufficient steel in hand to enable it to double its output for twelve months without exhausting its' supply. The Committee is also sanguine that f u r ther supplies will be available."" The clavise in the report stating this, which is the unanimous view of the Committee, is clear evidence that with the stocks on hand, and the stocks on the water, it would have been possible, for some time prior to the Committee's investigation, to institute a second shift. they been working one and a half shifts per day? that. evidence submitted, I am naturally suspicious at the present moment of the objections that have been put in the way of the institution of a second shift by the manager, Mr Wright. of the works state that the institution of a second shift would mean a reduced rather than an increased output for the first three months? were at present working a twelve-hours' shift per day, and that two shifts of eight hours would not mean an increased output. That statement on his part to the Public Works Committee was immediately followed by the evidence of the President of the Skilled Workers Union, Mr Cornwell, who told us that the men had intimated to the Department their willingness to institute a second s h if t; that they believed two shifts should be worked and two shifts, not of eight hours each, as suggested by the manager, but of twelve hours each. He went further, and said that, if necessary, in time of war the men were prepared to work for three Sundays out of four. This witness is one of the foremen of the tools branch The chief of the Factory, which is the most skilled department of labour in the whole establishment. He told us that there was no difficulty in the way of the immediate in stitution of a second s h if t; that if the necessary additional labour were provided, then, as a practical man, he would say that a second shift could be at once started, and that within a few weeks after they should be able to increase greatly the output of .the Factory. The Public Works Committee has unanimously recommended an increase to the extent of 70 per cent. A lot of the talk that has been indulged in regarding skilled labour in the Factory is, in my opinion, quite beside the mark. Captain Clarkson, who has investigated the manufacture of small arms all over the world, told the Public Works Committee that only a small percentage of skilled labour",15,Adjournment Formal Small Arms Factory Second Shift

At Lithgow we have half-a-dozen foremen and a similar number of section hands who, outside the tool branch, represent chiefly the skilled labour in the establishment, and, according to the sworn evidence of Mr Cornwell, the skilled workers in the factory aro prepared to heartily cooperate with their fellow-workmen, when a second shift is started, in making the new hands familiar with their duties. I hold that there was no possible excuse for any further investigation after the reports of the Public Works Committee and the Public Accounts Committee had been presented. have peremptorily directed the manager of the Factory to institute at once a second shift. hand, the residents of Lithgow had patriotically promised to house the additional hands required, the State Government offered the skilled labour, the co-operation of the skilled workers was assured, and a second shift should have been ordered by the Minister immediately upon the receipt of our reports. A want of driving power has been shown in the Department, and this is responsible for the delay of a month that has taken place, since the issue of our reports, in starting a second shift. I am glad that the management have at last been instructed by the Minister of Defence to start a second shift forthwith. Bnt something more than a mere instruction to the manager is necessary. outside business man of organizing capacity should be engaged to get into communication with the States Governments with the object of at once sending to the works the skilled labour necessary to provide for the second shift. If the provision of these additional skilled hands be dealt with in a purely departmental manner there will be further delay. therefore hope that the instruction given by the Minister to the Factory manager to start a second shift will be supplemented by the organization necessary to supply at once the additional skilled labour required, and that we shall hear very speedily that the machinery in the Factory, instead of running only two eight-hour shifts per day, as recommended by Mr Davis and the manager, will be set to work for the whole twenty-four hours per day.

But my information is that that limitation has actuallyexisted. The management, in additionto the Ministry, has been challenged. I would say now to Australians, as I have said on many other occasions, that they appear to attach a higher value to theability of others than they do to their own.

He spoke of an expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds on the establishment of testing laboratories, and I asked him to set down in writing what he proposed.

I do not think the output could be increased by the duplication of certain parts only, because all the machines we have are specially designed for this work, and are running a little below their normal capacity.

And I may add that there is some justification for a little added emphasis now, because this matter, which has been all too long delayed, is still being delayed. It seems to me that tliere is a sort of a curse on its progress. ago the second shift was to be initiated, but one difficulty after another has been raised to prevent anything definite being done. surprising. in the wav of the effective working of the Pactory is that Hie authorities are contemplating the removal of the Pactory to Canberra, and because of that possibility the Lithgow people hesitate about incurring expense in providing accommodation for the extra workmen. I am not prepared to say that Lithgow is the only place in Australia where a Small Arms Factory should be established, b u t I do say it is the best place, and that at this particular time it is the height of folly to introduce a debatable question of that sort, because it means thwarting the efforts of the Government to get the work done. say that the Government have seriously proposed the transfer to Canberra? HomeA f f a i r s Department, backed up by the manager, Mr Wright, is now stating that there is not room for the extension of I ho Factory so as to accommodate extra machinery, and that to acquire additional land would cost too much. W it h regard to the accommodation of the men, the The Factory Lithgow people are not eoing to lay out a lot of money in providinc houses when there is a possibility that, in a year or two, the Factory w ill be moved to some other place. However, the townspeople are willing to accommodate any extra workmen sent to Lithgow. The residents are We very patriotic, and any man who has a spare room in his house w ill make it available. That, however, is only a temporary arrangement; we cannot expect it to last long. Permanent accommodation must be provided. The honourable member for Wimmera has told the House how the manager's objections to the second shift gradually vanished as they were probed before the Works Committee. To my mind, it is the height of absurdity that this Factory has not been forced into working three shifts per day. We know that the material was in hand for at least # eight months' work, and if that work had been compressed into only two months, so much the better. No one can convince me that there are not enough men available to work the machines. An y trained Three or four weeks engineer requires only a design and a lathe, and he w ill produce the work.

Had that been done, we could have compressed the material for eight months' work into one month or two months, and supplied promptly an article that is badly needed. the plant is badly balanced. anced, three shifts would still give approximately treble the production of one shift. There has been a lamentable lack of initiative right through. There are machines available in Australia that could have supplemented the machinery at Lithgow. Factory, such as the forge hammer, which could do enough work for three factories, and other implements to augment the production by the other portions of the plant are to be had in the Commonwealth factories. All that was needed was an advertisement for machines suitable for this class of work. offered machinery at Randwick worth £70,000, and a large proportion of that could have been utilized for increasing the output of rifles. The objection as to the supplies of wood for rifle stocks is simply ludicrous. Any large firm engaged in the timber trade carries large stocks of seasoned timber which could have been utilized by the Small Arms Factory. I venture to say that the harvester manufacturers have in stock hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of wood which is three and four years old, and people engaged in manufacturing furniture and billiard-tables have also large stocks, which could be utilized by the Government. It seems to me that there is something almost treasonable taking place at Lithgow. As the right honourable member for Swan has said, the Minister should have been at Lithgow and set the factory going properly, and sent out of the way any man who was an impediment to the speeding-up of the establishment. A t a critical time like this, when the lack of munitions means a loss of valuable lives at the front, any drastic action would be justified. I have no patience with the delay that has taken place. cuses made to-day will not hold water. I have always taken that view.

All men,, whether holders of stocks or possessors of trained ability, ought to have been calledfrom all quarters of Australia' to help the Government in making the Factory efficient. moments ago the Prime Minister informed the House that the scarcity of steel was a reason for the delay in starting the second shift. Does the right honorable gentleman know that 1,000 tons of steel would be sufficient to keep the Factory going for twelve months?

These references I intend to quote, in order to show to the House that there is some need for a -change in the representation of the Public Service Commissioner before the Arbitration Court. I want to say at once that Mr Skewes is personally unknown to me, and perhaps it is not altogether fair to -condemn him without hearing his side of the case. I do not want to be unjust. Rather would I be scrupulously fair to this gentleman, but if the statements that have been attributed to him, and that have been submitted to me in a perfectly genuine way, were made by Mr Skewes regarding the conduct of letter carriers generally, then he is a man who should be -called upon for an immediate explanation, and a man whose position in connection with Arbitration Court work should be very seriously considered by the Government. Justice Powers dealt with him? here. The first statement of which I complain appears on page 1433 of the notes of Court proceedings, where Mr Skewes is reported to have said-< Whilst we have honest, hard-working men in the ranks of the letter carriers, we have also far too great a proportion of men whose eonsciences arc fairly elastic, and who do not scruple to rob the Government of valuable time. That statement would be quite right if Mr Skewes could back it up with evidence, but he did not back it up at all. He simply made the bald assertion. Mr Justice Powers, who was conducting the Arbitration Court, immediately pointed out that there was no evidence to support that he was expressing the opinion of the his own opinion. Further on Mr Skewes used these wordsWe go further than suspect it , because we know it . 1 want to enter a plea on behalf of the Letter Carriers Association-o n behalf of During tbe conduct of the the men who have to deliver our letters in the cities and in every part of Australiain connection with Arbitration Court work. When put to the test, Mr Skewes could not substantiate the charge. He finally pointed out that there were only 2 per cent, of the members of the claimant organization who had been guilty of any of a number of stated offences, very few of which are, I think, of a serious nature. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. some extracts from the minutes of the Court in order to substantiate some statements which I intend later on to make to the Committee. In the first instance, Mr Skewes made against the letter carriers the general charge of wasting time and robbing the Government; but, when pressed for specific details, he said that Iiis statement applied to from 5 to 10 per cent, of the men. In response to further questions put to him by Mr Justice Powers he said that in the course of three years 100 charges had been made against letter carriers. I do not think I can do better than read His Honour's observations concerning Mr Skewes' statementsee how Mr Whati t really amounted to was that thirty-' three to thirty-four out of 1,700 letter carriers each year had been found guilty of somo of the offences mentioned.

Here we have what honourable members opposite designate as "" Pat"" being assisted while wholly different treatment is meted out to the small man. In reply to a question I put to the Postmaster-General as to the number of mail contractors in New South ""Wales adversely affected by the curnot occurring under a Labour Ministry? tailment of the railway service in that State, I was officially informed that the report was that there were only nine. That surely must be incorrect. I am not exaggerating when I say that there are more than nine mail contractors in my own electorate who have been adversely affected in this way. In what direction are these men adversely affected? I have before ine a letter addressed to the Postal Department by one of the subsidiary mail contractors operating from a branch railway line, and the oflicial reply thereto. This man had entered into a contract some time prior to the curtailment of the railway service, under which he was tp be paid £175 per annum. On the railway service being curtailed he was officially notified that his subsidy would be reduced to £87 10s. Is the small mail contractor to have his subsidy cut down, while the monopolist mail contractor-the Railway Department-secure s an increased payment for a decreased service ? I am aware that the explanation given is that the increased payment is due to the opening of new lines. I find, however, that the Railway Department is paid upon a mileage basis, and the reduction of a daily service on branch lines to one qf three days a week cannot be more than compensated for by the opening of new lines. Very few new lines have been opened in New South Wales since these curtailed services were entered upon. I ask the Postmaster General to re-consider the whole position. able member suggest we should get the extra money ? concession, it should be made to the little, reduced from £175 to £87 10s. ? and not to the big, man. would increase the amounts paid to mail contractors outside the Railway Departments of the States because they have to pay an increased price for chaff. man shall at least be treated as well as the big contractor. The Railway Department of New South Wales is receiving an increased subsidy compared with the amount paid in 1913, although it has curtailed its time-table, whereas the small mail contractors are having their subsidies reduced. I am appealing to the Postmaster-General. These small mail contractors had to enter into contracts for the supply of fodder for their horses at the different changing stations. They had to look ahead, but they never anticipated the extraordinary climatic conditions with which they have recently been faced. Their arrangements were such that they could not violate these contracts with any honour; and yet we find that, because tlie trains do not run into the stations the same number of times each week that they used to do, the original subsidy is cut down by nearly half. These men have their own contracts to fulfil in the face of very adverse climatic conditions, and they have only half what they used to have to meet their engagements. It does not follow that because the trains along these branch lines only run three days a week, the volume of mail matter to be carried is lessened; it only means that they have to take two days' mails in the coach, thus adding to their trouble. More room is taken up, and the passenger space curtailed, and it was from the passenger traffic that they had hopes of making some revenue. With all these cases before me, I seriously question the replies I have received from the Department, to tbe effect that the curtailment of the railwav facilities in New South Wales affects adversely only nine mail contractors. speaking of the number affected; they are not all adversely affected.

We must recognise that the present charges are not sufficient. On telegraphs there is a loss of £ 1 5 1 , 4 4 6; and I think ment is very poorly compensated. that the present reasonable charges could very well bear a little increase. A person at Albury is charged ls. to send a telegram to Wodonga, while exactly the same message could be sent from Wodonga to Wallangarra, at the extreme end of New South Wales, or to Tweed Heads, for 9d. In my opinion there should be a uniform charge from one end of Australia to the other, except in the case of suburban areas. at uniformity-by reducing or increasing ? charges in view of the loss of over £150,000 a year; and tlie loss on the telephone service should not be forgotten. There are many other services rendered by the Post Office at too cheap a rate. Catalogues of every description can be sent through the post at very small cost, and this imposes a vast amount of work in the way of handling packages at every office throughout the Commonwealth. My suggestion is that the postage for catalogues should be brought up to the ordinary postage rate. tions are of very little use to the majority of people; and I do not think that the business houses who desire to reach prospective customers would have any objection to pay increased charges. is a matter that will have to be faced and decided. We have also to remember that big advertisers throughout the Commonwealth take advantage of the cheap rates, and give the postal officials much additional work that could well be avoided. There are some business houses who do the great bulk of their business through the Post Office; for instance, patent medicine dealers probably transact three-fourths of their business in this way. of newspapers might well be reviewed. Past Postmasters-General have been desirous of being in favour with the newspapers, and I understand that that was one of tlie main reasons why in the earlier history of Australia such big concessions were given to the newspapers. Honourable members opposite complain bitterly about the treatment of the mail contractors by the Postmaster-General, but they must not forget that much of the work of the mail contractors is caused by the heavy loads of newspapers which they are obliged to carry into the country districts. For that service the DepartThe newspapers in tlie capital cities of the Commonwealth are those which impose the heaviest tax on the Government service for the carriage of newspapers. Nodoubt the people in the outback districts are desirous of getting the latest information, but as the metropolitan newspapers are probably the greatest profit-earning businesses in the Commonwealth, they could afford to pay a greater charge than is levied at present. Many reforms are possible which would help to make the Post Office a paying concern. Whilst we I should increase the have no desire that the postal services shall show a profit, we certainly are anxious to terminate the losses which occur from year to year.

The subject of press telegrams also requires immediate attention. The Melbourne correspondent of a country newspaper may lodge a telegram to be sent to any part of tbe State,, but if it arrives too late to be delivered it is returned to the sender, and no charge is levied except a fee for informing the sender of the non-delivery. The telegram may have been one of 9,000 words, and the only return the Department gets from the handling of it may be 9d. I do not Then the charges for the postage think that there was any intention that the Department should conduct its business on those lines. The annual loss of £151,000 on the telegraphic branch is not surprising when we know that somuch time is occupied in the transmission of messages of this kind for which the Department receives no return.

The salary offered to the imported man is about £480 per My year, and that of the Australian artisan is only about £250 per annum. Tlio advent of imported men creates dissatisI faction amongst the Australians in the Department because tliey feel that they have not been given an opportunity of rising to higher positions.

The honourable member said nothing about increasing the charges to be paid by those who live in the cities; it is the people in the country who are to boar the burden. telephone rates should be increased. member for Oxley did not mention the telephone rates. would support an increase in the telephone charges. made by the honourable member would increase the charges to be borne by the people living in the country. He did not say that we should give up penny postage, but he appeared to be in favour of increasing the postage. Such a course would considerably affect those who live in the country, and we should again be in the strange position of having a penny postage to Great Britain and all the countries that are within the postal union, and twopenny postage internally. Some years ago we were in that position in Vic'toria, and I remember that a country newspaper then drew attention to the fact that a letter could be sent from a certain town to London, half across the world, for one penny, while it cost twopence to send it to the next town, only 13 miles away. Any charge in telegraph rates would also greatly affect the people in the country. A city man does not require to use the telegraph to send a message; he can use a messenger, and were the postage increased, many letters would be sent by messenger. That happened in Victoria on a former occasion, when the postThe Government should age was increased from, one penny to twopence. The number of letters sent through the post at once decreased considerably. The people in the cities do not use the telegraphs to the same extent as do the people in the country. The honourable member for Melbourne says that our telegraph service is the cheapest in the world, and. so it is if you pay only the ordinary rates, though some different arrangement should be made in respect of border towns. As a matter of practice, however, our telegraph service is one of the dearest in the world.

315,Mr Manifold,"I know that a conof the Post Office. As to the telephones, is it proposed to curtail the facilities given? Is it to be made harder for the people in the back-blocks to obtain telephone connection? We should be more liberal than we are now in providing telephone communication in the country, notwithstanding that the Department is a"" losing concern. able member make good the loss ? as we do now. Those in the country should not be put in a more difficult position than they now occupy. They should be able to telephone for a doctor in cases of illness. In the interests of development, our country telephone system should be extended. As to the town telephones, one cannot use them without being driven nearly frantic. Those in this building are enough to drive one crazy. No man could attempt to send two or three consecutive messages by telephone without being driven nearly off his head, and if merchants use the telephones as much as it is sai d they do, they must employ others to despatch and receive the messages. I do not think that they would object to pay higher rates for a better service. The other day, with a deputation, I waited upon the Deputy Postmaster-General for Victoria in regard to a telephone line which has a length of 18 miles. The local residents had put up the line, but it had gone out of use. The Department had obtained all the revenue that had been derived from the line, and the»deputation came to Melbourne to see what was proposed to be done about it. They were told to put up the line again, and the Department would be glad to manipulate the service. Greater telephone facilities than are given now should be extended to the people in the country. The honourable member for Oxley spoke of increasing the postage on newspapers, but it is the man out-back who pays that postage. The newspaper offices do not pay it. able member get the additional revenue necessary for his proposals? as we get it now; certainly not at the -expense of the people living in the country. According to the honourable member, the postage oh newspapers is low, because the various Postmasters-General [161] have courted popularity; but, prior to Federation, newspapers in New South Wales were carried free of postage, and the present rate is a kind of compromise. ber advocate free carriage of newspapers ? what I consider to be a fair thing. I say, do not put the cost of these services on the men in the country. Most of the working men in the country take a newspaper, and have to pay the postage on it . I ask the Postmaster-General whether the mail contractors are going to get any satisfaction. Does he or does he not intend to give them relief? of the promise will do some of them little good unless it comes soon. justed. sent in claims a month ago, and have received forms to be filled in with the price paid for chaff at the present time and the price paid twelve months ago. These forms have to be returned to the Department within twenty-four hours. In a case whicli came under my notice, the contractor, who is only a working man, though he has a fairly big contract, said, "" I know that I am paying £15 per ton for chaff now, but I could not tell, offhand, what I was paying twelve months ago, and I have put down the price from memory, at £5 per ton."" The Postal Department, having received this information, referred the matter to the local grain merchant, which was a proper, business like procedure, and was informed that the price twelve months ago was £3. forms that the returns must be made within twenty-four hours. that his return had to be sent back within twenty-four hours. I do not know why the Postal Department asks for the information to be supplied so quickly. Will the Department take twenty-four months or tweny-four years to grant relief, which must be of less value after every day's delay? Had these meu obtained consideration when they applied for it , they could have bought chaff for £8 or £9 per ton, but now it is £15 per ton, and in some cases unobtainable. Surely each application could be dealt",31,Estimates 1914 15

The mail contractors ought to be able to receive the relief that is due to them without having to wait any time at a l l . Honourable members may not have any idea of how long it takes to get money out of a Department. at least six months, and usually a person is lucky if he can get it w it h in six months. Such a delay is of no use whatever in the relief of these mail contractors. as waiting for six months. had been given that the money shall be paid straight away. the statement of the Postmaster-General -that as soon as the Department is satisfied that a claim is genuine, the money w ill be paid at once. six months as from 1st January last, in a lump sum, when the claim is made out. mail contractors in my district, many cf whom have approached me, that as soon aa they establish their claims; they will receive their money. But the honourable member for Calare has information on this subject which seems to suggest that these claims are not being properly settled. tion of new. telephone lines, I have endeavoured to discover why lines that have been sanctioned are not constructed. We were told, in the first instance, that there was a shortage of material. That is not so. Now we are told that, though material and money is available, the Department cannot obtain men. Surely, in a Department like this, where gangs of men are out erecting telephone lines in all parts of the country, it is not necessary to keep one gang with one ganger at the head for ever. The man who is second in command must surely develop and become fit to take a position as ganger. What is going to. happen to the Department if it cannot get fresh "" bosses,"" or whatever you like to call them, when the present men die? A r e they going to shut up? If a man who has been second in command for two or three years is not then fit to be promoted to the position of ganger, he has no right to be even second in command. There are hundreds of men capable of erecting these lines under proper supervision, and surely the Department should have no difficulty in finding men competent to take charge. When dealing with this question, the honourable member for Swan said that if more straightforward answers could be obtained in the House regarding In a great many cases, it takes the postal service, it would be more satisfactory to ' a l l concerned. I agree with the honourable member. May I quote a case which came under my own notice. Application was made for a trunk line from Warrnambool to Allansford. The engineer reported that the line was absoAuthority lutely necessary, because the Railway Department had declined to permit any more wires to be attached to their poles. Yet the Deputy Postmaster-General reI am glad to hear fused to sanction the line, and no explanation at all was given unti l after the expiration of eighteen months, when tlie parties interested were informed that the Department was going to construct the line. W h y could we not have been informed eighteen months ago that the line would be constructed as soon as posI shall inform the sible: that is, as soon as money and material were available? An answer setting out the facts would have relieved residents in that district of much correspondence, and it would have saved me. as member, a good deal of trouble, whilst there would have been a much better understanding all round. I hope, howW it h regard to the construcever, that the Postmaster-General will look seriously into this question of sending out more gangs of men. There are in my own district any number of men out of work, and I do not think the Denartment would have any difficulty in getting all the expert gangers they desire. agree to a certain extent with what the honourable member for Oxley said with regard to the management of the Post Office, but while I desire to say one or two things about the Department in connection with matters that deserve early rectification, I want to say also that it is altogether unfair to lay all the blame at the door of the Postmaster-General, no matter what the party to which he is attached, or at the door of the Deputy Postmasters-General.

357,Mr Parkermoloney,"T h a t ismember for Corangamite has said, but with their markets and, in short, with civilization. The Postmaster-General has admitted that the losses incurred in connection with the telephone service relate to the city exchanges, and I maintain that something should be done to lighten the burdens of the people who are struggling in the country, and doing more than their fair share to provide for the cost of government. These men, who have to bear the heat and burden of the day, should not. be asked to shoulder even one-half the estimated deficiency on a contemplated telephone line, as is required of them to-day. The honourable member for Darwin has said that in the United States of America every householder has a telephone. was that there an application to be connected with a telephone exchange is granted within three days. be a good thing if telephone facilities could be extended to every member of the community. business, and consequently augment the revenue. Another point that I wish l o make is that the method of arriving at an estimate of the revenue to be derived from these services is entirely wrong. It is impossible to gauge what revenue will be produced by calculating on a percentage of the number of outgoing letters. The Department should take into account the fact that population follows the granting of these increased facilities, and that with an additional population there must be additional revenue. I come now to the position of the mail contractors, to which reference has been made by the honourable member for Hume. If the Postmaster-General does not expedite the distribution of the £50,000 which has been set aside to grant relief to these men, it w ill not be worth £30,000 to them.

It would increase Here is the statement which Mr Skewes madeThroughout the hearing of this case we have refrained from making any pointed reference to the efficiency of the employees who are claiming higher rates. The largest class is the letter-carrying class, and we do not hesitate to say that the average efficiency of these employees is far below what is justified by even existing rates of pay. While we have honest, hard-working men in the ranks of the letter carriers, we have also by far too great a proportion of men whoso consciences are fairly elastic, and who do nnt scruple to rob the Grovernment of valuable time. Thab was a drastic statement to make, and, in my opinion, it was deliberately put forward to prejudice the claims cf these men.

I have read a good deal more evidence connected with this case than has the honourable member. orable members to assist me in the performance of my duties, by at once ceasing interjections. principle, and ought to be applied all round; we must be just to a man who is not able to present his own case. the men. mitted to speak, I might as well resume my seat. The question raised in the remark of Mr Skewes was not one for the Court. It was not for the Court to say whether or not these men were all perfect angels, doing their work with perfect honesty; the only question for His Honour related to the pay and the conditions of the men'. It is the duty of the Department, and not of the Court, to see that the men give an honest return for the wages they receive. tunate that a remark of the kind was made; but, from my information, I think that the object in making it has been rather misunderstood. It was quite natural, of course, that the men should resent such a statement; b u t I think that Mr. Skewes expected the Judge, in giving an award, to suggest that now that fair conditions had been granted, honest service would be expected in return. Suggestions of that kind have been made by other judges-suggestion s that both sfdes should honorably and loyally observe an award. said that these men were robbing the Commonwealth. haps, unfortunate in the way he presented the case. chance. member have patience for a moment?

Mr Skewes is not able to tell us himself the reasons that prompted h i m to make the remark, and, while I am not saying that it was a wise one to make, too much importance has been attached to it . The ground that Mr. Skewes had was evidence of cases in tha Department of the Public Service Commissioner. any time ever reported malingering by these men? number of such cases. But surely honourable members realize that in any large body of men, in any occupation anywhere, there must be some who are not doing quite the right thing ; and to say so is no reflection on anybody. A number of cases have been reported in the Department, and have been dealt w it h ; and, as I said before, the fact that only It was unforone case went to a Board loses its significance when we remember that admitted charges are not inquired into in that way.",37,Moloney The Y Cation For A Telephone Line Is Settled With

When the noise was made, the Judge adjourned the Court, and asked the Postmaster-General and Public Service Commissioner if they supported the statement of Mr Skewes. My reply was that I knew nothing of the case, except what had appeared in evidence. The Commissioner said he was prepared to prove the charge, and that he had evidence in his office of the percentage of the cases. not produced? tbe business of the Court to deal w it h such evidence.

The motive of Mr Skewes was an honest one, though, as I have said more than once, the remark may have been very unwise. ' Mr Skewes was in a difficult position. He appeared before the Court as the representative of the Public Service Commissioner, who previously had fixed wages and conditions, and he had to p u t forward the best case possible for the Commissioner. It was unfortunate that this trouble should have cropped up at all in the case; b u t much more has been made 'out of the incident than is justified. have been asked by the organization to dismiss Mr Skewes from the Service; b u t I do not intend to take any such action. The Judge stated his view, and I agree with h i m that there is no occasion to complain at all. I am satisfied that good honest work is being done by letter carriers, and there is not an undue percentage of unsatisfactory cases. The records of the Department show that a considerable number of cases have been dealt with under section 46 for varying offences.

The new accountancy system has worked very well, and has been of great assistance in in creasing the efficiency of the Department. We are now able to get comparisons and tests of efficiency which were not obtainable before. The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Premantle have suggested that the Post Office'should be placed under the control of a Commission.

Honourable members interjecting, The CHAIBMAN I regret that I have again to appeal to honourable members to maintain silence. Our Standing Orders provide that only one honourable member shall speak at a time; but several honourable members are trying to speak at once, so tliat it is impossible for even the Chair to hear what is being said by the Minister. I ask honourable members to assist the Chairi n maintaining order; if they do not, they will force me to take action. Department of specific instances of in efficiency are of very great value, and are welcomed, because they enable us to deal with any oflicer who is to blame. A statement has been made that a number of people send urgent telegrams because the ordinary telegram is not delivered quickly enough. Tests have been made in the Department to ascertain whether there is any avoidable delay. The time of lodging a message and of its receipt at the other end of the line are taken, and those tests have not shown that any unreasonable delay takes place. like that? am not talking at random.

440,Mr Spence,"No. But I say that in that immense number were not delayed. The percentage of delays is dimcult to arrive at; but, as I have stated, a check on the system is made from time to time. The new system of clearing centres which is being inaugurated will do much to minimize delay. Instead of every little office, with perhaps a slow operator, tapping the main trunk line and blocking business, the telegrams are collected at certain centres, where they are handled by a quick operator. In one case it was discovered; tliat work which had previously occupied one and a half hours to clear was done in half-an-hour, and 80 per cent, of it in fifteen minutes. By this means a greater amount of work can be done on the trunk line, and there is greater promptitude in the delivery of messages. will see that improvements are being effected. deal about the inefficiency of the Department, we never hear a word about the inefficiency of the public. Last year, 4,362 letters were posted, whose envelopes had no address at all, and of these 132 contained over £514 in value. Between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 letters containing over £84,000 in value went to the Dead Letter Office,' but we managed io deliver 2,000,000 of these. Over 800,000,000 articles go"" through the post every year, about half of them being letters and postcards, and only about one letter in 121,000 is not delivered. show that losses, delays, and non-delivery of letters are not wholly the fault of the Department, I might mention that, after it had been stated in one of the newspapers that letters were being stolen by some person employed at the General Post Office, and public attention had been drawn to the fact that private letter-boxes were often left unfastened, the authorities found that between 5th May and 5th June, twenty-four firms left their keys in the locks of tlieir private letter-boxes, so that any member of the public could obtain access to the letters in these boxes, and twenty-seven left their boxes open. The boxes thus left unfastened were boxes rented by some of the largest firms in Melbourne. When letters are reported missing, nothing is said of the neglect of the public; the blame is always put on the Department. There are, however, two sides to every question, and all the blame for failure to deliver letters is not properly attributed to the Post Office. As Mr Spence. to our contract with the Railways Commissioners of the States, we have the same agreement with them all, and it is one that was made some eight years ago, though it is now proposed to make a new agreement. The arrangement is that the charge to be made for the carriage of letters is to be the same whether a service is reduced or increased, the charge being fixed according to the weight carried, and the distance for which it has to be transported. This operates rather in favour of the Department, because, although on some lines the service has been temporarily reduced on account of the drought, the tendency is to increase services, and our contract will extend over a long term of years. As to telephone construction, as a country representative, I shall do my best I think honourable members to help those in the country districts. Very large losses have been incurred in Although we hear a great connection with the telephone service, which increases in expense as the number of connexions with an exchange increases. This increase is of great advantage to the busi-' ness people who are connected with the telephone. In Sydney, there are twenty-nine exchanges having 35,000 subscribers, with all of whom any Sydney subscriber can have conversation, and do business, and it is ridiculous that so little should be charged for the service given. The United States of America are sometimes referred to as an example of what we To should do in telephone matters, but, according to John Lee, M.A., who has written a book on the Economics of Telegraphs and Telephones, America is very much behind in regard to country village installations; and I think that, in some of these matters we can give them points. The Department is steadily trying to remedy the defects which are discovered in its work. Further decentralization is aimed at, and tlie clear limitation of responsibiUty. Officers are to be given authority within defined lines, and when that is done, we shall' be better able to test their efficiency and ability. We are also striving for uniformity in several directions, and trying to abolish dual control. As to new telephone and telegraph charges, I shall deal with them when the next set of Estimates is before Parliament. I hope to receive shortly a report from the gentleman who has been investigating the whole administration of the Department. I desire to make only one other observation, and it is in connection w i th the Telephone PurchaseB ill , which w i ll be discharged very shortly. In order to avoid litigation, the matter was put into the hands of Mr. Anderson, -who, I am glad to state, has been able to make an arrangement with about 150 persons who were concerned, so that there will now be no necessity to resort to legal process. exercised the utmost judgment and tact, and I think it is to his credit that, in a big thing like this, he was so successful.
