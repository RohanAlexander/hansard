It did Let me just take one by one some of the things from the Government. As soon as it became the Attorney-General said and try to put them apparent to the mind of the Attorney-General into order, because it is very hard to fit the that there was a misunderstanding, what should Attorney-General's thoughts into any order at he have done? He should immediately have corrected it. How could he possibly view the mornall. He said that there were issues in the confidential report-the report that we cannot refer ing's headlines and the editorials without understanding that, on his present story, there to-that would naturally be of concern to the was a gigantic misunderstanding as to what was Government. He asked: What other issues are going to happen. For example, the Australian there? Since he has posed that question, let me give him an answer. He may recall that the devoted an editorial to it, headlined 'Court acts where Government failed'. The headline in the Director of Public Prosecutions made a decision Age stated: 'High Court to judge Murphy'. Could this week. The Attorney-General would have read about it if he was not advised of it. That anything be clearer? There could be no clearer misapprehension than that on the basis of what decision was not to proceed with a fresh charge against His Honour Mr Justice Murphy. In that the Attorney-General tells us is the present situation. I go on to what Mr Gregory Hywood decision the Director of Public Prosecutions made had to say in the Australian Financial Review, it plain that he was not going to follow written in a front page article headed 'Murphy to be advice of senior and junior counsel to the effect judged by his peers'. The article opens with these that a fresh charge should be laid against His words: Honour Mr Justice Murphy. In the face of Justice Murphy's decision not to resign, I put these questions to the Attorney-General: despite qualms over his return to the Bench by his Does the Attorney-General really say that that peers, the High Court has decided to judge him itself. was a matter of no consequence? Does he really say that that is not another issue that needs to Is that not incontrovertibly plain? Was it not be examined? Does he suggest that that is not plain to the Attorney-General that there was an something that would not occasion concern? Does extraordinarily damaging and unprecedented he think that it is possible, that it is conceivable, misapprehension in the minds of the public and for His Honour to resume his position on the in the minds of the media as to the course that Court without any doubts whatsoever arising out the Court was taking and as to the role that the of that joint opinion?

Only Justice Murphy will be allowed to go back on when a statement was issued by the Chief Justice to the High Court Bench with that matter hangof the High Court did he do anything. ing over his head. Let me say lastly, in relation to some of the How could the Attorney-General possibly think specific points that the Attorney-General raised that there is nothing that needs to be considabout the High Court, that he put the High ered? He asked: 'On what basis have they moved Court in a position, as it were, of resolving the the censure motion?'. The answer is that if the matter. Let me be perfectly plain: The Court Attorney-General wanted to and was willing to has offered no direction to this Government. It make a decision he would understand very clearly cannot give a direction to this Government. It is that the High Court cannot make a decision.
