By this casual way of which arise out of this very Bill and the situation saying that there was just an 'omission' from the that arose in March when the Bill was presented previous Bill, the Attorney-General has added to the Parliament to make the initial amendments more questions to the growing list of questions to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. about law enforcement in this country and he has Let me mention three of the questions which added to the lack of confidence that the public emerge from the Bill and the environment that now has in his performance and the Governexisted when the Bill was promoted in March. ment's performance. The first question arises in this way. The Mr N. A.

Do we have to go hunting Mr Robert Brown-Of course it is. for them and drawing them out as though we were Mr N. A. BROWN-So let us look at some of drawing teeth? Why is the Parliament not shown the evidence. I ask a Government back bencher, these terms of reference?

If so, we are entitled to know about Commission? it. When I say 'we', I do not mean simply Opposition members; I mean the House as a whole. The The second question relates to the indemnities. Attorney-General simply cannot bury this matter Part of the Governmentjs terms of surrender on or wave it away as if it is something that will just 28 March, when it gave up the fight on this issue, go away. So that is the second question that arises when it was seen that its case was utterly threadout of the legislation before us. bare and indefensible, was· that it would give indemnities to the New South Wales police whose The third question is: What about illegal phone evidence was required to prove the making of the tapping in the future? The Attorney-General said illegal tapes. Those police officers were given 28 in his speech on 28 March that there would be no days to come forward to the Royal Commission protection for illegal phone tapping by police in and give their evidence. The Attorney-General the future. He said that it was to be limited as made it quite clear on that day that there were 28 from that day. I think that he was right in saying days in which the police officers had, in effect, to that. He must have been right. The Attorneyput up or shut up. The way he put it, in his own General said that we would not be countenancing words, was as follows: any further interception merely because the Bill was being introduced on 28 March. He made it I make the point that we would expect all police officers quite clear that the Government was drawing the concerned to come before the Commission within 28 days line at 28 March. In effect, he was saying to police from this date. We see no reason for any longer period. officers in New South Wales: 'Do not come running to us about indemnities for illegal phone tapMr Robert Brown-Hear, hear! ping In which you engage after this date, because from this date the grille comes down'. In my Mr N. A. BROWN-The honourable member speech on 28 MarchI pointed out that the Bill did says 'Hear, hear!', and, with respect, I agree with not say that at all. I pointed out that the Bill rehim to that extent. They should have been ferred to 'unlawful interception whether before or required to act. But if words mean anything at all, a,fter the commencement of this section'. The the statement by the Attorney-General means Attorney-General responded by saying that he that the police officers had 28 days from 28 March conceded the point; he described it as a good to come forward. We ask: Have they done so? point. But he said that it was to be controlled in Will the Attorney-General leave this matter of the new letters patent of the Stewart Royal Comenormous public significance up in the air and mission. That is another reason why we are ennever tell us what has happened? Have they come titled to see the new letters patent of the Stewart forward? Have they asked for indemnities? Have Royal Commission. If those letters patent, by imthey made available evidence going to the root of plication or expressly, give a blank cheque to organised crime in this country?

Have the police accepted the terms of the indemnities with the But the point, for the purposes of the present gloss that Senator Gareth Evans put on the debate, is that we are entitled to an explanation indemnities, which was a gloss to the effect that and as yet we have not had an explanation. Where they could actually be revoked, believe it or not, are the letters patent? When can we debate their after the policemen had given evidence that he adequacy? In any event, now that the Act is back had engaged in illegal phone tapping? That is the before us tonight, why can we not amend it in the indemnity that Senator Gareth Evans was holding way that the Attorney-General conceded that it out to the police when he was speaking on that would have to be amended? Why do we not do subject in the Senate. that? Is this another omission? Will legislation be back here again next week, or perhaps in August, They would be very brave souls indeed if they for us to debate another amendment to this Act? I had accepted such an indemnity. But all that we hope not, but I have my suspicions because the want to know is whether they have accepted the whole thing has been dealt with in such a sloppy way that I doubt whether the Government, even our moving an amendment to the second reading at this late stage, has got it right. motion. Of course, the Bill will remain intact. Let The most pressing question comes from the there be no doubt about this proposition. The Opsame point that I have been making: What has position's position is simply and clearly that the happened to the Government's undertaking to Bill should be given a second reading but, at the give phone tapping powers to the State Police in same time, the Government should say by its vote narcotics cases? WhaJ has happened to that on the amendment whether the Government still power? Of course, on 2 April, after the drug sumadheres to the view expressed as recently as 2 mit, the Prime Minister Mr Hawke got up on his April that the power to intercept telephone calls high horse. He was quite specific. He said: 'Look should be given to State police forces in narcotics at the amazing things that we are going to do to cases. It was a clear commitment. We want to stamp out the traffic in narcotics in this country'. know whether it is the Government's position as He said that we would have a uniform national of today. drug law and this and that. One of the things he The Government has a tattered record on this said was that the essential phone tapping powers whole matter. At least it can redeem part of its in narcotics cases would be given to the State reputation by supporting the amendment which Police. There was no qualification about that. Yet will enable it to keep its Bill intact and yet add to we hear rumours up and down the corridors of the it a firm expression of view on legalising phone Parliament that the Government cannot carry out tapping by State police in narcotics cases and subthis commitment. It cannot get approval through ject to safeguards. We will see the colour of the its own Party. It has been abandoned. The left Government's money later tonight and we will see wing has had another victory. Whether the left how much of a deep and serious commitment it wing has had a victory or not, the Prime Minister really has to the fight against organised crime. has been rebuffed yet again. But there is a simple way of testing this and I will outline the testI conclude by saying what I have said in a different form during my remarks tonight. These are House with rumours. They are matters that should have the utmost priMr N. A. BROWN-The Minister says that it ority given to them by the Government and paris a rumour. In that case, the Minister will have no ticularly by the Attorney-General.

Whilst it is true that some unfair, in a sense, that criticism offered by the Oppeople can suggest that section 19 of the National position was not really justified. I point out to the Crime Authority Act may allow the National Minister and to the chamber that in fact it was Crime Authority to do what the amendment prounder the previous Fraser Government that a poses, I was surprised that the Special Minister of National Crimes Commission was established. It State( Mr Young) did not mention section 17, bewas in place and its powers were set out.

The fact of the matter is that it is not which was in place in the latter stages of the clear, and it would seem to me to add to the status Fraser Government. So do not for a moment let it of the National Crime Authority to put this issue be suggested that the Fraser Government was not beyond all doubt if this very simple amendment acting on the evidence that had been revealed not could be agreed to. I fail to see why we have to go only by the Costigan Royal Commission on the through this process of legal boffins trying to make Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and a decision as to whether or not this authority is Dockers Union but by a whole series of other contained within section 19 of the Act.

The point at issue is that the Authority really clarified, because, whilst it is true to say that Austhe Government's view, for a commission which tralian police forces do have contacts with overwas in place and which was designed to do the job seas police forces, I do not think it can be argued this Authority is designed to do to be scrapped imthat the police can speak at the same level as, for mediately?
