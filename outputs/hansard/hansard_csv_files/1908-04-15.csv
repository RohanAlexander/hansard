The results to the Treasury are not such as are shown in the statement of the honourable member. 2. No drawback of duty has been claimed on excise sugar, and, therefore, the loss shown in the statement, referred to has not been realized. 3. I do not consider that any such position has arisen. 4. The authority for the' payment of bounty is provided for in the Constitution Act. General, upon noticeWhether he will instruct the Cabinet Committee recently appointed to inquire into the working of the Postal Department, to inquire into the feasibility of granting to country towns, where a continuous telephone service is not warranted, an extended service of, say, 16 hours per day, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., in such towns as return sufficient revenue to warrant such facilities being granted? Cabinet Committee will be instructed to bring forward the matter in question for consideration by the Committee. MrM c DOUGALL asked the Minister of Defence, upon notice1. Whether it is a fact that Major-General Hoad, in his report as Inspector-General, stated it was a mistake to take the Militia Garrison Artillery away from the Western District coast of Victoria? a. If it is true, will the Minister take immediate steps to re-establish the Militia Garrison Artillery in the district named by the Inspector General? orable member's questions are as follow : t and 2. Yes. In 1904 the Militia Garrison Artillery at Warrnambool and Port, Fairy was converted into a Field Battery. was armed with four 40-pounder R.B.L. guns pending the arrival of carriages for the ,4.7-in. Q.F. guns with which it was proposed to equip the battery. These carriages are now available, and the battery will shortly be equipped with comparatively up-to-date 4.7-in. Q.F. ' guns. These guns will be available not only for service with the Field. Force, but also for garrison defence.' It is considered that 4.7-in. Q.F. guns compare very favourably with any fixed defences which could,' at present; be provided at these places. The answers to SUPPLY (Formal).

Thursday, night-and think so still. On Thursday night, the suggestions made by the Senate in regard to the Tariff had not been placed in my colleague's hands from his officers, and have only been under his consideration since that time.

There has been no postponement. , If honourable members will look at the number-severa l hundreds-of suggestions which have been made, and recognise what their complete classification and consideration means, I.think that they will agree with me that remarkable expedition is being displayed in dealing with them, if we are prepared to take them in hand, as we Speaking for this House as a whole,' we have, 1 believe, an immediate duty in that regard, which has claims prior to any other claims that can .be urged upon us-no t that this comprises by any means the whole programme of this Parliament or of this Government, nor that it is the only obligation, for there are many, more. is to deal with tlie motion' of the honourable member for Gwydir, which we are week for the purpose of disposing of the now considering.' fidence to him as well as to the House that.

It is only from motives of our own, and in accordance with our own policy, that we feel obliged to treat it as hostile. But that is of our own choice.

I , therefore, content myself by saying that' in repeating what lie had already said when . interviewed by representatives of .the press, the Prime Minister has, this afternoon, made some statements'which are absolutely incorrect, and for which there is not a tittle of justification. What happened on Thursday afternoon? Honourable members are aware that the honourable member for Gwydir was anxious to discuss the question of an inquiry into the condition of the Post and Telegraph Department, but the moment the House met the Prime Minister, with an acrobatic swiftness which has never been equalled here, jumped in . ahead of the honourable member with an amendment declaring that the consideration of that question should be postponed until the following day, knowing, when he did so, that the question could not be discussed on the morrow. I know that now. as we now know that he took the course he didin order to prevent the honourable member for Gwydir going on with his motion at all member with his motion. There were three. first thing that happened ? I took a point of order that the question could not be debated on the morrow, and asked you, Mr Speaker, for your ruling.

Before the amendment was withdrawn, I objected to it, and for the reason t-hat I was drafting at the table an amendment providing that the -honourable member for Gwydir's motion in relation to' the condition of the Post and Telegraph Department should come on for discussion on the day after the decision of the House had been taken on -the Federal Capital Site, question^ It was only when the Prime Minister, watching me drafting the-amendment, 'arid watching me hand it to my chief ' member?

Point by point we are getting out of the honourable gentleman the information that he knew of this motion long before, and did his best to circumvent it. W ill the Prime Minister say that he did not know of the matter two days before? to the honourable member, but I shall say something of him presently. Minister say that he was not warned -two days before that the matter would be serious ? made the arrangement. Prime Minister to deny the statement. These are the facts of the situation, and for the Prime Minister to say that we were trying to block the Federal Capital question the Prime Minister to say that we were trying to block the Federal Capital question, when we were seeking by every means in our power to provide that it should take precedence of the motion of the honourable member for Gwydir. make this explanation as to what actually took place on Thursday last. We did not object to the Prime Minister's amendmentwe took no exception to it . What we did want to provide, however, was that the matter should not be postponed for three weeks, and we endeavoured to secure that the Federal Capital question should not also be shelved. These two desires were in no way inconsistent. The Prime Minister, of all others, was the honourable member who, after declaring that the Capital. Site question should be decided at an early date, did his best to postpone it for at least three weeks. On him, therefore, is the responsibility for any delay thathas taken place in regard to the settlement of that question. I do not mind telling the Prime Minister something else about the Federal Capital question, if it will do him any good. I do not mind saying that, so far as I am concerned, a delay of a day or two w ill not hurt. ThatI wish the Prime Minister to understand, and I hope he is satisfied now. I venture to mising for Dalgety! able to see, things do look a little promising for Dalgety just now. our side ! fighting a little on the side of the honourable member just now, and doubtless that is. why . he looks so pleasant. My answer to all the jibes of the Prime Minister is that we do not object to the postponement of the FedeI shall say nothing more ral Capital question for one or two days. This has been a mock political crisisa sham affair-al l through. It has been pathetic to read in the newspapers of the desire of the Prime Minister to resign office, and of his, only at the last moment, consenting to remain in office. These reports may or may not be correct; the Prime Minister has not said one. word on the I challenge the matter. But we have seen the Prime Minister in this kind of mood before. His attitude to-day is, "" I do not wish to remain a minute in office, but for heaven's sake do what you can to keep me here! "" That is the explanation of what has gone on during the last week-end. Where is the Government Whip? That gentleman never had such a busy time in his l if e as he has had in squaring matters outside; and -the result of it all is that the Prime Minister has consented 'to retain office, in order to put the Tariff through. There may be some danger to the Tariff in conseI think it right to quence of a possible change in the Ministry, but; personally, I confess I do not see what that danger is, having regard to the position of the Tariff in this House. The Government, however,' seem to scent some danger, and even the scenting of danger was a sufficient appeal to the Prime Minister to take the steps he has taken during the last week-end to ultimately persuade my honourable friends in the corner to take the action they propose to-day. I should like to know where we now stand. We are told that the motion of the honourable member, for Gwydir is to be postponed until the Tariff is out of the way.

That is a question on which I should expect to hear something from .my honourable friends in the Labour corner. I dare say they have made up their minds, and I only throw this hint out, because I shall be glad to hear what the complete proposals of the Government amount to.

We may, however, compliment the honourable member on his unswerving opposition to the It is for the honourable memGovernment. I really believe that. if the Government were composed of angels from heaven, the honourable member for Parramatta would be able to find some grounds for complaint.

External Affairs) [3.55]--There is little to reply to, except the insinuation of the deputy leader of the Opposition that my course in withdrawing my amendment for the postponement of the consideration of grievances on Thursday last was taken because of my knowledge of His intention to hint, suggestion, or conception of such action on his part, or on that of any other honourable member, was in my mind when I withdrew my amendment. I wished to ask ten or fifteen minutes earlier for leave to 'withdraw it ; but, on mentioning the matter to my colleagues, they said, ""Wait until we are certain that the House really wishes you to withdraw."" What decided me in asking leave to withdraw my amendment was not a doubt as to what the House wished, but the objection that notice had not been given .of my amendment. I admit that notice was not' given,' and that objection having been raised, felt bound to recognise it , and did so in the only way in my power, by asking leave to withdraw the amendment. drawal. member objects to everything. everything else the honourable and learned gentleman says. an arrangementwhich was telegraphed : all over the Commonwealth-that the Fedeof truth in them. ral Capital Site question should be dealt with on Tuesday and Wednesday; but ber must withdraw that remark. while on my feet, it was pointed out to me that Tuesday's sitting would probably that the statements of the Prime Minister be occupied with the discussion of the are not in exact accordance with the truth.

It had been telegraphed all over the Commonwealth that members would be invited on Thursday to vote on the Federal Site question, and no other, and I felt sure that, when it was found that they were being asked to deal with any or every grievance, I should be charged with having deliberately brought about the postponement of the Federal Capital Site question. My mistake was, that directly T propose another amendment. No found out that Thursday was grievance day., I did not point out the position to the House, and give notice*'of my intention to move to postpone the consideration of the Order of the Day for going into Committee of Supply. My action in moving the postponement of all grievances was impelled by the necessity for fulfillin g our pledge; 1 because I thought that my inaction would be distorted into an attempt to defeat the wishes of those to whom I had promised that we should deal with the Capital Site question. Those remarks dispose of the statements of the deputy leader of the Opposition, who has since said himself that there was strong reason for not dealing with the Capital Site question on Thursday, and that he had a motive for not wishing that the question should come on on the day fixed. He did not say that, or anvthing like it .

Simply a debate on that amendment which would have shut out the Capital Site question just as decisively as anything else. Had they submitted an amendment of that character -to put aside the proposal of the honourable member for Gwydir in order to allow the Capital Site question to come on that evening-it s consideration would have occupied the greater part, if not the whole of that sitting. Would a number of men who were so strongly moved as they afterwards stated in regard to the necessity for. a postal inquiry that they would allow nothing to intervene-woul d they 'have stood aside lo allow even the Capital Site guestion to intervene ? If the pledge to me had no binding effect on those who made it to me, why should it have a binding effect on those who honourable did not make it , and therefore had not the same obligation? Therefore the statement as to the amendment is a mere cloud to cover their escape from the fact that their action put aside the consideration of the Capital Its Site, that their amendment would have done the same thing; and this too after an agreement had been arrived at all round the Chamber for its consideration on that day.
