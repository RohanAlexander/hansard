The Conference did not consider the establishment of one central Meteorological Bureau to supplant existing institutions and to singly carry out the Australian weather services as practicable, but made certain recommendations.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) I move That the B i ll be now read a second time. I moved the second reading of a B ill somewhat similar to the measure now before us on two previous occasions-o' n the 23 rd March, 1904, and 9 th December, 1904, and as the statements I then made are on record in Hansard, I hope that I shall not be called upon, to repeat the whole of them. tunity to again bring forward this measure, because, in my humble opinion, it deals with perhaps the most important question that can engage our"" attentiona question which, to imy mind, almost overshadows every other affecting the interests of the Commonwealth. A t present, we are completely dependent upon importations for all our war material, iron, steel, and other things. If , unfortunately, an outbreak of hostilities involving Great Britain should occur, our position would be most critical. I consider that it is a disgrace to us that we have not already taken active measures for the development of our known large deposits of iron ore. No attempt has yet been successfully made to utilize them. division lists when a similar measure prised to find that one or two of the representatives of Tasmania, in which State our largest and most valuable iron depositsexist, voted against the B ill . as important, they should be the first to declare in favour of the introduction of a B ill of this character. ister always introduce these personal matters? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I shall please myself as to what I introduce. I did not refer to the representatives of Tasmania in any disagreeable spirit. My remark was prompted solely by the interests of that State, in which the Blythe River iron deposits exist. I say that the development of that vast deposit would materially influence the progress and the financial position alike of Tasmania and of Australia. That, however, is not the only deposit of iron ore are others. For example, I am in receipt of further information concerning a pi nee in South Australia, which is known as the Iron Knob. That deposit of ore is not deposit in Tasmania. It is more remote from a port of shipment, but nevertheless it 'is of a very valuable character. connected by railwav with the coast. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I was not aware of that. I was informed that it was 25 miles distant from the railway. connected by rail. Sir WILLIAM LYNE The informaI am very glad to have an opportion which I have received is that that deposit is almost as rich as is the Blythe River deposit, and I am 'given to understand that there is a vast extent of it . Further, nearly all over New South Wales large deposits of iron ore are known to exist. They are to be found in the north, south, east, and west of that State. I cannot speak so confidently of the resources of Queensland, because I am not familiar with them. the iron deposits there are very extensive. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I have no doubt that all over the continent there is an abundance of iron ore undeveloped at the present time. the country is nearly all of an ironstone formation.",14,Military Sunday Duty

I am now in a position to say that if the Bill becomes law private capital will be invested in it. cessary to start an industry of this kind? upon the size of the company and the quantity of ore that is smelted.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE I have said I am a State Socialist more than once, and I think that the honourable member declared himself a Socialist the other night. Unless he is prepared to sell the railways of Australia, and to part with the tramways, waterworks, and other services of that character, I brand him as a Socialist. That is the sort of Socialist that I am. I have frequently stated that I am in favour of the I happen State carrying on certain services, such as the railways, the tramways, and waterworks. Let the honourable member contrast the tramway system of Sydney with that of Melbourne, and say which serves the people the better.

I submit that this Bill is out of order. It has not been preceded by a motion in Committee, which, I take it, is a condition precedent to the introduction of any Bill appropriating the public funds for any purpose whatever. Standing order 243 makes this very clear. It says If any motion be made in tlie House for any public aid or charge upon the peopleI s the Minister a State SoI do not think there can be any doubt that this measure involves a public charge upon If this Bill be the peoplethe consideration and debate thereof may not be presently entered upon, but should be adjourned til l such further day as the House shall think fit to appoint, and then it shall be referred to a Committee of the whole House before any resolution or vote of the House do pass thereon. A vote has already been wrongly taken upon this B ill , inasmuch as it was not put in Committee, where the Bill ought to have originated. I submit that, following precedents going back almost to the infancy of parliamentary institutions, the Bill, as now before us, is out of order. It should have originated in the Committee to which I am very willing to the Governor General's message was transmitted as soon as it was received. The Constitution is silent in the matter of procedure, but all our parliamentary precedents are in favour of my contention, that there should have been an appropriation in Committee before leave was given to bring in the Bill. ber for Parramatta was good enough a few moments ago to call my attention to the point that he was about to raise in order that I should have an opportunity to con* sider it. On a previous occasion a similar B ill was introduced in Committee, the Committee originating from the reception of a message from His Excellency the Governor General. The Manufactures EncourI think that it agement B ill that was brought before the House last year was introduced, however, in the same way as that now before us has been. On examining this B ill I recognise that it is undoubtedly a measure for a public aid or charge upon the people, because clause. 3 provides that the Governor General may authorize the payA fiscal referment out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of bounties according to rates set out in the schedule. Standing order No. 243, which the honourable member for Parramatta has Withread, expressly declares that the consideration of a motion for any public aid or charge upon the people shall not be entered upon in the House until it has been referred to I rise to a point of a Committee of the whole.

Everything I have to say in regard to the Bill and the union label is bound up in this paragraph from [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill. the Age. There is another matter which has The to be considered, and that is as to how the B ill will affect every industry throughout Australia. One industry which shouicl greatly interest the representatives of Queensland is the sugar industry. When the union labour conditions are carried out to their fullest extent, as I have not the slightest doubt they will be, through the machinations of honourable members in the Ministerial corner, and their organizations outside the House, it will mean that every bag of Queensland sugar will have to bear the union label or else certain things will happen. For one thing, unionists will not be allowed to consume the sugar. Further, an instruction I think that is the prewill be given to the Stevedores' and Wharf Labourers' Unions not to handle the sugar. It is a matter of no Now, this is no imaginary business, but an All that indication of what will happen where instructions have been issued to the members of unions to, as far as possible, hamper the manufacture of the goods, and to prevent the handling of them. ber give us a few examples? should like to call the attention of honourable members to a recent decision by the Minister of Trade and Customs with regard to the labour to be employed for producing sugar in Queensland. Recently he was waited upon, or written to, in regard to the labour of a half-bred I refer to the following telegram, Kanaka on a sugar plantation in the northern part of that State, and, by his decision he has created a new industry. In the first instance, the mother of the halfbred Kanaka had married a Kanaka, and this son was the result of the union After wards she married a white planter, who applied to be registered as a planter working under white labour conditions. The Minister ruled, and justly so, I think, that this /young half-bred Kanaka should 'be allowed to work on the plantation of his step-father, who should be permitted to have a bonus for the production of sugar under white labour conditions. But the Minister has gone still further, and has ruled that half-bred aborigines shall be allowed to work on sugar plantations, and that the planter shall be able to draw the bonus under the white labour conditions.

In this connection the Minister is practically putting a premium on the production of these half castes, and solving this question, so far as Northern Queensland is concerned, so that in the future all sugar will have to be produced under union conditions. I should like to sketch what is likely to occur under those conditions in 1909, in, say, the Herbert River district.

Going a step further, we find that his linen has to be washed by the members of the Baby Linen Washers' Union of Northern Queensland, and that all food, including bread, has to be supplied by union men. This, of course, will interest the honourable member for Yarra, because he has recentlybeen through the fire, so to speak, with regard to non-union bakers; and he has proved abundantly the difficulty that will be created. Before we have had any of this In order to further carry out the compulsory legislation with regard to union labels, the honourable member has virtually been forced into the position of having to insure that everything that he uses is produced under absolutely unionist conditions. With regard to the further development of my imaginary youth, he has to be sent to a State school in which all the teachers have to be members of the Teachers' Union. His clothes have to be branded with the union label. This is no exaggerated idea, because the branding of clothes with Then, as the the union label has been insisted upon in Chicago and San Francisco; and there is evidence that the walking delegates have actually stopped members of the unions to see whether their clothes were branded with Of course the bottles have to the label.

That proves that my statement was accurate, and that the Minister did, in 1903, write a minute and promise to bring in a Bill to amend the Act. But the Bill is not yet forthcoming.

113,,"I will read proofs later Mr WILSON -The honourable memberinsisting upon these union conditions in America has been simply to produce a reaction in another direction; and I firmly believe that a very great deal of the difficulty that has occurred there in regard to the formation of trusts and monopolies has been caused by the principle underlying union label conditions. The same thing was attempted in Melbourne a short time ago, but fortunately the effort was nipped in the bud. There was a certain brewery which pretended that it was about to introduce, for the consumption of the people, beer which was manufactured under strict union conditions. I have seen a copy of the union label which was to be placed upon every cask issued from this brewery. It was a beer barrel marked with some such device as "" XXX , "" to denote the quality of the beer. There was a little l i d on the device which could be lifted up, and inside there was a picture of a ""beerchewer"" about to consume a glass of the ale produced under union conditions. The brewery attempted to capture the trade in Melbourne by using the union label. This brewery intended, if possible, to have it enacted by the Trades Hal l Council that all unionists should consume nothing but union beer; and this threatened to be a seriand non-unionists suffer. Such combinaous menace to the trade. The other breweries had a consultation, and they approached this one brewery; and the end was a decision that it would not be to the interests of the trade to carry the scheme into effect. Eventually the one brewery agreed not to produce beer under the conditions contemplated, ancl so the matter fell through. carried out-anc l it must be remembered that this was a voluntary matter-and the union label had been made compulsory, what would have been the position ? As I have previously said, the sugar in Queensland would have had to be produced, under union conditions, ancl so would the barrels ancl hoops. The beer would have had to be produced in union breweries, the drivers would have had to be union drivers, and the hotels would have been.tied down to union beer, whether that beer was good, bad, or indifferent. And, further, unionists would have had to drink that beer, whether it was good, bad, or indifferent. drink any beer which the breweries supply now. eries would have had to follow suit, with the 1>5J result that all non-unionists would have lost their employment in breweries. may say ""Good gracious""; but would it not be a serious matter if in a brewery 700 non-unionists out of 1,000 men employed should be faced with the alternative of los ing their employment or joining the union, although they might have solid objections to the latter course? Moreover, if those men joined the union, they might have to drink the beer which they had brewed themselves. Under such circumstances, the brewers would resolve to combine and form a monopoly. I have shown honourable members that this is one of the means whereby trusts and monopolies are brought about-com binations we all deprecate, and would like to see extinguished. Honourable members in the Ministerial corner, by their legislation, and by their actions outside Parliament, force people into trusts and monopolies, and the result is that we have combinations which exploit the public, and act detrimentally to the commercial interests, not only of Australia, but of other parts of the world, where they have assumed large dimensions. In this way, both unionists tions under our present arrangement of competition seriously affect the interests of men who work for their daily bread. If the brewers, for instance, combined, they wouldi find that, by using two or three establishments, and concentrating their efforts, they coul d brew all' 'the beer required. ( WhatI want to point out is that all the Buti f the proposal had been beer required could be brewed in two or three establishments, instead of nine or ten as at present. What would be the result ? very often. of the beer brewed under union conditions would very often be equally effective as physic. The combination I have indicated would mean that instead of, say, ten establishments, there would be three, with a corresponding reduction of staffs, and a consequent loss of employment. Those results would not be confined to the brewing industry, but would extend to every other industry in Australia. Instead of business enterprise being encouraged, it would be discouraged, and, by means of combinations, the unemployed difficulty would be accentuated.

He did not specify therein the character of the labour, and the contractor began the exterior work with non-union labour. A delegate to the Building Trades Council protested against this, and Mr Wehner, discovering that he was going to involve himself in difficulties, explained that he had no means of controlling the labour employed by his contractor, but that he would promise that all the interior work should be done by union labour. This was not satisfactory. A boycott was laid upon the structure, and upon the amusement that was to take place in it.

To show how much further the matter was carried in San Francisco, I quote the following: The Building Trades Council of San Francisco is composed of over fifty, governed by an executive council, with a"" delegate from each union. The Labour Council of San Francisco numbers nearly 135 unions, and numbers among its members such unions as the Chicken Pickers, the Fish Gutters, and there was even a union of the Bowling Alley employees organized, the men who set up the ten pins at the end of the alley. Honourable members will notice that, under these conditions, if the system is to be son carried to such an extent as the Ministry of are making provision for at the present maintained. The Court, in overruling the demoment, it will be impossible in Australia, murrer, said, "" There are not, and there cannot as well as in America, to have even a game be of skittles unless some of those employed support happen to be members of a union. I quote or the proprietors unfair in this manner, is as in this furtherWhen in San Francisco they began the work of acts complained of are breaches of the peace, and the boycott, labour there employed sandwiched it is safe to say that if the one boycotted had met men, and we had parading up and down the streets it by personal violence, instead of appealing to of our city in dozens of places men bearing plathe law, he would have been justified by a jury cards, bearing such inscriptions as this"" Do not under his constitutional right of self-defence."" patronize this non-union restaurant. It employs scab help. Indorsed by the San Francisco Labour That is a very important decision by an Council,"" or some other labour organization. If the system is to be carried out to the same extent in Australia as in America, and if such a thing is permitted, we shall no doubt have sandwich-men parading the streets of Melbourne, Sydney, or Brisbane, pointing out the institutions at which people can get a feed, can get clothes or boots, or telling them which newspaper to read. If some newspaper is not produced under certain labour conditions,) people will be informed that it is not to be purchased by members of the unions. The extract I make proceedsBut unionism was in the air to such an extent that labour had not employed its sandwiched men boycotters for a dozen days until the sandwich men conceived the idea of organizing the Sandwich Men's Union. And we had the Sandwich Men's Union demanding of the union that employed them an increase of wages from a dollar and a half to two dollars a day. And when they did not get it they struck, and we had upon the streets of San Francisco the ridiculous spectacle of one sandwich man parading up and down in [-'5]-2and another sandwich man parading up and down in front of him, declaring that when he declared the business unfair he unfairly declared it unfair. This sort of thing had been going on for a very considerable time in San Francisco, and the evil had increased to such an extent that 85 per cent, of the businesses in that city were terrorized by the system. The condition of things described had existed for three years, and when the people could stand it no longer they rose to defend themselves, and brought it under the notice of the legal authorities, in the form of a case submitted to the Court. Judge Hebbard, of the Superior Court of San Francisco, gave a decision in connection with the matter which is of very considerable importance. I quote the following reference to it : It was upon a demurrer interposed to an application for a restraining order, a complainant in the Equity Court, setting up a boycott as the reafor the restraining order, and asking protection of the Equity Court. The question was one law, whether an action in boycott could be any authorities to sustain the defendant's contention. There is no law, human or divine, to their argument.

I am afraid the honourable member does know something about the matter, or, having taken the action he has taken, and having gone as far as he has gone in connection with this union business, he would have gone wholly into if, and become one of the unionists. It is plain to me that it is because the. honourable member knows something that he has wisely kept outside. the question I asked? knows that what has occurred in America may occur in Australia.

In New South Wales, men join the unions, and then, as the leaders of the unions take good care that there shall always be disputes pending in the Arbitration Court, they are unable to leave them again. But the leaders of the unions have pushed matters too far. disposed to assist them so long as they thought that they were asking for a f a i r thing ; but they are now causing reasonable men to turn against them, because they are saying in effect to those who are non-unionists ancl free men, "" You are not slaves now, but immediately you become members of our organization, you will be so. just as the members of the Labour Party in this House are bound with regard to their votes, and almost with regard to what they say in this Chaml>er. should have been a novelist; he would have done well. extract from a later issue of AmericanI n dustries, but before doing so, I should like to see a quorum present. {Quorum formed.] The extract which I wish to read is as follows: An opinion of Judge Shackleford Miller, of the Chanoery Branch of the Jefferson Circuit Court, at Louisville, in the suit lately brought by the Courier-Journal Job Printing Company, ancl its president and vice-president, as citizens, bids, the defendant, Bishop, followed the requireto test validity of the ""union label"" ordinance under which the city has been awarding the contracts for public printing, is of the utmost interest and importance. It renders an unqualified judgment for the plaintiffs. Some of the points in the brief of the attorney for the plainthe work for $2*20 per page, while the defentiff, Mr Alfred Seligman, were as follow :That the ordinance is unconstitutional and void, being in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in this : cost of the entire work under the respective bids. that citizens not a member of the Allied Printing Trades Council of Louisville, and not employing members thereof, are abridged in their privileges ancl immunities as citizens of the United States and deprived of liberty and property without due process of law, and denied the equal protection of the law. That it is unconstitutional under section 3 of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of the State of Kentucky, in this : that the said ordinance constitutes the grant of exclusive separate public emoluments and privileges to persons, members of said Allied Printing Trades Council of Louisville, or employing members of said council, and that such separate public not use said label upon its work, and cannot emoluments ancl privileges are not in consideration of any public services rendered. That it is a violation of the inherent equality of all men before the law. Moneys raised by public taxes constitute a trust fund for the benefit of all taxpayers, to be administered and spent only for public municipal It is according to fact. purposes; that municipal officers are trustees, and have no right to divert such trust funds to any other than municipal governmental purposes; that the city buyer is undertaking under the direction of said ordinance, to pay $260 more for the public printing than the same can be done without the operation of said ordinance, and to that extent there is a diversion of public funds to private uses, and a breach of trust that Men of liberal mind were will be enjoined by the Court. The injunction is not an interference with the discretion vested in this public officer. The legislative department of the city of Louisville has no right to impose upon the discretion of the city buyer or limit it by an unconstitutional ordinance, nor has he a right to accept or bind his discretion with the terms of such an ordinance. The appropriate remedy is by injunction. Judge Miller's opinion was as follows :-This action is brought by L . T. Davidson and August Straus, in their capaYou' will be bound hand and foot,"" cities as residents ancl taxpayers in the city of Louisville, and by the Courier-Journal Job Printing Company, as plaintiffs, against the City of Louisville, Charles F. Grainger, mayor of the said city; Fred. R. Bishop, city buyer of said city ; the Globe Printing Company, and Charles T. Dearing, as defendants, for an injunction to prevent the awarding of a contract for printing of the reports of the city of Louisville for 1903, under a letting of June 7, 1904, to either the Globe Printing Company or to C. T. Dearing. I wish to read another By an ordinance of the city of Louisville, approved January 24, 189S, it is provided in substance that all printing, bookmaking, and work of like character used or ordered by the city of Louisville, ""shall bear the imprint of the recognised union label of the Allied Printing Trades Council of Louisville, Kentucky, as registered with the Secretary of State""; and that the city buyer, when advertising for printed matter, shall insert a notice in the advertisement that all bids shall be submitted in accordance with said ordinance.

Dearing, each offered to do it for $2'6o per page, there being a difference of $240 in the There is no question raised as to the regularity, sufficiency, or validity of any of the bids. This motion for an injunction is based upon the single ground that City Buyer Bishop is threatening to and will award the contract to the Globe Printing Company or C. T. Dearing at $2'6o per page, under and as required by said ordinance of January 24, 189S, because said Globe Printing Company and said Dearing can comply with the ordinance by using the label of the Allied Printing Trades Council-commonl y called the "" Union Label""-whil e the Courier-Journal Job Printing Company, being an "" open shop,"" cantherefore complv with the requirements of the",25,Trade Marks Second Reading

The matter is one of preference being given to unionists, and the attempt made last session to apply that principle, compared to what is now sought to be achieved under the provisions of the B ill , was as measles compared to the -plague. That the purpose of the strike was to compel the -execution of the drafts of agreement is clear. It is averred, in the sworn B ill , and deposed to in -the affidavits of De Wolf, complainant's president; Kellogg, its secretary and treasurer; and Edwards, its superintendent, that business agents of the different unions, called on complainant, and insisted on its executing the agreements, and that, when complainant's president refused, on the ground that the proposed agreements were unreasonable, it was threatened by one of the said business agents that unless complainant would sign the agreements a strike would be called, and that said 'business agents called a strike, in response to which the business of the complainant so far as they about 500 of complainant's employees quit its employ. As I endeavoured to show a few minutes ago, the attempts to force all men into -the unions are monopoly for a certain class of labour. If the efforts of the Labour Party are successful, they will have the effect of bringing about monopolies amongst those who are conducting commercial enterprises. Therefore, the very conditions which honorable members are always condemning, are likely to be brought about by their own action. and trusts, ancl are at the same time contemplating the nationalization of our industries.

Contracts tending to create a monopoly are void. The Legislature of the State cannot create a ""monopoly. the The purpose of the strikers is in violation of the criminal code, which provides as follows :Section 15S -If any two or more persons shall combine for the purpose of depriving the owner or possessor of property of its lawful use and management, or of preventing, by threats, suggestions of danger, or by any unlawf u l means, any person from being employed by or obtaining employment from any such owner or possessor of property on such terms as the The judgment continuesparties may agree upon; such persons so offending shall be fined not exceeding $500, or confined in the county gaol not exceeding six months. Section 159 -If any person shall, by threat, intimidation, or unlawful interference, seek to prevent any other person from working or from obtaining work at any lawful business, on any terms that he may see fit, such person so offending shall be fined not exceeding $200. Not only was the purpose of the strike unlawful, but the means used to achieve the unlawful purpose were unlawful. The means used were the acts heretofore mentioned, and thereby injury to tbe complainants' business. The appellants and their associates intended to stop possibly could, and the evidence shows that they did stop it in great part to complainants' injury. there about union labels. Each conspirator is responsible for the acts and declarations of every other conspirator in furtherance of the common purpose. The conspiracy originated simultaneously with the calling of the strike, and continued until the filing of the last petition, July 14th, 1902. It was'a single conspiracy. And 'the Court on the hearing of each of the second and third petitions did not err in hearing the prior evidence. They are setting up monopolies This was an appeal case, the evidence having been given in another Court. The statement proceedsThe evidence was competent as tracing and showing the character of the conspiracy. It is an indispensable condition of the enjoyment by each citizen of the liberty and rights guaranteed by the Constitution and laws that he shall respect, and not unlawfully infringe upon the liberty or rights of any other citizen. This cannot be done with impunity The fact that labourers have the right to refuse to work the United for a man who does not employ union labour, or in order to better their condition or advance their wages, does not authorize the making of a conHis position tract under which the employer is compelled to employ only union labour, and to discharge non-union labour.

250,Mr Kennedy,"There is no coercionof coercion is given to the unions by means of this principle. The object which I have in view, before the Bill is finally disposed of, is this: We have had many complaints in Australia-som e have been voiced on the floor of this House-as to the injurious effects upon the community generally of monopolies, combines, and trusts. To my mind there is splendid opportunity in connection with this Bill-as there was in connection with the Patents Act, although advantage was not taken of it-to do something to restrain monopolists or those individuals who wish to create a monopoly in any particular article. I intend to propose an amendment to the effect that any individual or corporation who becomes the proprietor of a registered trade mark, and who does anything whatever in restraint of trade in the article to which that trade mark is applied, shall have the registration cancelled forthwith. apply that to a trade union that did anything of the kind? achieve uniformity wherever it is possible. member would apply the principle to both parties ? why, in a spirit of equality and fairness. I. wish trade unions to have the right to register a union label just as an individual or corporation is given the right under this Bill. gaged in trade labour; that is their trade for the time lifting. The leader of the Opposition told us that this Bill was an instance of the effects of a shuffle of political cards, and he went on to argue that if it was possible by combinations of parties to bring about such a state of things, we should never know exactly where we were. Stress was laid on the fact that the Labour Party in this House were the determining factors in this class of legislation. honourable member's attention to the fact that the industrial classes in Australia are above the level of serfs to-day. citizens; they are constituted such by Act of Parliament. We have thrown aside in Australia the old barbaric system of resorting to road metal and brute force to achieve what a particular class may think to be for its welfare. The working classes have come into the political arena. The members of the Labour Party are here as representatives of the citizens of Australia. leader of the Opposition to quarrel with the members of the Labour Party or with those who send them here. It will be better to recognise that they represent one of the forces at work in this community, and to endeavour to direct that force into proper channels than to be interminably in antagonism to it . The whole industrial and economic l if e of Australia is to-day represented in Parliament. The party which is designated the Labour Party, represents, if honourable members choose to say so, a class. But we have had class representation'in the past. Those who complain of it to-day did not complain of it then. This force being at work to-day, is it not better to recognise it, and to endeavour to direct and govern it in the best interests of the community, than to be eternally abusing it? It has been recognised in some of the States, and it is being recognised in this Parliament, that it is our duty so to control the affairs of the nation that no section Yes; and that is of its people-eve n the poorest of our'industrial classes-shal l have to sacrifice their life-blood, so to speak, for the benefit of their employers. So far as I can understand the situation,, it is admitted by all that the efforts of trade unions have been directed towards the uplifting of the industrial elements in Australia, and to placing them on an equality with other classes. That is the sole object of this trade union proposal. Consequently, I approach the question with an open mind. Up to the present, however, I have not heard of anything to prethe vent me from supporting the Bill. I trust that when we get into Committee, if anv provision i's found to be necessary to safeguard the interests of all, we shall be found perfectly willing to insert it in the B ill . members desire to have additional evidence I should like to direct the right of the fact that the present Government does not possess a sufficient majority in this House to enable them to introduce useful They are legislation, they have it in this attempt to bring forward a Bill embodying proviThey have the franchise. sions which afford clear proof of pressure from another party.

259,Mr Johnson (Lang),"If honorablethat if the party really responsible for the introduction of the trade union label provisions of this B ill were occupying the Treasury bench, they would not have had the temerity to bring forward a provision of the kind. They would have exercised that caution which was so characteristic of their brief reign of office only a little while ago. But, occupying positions in which' they are able to control legislation without responsibility for that legislation, they evidently have been able to prevail on another Ministry to do what they themselves would probably never have attempted. I object to provisions of this character for reasons which I have always given for my objection to the creation of special privileges for any one section of the community. I hold that the Legislature exists for the purpose of preserving the equal rights of every citizen, and not for the purpose of creating laws which advantage one section at the expense or inconvenience of the, rest of the community -That is exactly what measures of this kind are designed to do. Here, the obvious intention and purpose is to enable one section to obtain special privileges at the expense of the rest of the community, hy the use of a union label, which will have the effe'ct of bringing pressure to bear on employers and employees alike-o n one to employ only certain members of the community, who are associated with unions, and on the other to purchase goods only from those who employ union labour. Whatever may be the rights of unions to draft rules in an endeavour to bring about such a state of affairs, the Legislature has no moral right to lend itself to any scheme for enabling such things to be done under the sanction of legal authority; ancl it is that aspect of the question to which I propose, mainly, to address myself. ber not give a union the right to register a label ? a union registering a label, provided it is clear that it is not the intention to use that label for the purposes of intimidation, coercion, or conspiracy, for the purposes of a bovcott, or by any other means of combination to prevent freedom of choice on the part of members of unions to purchase wherever they please, or to prevent freedom on the part of manufacturers or dealers to employ whom they choose, and sell what goods they choose, whether or not of union manufacture. If it is not the intention of the framers of this Bil l to afford such facilities the provisions of the part relating to trades unions certainly seem to me to lead in that direction. If we are to take the experience of other countries where similar provisions have been adopted, not by Legislatures, but by the unions themselves, we have reason to believe that there is room for great doubt and fear as to the consequences of passing such a measure with the f u l l force of law behind it. Looking through' a list of cases, which is supplied in a pamphlet recently distributed, we see the following statement. distributed ? the Central Council of the Employers' Association of Australia. no signature, but it is issued by the central council, from 285 Collins-street, Melbourne.

The law rightly steps in to prevent this infringement of the rights of others. the unionists ask for. preference clause which it was sought to introduce into the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill and the object of the proposed union label is to secure, not equal rights for all, but special privileges for some at the expense of the rest. The object of the preference clause was to prevent non-unionists from getting employment until all unionists were employed, and the object of the Bill is to serve a similar purpose. at any rate. If the B ill is carried, we may easily have such a state of things as this : A man, attempting to hang a picture in his own house, with the assistance of his wife, might find that they were unequal to the task, and call in the coachman to their service. Under orders from his union, however, the coachman might refuse to have anything to do with the matter, unless the picture bore a union label, to show that it had been painted by a union artist; and he might also demand that the canvas should be labelled to show that it had been manufactured under union conditions, and that the very tacks used to secure it to the They frame bore a union stamp. He might also refuse to handle the picture unless the nail from which it was to be suspended could be shown to be of union manufacture, and Notwithmight raise similar questions in regard to the wall paper, plaster, and everything else connected with the building. There is no limit to the objections which could be raised, and, if I remember rightly, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, in a famous speech on the Arbitration B ill , spoke very forcibly on this subject. Therefore, although the measure at first sight appears to be such a simple one, it may prove one of the most powerful All law has a engines of tyranny, unless its provisions are carefully safeguarded, and I ask those who support it to assist us in obtaining such safeguards from abuse. I shall oppose the measure unless its provisions are so safeguarded, because, as they stand, they are calculated to establish a labour monopoly. One of the most cruel forms of monopoly exists when labour unions attempt to exclude from employment all who are not unionists, and resort to devices of this kind to obtain the support of law for their coercive actions. have no intention of speaking at any length, because I think that Part VII . may be dealt with very fully in Committee.

The members who have spoken from the Labour corner have asked in frenzied fashion why unionists should not have the right to register trade marks, a right which manufacturers possess. I see no reason why they should not. In point of fact, they possess that right. trade mark in Victoria. the Attorney-General, in moving the second reading, said that every individual has the right to register a trade mark, if he feels disposed to do so, and can put it on any article that he manufactures. But the proposed label is to be used by the unions to give a preference to goods manufactured by them over goods manufactured by non-unionists. Bill providing for that. Thev are not honest enough to put it into the B ill . object of the measure. The Attorney-General, in moving the second reading, said that the B ill provides a guarantee to the general public that the labour employed in manufacturing goods has been employed under conditions in which sweating could not prevail, and the whole argument last week was that the great philanthropists of the day say that such a measure is necessary to prevent the public from purchasing goods manufactured under unfair and insanitary conditions. An appeal is therebybeing made to persons with a conscience to purchase goods which are manufactured by those who pay their workmen a fair wage. What is the real object of the proposal for the use of union labels? workmen may purchase goods which have been manufactured by union labour, and so encourage the employment of unionists? purchasers to discriminate between the goods made by unionists and those turned out in workshops where non-unionists are employed. for what other purpose ?-in order that non-unionists may be forced into the unions. The honourable member for Bland told us that he would keep the unions open to every person who might desire to join them. I hope not. That is only right and proper. The honI see no oborable member desires that all workmen* shall join the unions, and he would keepthe unions as open as possible.

We have heard a good deal with regard to the experience in that country, and I judgethat what has happened there will probably be repeated here, namely, that the unions will endeavour to make it imperative that manufacturers shall employ only ivnion That is what is meant. labour. I am not prepared to say that the unions would go to the same extremes as their confreres in America have done. I doT h a t is the not propose to follow that line of argument. My point is that the chief object of the provisions relating to the use of union labels, is to force men into the unions. We know from what has been written by Tom Mann, Webb, and others, who have dealt with the unionist side of the labour problem, that their aim is to force all artisans into the unions, and to then organize their forces insuch a way as to accomplish their political ends. Since this debate was commenced, I have endeavoured to obtain a copy of the last pamphlet written by Tom Mann, in order to ascertain whether he has repeated what he stated in a former publication, to the effect that at the last International Labour Convention, the members agreed by Is it not that resolution to do their best as Socialists to force men into the unions, and then use the unions for the purpose of promoting the adoption of extreme socialistic principles.

That is the objective of the present movement in England and upon the Continent, and honourable members of the Labour Party in Australia are working most assiduously in the same direction. The Attorney-General proposes to make provision whereby non-unionists shall be able to work with unionists. Whilst the Minister is, no doubt, sincere, I am inclined to think that he will fai l to accomplish his purpose. The honourable member for Bland has mentioned certain instances in which unionists and non-unionists might be employed in the same factory. He mentioned the case of clickers in a boot factory. Let us imagine that a non-union clicker is employed in a boot factory. who cuts out uppers, and one man is capable of cutting out thousands of uppers, and of keeping a whole factory going. Therefore, the manufacturer who employed a non-unionist clicker could not affix the union label to his goods unless he also attached a tag to show that some of the men employed by him were non-unionists. It could not be expected that those whose sympathies were with the unions would purchase goods bearing a tag of the non-unionist. Otherwise, the union label would possess no advantage. The honourable member for Lang has described what has taken place in San Francisco, and I have no doubt that the same condition of affairs is sought to be brought about here. I have no sympathy with coercion or tyranny, and I contend that the object of the Socialists, if approved by unionists, should be attained by evolutionary methods, not by coercion. able member believe in Socialism? favour of the State taking over many public services, but not in the form that the honourable member desires.

No man, I suppose, wishes to see labour employed in any place under unfair conditions. But I claim that the means which it is proposed to adopt to secure that end are not such as ought to commend themselves to the House. This Bill marks a very important departure in our legislation, and I exceedingly regret that there is such a small attendance of honourable members who take any interest in it . If it is merely desired that a man engaged in producing any article shall work under fair conditions, obviously these clauses should not apply to any industry which is working under a Wages Board/ or under A clicker is an operative an award of the Arbitration Court, because those tribunals guarantee fair conditions to the men engaged in such industries. If the contention urged in support of this proposition is correct, no attemptshould be made to apply the principle of the union label to goods which are produced in industries working under an award of the Arbitration Court or under a Wages Board. effect of using the union label shall be upon the goods. is aimed at. The proposal to adopt the union label is another attempt to secure a preference to unionists. We debated that principle ad nauseam last year, we deposed two or three Governments whilst it was under discussion, and honourable members generally derived a good education in regard to it. The proposal contained in this Bill constitutes another attempt to secure a preference to unionists, because the idea underlying it is that by the use of ' the union label we shall create a demand for I should be in union goods, so that any employer of non-union labour will be forced by the competition of those who put the union label upon their products, either to urge his men to join the uniona course which they may not desire to adopt-o r to dismiss them. proposed. direct compulsion is proposed; but the proI shall have visions of the B ill would, in their operation, prove an indirect means of compelling men to join a union. upon the manufacturer to apply for the union label.",39,Willis W H A T Expense Or Arbitration Bill Although The Leading Fea

It was stated by the honourable member for Bland The object is that union label provisions were in force in a great many States in America. It is a fact that a large number of the Legislatures of the States have passed what we may designate as union label provisions; but it must not be forgotten that those provisions have been held to be unconstitutional by every Supreme Court in the United StatesA in which they have been challenged. They have been held to be unconstitutional because, in almost every case, I believe, they infringe not only the Constitution of the States concerned, but a very vital amendI n this letter it ment known as "" The Fourteenth "" in the Federal Constitution of the United States. which gives a f u l l statement of what is described as a union label case, heard by the Jefferson Circuit Court, Chancery Branch.

In a Kentucky case, Mr cated the boycotting; of newspapers, emJustice Shackleton Miller statedBoth classesT h a t is, unionists and non-unionistsare entitled to precisely the same consideration; neither is entitled to a preference at the hands of the law. It is elementary that our government is conducted for the benefit of all citizens alike; and not for the special benefit of any one man over his neighbour, and thai a non-union workman has no right to say that a union workman shall not be employed in public work. A union workman has all the rights before the law that the non-union workman has, and the General Council cannot, constitutionally, deprive the union workman of that equality. In the United States the authorities are abundant and uniform to the effect that ordinances and laws restricting the right of work to a class are unconstitutional, therefore void. are based upon sections in the Constitutions of the individual States, as well as in that of the Union, which guarantee to all individuals there the right to pursue their avocation in the way which seems best to themselves.

The object of that is, of course, to strengthen the unions in every way, to force men into them. I do not think that Parliament can too strongly reprobate conduct of that kind. The privilege of joining a union is one of which I think most men ought to avail themselves. Buti f t they do not, it seems to me to be a very in Adelaide, the employers advocated -the boycotting of newspapers. ployers are just as much to blame as are employees.

That is not a state of affairs which any honourable member favours. blackballed men all over the country. make a right. If men do these things voluntarily, they are guilty, it seems to me, of an act which is wrong in a court and of morals. Buti f we, by law, give men The American decisions the power to so act, we shall do something which is much more immoral, because we shall put men in a position where they can do something which offends against morality, but which they will be able to justify by an Act of Parliament.

Honourable members will admit, I presume, that most of the non-unionists are in the poorest circumstances. in the case of women. from the honourable member that the condition of those outside the unions is riot so bad as I thought it was. But even if there are only a few persons who do not join a union because they are not Jinandaily strong enough to do so, we should not make their burden any greater than it is. We know that in these States, where friendly societies are largely in vogue, many men find great difficulty in keeping up the payments which, when the necessity arises, would entitle them to sick pay, and so on. If , on top of that, they are forced into a union, where they would have to pay an entrance fee and make another payment, the calls upon them get too severe, and those who are dependent upon them suffer very much in the long run. In conclusion, I can only reiterate what I have said against this provision, because I feel that it is another attempt to extend the principle of preference to unionists, which I believe should not be enacted, it being, in my opinion,, contrary to any high moral code. gret that, when a measure of such far-reaching importance is under discussion, honourable members who are responsible for its original and extraneous phases, have not seen fit to explain what they really mean. We have had honourable members sitting in the corner as if they were without that g if t of loquacity which we all know them to possess, as if they were under the Government whip, instead of holding the whip over the Government, This is a measure which previously had a vast amount of opprobrium heaped upon it, because it was what is known as a non-contentious measure. I do not think it can be said any longer that it is non-contentious. The House recently expressed its desire to proceed with useful business, but all along it has shown that it is incapable of dealing with contentious legislation. I apdid, to proceed with useful business. The that hath not shall be taken even that he ness is to express clearly what we mean to do, and not to try to crowd contentious proposals into non-contentious measures. If this provision for a union label be germane to the character of this measure generally, why was it not proposed in the first instance ? The original measure was drafted by the Deakin Government, I think, during the previous recess, or immediately after the House met last session, and it contained no I am glad to hear union label provision. The succeeding Governmenta Government representing militant unionism in the Commonwealthdid not submit any . union label proposal. The Reid-McLean Government then came into power, and it also did not propose to insert this foreign proposition. We had to wait until the Bill was introduced into the Senate before a member of the party that is now so silent in this Chamber submitted a provision for a union label. It is only fair, in trying to gain an estimation of what the proposal really means, to ask honourable members why, when they had their own party in power, they did not see fit to introduce the proposal in an honest, straightforward way? We know that for a long; time the Labour Party were intensely anxious about a Federal arbitration measure. We know that they devoted all' their energies to the preparation of a measure which was to secure industrial peacethroughout the Commonwealth so far as anindustrial dispute tresspassed beyond the boundaries of any one State. It was of no use to point out to honourable members; that for a considerable time there had beenno industrial warfare of a Federal nature, and that there was no likelihood of industrial strife of a Federal nature occurringfor a considerable time to come. They said, "" Such a thing may happen, and we wish to prepare against it . "" Well, we prepared against its occurrence, but the Housesaw that that measure, which was to induce industrial peace, would also conduce to the immense strength of the labour organizations -to the political strength of each member of the Labour Party!

This House very properly refused to support that conspiracy of honourable members on the cross benches. The House, as we know, inserted definite safeguards in that Bill. It laid down the principle that when a for the purpose of crowding what ought to man in pursuit of his livelihood was compelled by legislation which this House had passed to join a union, that union should have no oppressive rules, and should in no way interpose in politics or interfere with the liberty of that man outside the legitimate objects of the union. other similar safeguards which.

But there are two ways to do these things. way, and there is a surreptitious secret way. There is a way of candour and there is a way of hyprocrisy. I do say that it is surreptitious and hypocritical for honourable members opposite to insert proposals of the immensely far-reaching character of that which is contained in this B ill , into Bills which were never designed to contain such provisions.

371,Mr Kelly,"T h a t is why I wish theand straightforward way, and not disguised as a non-contentious measure. As a proof that the manufacturer, or person in trade, is always able to visit on the consumer -the increased loss caused by this type of legislation, I have only to point to the anxiety manifested amongst the extreme members of the Socialistic Party, who favour it, to fix values and assess everything by statute. bers Worker has recently been tackling this question, which has also arisen in New Zealand. In the latter Colony it has been found that the increased cost of production, owing to fhe present proceedings of the Arbitration Courts and to the consequent general rise of wages, has been passed on to the consumer, and the worker himself has to pay the enhanced price of the articles produced. house rent. only to house rent, but to all goods and all phases of trade; and the cry now is to settle everything by Act of Parliament, even the price of food. Will honourable members deny the truth of that statement ? Do they deny that, as a result of the increased cost of production in New Zealand, the articles produced are charged more to the persons who produce them, and that there is now a cry raised to have prices fixed by statute? the consumers, who constitute the people of this country, nor, perhaps, the manufacturers, who are a very small element, wish for legislation of this character. I can understand honourable members on the cross benches, who are of the Socialisti': Party, sedulously urging on this measure under any guise in which they can secure it. trade unionism; and they hope to affiliate to their political organization all trades unions and the members thereof. They have already succeeded in affiliating a considerable number of the trades unions of Australia, and from those trades unions their electoral subscriptions are met. honourable members listen I shall prove should be safeguarded-that no man should the facts. In South Australia, as all honbe compelled to join a union, the rules of orable members should know, if they do which were oppressive, or made him not, the members of the affiliated unions sacrifice his political opinions or consupport the Labour Party by yearly subtribute to funds to be devoted to obscription. I am, therefore, absolutely corjects outside those of an ordinary trades rect when I say that the affiliated unions pay for the organization work of labour members of this House. sides. side to which I have the honour to belong. member that it does apply in South AusHonorable memtralia. South Australia give their subscriptions to all sides of politics, I still think it is a very false system. In New South Wales, the trades unions support only one side of politics. A t the recent Labour Conference in New South Wales, there was a proposal to levy 6d. per head on every member of every affiliated union. The delegate who brought forward the proposition told the conference that the suggested levy would realize from .£1,500 to ^2,000 per annum for the Labour Party's fighting fund. There is direct proof of the interestedness of the Labour Party in this measure ! If men can be forced into unions, and those unions forced to become affiliated, and the proposition to which I have referred, is made universal, this 6d. per head per compulsory recruit will become available for the organization and political expenses of honourable members who are now supporting this Bill. I can understand that -neither the Bill, anyhow. gratulate the honourable member on that fact. We know that this inclination on the part of the Labour Party, received a check in the House during the course of the Arbitration Bill. The Labour Party hope for increased affiliation'; and the honourable member for Grey may take some comfort Those gentlemen represent political from that, though he was not keen to go to the country a few months ago. for Wentworth was not eager to go to the country twelve months ago. clination of the Labour Party received a check during the course of the Arbitration Bill.

Thar Act provides that a union, the rules of which are burdensome or oppressive, or do not provide reasonable conditions for admission to and continuance in membership, shall not be entitled to ask for preference, and further that no organization shall be entitled to appear before the Court, so long as its rules, or Other binding decisions,. in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act? permit the application of its funds to political purposes, or require its members to do anything of a political character.

I wish some persons would be prepared-althoug h not forced-to pay fid. a head for it. the result of this measure will be the same as that which it was contended would be the result of the provisions proposed in the Arbitration and Conciliation B ill . We know that the result of this measure will be to force men into unions. There is no use. trying to disguise the fact, or to burke the issue-me n will be forced into unions under the provisions of this Bill. This House knew that, as the result of the preference clauses of the Arbitration and Conciliation B ill , men would be forced into unions, and it took definite action with regard to that Bill, and laid down the definite principle to which I have just referred. Will not the House apply the same principle to this measure ? applicants for trade marks; that would do. orable member while I refer to it ber for Wentworth go as f a r as that, and apply the principle he suggests to every applicant for a trade mark? every applicant for a trade mark. ber has committed himself now. applicant for a union trade mark. No hongentleman has something particularly imorable member will contend that the object portant to say in the conversation in which of an ordinary trade mark is to effect a he is engaged, but I was going to ask him boycott. It is only to give a value to the consumer. I have proved that the object of the proposed union label provisions in this B ill is not to give a value to the consumer, ancl that their effect would be to force men into unions. That being the case, why should we not say that these unions shall be gpverned by the same rules as those which we have already laid clown used to force people into combines? would re'gulate that by an ordinary antiHonorable members trust B ill . ence ? an ordinary anti-trust Bill, which I hope will be introduced in this Chamber. But this sort of -business, introducing legislation providing for interference with trade in a measure which has nothing whatever to do with such proposals, is not honest, I pay for all my own as it does not give people outside an opportunity to know what those who propose such legislation have really in view. If We know that honourable members would bring such a measure forward, to be dealt with on its own merits, the case would be different. Of course, I should be against it then, as I am against anything that would provide for a boycott. Buti f , on the other hand, Ministers would bring forward measures to prevent undue interference with or hindrance to trade, I shouicl be prepared to support those measures, provided they are not drafted in a way which is calculated to defeat the object I desire to attain. Honourable members have told us, during the course of the debate, that it is essential that some such provision as the one which I have just outlined should be included as a safeguard in this measure.

During the honourable gentleman's speech he imade that statement in reply to an interjection. The. honourable gentleman has admitted the keeping the unions free from any outside object. unionism is not necessarily political, and these unions should be kept free from political objects. The honourable member for Moira also again reiterated his determination to in no way depart from the principle laid down by this House. Honourable members have already voted on a somewhat similar provision, and, according to the official division-lists of this Chamber, I find that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat voted for the principle I have just announced. Richmond, at present Vice-President of the Executive Council, also affixed his signature to that principle. The right honourable member for Swan also adopted that principle. The honourable members for Mernda, Moira, Echuca, Wimmera, and the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, also affixed their signatures to that principle, as well as honourable members on this side of the House. I think I am justified in asking, what 1 think their constituents and the people of Australia will ask, whether, if it is necessary to regulate these things in one B ill , it is not necessary to regulate them in another similar one? Honourable members may say that matters have now changed, and they are under the whip, and cannot help themselves. Mr>. KELLY members may say it. do so. there can possibly be for any change of opinion on so vital a question. Honourable members may urge that that would be some reason for a change of opinion, but I put it to them that in this House, from its very inception, it has always been understood that, if an honourable member once gives a vote in a certain direction, no new arrangement of parties is to be considered a sufficient reason for departure from the D i d not the honourable vote previously recorded. Certain questions are always treated as non-party questions. We know that in the present Ministry there are several gentlemen who voted, on the occasion to which I referred, against the insertion of any safeguard, and No w the honourable those honourable gentlemen cannot be expected to go back on their original position. But the honourable gentlemen I have mentioned have put their signature to the expression of a principle, and in the pages necessity of of Hansard they are wedded to that principle; and if they now depart from The object of legitimate trade it, there can be absolutely no reason advanced except a most ignoble love of office, and a most ignoble fear of the whip which is constantly held over them. has a lot to learn yet. if I must learn that I must stand in this House and refrain from expressing my contempt for such departures from principle. I know that some of the honourable members. I have enumerated will not vote with the The honourable member for Government upon this matter, but I hope that all of them will stand firm to the votes they previously gave, and agree that-these provisions are opposed to the principle which they have approved. I have endeavoured to show that there is a similarity between the situation brought about by the present proposal and that evolved by the discussion on the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. I have shown, further, that the anxiety to introduce the union label by means of this measure was not evinced until in another place provisions had been inserted in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill for the regulation of unions. I now propose to show that unless Parliament again stands to the principle it has already laid down, and makes sure that no union which mav be formed, as the result of this union label proposal, shall transgress the I say that honourable rules sanctioned by the Arbitration Court, new unions of a political character will spring into existence to do the recruiting for my honourable friends on It is the only explanation the cross-benches. If non-unionists are to be compelled by means of the boycott to join unions, I think it will be admitted, even by those on the cross-benches, that entrance to and membership of unions should be made as easy as possible.

407,Mr Kelly,"I have a lot to learn yetistic leagues, these provisions, which allow non-unionists to be coerced by being forced into unions to adopt politics which may be foreign to their views, should surely be safeguarded. The rules of unions may very easily be made offensive to men who treasure the liberty of the subject. 1 do not propose to go far and wide in search of anomalies, but I should like to read three of the rules of the Sydney Wharf Labourers' Union, which is one of the largest unions in the city from which I have the honour to come. The entrance-fee to be paid on joining that union is ios., and the annual subscription another ios., so that a man who sought to enter it to earn a day's work would be compelled to pay j £ i for the privilege. That, however, is not the point which I wish to make by quoting these rules. This is the first rule to which I wish to direct attention :If any member shall at any meeting bring :t rand influential newspaper. This union, as wartl a proposition tending to destroy or break the aforesaid union, or should any member persuade or seduce others to join a conspiracy for such purpose, those who are thus tempted shall report the same to the committee of management, who shall investigate the matter, and on proof to their satisfaction of such conspiracy, they shall award such punishment as they may consider necessary. That rule obviously places an enormous power in the hands of the committee of management, final and absolute arbiters. choose to say that anything that has been done has been done against the interests of the union, the offender may be dealt with as they think fit. To illustrate the effect of such a rule, let me ask honourable members to consider what would have been a similar position if , at the beginning of this session, the late Government had been in the position of this committee of management. Any member bringing forward "" a proposition tending to destroy or break t h e "" late coalition-the ""aforesaid union ""-o r to "" persuade or seduce others to join a conspiracy for such purpose"" would at once have been liable to be dealt with at the absolute discretion of the late Administration! might very easily militate against the joining of unions by non-unionists-becaus e non-unionists probably have friends who are also non-unionists, and do not wish to join unions-is this :No member of this union shall work with unfinonci.il members or non-unionists when union labour is available. I pass by that rule without comment, since its extreme stringency speaks for itself. The third rule is the most stringent of them allI f any member shall at any meeting bring forlion which may lend to injure the union, or conveying information, or causing to be conveyed any information, either verbally or otherwise, or acting as an accessory, if found guilty by a majority of the committee of management, such person or persons shall be expelled for all time from the union. In other words, a man is to have no opportunity to earn a livelihood if , in the opinion of the committee of management, he has been guilty of the rather slight offence of "" imparting information."" That is a rule which is oppressive, and Parliament should not pass a law which would have the effect of compelling men to join a union governed by such a rule. To give other instances of union oppression, it is well known that the Australian Workers' Union runs a strong every one knows, supports a distinct partu in politics, and the newspaper is a partisan organ of the most pronounced type. The offices in Sydney into which it has just moved are such as the most capitalistic press might envy, and, if we pass the legislation now proposed, it may obtain compulsory subscriptions from men who maybe definitely opposed to the views published by it. Before passing a measure because they are the which will inevitably have the effect of If they compelling men to join unions, we should endeavour to insure that the unions shall not use these compulsory recruits oppressively. There will be no difficulty about the enforcement of such limitations. Honourable members know that the Arbitration Court has power to enforce the provisions in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act governing unions. Honourable members on the cross-benches told us while that Bill was under discussion ]that Ithe difficulty of forming new unions is almost insurmountable. If that statement was correct, no new unions will be formed, and the limitations which I should like to see placed on the existing unions, which will benefit by this legislaAnother rule, which tion, will not press hardly upon any one, since they already weigh on every existing union. But, if honourable members on the cross-benches were only characteristically specious on the occasion to which I refer, it will be clear that, unless we insert the provision which I wish to see inserted in this B ill, the measure will be used in opposition to the provisions of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and I do not think that Parliament should stultify itself by allowing such a position to arise member prove that? The agitation for the registration of union one of the best contributions on the sublabels did not arise until the unions, which ject I have read.

I intend to show that the proposal is totally unnecessary, and may prove an injury instead of a benefit to the people for whom it is intended. I take it that a trade mark is first and foremost a guarantee of quality, and as such we have surrounded it with legislative authority and protection, so as to encourage the production of quality in articles of merchandise. give a. man this ^protection because we believe it will be on the one hand a guarantee to the people that they are getting the good articles for which they pay, and that on the other it may encourage the maker of those articles for consumption to acquire a reputation for a good instead of an indifferent product. By this means we are doing that which we do in many other ways, and that which I think should be the guiding principle of all our legislationwe are seeking to make it easier for people to do the right thing than it is to do the wrong. Trade marks, therefore, are in their very essence a guarantee of the quality of the goods on which they are placed. But no guarantee of quality is conveyed by the mere placing of a trade union label on an article. guarantee of quality given by the ordinary trade mark of a manufacturer. not of the abuses which occur, but of the intention of the legislation relating to trade marks, and of that for which it stands. A trade union label gives.no guarantee of the quality of the goods or the -product on which it is placed. sonable working conditionsI firmly believe that it is intended to give that guarantee-bu t that is quite a different object from that of a trade mark. A trade mark gives no certificate as to the conditions under which goods are produced. It does not show whether goods are produced under sweating or wholesome sanitary conditions, but merely sets up a standard of quality and protects that standard to the benefit of the consumer, as well as of those who observe it. A t ""the best the only guarantee that a trade union label affords is that the goods on which it is placed have been made under trade union conditions as to wages and hours of employment. I wish to say as plainly as I can that, unless a trade union label gives some guarantee of the quality of the product on which it is placed, we ought not to go to the extent of enshrining a provision of this kind in the statute-book of the' Commonwealth.

I go further, and say that I do not think that a trade unionist, or any other free man, ought to be coerced to purchase goods of an inferior quality, no matter how or by what means they have been produced.

I was pointing out when interrupted that if you legalize the labelling of goods which may be inferior in quality, for the purpose of inducing trade unionists to buy them in preference to others, by the very fact that they are inferior you will force a reduction of wages upon those who have only a certain amount of money to spend. ber think that goods made by trade unionists are inferior? If the honourable member were to ask me whether I think that trade union labour is inferior to other labour, I should say no, emphatically. labour likely to be inferior? honourable member an instance in point. A little while ago two contracts were let in connection with military clothing. One contract was for the supply of the cloth, and the other for the making up of it . cloth was supplied to the Department, and it was taken at, I think, about 6d. per yard cheaper than good cloth, and made up at the same cost as good cloth. anything about union labour. by factory labour, I presume. The cost of making up was the same in each case, but the article produced was very much inferior in one case, because an inferior cloth had been supplied. In other words, it cost the same to make up bad cloth as good cloth. label would apply to only the workmanship. that it would apply to the whole product, if the cloth had passed through union hands in the making up. But, supposing that the label applied to only the working up of the cloth, I presume that there would be another label for the cloth itself. Cloth may be made by union labour, and yet be of inferior quality.

Therefore, you may have an article passing through the hands of the most skilled handicraft men, which in its finished state will be of an inferior character. Today some of the cloth I referred to is being worn. It is hardly fit to be worn, but because it was a little cheaper than good cloth it was accepted ''by the 'authorities, and made up at the price which had to be paid for the making up of good cloth. Whereas a good suit of clothes well made will last two years, this inferior cloth will last only one year. Therefore, the one is worth only about half as much as the other. So that there is no guarantee of quality in connection with these labels; and there being no guarantee of quality, there is no guarantee that people will buy goods so marked. If they do, they will be decreasing their own spending power by that very act.

He saidAndI say, further, that after all his declarations of sympathy witfl trade unions, I do not remember any instance where the right honourable member has gone out of his way to help them, in a political sense. Has it came to this: that a man can have no sympathy with trade organizations except he believes in political trade unionism finding its expression in the labour leagues ?

The honourable member will find, moreover, that the unions in the old country are quite divided as yet as to the advisableness of going into the political arena; I mean, of course, in any such sense as they have done here. And surely a man can express sympathy with trade unionism even though he does not believe in the politicalization of the unions to the extent that has taken place here.

It is very different with the union represented by the honourable member for Darling. That is a political organization. But the miners in New South Wales for the most part decline to make their unions political organizations. When that is the case, even in Australia, and over a very much wider area of the world outside, I think that a man may express his opinion in favour of trade unions and yet disbelieve in their being made political organizations. That, I understand, is the attitude of the right honourable member for East Sydney. It is mine, and always has been.

When I take up the industrial newspapers of the Commonwealth I find them filled with advertisements of one kind and another. To-day, I was looking at the Sydney Worker-a n organ in which the honourable member for Darling is very keenly interested-and I find that there is not the slightest difficulty in advertising unionisfic wares and unionistic conditions. The signature of that honourable member is appended to an agreement showing the conditions which obtain in the industry he particularly represents, ancl I also find advertisements relating to unionist hotel keepers who are scattered throughout the country. I was very much surprised to find on one page of that newspaper about 120 advertisements of hotels, showing where the union hotels were, where union liquor was to be obtained, and where unionist accommodation was to be found. So that there appears to be no reason why we should come to Parliament to ask for these privileges, seeing that unionists have all the opportunities for self-advertisement that they can possibly desire. not to come here to ask for special powers by legislation, without making out a case snowing the absolute necessity for doing so. when arguing these matters, has acquired the knack lately-and it is a very cunning thing to do-of quoting the opinions of clerics in various parts of the world in happen to be propounding.

I say that I doubt the wisdom of the means which some trade unionists are pursuing in Australia in turning unions into political camps. I say that, in my judgment, the condition of affairs to date furnishes no warrant for the new departure, but rather furnishes reasons for getting back to the sound, sane, and healthy conditions of the past in this respect. The honourable member for Bland the other night quoted Canon Scott-Holland, who happened to say that it would be to our advantage if we made greater inquiry into the conditions under which the articles we purchased were produced.

He summarizes the reason for a trade union label, and he saysThe appeal is made directly to the public, first, cil stops them to understand what the label means(1) It means, or aims to mean, that the work is done tinder wholesome conditions. (2) It ensures or aims to ensure the payment of reasonable wages. (3) It ensures or aims to ensure reasonable hours of work. (4) It stands for the effort of an organization constantly striving to secure and maintain these results. Secondly, the appeal is made to co-operate actively in furthering its use The union label therefore appears to be the only menns of helping the workers in the factories lo help themselves. I point out that the value of that statement is very different in America to what it is in Australia, and for the simple reason that they have not in America the conditions of things that we have here. The honourable member for Bland admitted that the trade unionism of America is of a totally different type from the trade unionism of Australia. They have not gone into the poli tical arena there yet, and they are doing by other means in America, what we already But the have the means of doing throughout the length and breadth of Australia.

If they are, I do not see what limitations are to be imposed on the debate. to follow the methods of the honourable gentleman's party and other parties-ther e are very many parties here; nothing but parties, in fact-the debate will have no natural limitations at all. honourable and learned member has asked me to determine is whether the honourable member for Parramatta is in order in discussing the existence or non-existence of Wages Boards in the various States. As the honourable member has set up the argument that the existence of Wages Boards enables the discrimination to be exercised which is sought in the B ill by providing for thd, registration of the union trade mark, I think his observations are perfectly in order. to enter into a dialogue with other honourable members, and ask them not to inaugurate such a dialogue, I cannot rule him out of order, so long as he follows his present line of discussion. out that the condition of things here is totally different from the condition of things in America. first sought to be attained by the use of union labels in America, namely, the getting of work done under wholesome conditions, can be guaranteed by the various tribunals which have been set up in all the States of Australia except two. thing to prevent those States from setting up such tribunals, and in Queensland the Government have made it part of their policy to pass such' legislation. Other objects are to insure the payment of reasonable wages and the enforcement of reasonable hours of work, both of which come within the province of our Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards. The honourable and I rise to a point of order. learned member for West Sydney on almost every day that he is absent from this House, is engaged in arguing on behalf of such things, and making money out of it , more power to him, in the New South Wales Arbitration Court. He is engaged in seeking for the Court the aid which, -it is alleged, can be secured in America only by the use of trade union labels. If , then, we already have legislative machinery which compasses all the ends which are set out as the objective of the trade union label in America, the proI n my visions of the B ill, though perhaps necessary in that' country, are not necessary here. We have taken other means to get If we are rid of our labour difficulties, and to set up and proclaim to the world the conditions under which our goods must be made. If my honourable friends wish to guarantee to the public that the goods which it buys are made under fair conditions, all they have to do is to remind it that they have been made by the members of the unions registered in the various States. I have yet to learn what advantages, in addition to those which they already enjoy, would come to our industrial toilers if the proposed legislation were passed. A t the best it would overlap other legislation already on the statute-book, and I believe that its ultimate result would be detrimental to those who are now asking for it.

I believe that the toilers of Australia will eventually suffer most from these rash proposals, and therefore I have to take my stand in opposition to the socialistic propaganda as a whole.

The only casesin which misunderstandings occur and bad feeling exists are those in which the employer is enabled to grind down wages and compel his men to work long hours. Dissatisfaction and discontent are rampant in those cases, and there is naturally a feeling, of bitter hatred; but where good conditions are observed, fair wages paid, and the employee feels that he is receiving a fair share of the results of his labour, an excellent feeling prevails. I am quite confident that as the Wages Board system is more understood and more widely applied, a still better feeling will prevail.

All intricate questions and technicalities are easily understood; mistakes and delays are avoided; fresh avenues of trade easily ancl quickly provided for.

686,Mr Mauger,"We are told 'that in Victoria. A large number of manufacturing industries desire to get the benefit of this protection, but they have not yet been able to do so. In Tasmania, Queensland, South' Australia, and Western Australia, there is a large number of industries which are not protected by Wages Boards and industrial legislation, and we wish to apply the union label to their products. We are also asked, what benefit can it do? May I ask in reply, what harm can it do? A very striking illustration of the value of a labela label not registered, but essentially serving the same purpose as a trade union label-wa s brought under my notice in Brisbane about two years ago. An enterprising tradesman there put on his slop clothing this label, "" These goods are made in Victoria under the conditions prescribed by Wages Boards."" He assured me that a large number of the workers in Queensland sent speciallv for this clothing, because, by the use of that label, they were assured that decent wages were received, and proper conditions enjoyed by those who were making them. cheapest to be had, I suppose? quite disagree with my honourable friend's insinuation, ancl also with the honourable member for Parramatta. My experience is that the average trade unionist is fast being educated up to the fact that he is only doing his duty when he buys an article which was produced by the best labour, working under the best conditions, and receiving the best wages. than other men. wishes to make out that he is. . tion that the trade union label, designating as it will the important fact that clothing or footwear was made under proper conditions, in a sanitary building, and by men receiving proper wages, will, to a large extent, attract not only trade unionists but philanthropic men and women, who are anxious to discriminate between sweaters and anarchists and those who work under proper conditions. To show that this proposal does not emanate entirely from trade unionists, let me say that when this agitation was first started in Victoria, the Christian Social Uniona socialistic institution allied to the Church of England-en deavoured, as it was not legal to prepare r a black list, to prepare a list of what they called the "" white traders "" for the purpose of urging on all whom they could influence that it was their duty to go to the shops where they had ascertained that wages and conditions compatible with proper living prevailed. It was only because the movement was not backed up by law that it was not eminently successful. It is being carried out to some extent in the old country, where Canon Scott-Holland, Canon Gore, and other eminent men in the Church of England are continually doing their best to provide some means by which men and women can discriminate as to the wages paid to the workers and the conditions under which they work. It is useful in another respect. A lady has no assurance, when she pays even the highest price for her clothing, that it was made under proper and humane conditions. I know of instances where ladies in this community have paid the highest prices for ready-made mantles, which, unknown to them, had been made under the very worse sweating conditions. Ladies would naturally prefer to go to the shops which placed beyond 1 doubt the fact that the goods had been made under proper conditions by men receiving proper wages. by union labour, and that the buttons were not; would the honourable member allow the union label to be applied to the coat? gnat and swallowing a camel. ber can assure himself that the coat was made under proper conditions, he need He is no better. not worry about the braid or the buttons.

Sydney) -The honourable member for Bland, in an interjection while the honourable member for Parramatta was making his speech, indicated that, in his opinion, the honourable member for Parramatta had changed his views in keeping with his company. In perusing this BillI have asked myself, what is it that is colouring the views of honourable members on the Government side of the House, especially those on the right of the gangway ? How is it that some of them who were responsible for this Bill in its original condition, never saw the necessity for clauses providing for a trade union label? spite of the remarks of some of the members' of the Ministry in connection with this and analogous questions, we find such clauses inserted in this Bill, and every member of the Government Party supporting it? opinion from whatever cause is exceedingly marked in connection with the measure. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat ventured to call the trade union label provisions progressive. Attorney-General, who is in charge of the Bill, indicated that they were provisions that had been in existence in England many years backI think he said hundreds of years; that there was power then to try to preserve to the guilds of England the work of England by the registration of similar marks. not the' effect that was anticipated, and is now anticipated, and the guild marks of Britain became absolutely of no value. rect, I think, except for one instance which the honourable and learned gentleman mav be able to name: and in that instance, I do not think that the guild mark is of much value, though it is still in existence. am sure that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, in questioning the statement of the honourable member for Parramatta, must have misunderstood, him, because I am perfectly certain, from words which 'fell from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, not in this House, but outside, and which are recorded in Hansard, that he and the honourable member for Parramatta are quite in accord. To what was the honourable member for Parramatta referring in the remarks to which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports took exception? He was speaking of political labour leagues are seeking, and have obtained in many cases, the political control of labour unions. give the right to use a label to the political labour leagues. political labour leagues are seeking-and have nearly accomplished their purposeto get the labour unions to become members of their organization. Only by two votes was a motion to bring the unions within the labour leagues lost at a recent How is it that in conference; and it was in connection with that phase of political unionism that the honourable member for Parramatta was speaking. I think that the colouring of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports said on that same phase ? He said on one occasionThe electors hnd to consider whether they would be represented by a person who was the The nominee of a little clique called the Political Labour League, or whether they would send back their present member, who represented, not one section, but all sections of the community.

709,Mr Mauger,"I say it is not only a failurewhich he formerly denounced. that the criticism pf honourable members has been confined practically to one portion of the Bill is because it is generally recognised that there is a necessity for a measure of this sort, and that most of its provisions are such as have been tested by experience in our own land, and in other countries. Consequently there has been a general acceptance of the remainder of the clauses. Any difference of opinion is left to the Committee stage. But there is one very grave departure that has attracted almost the entire criticism of honourable members, and, looking at the Attorney-General's speech in moving the second reading, I find that he gives some reasons for this departure. So far as my reading of the B ill goes, in all other portions it is supposed that the person who applies a trade mark shall be the owner of the goods to which that trade mark is applied. proper limitation. It would safeguard the Bill from many difficulties if it had been adhered to throughout. beyond that safe limitation, enormous complications and difficulties may arise. the Attorney-General, in his speech, stated that this was no novel proposal; that in Great Britain there is a law on the subject. may be correctly quoted. and learned member said that a mark may be applied in various ways, and in some companies each member of the company or guild or trade has had his own special mark to ident if y his workmanship. In various Acts of ParliamentI do not wish to occupy time by enumerating the details of them-the principle has been recognised in England for centuries back of having the goods stamped with the workers' mark. The honourable and learned member also referred to the law of New South Wales, and saidIn the existing Act of New South Wales there wil l be found words to which I invite the attention of honourable members. In that Act a ""trade mark"" is defined as f o l lows :""Trade mark"" includes any mark lawfully used by anv person to denote any goods to be goods of {he manufacture or merchandise of such person, or to be goods of any particular description made or sold by such person. of the definition of "" manufacture.'' orable and learned member went on to sayIn the same section ""manufacture"" is defined to include "" workmanship and production."" The fact Having quoted those provisions, apparently with approval, it might have been anticipated that he would follow them in his B ill ; but such is not the case. The Attorney-General does not give every person the right to register a trade mark, but gives that right, first of all, to the owner of the goods, and, secondly, to a special section of the community, and that section only. Everybody else is excluded, though they may be workmen getting higher pay,, and employed under better conditions than are union workmen. There may be a single individual who cannot form a union, and yet such an individual under British law,, as quoted by the Attorney General, would have power to apply his mark. None but those who are members of trade unions, no matter how well paid they may be, or how good the conditions are under which they work, can take adThat, I think, is a vantage of this measure. refers only to members of guilds or comOnce you step panies. only quoting what the honourable and learned member said.

Only the owner of the goods is allowed by this measure, except as to trade union marks, to register a trade mark; that is my reading of the provision, substantiated by legal opinion. I did not pay for that opinion, but I do not suppose it is any the worse for that; at any rate, it is much better to have a wrong legal opinion for which you have not paid, than to have a wrong opinion for which you have paid. However, my opinion was substantiated by a competent legal opinion, namely, that in other parts of this measure, only the owner of the goods is entitled to apply a registered trade mark. to apply trade marks to goods under this provision. fectly aware of that; but they have the right of registration, which is not given to other workers. is not given to other workers, however much they may desire to have their mark applied. The honourable member for Bland, whose Ministry introduced this measure in the Senate, said that he did not insert these provisions, because he did not know that under the law of EnglandI think that was his meaning-ther e was any provision to prevent such a registration, ancl he did not suppose there was under the Bill. If the honourable member was satisfied with the law of England, why did he not adopt it? I believe the honourable member is still under the impression that there was no restriction under the Bill. that I had since been informed on legal authority that the law of England did not allow of such registration. these circumstances, I shall not proceed with my remarks on that point. I understood the honourable member to mean that he believed the law of England did allow registration. It only mv impression. it seems to me that there is another distinction which, fhough not larger than that It only I have already mentioned the latter is large enough-is important.

I have already explained that unless the intention is to assist the formation of unions by a method which should not be adopted for that purpose, then any body legitimately forming an association that might be as closely connected with the manufacture of an article as is a trade union should have the same opportunity to register a trade mark as is here given to a trade union. I think that this proposal really has the same political object as the unrestricted preference to unionists that was sought to be embodied in the Conciliation ancl Arbitration Bill. It is to increase political power. It is to make the joining of unions almost compulsory, ancl to give the political Labour Party, of which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports spoke so harshly and so eloquently, additional power, by adding to the strength of the unions which they partially control now, but which they hope to control entirely in the future. That, to my mind, is the evident object of these provisions. It is said that registration of a label is not compulsory, and that it need not be used by employers. I consider that one of the worse features in the Bill is that the measure, as brought in by the Government, does not say what shall or ought to be compulsory, but leaves the compulsion to the members of the unions. That creates a cause of bitterness at once. The measure says, "" You can have what you ask for, but if you want to enforce it , it must be by your own compulsion."" That creates at once a burning cause of bitterness between employers and employees. union is to benefit by the provision-and if it is not, I shouicl like to know why it is proposed-it must compel the use of the union label, and the whole force of the union must be brought to bear to accomplish what the Government propose for it in this measure. gentleman say that a man who has a trade mark must 'nave compulsion in order to benefit by it? everv man who has a trade mark must see that it is used, if he wishes to benefit by it .

Does the honourable member for Bland say that his experience as a business man tells him anything else? not meant to be used, but it depends upon the public whether they will give it effect. same way a trade union will register a trade mark because it will be meant to be used. lawful means to see that it is used. MrD UGALD THOMSON -Of course, and the trade unions mean to compel the employers to use their labels. What will be the means resorted to? Do honourable members think that we are simpletons ? Do we not know what will be the means? It will be the boycott of the goods of those who do not use the trade union labels. Honourable members should not come here with such exaggerated innocence as to say that that will not be the means. It will be the means, and it will be another cause of difficulty and bitterness. I may allude to a remark made by the honourable member for Moira, who said there could not be strife because unions cannot strike. That is not accurate. The honourable member was alluding, of course, to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, but as a matter of fact, we know that under that Act, unions can strike to any extent. The reason the honourable member saw for the introduction of Would the honourable this provision, is a reason which, in the opinion of other honourable members, as well as in my opinion, proves that it is not necessary.

The protest from the Ministerial corner as to the delay in pushing on with public business is one of the richest I have ever heard. The honourable member for Grey rightly said that nothing had been done by this Parliament for the last' two years, but, he forgot to mention that that was due to the obstructive tactics of honourable members of the Labour Party; that it was due to speeches consisting of pure drivel surely referring to his own sDeeches. to speeches extending over five or six hours madeTiy members of the Labour Party. made by the honourable member for Macquarie, and the speech on the Standing Orders made by the honourable member for Dalley? were made during the first Parliament.

No doubt we shall have these protests repeated every week-perhap s every night-durin g the remainder of the session. The Labour Party are, of course, responsible. They have the power to turn out the Government at any moment, and if any one expects that they are going to submit quietly to the ordinary process of government he makes a very great mistake. The Labour Party have the power, and we see to-night how they are beginning to utilize it. They are going to flog the Ministry into carrying out theirevery wish, and we shall look on, with the greatest possible anxiety for the reputation of constitutional government, to see how far the Labour Party will proceed with this kind of flagellation.
