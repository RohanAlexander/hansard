Andrea West will be remembered by many people here as an incredibly diligent, focused and committed woman. She was also a person who brought her teaching experience, which is often a very rare thing in this place, to the federal parliament. Andrea and I worked together in 2001 and I have remarkable memories of working together in the Redlands area. I only wish that I had been able to see more of Andrea’s time in the parliament in those two years and her successful campaign directed by her father, Bill. Many on my side will remember that Andrea worked as part of the class of ‘96, with the incoming Howard government, to fight one of the toughest battles of all-to sell a new tax to a local community. Many would say that the battle to convince people of the merits of the GST was something that Andrea really took to heart and that it may have had something to do with the election results of 1998 in the seat of Bowman, which saw the Hon. Con Sciacca retake the seat. One thing is sure: Andrea always had a fantastic relationship with people on both sides of the chamber, in every corner of Bowman, groups like Zonta and Toastmasters as well as Con Sciacca and me. One thing that runs as a common thread through the seat of Bowman, even though its boundaries may have been reconfigured slightly, is that very close relationship between the people who have represented the area and between local members. Redlands is a really special part of South-East Queensland. It sits with its own local jurisdiction. It takes its local representatives very much to heart and considers them as locals and part of a very tight community. The boundaries of the seat have moved very little and it gave Andrea the wonderful opportunity to represent this part of South-East Queensland. I remember she used to jump onto the ferries and make her way out to the populated North Stradbroke Island, which is the particular privilege of members of Bowman to do. When one is having a hard day one can always go there, sit at the Stradbroke Island Beach Hotel and gaze over to Moreton Island. Living at Wellington Point Andrea was really committed to work on the ground in that suburb, in Birkdale and Capalaba. Andrea was patron of a number of local groups and her family, her husband, Jeremy, and all of her children, lived, as I always say, in the nerve centre of Redlands and the seat of Bowman. Andrea played a really consistent role even after she had lost that seat, and that is the mark of a good local member as well. Even having lost the seat she remained really active in and committed to the Liberal Party and made an enormous contribution to helping me run for that seat in 2001. I remember during that campaign that Con Sciacca said to me, ‘I wish you luck, son; I just hope it takes you more than once.’ I enjoyed sharing that with Andrea and all of my time working with her, as I know people on both sides of the chamber did. We offer our best wishes to her husband, Jeremy, and her children, Felicity, Anthony and Nicholas. MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Terms Bill 2010

Fernvale is a part of the Somerset regional area which has been redistributed into the federal electorate of Blair. In representing the Deputy Prime MinisterI opened the new resource centre, the new multipurpose hall and the new level sports field. David Raine, the principal, has been there for many years, from when the school numbered just over 200 students, and there are currently 530 students. I want to congratulate Mr Raine, the P&C, particularly Mr Jeff Kalinowski, the Fernvale P&C president, and Mr Graham Peel, the immediate past president of the P&C, and his wife for their foresight. Mr Raine said that his dreams came true with this BER funding. At $3.2 million it is the biggest school funding initiative in the Somerset region. Also present were the state member for Ipswich West, Mr Wayne Wendt, and Mr Graeme Lehman, the mayor of the Somerset Regional Council. Robin Maycock, the program manager for TBH told me that 200 jobs were created by this particular project. It is a wonderful initiative. The multipurpose hall caters for about 800 students, because the growth in this area is simply enormous. One thousand new lots have been approved for the Somerset Regional Council. This is, of course, part of the BER funding and commitment to our local education. In the Somerset region there are about 18 schools. Somerset, now added to the Blair electorate, was part of the electorates of Dickson and Fisher. This has been warmly welcomed by the electorate of Blair, which has a strong connection with Ipswich. But the member for Dickson was not there; he sent an apology. He did not vote for this funding, and I made it pretty plain to the people there that he did not support this. I was very pleased to have voted for this funding. The Deputy Mayor of the Somerset Regional Council was not there either. If he had been in parliament he would not have voted for it either, for that matter. The truth is that this initiative, which created jobs in this area, brought forward great funding initiatives. The school community loved this project. It gave a great opportunity to the people of Lower Somerset and to the young children there. It is simply a shame and a tragedy that the member for Dickson did not vote for the project. He did not have the foresight and the fortitude to stand up for his local community when he represented it. That is the truth. Those opposite are big, strong, courageous people back home in their electorates, but here they do not stand up for the school communities and we know that for a fact. Dickson Electorate: Home Insulation Program edy surrounding the Labor government’s bungled roof insulation scheme. The fallout from the scheme, which is just one of Mr Rudd’s long list of broken promises, has left legitimate small businesses with great uncertainty and little hope of surviving into the future. We all remember when Mr Rudd got out his notepad and pen and told installers that he had ‘got it’ and would assist them by fixing the scheme. That promise stands in stark contrast to Labor’s treatment of Mr Covill, a Dickson installer who now faces great uncertainty after investing in the industry. After Mr Rudd stopped the scheme dead in its tracks, Mr Covill contacted the minister for assistance. To this day, the only reply he ever received was an acknowledgement via email that the minister had received his letter. The minister has not even had the decency to respond adequately to my own inquiries on Mr Covill’s behalf. On9 April, I wrote to the minister seeking assistance for Mr Covill.

He has never received anything by way of guidance or assistance. has been trying, without success, to get assistance from the minister. Green Rebate Insulation is owed $180,000 by the Rudd government for the work they did under Mr Rudd’s scheme. Month after month, they have contacted the government without any response or result. This inaction filters through to the whole business community and ultimately it is affecting local families and workers. For example, Mrs Pascoe of PR Print in Lawnton waits patiently for $30,000 for work she did for an installer, which in turn is waiting for the government to pay for its past work. While the government does nothing to pay the installers or to settle the accounts it encouraged setting up, other companies bear the debts installers owe to them and so on. The list of examples is endless. Baigrie Electricians of Petrie helped the government inspect homes following the insulation debacle. Despite the fact that they fixed several dangerous faults-and potentially saved lives-the government cannot even manage to pay the $6,732 they are owed for their services. This government just keeps getting worse. While the insulation scheme may no longer be front-page news, the reality is that this fiasco continues on in the background. It continues to impact the lives of local businesses and local families in Dickson. If the government cannot manage to put free insulation into roofs, there is no way the Australian people can trust it to manage anything more serious, like hospitals or the economy. Imagine a second term Labor government-think Anna Bligh. Calwell Electorate: National Refugee Week Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (4.09 pm)-I rise today to speak about National Refugee Week, which we are celebrating this week. Last Friday the launch of National Refugee Week in my electorate attracted a huge gathering at the Broadmeadows Town Hall. As the member for Calwell, I represent a constituency which has welcomed many refugees from across the world. I am proud to represent my constituents because they serve as a real living example of the contributions made by refugees who now call Australia home. Those attending included members of the Bhutanese community, numbering around 300 people, which is a small but emerging community in my electorate. In attendance also were members of the Chaldean and Assyrian Iraqi community, the Somali community, Sri Lankan community and many more. Refugees have long been welcomed in Calwell. It is a community which upholds the Australian ethos of a fair go by working alongside our newest Australians and helping them to create a better life not only for themselves but also for the rest of the community. This year’s theme for National Refugee Week ‘Freedom from fear’ is one which by the end of 2011 will have been used for three consecutive years. It is an apt theme because it highlights the need for the community to engage with our newest migrants to make them feel welcome-to see them as fellow human beings rather than through the lenses of hysteria or xenophobia. It is also a theme which highlights the refugee experience the world over which ultimately can be shaped by fear or a welcoming attitude. I am very glad that we not only here in Australia but also in my electorate have chosen the latter-a welcoming attitude. MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Constituency Statements
230,Mrs Mccallum Of Green Rebate Insulation At Brendale Is Another Dickson Constituent Who,"Australia has long been a welcoming country for people from across the world, and this welcoming culture has long been extended to our refugees. I say this in spite of the negativity of public debate that sometimes clouds our ability to celebrate the valuable contributions made by refugees to the overall social character of Australia. It does not serve our humanity as parliamentarians or as a community if we buy into this idea that refugees are queuejumpers invading our shores in droves and that somehow because of this they are less deserving of seeking asylum. The fact is asylum seekers account for less than seven per cent of our overall immigration intake, and 90 per cent of asylum seekers are found to be genuine refugees. National Refugee Week, therefore, is an important event because it allows us to truly reflect on the successful integration of all Australians-both our newest Australians and those more established Australians. We need to better understand why people come to Australia and this allows us to understand the importance of the contribution that refugees have long made and continue to make to Australia. I am glad that all of us, regardless of our individual stories, our own experiences and journeys can call Australia home and we need to continue to extend this welcome to people seeking refuge in our home. Paterson Electorate: Queen’s Birthday Honours the Paterson Electorate: Ronald Franks, Howard Grigor, Diane Bennett, Doris Brooker and Charles Munnery. Each has made an outstanding contribution to the local community. They have now been honoured with the medal of the Order of Australia in the General Division. I would like to add my sincere congratulations and say you thank you on behalf of an entire electorate of Paterson which, through their contribution, has been made a better place. Firstly, I would like to say a few words about Medowie resident Howard Grigor. This is not the first time. I have had the pleasure of recognising Howard who was Paterson’s citizen of the year in 2005. He is a decorated hard working Rotary member who has travelled across the world to help others in need. He was also a driving force behind the restoration of Williamtown Hall and has worked extensively to better the lives of disabled people through programs such as Sailability and Riding for the Disabled. I also had the honour of awarding Paterson’s citizen of the year to Vacy resident Doris Brooker in 2009. She too has been recognised with an OAM. The 96-year-old Doris has worked with the Country Women’s Association for more than 30 years and has been an active member of the Australian Red Cross for double that time. Doris has opened her home to many local people and she has been an inspiration for many more. NextI would like to say a few words about Diane Bennett who has dedicated her time to others through the Clarence Town Rural Fire Brigade for more than 20 years. Diane was named Dungog citizen of the year in 2009 for doing what she loves and, testament to her dedication, told a journalist from the Maitland Mercury newspaper that she was embarrassed to be recognised at all. She said, ‘I just do what I do.’ Ronald Franks, from Hawks Nest, has been honoured for service as a volunteer. While being president of a community group is a big responsibility for any one person, Ron has been president of three groups and an active member of many more. These include positions with the Lions Club of Tea Gardens, Salvation Army and Tea Gardens Motor Club. Ron was also MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Constituency Statements
231,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (4.12 Pm),"I rise today to recognise five special residents in the Tea Gardens RSL sub-branch president for nine years and was instrumental in establishing the war memorial in ANZAC Park. Finally, I would like to acknowledge Charles Munnery, of Raymond Terrace, who has worked with veterans, their families and the wider region for over half a century through Legacy and the RSL. He has helped raise vital funds for veterans, youth clubs and the disabled. Those five people have dedicated thousands of hours to people and places in the Paterson community and are a wonderful example of what we can all achieve. TodayI would like to honour them and, again, say thank you. They set a brilliant example for others, and we can all take inspiration from their dedication. Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union: Clean Start Campaign Ms SAFFIN (Page) (4.15 pm)-Last week I attended a breakfast meeting in this place. It was organised by the LHMU to kick off their Clean Start campaign in Australia’s shopping centres. The Deputy Prime Minister attended, along with my electorate office manager, herself a previous LHMU organiser but also, importantly, prior to becoming an organiser a cleaner in our schools. The key guests at this breakfast were the cleaners who keep clean our shopping centres all over Australia. We MPs all met small groups and listened to their work related stories. That is why they were there. All are proud of what they do. They just simply want time to do it, to do it with dignity, to do it properly and to not be expected to be in two or more places at once. Some said they could be cleaning up one crisis and get called to another. They found it difficult to manage that with the demands of being in big shopping centres, in particular, being in different places and all needed at the same time. They all want to be treated with dignity and, to be fair, many are. But dignity has a number of defining characteristics. It is about giving workers enough time to do their work well, and cleaning is important because it also has a big public health function. The campaign goes back to 2006, when the LHMU launched the Clean Start campaign. It was to highlight the crisis in the cleaning industry and to improve jobs for cleaners. You may remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that they stood together, in front of CBD office towers, and they talked to tenants and they told their stories. Cleaners in every capital city were out and about, helping to build consensus for the reform that was needed in the industry. LHMU cleaners, alongside government and commercial property owners, responsible contractors, made great strides to improve both the quality and reliability of CBD office-cleaning services. This is the message from the LHMU’s Clean Start campaign in Australia’s shopping centres: ‘Now it’s time to deliver the same improvements to the cleaners, owners, managers, tenants and customers of Australian shopping centres.’ When the LHMU had the Clean Start campaign the Deputy Prime Minister, on behalf of the federal government, wrote to all state governments asking them to support Clean Start. That is what we have been asked to do. They will follow up with members of parliament and ask us to do particular things. I pledge my support to cleaners campaigning for a clean start in shopping centres and I commit to helping them have their voices heard over the coming months. McMillan Electorate: Port Welshpool Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority administrative offices, tourist information and the aquarMAIN COMMITTEE",172,Constituency Statements
232,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (4.18 Pm),"The development in Townsville of the Greatium, along with boat based ecotourism throughout the reef, has created many jobs, offsetting job losses in the commercial fishing industry. This regional management and promotion of marine conservation is also playing a vital role in Australia’s tourism industry, generating overseas visitors and valuable export income for the nation. Port Welshpool in my electorate has the potential to do the same. It was once a fishing, shipping and air travel gateway to the Bass Strait islands, with over 100 fishing boats. Now there are less than a dozen and the airport has been closed, without the business of ferrying crews and catch. Recently, a number of state and Commonwealth marine protected areas have also been declared over the fishing grounds of the former fleet of this port but, as yet, there is no infrastructure from which to develop ecotourism of Townsville and other coastal areas near the Barrier Reef or south-west Western Australia. Another great asset, the Port Welshpool Long Jetty, was closed in 2003 but is about to become the centre of an exciting community driven ecotourism development. A local non-profit group in my community, Welshpool and District Advisory Group, has raised $5 million worth of investment from Marine and Civil Pty Ltd, which has also recognised the potential of this project in the region, to install an underwater observatory in the Long Jetty. This will be one of the most exciting tourist developments on the east coast for more than 20 years. In Busselton, Western Australia, an observatory built by the same company is now generating between 60,000 and 90,000 visitors annually, with a calculated net economic benefit of over $10 million. The Long Jetty project has the potential to provide the seed for the growth of ecotourism in Bass Strait. With over 100 islands, massive numbers of dolphins, whales and seals and an extraordinary variety of marine life, much of it unique to the region, the ecotourism of Bass Strait is yet to be developed. For taxpayers there is huge potential in these coastal communities for return on investment in maintaining and restoring basic infrastructure, like the jetty at Port Welshpool, for ecotourism. The underwater observatory will provide the customer base for many other businesses and will generate overseas tourism from Bass Strait ecotourism ventures. A third of the Busselton observatory visitors are from overseas, and so it will be at Port Welshpool-or better, being so close to the Phillip Island penguins. The other personal interest that I have in the Port Welshpool Long Jetty is that those who are disabled have always had access to the jetty for fishing. Disability services are very close to my heart. It is very important that a jetty like the Long Jetty should be reopened so that there is access, including access for wheelchairs, for fishing and other day activities for people with disabilities. It is a great opportunity for the electorate as a whole. Corio Electorate: Ryrie Street have spoken before in this place about Geelong’s strength as a heritage city and, I believe, our tendency to undersell that heritage. TodayI would like to talk about one particular street that is especially important because its architectural story is the story of our city. From the earliest days Ryrie Street or, as it was once known, Great Ryrie Street, formed the central core of Geelong, a city which dates back as far as 1838. Ryrie Street was the traditional commercial strip that evolved as the town grew and it can still lay claim to being a great and grand thoroughfare. There is a wonderful photo of Ryrie Street, dating back to 1917, which shows a wide boulevard of merchants and country businesses. This was the age before Ford, and the street is dotted with horsedrawn carriages, cyclists and the odd pedestrian. Down the middle of the MAIN COMMITTEE",173,Constituency Statements
233,Mr Marles (Corio,"Parliamentary Secretary for Innovation and Industry) (4.21 pm)-Istreet were tramlines, indicating the arrival of electricity. In 1917 Geelong was an important provincial transport and trading centre and had been the wool capital of Australia for well over half a century. The buildings in Ryrie Street chart that history. The old telegraph station, built in 1857, is one of Geelong’s earliest and most historic buildings. It represents Geelong’s Georgian past and reminds us that, unlike Ballarat and Bendigo, Geelong was a pre gold rush town and a major centre of trading and shipping. The building is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register, as is the old post office next door, which dates back to 1889. This is a classic boom-time building, when the restraint of colonial architecture gave way to optimism and extravagance. From the 1860s furniture warehouse at 34 Ryrie Street to the 1870s YMcA building through to the 1915 market building, Ryrie Street plots the evolution of Geelong in stone and brick. These days not all the buildings are at their best. In the 1960s building owners were forced to remove verandahs because the posts were considered a hazard to cars. It seems hard to believe now that such a thing could happen, and unfortunately many buildings still bear the scars of that decision. In 2006 the Geelong Verandah Study was completed, and this is a valuable reference point in the city’s planning scheme. It provides advice on appropriate signage design, colour schemes and the reinstallation of verandahs, taking current safety and building regulations into account. To their credit, some owners have rebuilt verandahs. The Geelong art supplies building is a recent example. Much of Ryrie Street is in the Geelong Commercial Heritage Area, which provides a level of heritage protection. But more can be done. Already the Victorian government, through the Transit Cities unit, is promoting shop-top apartments. There is great potential for these and other developments to enhance the city’s heritage values. We do not want to recreate the past and we cannot do that, but by acknowledging the past we can breathe new life into Ryrie Street. It can become one of the region’s and the state’s best tourist attractions. On 22 JulyI will meet with representatives of the City of Greater Geelong, among them the city’s consultant heritage adviser, Dr David Rowe, and Councillor Cameron Grainger. We will walk down the street. Everyone is invited to attend. Broadband Network announcement yesterday by the federal government and the lauding of this policy. The government went to the last election with a $4 billion policy, which has now become a $43 billion policy, with a very scant economic model. Any of the modelling that I have seen would ask: why have businesses in the private sector not already done it if the project is so good? What they have apparently offered-that is, what they have come to a heads of agreement with Telstra for-is $9 billion compensation to Telstra. In other words, that will go to Telstra shareholders, with another $2 billion to follow. Where is the economic modelling to say that the access to infrastructure that they are going to give to the National Broadband Network, to the NBN, is worth $11 billion? The Telstra board have a responsibility to call an extraordinary shareholders meeting before the next federal election and explain their decision to their shareholders. In the announcement yesterday the Prime Minister said that this would not be wrapped up until after the federal election. I would say Telstra’s board of management and executives were perhaps a part of the Rudd government’s re-election team, unless they were MAIN COMMITTEE",174,Constituency Statements
234,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (4.24 Pm),"I rise to speak on the National Broadbandprepared to go to their shareholders and give an open account of why the access to infrastructure they were giving to the NBN was worth $11 billion. It could be worth more. Let us get a commercial assessment of what it is worth. Then we might have some open accountability in this government, which we see very little of. The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy and the Prime Minister said, on the one hand, ‘The whole of Australia will have access to high-speed internet through the optic fibre cable network,’ and yet they said, ‘Ten per cent of it will remain on copper.’ The minister for communications on the ABC this morning said that 10 per cent would remain on copper. That will be those communities with fewer than 1,000 people. It will probably end up being communities with fewer than 2,000 or 3,000 people. The solution from the minister was, ‘Possibly they will get wireless or satellite internet.’ That is not what they said, prior to the last federal election, they believed they could deliver. I say to the people of rural and regional Australia: do not buy this model, because if they are re-elected you will have to carry the commercial risk for the $43 billion, $33 billion or $32 billion of borrowings but you will not get the benefit of optic fibre cable delivered to your community. It was quite clear from the minister for communications that 10 per cent of Australia would not be participating in this rollout of optic fibre cable. There is a long way to go in this debate, and I for one will want to keep this minister, this government and Telstra’s board of management held to account. (Time expired) Deakin Electorate: Foundation Skills Package visit to the Swinburne TAFE campus in Croydon in my electorate to talk about the Foundation Skills Package, a $120 million Rudd government investment. The package itself was designed to help over 140,000 Australians over the next four years. Part of that package, the Language, Literacy and Numeracy program, was designed to help 70,000 workers through to 2014. The training measures funded under this package build on existing Australian government foundation skills programs, namely the Workplace English, Language and Literacy program and, as I said, the Language, Literacy and Numeracy program. The LLNP provides up to 800 hours of free accredited language, literacy and numeracy training for eligible job seekers whose skills are below the level considered necessary to secure sustainable employment or pursue further education and training. This program expands the number of places available. When I went to Swinburne in late May, I met with students who were taking training and actually upskilling themselves. I met people like Melville Pereira, who was studying English at Swinburne. He said the adult literacy classes allowed people to retrain for a different occupation. They have made him proficient to operate a computer and helped him to brush up on his English and maths. They have also given him an interest in pursuing further education. I also met Jason Pearce, an English and maths student, who said prior to taking on the course he lacked self-confidence and motivation. That was two years ago, and he has moved ahead in leaps and bounds. He did not believe in his spelling and maths before he started the course and had no idea of what he wanted to do in terms of a working life. Leaving school at year 10 meant that he found the work that he did both hard and stressful. The teachers and assistants, as Jason said, had done such a good job spending a lot of their time helping him and pushing him to believe in himself. As I said, they had given him a goal in life.

Finance and Deregulation Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $668,590,000 regulation for agreeing to turn up and answer a few questions. I have no doubt that he will be assiduous in giving answers to the very legitimate questions that I would like to put here today. One of the prime responsibilities of a finance minister is to ensure value for money in the spending of taxpayers’ funds and to ensure that there is no waste and no mismanagement. I refer to the minister’s speech to the Press Club on 8 August 2007 where he seemed to confirm this responsibility. He said: Every tax dollar the government takes from a family’s bank account is a dollar that can’t be spent on clothes, schoolbooks, groceries or holidays. It’s a dollar that won’t be directly creating jobs in the private sector. When the government takes that dollar, it’s got a responsibility to ensure that it provides value for money in return I have a series of questions that I would like to ask which relate to that statement, one I agree very strongly with. Minister, it has been reported in a new book by Lenore Taylor and David Uren, which quotes a Labor insider in relation to stimulus spending-the government taking taxpayers’ dollars and spending them: Tanner argued vigorously against a spending package. … … … The problem for Tanner was that, while he still needed to be convinced, Rudd and Swan had already decided. Does the minister still remain opposed to stimulus spending? Is he troubled by the fact that the government is continuing its reckless stimulus spending through until 2011-12 after one quarter of negative growth back in 2008? Furthermore, in overseeing the potential for waste and mismanagement, why is it that under the minister’s watch Labor’s promised program of computers in schools for every student in years 9 to 12 has so far delivered only 220,000 of MAIN COMMITTEE",176,Constituency Statements

238,Mr Robb (Goldstein) (4.33 Pm),"I am very grateful to the Minister for Finance and Dethe one million computers and a blow-out of $1 billion? Why is it that Labor promised to cut spending in consultancies but have instead awarded $1.2 billion in consultancy contracts since coming to office? Why is it that Labor promised broadband for $4.7 billion but broke that promise, replacing it with a plan for $43 billion, in the process wasting $20 million on a cancelled tender process and spending over $25 million on yet another report by consultants, all for a white elephant that will put up to $43 billion of taxpayers’ money at risk? Mr Tanner interjecting Mr Tanner interjectinggram that is to cost $16.7 billion-some of these numbers should be fairly fixed in your mind, I would have thought-independent assessment has found in at least two or three instances that these school halls cost four times the amount of similar commercial buildings? Why are we seeing billions and billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money potentially wasted? If that were repeated throughout the building phase you would probably be talking about somewhere between $5 billion and $6 billion of the $16.7 billion literally wasted when it could have been done for much less. Also, Minister, why is it that border protection, having seen at least a $1 billion blow-out this year, has an estimate for next year based on an assumption that only 2,000 asylum seekers will arrive over the next 12 months of 2010-11 when 5,500 have arrived to date in this financial year? It is a billion-dollar blow-out in this financial year with 5,500 arrivals, so you can understand the blow-out, but why is it that an assumption of 2,000 arriving next year is then made? (Time expired) give a generic answer to the shadow minister’s question. I will endeavour to go through them item by item. Apologies if I miss any; feel free to remind me of them. First, it is correct to say that the Minister for Finance and Deregulation has responsibility that encompasses government waste and use of taxpayers’ money, but that is a responsibility that is shared with other government ministers. As I am sure the shadow minister, as a former minister, would understand, there are things called the Financial Management and Accountability Act and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act which govern the arrangements that apply here with regard to the responsibilities for managing the spending of government money with respect to both the finance minister and individual ministers. So there is, in effect, a shared responsibility with a specific role for the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, but other ministers also inevitably have responsibilities that are crucial to this overall approach. First with respect to the question arising from the book that he refers to, obviously I do not make public comments about things I am alleged to have said or not said in cabinet or cabinet committee deliberations, and that remains my position. I can only refer him to a quote that I did provide the authors of the book, which was along the lines that I brought to these discussions, as you would expect, a traditional finance minister’s responsibility of seeking to test propositions that were put to me. I would say of any spending proposals that I see that as a central part of my responsibility, to undertake that testing or challenging of any proposals, whether inside committee decision-making processes or indeed matters that are put to me biMAIN COMMITTEE",177,Appropriation Bill No 1 2010 2011

241,Mr Tanner (Melbourne,"Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (4.38 pm)-I firstlaterally by ministers. That is essentially my job. But otherwise I do not comment on the deliberations of cabinet or cabinet committees. With respect to the specific matters that the shadow minister did raise, there are some matters that are more specifically within the purview of individual ministers rather than me as minister for finance. I will endeavour to go through them one by one with that caveat. First on the computers in schools program, as you would be aware, there has been a set of negotiations with state governments about the process. That did lead to some modification compared with the original election commitment. We are fulfilling the election commitment but nonetheless in order to reach agreement with the states there was an additional financial commitment involved there. Second, with respect to consultancies, the statement in the question from the shadow minister is incorrect. In fact, spending on consultancies across the government in calendar year 2008 and again in calendar year 2009 is substantially lower than it was in calendar year 2007 under the Howard government. The fall in expenditure in calendar year 2008 was about $65 million. All these are on-the-record figures and I would suggest that the shadow minister not be misled by highly distorted material that has been published in the Australian. All these things are a matter of public record, that there has been very clear and substantial reduction in spending on consultancies under the Rudd government. Third, on the question of the broadband proposals, the shadow minister will probably recall that the then opposition went to the election with a commitment to a fibre-to-the-node proposal for a broadband network which involved optical fibre going to nodes in individual streets rather than all the way to individual households and businesses. You will be aware that the tender process for that did not produce a successful outcome, partly because it ended up occurring very much at the peak of the global financial crisis and a number of potential bidders were undoubtedly disadvantaged by the fact that the availability of capital for things of this nature was inevitably constrained given the circumstances. The government, confronted with this situation, chose to move in effect to what was always seen as the logical next step, although no previous commitment had been made to do this. The government chose the logical next step of building a fibre-to-the-premises network. (Extension of time granted) On the question of the Building the Education Revolution primary school buildings, I am not aware of the two or three specific instances that the shadow minister alleges that buildings that cost four times the equivalent being built in the private sector were constructed. The shadow minister would be aware that there is currently a taskforce headed by former US CEO Brad Orgill examining all of these questions. I am happy to rely on the report that emerges from that taskforce in terms of the issues that have been raised here. We do accept that in a situation where you have got thousands upon thousands of individual projects all around the country the nature of the construction sector is such that every now and then there will be disputes and there will be problems. We regard the prospect that there will be individual issues of this kind as something that is an unavoidable aspect of having so many individual construction projects. We do not necessarily accept some of the assertions that have been published. In my experience, the descriptions that have been published that I have looked at in some detail, almost invariably, have been somewhat at odds with the facts or have been selective in the use MAIN COMMITTEE of facts. There have been aspects of the picture that have been not been referred to that would clearly modify any reasonable balanced assessment of the claims being made. Finally, I would suggest that the border protection questions are probably better directed to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship because the basis for forward estimates and the numbers of prospective claims is something that is very much a matter for the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. I would also draw the shadow minister’s attention to instances in the past where there have been much smaller estimates put in place that have been, shall we say, out distanced by the actual number of arrivals, instances from the time that the Howard government was in office. I refer him to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship on the question of estimating, for forward estimates purposes, the number of arrivals. to some more specific questions. I have sought to follow up with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. He has said publicly that he has got no idea how many will come next year. I would like to know the rationale behind it. I presume you and your department take some responsibility for ensuring that the numbers make sense and that you can have reasonable confidence in the assumptions. Given that this year there were 5,500 arrivals and a billion dollar blow out, I would be interested to know what process you went through to arrive at a figure of 2,000 for next year. Given that you have had a blow out this year, I would have thought that, conservatively, you would use a higher number or as high a number as this year. If you succeed in reducing the numbers well and good, but the experience to date is there seems to be no evidence of numbers coming back so I would be interested in that process. Secondly, the Building the Education Revolution, as you say, has thousands of different projects but, whether there is one or thousands, it still remains the responsibility of the government to act in a conscientious and prudent way to avoid waste. It seems to me you are really putting the proposition that government, with thousands of projects, cannot be expected to dot every ‘i’ and cross every ‘t’. Would that be the case? I understand the point you were making that there are joint responsibilities between individual ministers and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. The point of my question was what specifically have you sought to do to rein in what is clearly some of the biggest wastage perhaps in our country’s history of federal government programs including the massive wastage which will end up, no doubt, in billions of dollars with the Home Insulation Program? There have been billions of dollars wasted, on the evidence to date, which seems to me to be a lot more than the occasional problem here and there. What specifically have you done over the last six months when it became patently obvious that there were generic problems in the management of these programs and when those ministers responsible, for whatever reason, were failing to rein in these programs? I would have thought you have a significant responsibility. How did you exercise that responsibility? I would be very interested to know. You made a statement about the $4.7 billion that the program was in prospect and that because of the global financial crisis funds were not available for commercial interests, but you went on to say that, as a result, you went to the next logical step of fibre to the house. Was it always intended that the next logical step would be fibre to the house and that it would involve massive government involvement in the creation of that network, the funding of that MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Appropriation Bill No 1 2010 2011
242,Mr Robb (Goldstein) (4.36 Pm),"I will follow a couple of those issues and then move onnetwork, the operation of that network and, hopefully, the financial return on that network? Was it envisaged that you would in fact renationalise a very big part of telecommunications? Was that the logical next step for the government? As you thought through this program, was that in your head when you went to the last election and promised a broadband network around the country? Is what we are not getting the thing you have always had in mind as the logical next step? On other specific items: on page 84 in Budget Paper No. 2, nearly $1.3 billion was listed as decisions taken but not yet announced over the forward estimates with $50 million listed between 2009-10 and 2010-11. Can you rule out these funds being announced ahead of the federal election? (Time expired) spect to the supplementary question asked by the member for Goldstein on matters regarding asylum seekers, I will take that question on notice in order to give him a proper response. Secondly, I do not accept the premise on which his further question about the Building the Education Revolution program was unfolded. SoI do not accept his claims with respect to waste. I am afraid that for me to answer the question he asks me about what specifically did I do, that would involve me revealing cabinet discussions and cabinet deliberations, which I am not in a position to do. Penultimately, on the question of the move from a fibre-to-the-node proposal, as put to the election, with the fibre-to-the-home National Broadband Network proposal, when I said that that was seen as a logical next step I did not say that this was seen as a logical next step by a specific party-that is, the federal opposition. This was generally widely in public debates seen as, in effect, a stepping stone. That does not therefore mean that the opposition at the time had any specific subsequent commitment in mind. We were aware of that possibility but we had made no decision about it and had no preconceptions about it. Once the tender process for the fibre-to-the-node proposal failed, we had to give consideration to that possibility along with various other possibilities, but there was no preconceived proposal flowing in the wake of the original election proposal. Finally, on the decisions taken but not yet announced, I am not in a position to rule anything in or out about how those matters are dealt with. Apart from anything else, it is not my responsibility. My responsibility in this regard is simply that these things are accurately recorded in the budget, but I am certainly not in a position to make any statements about when any particular thing will be announced. the last issue that the minister responded to-decisions taken but not yet announced-I ask a supplementary question. Could you confirm, Minister, that the $400 million announced by the Prime Minister on 9 June as part of the renamed Regional Infrastructure Fund was taken from this line item in the budget? I was going to ask you more about the disbursement, but I understand from your earlier answer that you claim not to be in a position to do that. More specifically on some of the other issues: why is it that you and your department are being sidelined regarding the $16.2 billion school halls program after the Deputy Prime Minister established a $14 million task force, which will be led by Mr Brad Orgill, to assess the level of waste under this program?

That way we can do this formally. have been sidelined in relation to the investigation into the level of waste and mismanagement under the Building the Education Revolution program? Shouldn’t this have been the job of the minister and the minister’s department? Given also that the department of finance is responsible for sustainable government finances, does the minister think that the Building the Education Revolution was value for money and good policy? Given that Australia recorded one quarter of negative growth in 2008, why is it that $500 million of the stimulus funding under the Building the Education Revolution program will be spent in 2011-12 at a time when real GDP growth is forecast to be four per cent and CPI at 2.5 per cent, and this following six consecutive interest rate rises which have added between $4,000 to $5,000 to the average home mortgage? Furthermore, what role did the minister perform in relation to developing the Home Insulation Program? When did the minister first become aware of the problems with this program? What is the total figure that this program will cost the budget? Has the minister costed inspecting every one of the million or so homes that have received insulation as part of this program, given the ongoing problem with fires that often occur in homes that have been ruled as not needing any particular attention? Has the minister assessed the total financial liability of the Commonwealth under this program? Minister, given that the department of finance is responsible for sustainable government finances, do you think the Home Insulation Program was value for money and good policy? Furthermore, Minister, in the 2010-11 budget papers, you claim $17 billion of new taxes as savings. Can you please clarify these statements and the metrics that the government uses in classifying new taxes as savings? Finally, do you envisage spending the remaining $700 million left in the Building Australia Fund over the coming months? stand by all of the government’s stimulus measures. While the government have acknowledged that there have been specific problems in the Home Insulation Program, we have acted to deal with those problems. I will take on notice the question about the cost to the budget of the Home Insulation Program. As to the question of Commonwealth liability, it is my responsibility with respect to any prospective legal proceedings that may be issued against the Commonwealth-be they about this or any other matter-to effectively present reporting in the budget about risks, in the statement of risk, and also to oversight those potential liabilities. I am continuing to do that in this and other areas. The questions relating to my role in developing the program and the points at which I became aware of the problems I referred to are matters that relate to cabinet deliberations, which I am not at liberty to reveal. As to the question suggesting that my department was sidelined from the process of the examination of problems or alleged problems in the Building the Education Revolution, my answer to that is that my department was not sidelined. It is a perfectly normal and legitimate thing, where an issue emerges in a particular portfolio, for the minister of that portfolio to initiate some kind of arms-length or independent examination of that-and that is not conducted by the Department of Finance and Administration.

247,Mr Tanner (Melbourne,"Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (4.59 pm)-Firstly, I would give rise to accusations that this was not a genuine independent or arms-length examination of the problems. It is a perfectly normal situation under governments of both persuasions that, if there is to be some examination of this kind, one option is to have an inquiry or a task force of the kind which has been established. As to the question of why there would still be $500 million of stimulus budgeted for the 2011-12 financial year, I suspect the answer to that question is that, inevitably, projects occur over an extended period of time. You obviously do not pay the entire cost of a project upfront. Typically, particularly with more substantial projects, there will be milestone payments and there will be payments at the completion of the project, as well as the payments at various stages along the line. I suspect you will find that that $500 million essentially reflects that pattern. Of course, it will reflect, retrospectively, private sector activity that has occurred in the preceding period. The question of the decision regarding $400 million of infrastructure assistance for Western Australia was an item in the category of decisions taken but not yet announced. I can confirm that. I am not in a position to make any statements about when the remaining funds in either the Building Australia Fund or any of the other funds will be disbursed. That is not a decision I take unilaterally, obviously. I am not in a position to respond to that. Apologies, I am just looking through my scribbled notes to make sure that I have covereddescribe improvements in the net bottom line to the budget.

It is not an issue to be laughed at and to abuse otherspent in the electorate of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, a minister who has made his reputation on the back of anti-rorting statementsbanter across the table. Please continue. good ruling! Minister, are you cynically giving the nod to the funnelling of taxpayers’ millions into your own electorate with an eye to your own electoral skin? Furthermore, following the budget the finance minister said ‘the coalition’s debt and deficit campaign is dead’. Minister, can you please justify this statement considering that the budget deficit-not that we heard much about it on the night of the budget-is $57 billion for 2009-10 and, if all of the rosy assumptions come to be, is forecast to be $40.8 billion in 2010-11? The point of my question is that $57 billion is the largest deficit in our history by a country mile and $40 billion, if it comes to pass, will be the second-biggest deficit in our country’s history. I would like the minister to explain how he can say that the debate about debt and deficit is dead when the government, with a budget approved by the minister, will have to borrow $700 million a week for the next two years to pay for the continued spending. As well, can the minister confirm that the interest on net government debt in 2010-11 will be $4.6 billion and that net government debt is forecast to peak at $93.7 billion in 2011-12? Can the minister confirm that the forecasted interest repayment on this amount is $6.5 billion? I also refer to the $10 billion super hit for small business. I refer to the proposal to lift the compulsory employer superannuation contribution from nine per cent to 12, which will cost small business $10 billion a year. Three months ago, when asked by Ross Greenwood whether future compulsory superannuation increases would come at the expense of wage increases, the minister clearly said: … the fact that your employer is forced to put in an extra three per cent in your super means that money that otherwise could have gone into your wages, is going into your super basically. When, subsequent to that announcement, the minister’s own words were read back to him in a radio interview on 4BC, the minister said he had been seriously misrepresented, but he finally conceded: Yes, it will have an impact on the dollar increase for some workers. On multiple occasions the minister has conceded that the compulsory increases in employer superannuation will come at the expense of wage increases. Why then, when pressed in different forums, has the minister claimed not to have said this? (Time expired) with respect to matters regarding my own electorate, the amount of stimulus spending in my electorate relative to other nearby electorates varies in one respect only, and that is with respect to social housing. If you look at all of the items listed in stimulus measures in my electorate, you will see that, whether it is Building the Education Revolution or other areas of stimulus, broadly it is pretty much the same as in the equivalent electorates. There is only one difference; it is social housing. I wonder why that would be. Guess what-the answer is because that is where the social housing is.

263,Mr Tanner (Melbourne,"Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (5.09 pm)-First,tenants in Victoria. The number is, I understand, something like 2½ times the number in the next highest electorate. It is unavoidable that, where you have a stimulus strategy that includes major measures to upgrade social housing, it is not going to be distributed evenly across all electorates, as, for example, the Building the Education Revolution funding is distributed evenly because the number of primary schools or primary schoolkids is going to be fairly similar across individual electorates. The key answer to the shadow minister’s question is: were the stimulus to have been about upgrading yacht clubs then there probably would have been a disproportionate investment in his electorate, but, because the government made a decision to upgrade social housing, that meant that a disproportionate amount of that money was inevitably spent in my electorate. Finally on this point I might indicate that the actual decisions with respect to the location of spending, the decisions about individual projects, were decisions in which I played no role. These were matters worked out with the Victorian government by the Minister for Housing, and these were decisions in which I had no role. As someone representing an electorate that is not quite inner city but is not far therefrom, I would suggest to the shadow minister that the notion that the construction of additional housing of any kind, particularly higher density housing, in the inner city is the pathway to electoral popularity is a proposition that you will not find many serious political analysts able to support. Amongst other things, I find it amusing that people think that I regard this as a pathway to winning support in my electorate. In fact, I support it because it is the right thing to do for a large group of people who traditionally have been neglected and ignored by successive Liberal governments who have dramatically cut funding for social housing over the years and who have refused to invest in them. These are people who are on very low incomes, who are very disadvantaged and who we believe are entitled, along with everybody else, to reasonable living circumstances. Secondly, I am asked why I made the statement that the opposition’s debt and deficit scare campaign is dead. Notwithstanding the campaign that we have had regarding tax reform from the opposition, there have been numerous questions in the last few weeks in question time about a variety of other subjects and I do not recall any questions about this particular subject. The evidence that your scare campaign is dead is actually out of your own mouths. The other evidence is that Australia’s debt level is projected to peak at around six per cent of GDP, in a world where other major countries have debt levels that are heading towards 80 per cent or 100 per cent of GDP. Any serious economist does not regard your campaign seriously and regards it as the complete joke that it is. That is why you have dropped off it completely. I have answered your question. I have answered why you have dropped your debt and deficit campaign-because even you realise it is totally idiotic. That is the answer to your question. with respect to debt interest, I refer the member for Goldstein to the budget papers. Finally, on the question of statements I have made with respect to the impact of increases in the superannuation guarantee on wages, I will repeat the statements I made on 4BC to try to explain the difference. It is the difference between nominal wagesMAIN COMMITTEE",184,Appropriation Bill No 1 2010 2011
264,Mr Robb,The highest ever is ‘idiotic’!,185,Appropriation Bill No 1 2010 2011
265,Mr Tanner,"Your campaign is idiotic. (Extension of time granted) On the questionsments, and I will make them slowly and in words of limited syllables so that, hopefully, this time the member for Goldstein might understand them. Perhaps when you get an opportunity you might stand up and see whether you can explain your version of what the difference between nominal and real wages means. That would be enlightening for all of us. On the difference between nominal and real wages, the point that I was making in the initial interview, conducted by Ross Greenwood, was about nominal wages and the perception by individual workers that an increase would involve loss of nominal wages. The question I was asked on Q&A, not on radio, referred to real wages. There will not bewages’. If you look at the government’s proposals, what you will see is that, in any given year, the increase in the superannuation guarantee is no higher than 0.5 per cent. In other words, it is expected that real wages will continue to increase, because typically the real wage increases are significantly above that and the historic trend is that and we anticipate that real wages will increase at a higher level than those rates. So real wages will not be cut; real wages will not be reduced. That is precisely why I did not accept the interpretation being put to me on Q&A about that statement, and I stand by all of that. Yet again, the people who opposed occupational superannuation in the 1980s are going to be opposing it now and they are going to continue opposing it. Why? I say it is because it benefits ordinary working people. Why do they oppose occupational superannuation? It is because when we took office in 1983 superannuation was the privilege of the rich, the wellheeled, whom the Liberal Party are interested in supporting. What Labor did in office was extend access to superannuation to ordinary working people. What we are now proposing to do is to strengthen that access to superannuation for ordinary working people. That is why you do not like it and that is why you are opposing it, along with cutting company tax and along with improving the tax provisions for small business. You are opposing it because, ultimately, you are on about the well-off. You are on about the well-heeled in this society, not ordinary working people. Yet again you will oppose the extension of greater superannuation to the ordinary working people of this country. That is the issue here. The government is resolutely committed to delivering this improvement in superannuation and retirement incomes for ordinary working people and strengthening the investment pool which, amongst other things, helped save Australia from the global financial crisis and helped protect Australia’s economy during that time. Any serious player in financial markets will tell you that, because there was a guaranteed automatic pool of billions of dollars coming into the markets, no matter what occurred internationally, from that occupational superannuation arrangement. That is why the government remains resolutely committed to improving occupational superannuation in this country: because it improves the retirement incomes of working people, for whom the Liberal Party has never done a jot, and because it improves the investment savings pool that will be invested in the long-term economic growth for the future of Australia. That is why we remain committed to this proposition, and that is why you oppose it-and no amount of sophistry and misrepresentation and verballing about things that I have said will change any of those things.

I ask the minister to explain the Treasurer’s speech of 4 May, where he said: The fact is, the Government’s reforms will tax the mining industry better. In fact, the most significant ‘spend’ in the entire tax package is over $8 billion every year in state government royalties that will be refunded or credited to mining companies. Given that there is a net 9 billion, and the total is 15.9 billion, the question is how did the Treasurer get the 8 billion. Law and Minister for Human Services) (5.24 pm)-Again, I am happy to take that question on notice.

275,Mr Bowen (Prospect,"Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and CorporateFinance and Deregulation that an increase in the superannuation guarantee will come out of take-home pay? Law and Minister for Human Services) (5.24 pm)-This is a very interesting point for the shadow Treasurer to make. Again, the opposition have been at sixes and sevens on this. Of course, they have always opposed superannuation, as my colleague the Minister for Finance and Deregulation pointed out. They opposed the introduction of compulsory superannuation; they said it would have an impact on small business, they said it would drive small business out of operation and they said it would increase the cost of employing people. They said all that through the 1980s and 1990s-and, again, when the government announced the decision to increase the superannuation guarantee, they came out and said, ‘This will be a tax on small business and it will reduce take-home pay for Australians.’ I note that a couple of weeks ago Senator Abetz issued a press release asserting that it would come out of take-home pay. I fail to see how that could be at one with their constant claims over recent weeks, and indeed over recent decades, that superannuation was an impost on small business. I make the point that the increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent is being phased in by this government at a more gradual rate and over a longer period than even the original nine per cent-moving from the three per cent in awards to nine per cent. We are moving from nine to 12 over a more gradual period, and we are doing so in conjunction with reductions in the corporate tax rate. There are times when the superannuation guarantee going from three to nine per cent coincided with increases in the corporate tax rate. We are doing so with reductions in the corporate tax rate and we are doing so over that long period, starting at increments of 0.25 per cent-which is half the average increment under the previous increase from three to nine per cent-to enable plenty of time for employers, employees and unions to build these into their negotiations. I have no doubt that employers will argue in those negotiations and before tribunals that these should be taken into account. I am sure that will be the case, and a number of unions have recognised it. urer’s Economic Note of 9 May. In response to a question on notice in Senate estimates, Treasury provided aggregate data underlying the pie charts, and there are some unusual aspects to the data. Comparisons with ABS data show the Treasury estimates of resource rents were lower than the ABS measure of EBITDA-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization-for the years 2001-05 through to 2007-08. Now, that is what you would expect: resource rents would be only a portion of earnings. But interestingly, in the information released by Treasury in 2008-09, Treasury’s estimate of resource rents-$91.2 billionactually exceeds the ABS measure of earnings, which was $74.1 billion. So Treasury’s estimate of resource rents more than doubles in 2008-09 to $91 billion from $40 billion-a massive jump. And yet the company tax only increases by 46 per cent, to $11.9 billion from $8.1 billion. My question is: why did company tax not keep pace with the increase in resource rents?

There has been some discussion, particularly from Dr Henry, that that may be a conservative figure and it may well be a much larger figure. Will the minister advise the House of what Dr Henry was alluding to when he referred to a higher figure? Law and Minister for Human Services) (5.30 pm)-It is well known that, when the Treasury does its modelling and its forecasts, it takes a conservative approach. It makes assumptions which could be accused of being conservative. I know that it has made assumptions, in arriving at the $9 billion figure, based on certain profit projections and certain terms of trade projections. I think the Secretary of the Treasury was making the point that those projections are, in his mind, conservative-as is prudent and appropriate. I know the shadow Treasurer has some interest in this. He last year accused the Treasury of not being conservative enough-of being overly optimistic. Of course those projections turned out to be too pessimistic. This year he has accused the Treasury of being too pessimistic whereas last year he accused it of being too optimistic. He now accuses it of being too pessimistic. I think he and I would agree that forecasting is, by its very nature, not always an exact science, but this is the Treasury’s best estimate based on the best information it had at hand, with conservative assumptions built into that. I would much prefer the Treasury to be conservative in its forecasts than to be overly optimistic. ister has now just confirmed-that the estimate of $9 billion in annual proceeds from the resource rent tax is conservative, will he undertake to advise the House of Treasury’s best available information on the net proceeds from the tax?

286,Mr Bowen (Prospect,"Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporateavailable is the information in the budget papers. The published budget papers represent the Treasury’s best estimate, but Treasury do not necessarily take an optimistic view on the terms of trade or on profit levels. They use their best estimate of what those parameters will be. They do that in a fashion which is not overly optimistic or, to use a different term, which is conservative. But the figures that have been published in the budget papers are the Treasury’s best estimate of what the revenue will be, as projections published in the budget papers are the Treasury’s best estimate of all economic parameters and all revenue parameters for every tax, for all sorts of revenue, for all expenditure and for the broader economic figures which apply throughout the budget. what I was saying. It is one thing to have the best Treasury forecasts and projections, but revenue is another thing. On this occasion, the Treasurer and the minister have confirmed that the revenue estimates of $9 billion are conservative. Given that Dr Henry said that as wellso now both the minister and Dr Henry have said the estimated revenue of $9 billion is conservative-I again ask the minister if he could tell us whether it is $12 billion, $14 billion, $7 billion, $15 billion or whatever. Obviously, if it is a conservative figure, it is more than $9 billion, but the question is just how conservative it is. Law and Minister for Human Services) (5.34 pm)-It is not more than $9 billion. It is $9 billion. That is what is in the budget papers. The honourable gentleman would be the first to criticise Dr Henry, the Treasury and the modellers if Dr Henry said: ‘It might be $9 billion, but actually we think that’s a bit optimistic. We think that’s on the high side. We think it could be a bit less than that.’ I think the shadow Treasurer would then be right to say: ‘The Treasury are fiddling the books. They are not putting the right numbers in.’ The Treasury’s best estimate is $9 billion. It is based on conservative, but nevertheless appropriate, assumptions about different parameters which may affect that revenue base going forward. SoI have to disabuse the honourable gentleman of his notionSpeaker-on most days. But I must disabuse him of this notion that somehow the forecast and the projection in the budget paper is not the Treasury’s best estimate of the amount of revenue to be raised, because it is. Minister. Given we have both shared children time at the Powerhouse Museum, we both understand those pressures. Minister, I refer you to table 6, statement 3 on page 13 of Budget Paper No. 1. It shows that policy decisions since the 2009-10 budget have increased net spending by $5.9 billion. That is the sum of policy decisions for the year 2009-10 through to 2012-13. That figure includes new spending measures, new taxes and savings initiatives. It shows that all of the new taxes have been spent, all of the savings initiatives have been spent and, on top of that, $5.9 billion has been spent for good measure. New policy decisions have not contributed in net terms a single cent to reduce the budget deficit, so the question is: how are they going to reduce the budget deficit?

292,Mr Bowen (Prospect,"Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporatevery clear-that is, we will limit real spending growth to two per cent. I know the honourable member says that that is easy, but I would disagree because I have had a look at the spending decisions made under the Howard government, and real spending growth exceeded two per cent for, I think, almost every year of the last 10 years of the Howard government. SoI do not think it is necessarily easy to limit real spending growth to two per cent, but that is what we have committed to do and that is what we are doing in this budget. We have also committed to, if you like, banking increases in tax revenue to draw down the deficit. That is why we are able to budget for a surplus three years ahead of time and before any other major advanced economy. It is because we have those very clear fiscal rules in place, and the savings delivered under this budget are greater than the increased expenditure contained therein. For that reason, we are making a contribution to reducing the budget deficit and moving into surplus. We have made those fiscal rules very clear, and I think the honourable member is aware of that. He is also aware that we have met those fiscal rules. tune, terms of trade or whatever the case might be-is doing the hard work to get the budget back into surplus one dayMr Bowen interjectingwhich is the authoritative table of Budget Paper No. 1. The morning after the budget was presented David Koch sought to challenge me on this table, but I had read it before he saw it. I refer to the fact that, as a percentage of GDP, in the last two years of the coalition government expenditure was 23.2 per cent and then in 2007-08 it was just 23 per cent. Yet, at the most optimistic end of the chart, in the last projected year of the Rudd government’s budget to 2013-14, it is still 23.6 per cent, which is above the levels of the last coalition government. I ask the minister: when will you ever get to the same low levels of spending as that of the last year of the coalition government? Law and Minister for Human Services) (5.39 pm)-The honourable member is correct to point out that this government needed to make some spending decisions which resulted in the figures to which he refers. We needed to make those spending decisions based on the impact of the global financial crisis on this nation, and that meant that we needed to stimulate the economy. I know the honourable member and his party opposed that stimulus but we feel that it was necessary. We feel it was necessary not just because it would have increased the unemployment rate if we had not done do so-and put a lot of people on the unemployment scrapheap, with all the intergenerational impacts that that would have had-and not just because it would have driven many businesses, including predominantly many small businesses, out of operation if we had not done so. It was necessary and desirable to do it for the long term fiscal strategy of the government, because, if as a nation you go into recession, you have a long-term debilitating impact on government revenue and government expenditure. It has an impact on government revenue because personal income tax and corporate income tax takes are down because economic activity is less, and it has an impact on government expenditure because welfare payments, predominantly through the Newstart allowance, are greater because the unemployment rate is greater.

There is no way the budget could have been kept in surplus during the global financial crisis, even without any stimulus. A stimulus was necessary and desirable to reduce the deficit going forward and to maximise the chances of returning to surplus, as I think the indication is that we have done by returning to surplus three years ahead of time. resource rent tax.

I refer the minister to legislation that passed through this parliament providing a guarantee for state government borrowings provided by the Commonwealth. An amendment moved by the coalition and accepted by the government was that there should be full disclosure through a register of those people who are purchasing government bonds. Given that it has been nearly a year, as I recall, since that legislation was passed and gazetted, at what point will the government comply with the law and disclose who is actually lending Australia all this money?

306,The Deputy Speaker,"The shadow minister has the call.ernment spending and interest rates has been confirmed in the past few weeks in Senate estimates-and that is natural enough. Dr Gruen of Treasury said: … if you were to engage in discretionary fiscal stimulus at a time of full employment then the implications of that would be that monetary policy would likely offset it with higher interest rates. Given that in May the unemployment rate declined to 5.2 per cent and Treasury claims that full employment, as I understand it, is five per cent, at what point does the government believe it has a responsibility to heed the words of Dr Gruen and massively pull back on its stimulus spending? Law and Minister for Human Services) (5.45 pm)-With all due respect to the honourable member, I am not sure that Dr Gruen would agree with that characterisation of his comments that he was calling for a massive winding back of the stimulus. In fact, I know that Dr Gruen would not agree with that characterisation of his comments and that, if he were able to be here, he would make that point very strongly. The fact of the matter is that the shadow Treasurer has made this case repeatedly, and he has repeatedly got it wrong. He repeatedly argues that for some reason Australian government debt, Australian government expenditure, is putting upward pressure on interest rates. Of course, there are circumstances where government spending can put upward pressure on interest rates. Indeed, the honourable member as a member of the previous government would be fully aware of that, because that is what they did. They were determined to spend their way out of the boom. They were determined, despite the terms of trade and the economic conditions at the time, to increase government expenditure very substantially. We faced a very different set of circumstances. We faced the circumstances of a global financial crisis and a reduction in economic activity. Accordingly, we stimulated the economy but we did so in such a way that the stimulus was designed to wind down as economic growth picked up. This was a very deliberate design feature of the economic stimulus package. For example: the first home owner boost wound down at the end of last year; the improvements to depreciation, the upfront capital allowance, wound down and have now washed through the system. Indeed, if you look at the proportion of our stimulus spending, which was being spent upfront and early compared to that in many other nations, we have a very good story to tell. The honourable gentleman argues, and the opposition argued at the time, that, for example, the stimulus payments direct to households were inappropriate. We disagree. They were appropriate because they stimulated the economy quickly and early in the cycle, and that was when it was necessary to do that. It washed through the system very quickly. It stimulated the economy and it has now washed through. The stimulus is being wound down. SoI strongly disagree with the honourable gentleman’s characterisation of Dr Gruen’s statements. I strongly disagree with the central tenet of his economic argument that this government is somehow putting upward pressure on interest rates. I also strongly disagree that in any event, with Australian government bonds on issue being 0.001 per cent of bonds on issue throughout the world, the Australian government is putting upward pressure on interest rates. IfI could take this opportunity to say to the member for North Sydney in further response to his previous question: I am advised that that information from the AOFM is on the website.

308,Mr Bowen (Prospect,"Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporateenthusiastic supporter of his own stimulus packages, a chart on page 2-23 and 2-24 of the 2010-11 Budget Paper No. 1 purported to show a relationship between the size of fiscal stimulus and the extent to which economic growth exceeded expectations. It concluded: Those countries that enacted large and timely fiscal stimulus packages, including … Australia, performed much better than expected. … The relationship … is highly statistically significant …. The chart used data from just 11 of the G20 countries. However, in Senate estimates the Treasury admitted in a statement on 2 June 2010 that ‘an error was made’-‘We screwed up’ is perhaps a better way of describing it-in the original chart. There is no statistically significant relationship between fiscal stimulus and the extent to which economic growth exceeds expectations. It also turns out there is no significant relationship when all OECD countries are included. Given this, will the minister now agree that new Treasury information shows there is no basis to the claim that the Rudd government’s fiscal stimulus played a significant role in the economic performance of Australia? Will the minister undertake to consult with the Treasurer and ask the Treasurer to refrain from making any further unjustified claims? Law and Minister for Human Services) (5.50 pm)-If the shadow Treasurer is realistically arguing that fiscal stimulus had no impact on economic growth in Australia over the last two years, then my answer to him is: no, we will beg to differ. We will beg to differ because I think anybody who is an objective and considered analyst of these events would acknowledge that fiscal stimulus had a clear impact on economic growth. I know that the shadow Treasurer and his opposition colleagues, who were sitting by and hoping that Australia would go into recession, because it was a good way to ride back into government, would be disappointed with the fact that Australia avoided a recession and that the stimulus actually worked. The stimulus worked in two ways. It had an impact on economic growth directly through stimulating expenditure. It also had a very important impact on confidence. I remember that the honourable member’s colleague the former Leader of the Opposition used to rise in the chamber and lecture us about how important consumer and business confidence was and how it had collapsed, and he said that that collapse was all down to the efforts of the Rudd Labor government. Then of course we had the stimulus and consumer and business confidence rose in Australia by a greater level than in any other comparable economy. Then the former Leader of the Opposition went very quiet. Economic stimulus has impacts in two ways: it has the direct impact and it has the indirect impact through the impact on confidence. As the Treasurer has often put it, very eloquently, it is worth more than the sum of its parts, because of that impact on confidence. SoI do not share the premise of the shadow Treasurer and I am sure he will understand that I will want to check his characterisation of the Treasury’s evidence before estimates, because many of his colleagues sometimes choose to verbal bureaucrats. I want to check that he has accurately characterised their comments, because I think that would be the appropriate thing to do in fairness to those Treasury officers. vices minister.

311,Mr Hockey (North Sydney (5.52 Pm),"My question is addressed to the financial serASX 200, would the minister be good enough to ask ASIC to investigate whether the movement in the share price of Telstra has been appropriate or whether there may have been reason for concern? Law and Minister for Human Services) (5.53 pm)-I thank the honourable member for the question, because it is a serious one. It is a very serious issue and I take all issues such as this very seriously. ASIC, as an independent statutory government authority, does not need a minister to refer issues to it for investigation, as the honourable member, a former minister for financial services, would know. I make this point: this government takes these matters very seriously. That is one of the reasons that the government made this announcement on a Sunday. Sometimes honourable members criticise us for making significant announcements on Sundays, and often the reason for that is that when the market is closed is the appropriate time to make market-sensitive announcements. A Sunday or Saturday before 10 am, or after the close of markets, is the appropriate time to do that, and often Sunday is the best day to do it. I have not looked at the Telstra share price movements over recent days. There have of course been share price movements across the board. I will pass on the honourable member’s concern to ASIC. What they do with it is then completely a matter for them. But I am very concerned about any suggestion of-let us call a spade a spade-insider trading and, as a result, tomorrow in the House of Representatives I will be introducing a bill to significantly increase the penalties for insider trading and boost ASIC’s powers to investigate, including the power to intercept telephone calls and electronic communication to help their investigations. I would hope for opposition support for that because it is very significant. ASIC have pointed out to me-and this was one of the reasons why I embarked on that legislative change-that it is not uncommon before major announcements for share prices to move. This leads ASIC to have very considerable concerns, and I share those concerns. If there was anything in particular to note about the Telstra share price movements over the days before this announcement, that is something that I am sure ASIC would be investigating, but I will pass on the member’s comments and ensure that ASIC are aware of them so that they can take appropriate action. and the ASX if necessary, I am sure. I also make the point that there was a significant surge in the Telstra share price today on the basis of a one-page statement from Telstra that it has signed a non-binding financial heads of agreement on the NBN. I express the concern that, from a common perspective, it could reflect poorly on our reputation as a well-managed market, which we are. Our equities market is well managed, but I do express a concern that, on the basis of a non-binding agreement that Telstra itself says is subject to the passage of legislation and ACCC approval, there is a significant surge in the share price of Telstra. I ask the minister whether it would be deemed appropriate for Telstra to provide more information to the market and, obviously, their shareholders about the terms of the financial heads of agreement so that there is actually something substantive that is the basis for the increase in the share price. I note that there was a reported statement, I think in the Australian Financial Review today, that suggested that this deal would add 90c to the value of Telstra shares, which is almost a third of the value. If this were a penny dreadful stock you would say, ‘That’s speculative.’ But, given that it is one of the largest companies in Australia, with, I am MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Appropriation Bill No 1 2010 2011

I draw your attention to it tonight because it has happened a few times lately on both sides. The honourable minister has the call, and we have a few minutes left for this debate. Law and Minister for Human Services) (5.58 pm)-The honourable member would know that share markets and financial markets respond to all sorts of things. Often, that can be regarded by clear-eyed and rational commentators as being overly exuberant. Nevertheless, the markets do respond, and I would suggest that there have been plenty of occasions where markets have responded to a lot less than a press statement from an organisation like Telstra. As I said before, the government fully expected this information to be market sensitive. That is why we made the announcement when the market was closed-because that was the appropriate thing to do. Again, I will refer the member for North Sydney’s comments to ASIC. There are continuous disclosure obligations, as the member knows, on all companies. I have no reason to doubt that Telstra have complied with those continuous disclosure obligations, but the appropriate organisation to consider the honourable member’s point is ASIC and I will draw his comments to their attention. statement from Telstra to the ASX-the transaction, if completed, would deliver a post-tax net present value of approximately $11 billion. It does not say when. This includes payment for the decommissioning of Telstra’s copper network and cable broadband services-it does not say when-the use of Telstra’s infrastructure and the value to Telstra of avoiding costs including USO costs. Payments would be made progressively to Telstra. It does not say when and on what basis. SoI think there is a common interest in having more information provided in due course. Finally, will the minister undertake on behalf of the government that, if there are any changes to the resource super profits tax, at the time of the announcement of those changes there will be full disclosure about the impact on the budget?

Community cabinets are such an important initiative because, spending so much time in Canberra, the government risks losing sight of what truly matters to all Australians. As the Prime Minister said at the community cabinet at Epping in April, the reason we take the cabinet on the road is to spend time with the men and women, boys and girls and young people who make up the great Australian family right across the place to hear directly about what the government is doing right, what the government is doing wrong and what the government can do better. So these are initiatives that, as a government, we intend to continue to pursue because they are part of the government’s commitment to keep in touch with what the community expects of us and to provide opportunities for people to bring their concerns directly to government. There have been 11 community cabinet meetings in the year 2009-10, and there has been a very positive response from those who have attended. Since the inception of community cabinet meetings, over 10,000 people have attended public forums and over 1,300 one-on-one meetings with ministers have been held. Indeed, the reaction to these meetings normally sees more people than can be accommodated registering for each event. I notice various criticisms from the opposition, but this is done at a low cost, with the only advertising being through local papers and community cabinet sections of PM&C’s website, inviting all members of the local public to attend the meeting. I have attended most of these meetings and have seen first hand the wide-ranging benefits they provide to the community. There have been a number of issues that members of the public have raised that we as a government may never have known about if we had not gone and visited those various communities. SoI will certainly take on board the comments of the member for Solomon and reiterate my agreement that a community cabinet in his electorate, I am sure, would be a very good thing. As far as I can recall, a community cabinet has not been held in Darwin-I am not sure if that isMs Jackson interjecting Mr Irons interjectingwith cabinet ministers and provide feedback on issues that are important to them. cabinets. You recently held one in my electorate of Swan. The next day, there was a lot of speculation by people on talkback radio wanting to know exactly how the process for selection of people attending that community cabinet was done, particularly because there were constituents of mine who said, ‘We couldn’t get in, but people from Joondalup and Fremantle were able to attend, when the community cabinet was being held in Swan.’ They wanted to MAIN COMMITTEE",197,Appropriation Bill No 1 2010 2011

Could the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister answer that for me? retary for Trade) (6.08 pm)-In answer to the good question from the member for Swan, as part of the planning process for a community cabinet meeting, shortly after the locality of a meeting is advised, PM&C’s Community Cabinet Secretariat meets with the office of the government’s local representative, local member or duty senator for the electorate to advise of the forthcoming meeting. I am sorry to ask you: I presume that you had been contacted with respect to this particularmember is not a government member, the Deputy Secretary, Governance, of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet writes to the local member with advice about the meeting and offers a point of contact to facilitate their attendance. The letter is both faxed and posted on the day that advertising for the meeting first appears. If there is no response after a couple of days, a secretariat member will contact the member’s office to confirm that the letter has been received. The Cabinet Secretary writes to all non-government senators in the state in which a community cabinet is being held advising of the meeting and offering a point of contact to facilitate their attendance. These procedures have been in place since the Bathurst meeting in November 2009. With respect to people trying to get through who might not have been able to, unfortunately it is like a first-come, first-served basis. The difficulty is, you have a number of people who cannot make it-I stand to be corrected by the departmental officials behind me. If it helps the member for Swan, I think there was a delegation of women looking at rural child care who were not able to make the cabinet meeting because the community cabinet meetings had been booked out. When I found out about that, I agreed to meet with them to allay their concerns. I can understand their frustration, but frequently these events are over-booked. Unfortunately, it is first come, first serve, as I understand it, but I am happy to be corrected by any of the departmental officials behind me. If there is any other issue you want to raise with respect to that, I would be happy to pursue it further for you. Prime Minister is: as a member of the caucus National Security Committee, I am interested in knowing what the Rudd government is doing to build on its strong track record in national security. I understand the Prime Minister and cabinet has a strong policy focus on national security matters in areas such as defence policy and border security. Over the past month, there has been a lot of debate concerning a freeze on public service recruitment. SoI wonder what the effect of such a freeze might have on the department’s capacity to deliver advice in this very important area. In terms of new initiatives, I wonder what this budget includes and what the government’s focus is. Another aspect of the government’s policy on which I have been focusing closely is the National Security Legislation Monitor. I would ask whether the government is fulfilling this commitment and why the commitment has been made. MAIN COMMITTEE",198,Appropriation Bill No 1 2010 2011

330,Mr Hale (Solomon) (6.10 Pm),"My question to the Parliamentary Secretary to theretary for Trade) (6.11 pm)-I will address the issue of the National Security Legislation Monitor, if I may. It is a fundamentally important question. I served on the Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security-it is a great honour to be selected. The selection is made by the Prime Minister of the day or the Leader of the Opposition. In a general sense, the representatives work on a very bipartisan basis. I do not know whether the member for Swan is aware of this but all the reports released by the joint intelligence committee-formerly the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD-have been unanimous. On one occasion, I think, there was a dissenting comment but not a dissent to the report, which says a lot about the bipartisanship of this place with respect to national security. In my term, the chair of the committee was Senator Alan Ferguson, who performed his duties with great honour and dignity and certainly was a great representative of the committee. As I have said, national security is one of the most important aspects of public policy and I am proud of the leadership the Rudd government has shown in this area. Appointing the National Security Adviser, who is Duncan Lewis, is just one way in which the Rudd government has shown leadership in the area. Within the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio, there are a number of branches which do fundamentally important work in the field of national security. The National Security and International Policy Group provides advice, coordination and leadership in the development of a secure, coordinated and effective national security information and management environment. I note in this year’s portfolio budget statements additional funding has been provided for an independent review of the intelligence community. The work of the National Security and International Policy Group is first rate and the government strongly supports their ongoing work. I would hate to think what effect the opposition’s proposed freeze on public service recruitment would have on this important work, and I do not say that lightly. I know at estimates recently the Secretary to the Department of Finance and Deregulation expressed concern that this freeze would almost rule out the capacity to take on graduates each year. Graduates are a vital asset in training our future public service leaders and this would be a huge loss. I met DFAT graduates only last week and was incredibly impressed by the standard of these particular graduates. Naturally the loss of their contribution would have a significant effect on the department’s ability to deliver services and policy. In line with the Rudd government’s commitment to national security and to government accountability, we have made a commitment to implement the National Security Legislation Monitor. This commitment arose out of the recommendations of the Security Legislation Review Committee, in 2006, and the committee that I was on, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and the report of the inquiry into the case of Dr Mohammed Haneef, which was compiled by the Hon. John Clarke. The purpose of the monitor is to ensure that Australia’s counterterrorism and national security legislation operates in an effective and accountable manner, is consistent with international human rights law and helps maintain public confidence in the applicable laws. The monitor will review the operation, effectiveness and implications of counterterrorism and national security legislation and report findings, comments and recommendations to the Prime Minister and, in turn, the parliament on an annual basis. The monitor will also consider whether Australia’s counterterrorism and national secuMAIN COMMITTEE",199,Appropriation Bill No 1 2010 2011
331,Mr Byrne (Holt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secrity legislation remains necessary and contains appropriate safeguards for protecting individual’s rights. I understand that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is presently working with the Attorney-General’s Department to develop a strategy, drawing stakeholder agencies together to identify legislation that falls within the monitor’s purview and to suggest potential review activities that the monitor may wish to undertake in the first 12 months of operation. I wish to reiterate what I said earlier about national security because it is so vitally important. As I have said, I was on the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Intelligence and Security in 2006, which made the recommendation regarding the national security legislation monitor. The fact that we are implementing this is testament to our commitment to national security. We are also implementing it and funding national security agencies in a manner that is responsible and that has our nation’s best interests at its core. Incidents, both internationally and domestically-and, tragically, that includes today’s incident-have reaffirmed the need for a trustworthy government that acts in the nation’s interests. The Rudd government has a proven track record on this. concern about the opposition’s plans to cut the Public Service and the particular impact that may have not only on my community but also across many parts of rural and regional Australia. I am talking about the opposition’s budget reply. TodayI particularly want to focus on the Australian Taxation Office because I think it is a good example of an agency that provides a service nationally but which can often be delivered in many parts of regional Australia, including in my electorate of Corangamite. I am told we have some 20,000 people working for the tax office, of which about 160 of these are based in Geelong. People working in the ATO do a raft of work that focuses on the collection of around $264 billion. That is a very significant amount of income that, down the track, then goes to the provision of services, whether it be health, education or a wide range of other services, particularly in supporting some communities that may be in crisis or stress. I again think of the Victorian bushfires. With respect to the coalition’s budget cuts, I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary some questions. What will these cuts actually mean for the provision of a strong taxation service? What will they mean in terms of having a sustainable revenue base? What impacts may occur with these proposed Public Service cuts that the coalition are proposing in the delivery of a quality service in areas such as Geelong, Darwin and in many other parts of the nation? retary for Trade) (6.19 pm)-I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. It is obviously a good question. I certainly share the member’s concerns about what the coalition’s two-year Public Service freeze would do to the government’s ability to deliver essential services and implement crucial policy such as maritime safety campaigns and other campaigns of similar importance. The member for Corangamite is correct to point out that we have displayed strict fiscal discipline and we are returning the budget to surplus three years earlier than predicted. The Liberal Party talks tough about cutting government spending but the party’s blocking and opposition serve to make the deficit worse. Conversely, we have displayed the courage of our convictions and delivered a budget that the nation needs. All agencies within the Prime MAIN COMMITTEE",200,Appropriation Bill No 1 2010 2011

333,Mr Byrne (Holt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary SecMinister and Cabinet portfolio were able to comply with savings measures with the exception of the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the Office of the Official Secretary to the Governor General. I am sure all members will agree with the importance of the work of the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and respect this decision. Across the APS, staff numbers increase and decrease in particular APS agencies depending on priorities and changes to programs. For example, this year’s budget papers show a reduction in the number of Centrelink staff on account of the number of welfare recipients also declining. All APS agencies are expected to be managed in the most efficient and effective manner possible. Since 2007, the growth and the headcount figures for the APS show that the growth in public service numbers under the Rudd government has slowed substantially. In June 2007 there were 155,416 APS employees compared with 162,000 in June 2009. This represents a modest growth in the Australian Public Service of 4.2 per cent over two years. By way of contrast, between June 2004 and June 2007 under the Howard government, the number of APS employees grew from 131,473 to 155,416-a growth of over 18 per cent. We now have a scenario that will take us from one absurdity to another. As the member for Corangamite correctly identifies, the coalition’s proposed public service freeze will significantly undermine the Public Service capacity to deliver essential services. Graham Peachy, the head of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, said that the plan: … would severely curtail our ability to deliver national safety programs and to deliver an effective search and rescue effort. This is something that concerns me. But he is not alone in his concerns. I also note that Alan Thompson, the head of the Department of Parliamentary Services, stated: Services could be affected across parliament including in security, research, building maintenance as well as affecting the Parliamentary Library and parliamentary guides. As the member for Corangamite has said, it will also result in a reduction of 50 staff from the Auditor-General’s office, affecting vital services. My colleague Nick Sherry, the Assistant Treasurer, has also pointed out that the reduction in staff in the Australian Taxation Office would mean a loss of $2.1 billion in tax receipts that it would otherwise collect. I believe that the policy being put forward by the opposition is short-sighted and it is irresponsible. On the other hand, we have delivered the budget the nation needs and a budget that will return the nation to a surplus a full three years earlier than expected. We have applied strict fiscal discipline in all of the decisions we have made and the budget statements support this fully. member for Solomon you spoke about the benefits to the community which would result from community cabinets being held in those electorates and the feedback that the Prime Minister and cabinet could get from holding those community cabinets within those electorates. I would have been happy to give you feedback from my electorate if you needed it. It probably would have saved the taxpayer a lot of money and airfares. If you cannot answer this question could you take it on notice: were there any direct benefits to the seat of Swan from that community cabinet? Were there any promises made for funding put forward by the local councils? If there were, could I get a copy or a list of the benefits to the seat of Swan during that community cabinet?

I know there was no consultation with the mining industry prior to the announcement of it but I would appreciate knowing between the Prime Minister and the government how much consultation there was prior to those figures being allotted into the budgets and whether the cabinet were fully aware of the impact it was going to have on the mining sector, particularly in Western Australia. In my electorate I know there are people who have had downturns in business already because of the announcement. Was the cabinet fully aware of what effect that was going to have on the people and businesses in Western Australia? retary for Trade) (6.25 pm)-Member for Swan, I do the one on ones with the Prime Minister, so there is a discussion between the people that meet. I would be very happy to take your question on notice, and to the ability that we have we will answer those particular questions. With respect to the second question that you asked in terms of the RSPT, given that they are obviously in many cases cabinet-in-confidence conversations, I will also take that question on notice, as you have given me the capacity to do so, and we will respond to both of those questions within 30 days. former government, the Howard government, particularly on their track record when it comes to government accountability, something they were not known for during their long 12 years in government. My interest specifically relates to access to government information and the changes to the Electoral Act. There have been quite a number of inquiries in those areas for some time. One of the things I would like to know more about and ask the parliamentary secretary about is that the sheer number of FOI requests seems to have declined while the Howard government were in government. I know there is vital information there that really does need to be part of the public arena, so I ask the parliamentary secretary if he has a comment in terms of what government is doing about sharing government information. retary for Trade) (6.26 pm)-I thank the member for Oxley. I know he is a very enthusiastic advocate of electoral reform. I always welcome the opportunity to speak on the government’s reform record on freedom of information policy and electoral reform. When the Rudd government won office, the privacy and FOI policy branch was moved from the Attorney General’s portfolio into the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio. I know this is a little bit indulgent, but I would like to pay tribute to Senator John Faulkner, who was then Cabinet Secretary and Minister of State and a key driver of many of the reforms that have since been initiated by the Rudd government. Since then the Rudd government has introduced a number of reforms to the FOI Act as we recognised that it is in need of reform. As a government we are committed to giving better access through easier and less formal means. Anyone outside the government was subjected to a decade of secrecy under the Howard government. John Hartigan is not often referred to as a friend of mine and I notice that he and I have apparently become buddies by association by a tabloid called vexnews, a very fine, interesting blog. He referred to the previous government earlier this year as the most secretive government we have ever had, even in war time. I think that reinforces why the reforms were needed and brought about by the Rudd government. As part of our reforms we are reducing the access period to several forms of information, such as amending the Archives Act to reduce access to MAIN COMMITTEE",202,Appropriation Bill No 1 2010 2011

Another significant FOI related reform relates to the introduction of the Office of the Information Commissioner. The Office of the Information Commissioner will bring together the independent oversight functions for privacy protection and access to government information. We are creating two new statutory positions in the form of an Information Commissioner and Freedom of Information Commissioner. These are important reforms in promoting a culture of disclosure and meeting important election commitments. As a government we have also introduced a number of measures that will make the Commonwealth Electoral Act fairer and more inclusive as well as implement efficiencies and make the day-to-day operations of the Australian Electoral Commission easier. The reforms we have introduced restore integrity and transparency to the electoral act after its integrity was undermined by the Howard government. One of the important reforms we have introduced comes out of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report on the conduct of the 2007 federal election and matters related thereto. It goes to proof of identity requirements for enrolling, reduces the age at which people can provisionally enrol as well as a range of other amendments. The recommendations of the JSCEM report will bring the Commonwealth Electoral Act into the 21st century. We are committed to implementing policies we committed to in opposition and restoring the integrity of Australia’s electoral system and FOI acts. We are committed to making information easy to access and to making government operations more transparent. I know my colleague Senator Faulkner in particular and now Senator Ludwig have been working assiduously in this regard. I am reminded again of John Hartigan’s comment-and it is very unusual these days to be on the same page as John Hartigan-that the Howard government was the most secretive government we have had, even in wartime. Having seen these reforms being put forward and executed, it is an honour to be part of a government that is so truly committed to reform and to delivering on the commitments it has made, particularly in this area.

Sadly, Darryl McLindin, a community member in my electorate, passed away on Sunday, 13 June. I, along with many members of our community, attended his funeral service last Thursday. I am fortunate enough to have the privilege of being the patron of the Tuggeranong Hawks Football Club and also the Sydney Swans Canberra support group. I mention that because Darryl McLindin and his wife of 47 years, Pat, have both been very strong and wonderful supporters of the Tuggeranong Hawks footy club, in the first instance, and they have both been convenors and organisers of the Canberra support group for the Sydney Swans. That is despite the fact that Darryl actually supported Collingwood. I mention this in the chamber this evening to say how much I my colleagues are able to see and value the leadership role that people in our communities take. The support that Darryl gave his community, through both the Tuggeranong Hawks and the Sydney Swans support group, is immeasurable. Many people are indebted to him for his support, for the work he did and for the gentlemanly fashion in which he carried it out. He did sorts of tasks, particularly for the Tuggeranong Hawks footy club, and made sure that everybody connected with the Sydney Swans club was well looked after. He will be sadly missed.

This is emphasised in federal parliament today as I table a petition with 1,095 signatures calling for an Australian Red Cross mobile blood service in Hay. At the moment, the Red Cross is not able to come to Hay to collect blood. The Red Cross itself is the real loser here because the people whose 1,095 signatures are on this petition want to donate blood in Hay. This is a very unfortunate situation. The Red Cross needs blood supplies and the people of Hay want to provide them. Right now, they will get on a bus and go to the nearest blood collection point, perhaps in Griffith or Hillston, in order to do their civic duty. The Red Cross cannot possibly have any doubts about whether the extra journey to Hay would be cost effective as far as donations are concerned. I call on the Red Cross to come to Hay to collect donations of blood.

Firstly, I want to express sorrow at the ethnic clashes in Kyrgyzstan that have caused some 300,000 Uzbeks to be internally displaced while another 100,000 have fled to Uzbekistan as refugees. It is estimated that 2,000 people have died so far and there have been reports of sexual violence and widespread destruction of property. I hope the international community, including Australia, will generously support humanitarian assistance as well as an independent investigation into the events. Secondly, I note the Israeli government’s announcement that it will ease the blockade it has imposed on Gaza since June 2007. This decision is welcome in light of the enormous suffering that the blockade has caused the civilian population in Gaza, 80 per cent of whom are reliant on food aid. I note further the establishment of an Israeli investigation commission into the raid on the Gaza flotilla that left nine people dead. Concerns have been expressed that the commission’s work may suffer from a lack of transparency, access to information and enforceability. Nevertheless it is to be hoped the investigation will lead to a credible and a satisfactory explanation of the shocking events of 31 May. The world is watching with interest. Thirdly, I refer to the welcome visit to Australia this week of Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping. I hope the Australian government will take the opportunity of Mr Xi’s visit to raise, among other things, the issue of Tibet and humans rights issues within China. Finally, it is extremely concerning that the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico continues largely unabated. It is imperative that we learn the lessons from this environmental and economic disaster and ensure it cannot be repeated here in Australia.

This adds up to 22 years, which is a substantial effort, as I am sure you will realise, Mr Deputy Speaker.

Hasluck Electorate: Midland Health Campus Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (6.53 pm)-I rise today to talk about my ongoing concerns about the Midland Health Campus in my electorate of Hasluck. In the 2009-10 budget, the Rudd government provided $180.1 million in funding for the new Midland Health Campus, following requests from the state Liberal government for the funding to ensure the project proceeded without delay. Construction was meant to be completed by November 2013, a year later than originally promised. Premier Colin Barnett, in his new role as Treasurer, confirmed in his recent state budget that construction on the new hospital is not due to start until 2012, with completion sometime in 2015. For a hospital that was originally due to be completed in 2012, I find this delay extremely disappointing. In addition to that, we still have not seen the contribution from the state government, who agreed to match the federal funding. State budget papers only mention the Midland Health Campus by saying that ‘planning’ for the new hospital is ‘well advanced’. Last year’s state budget also mentioned that planning for the Midland Health Campus was ‘well advanced’. I am concerned that, after another year of delay, the state government are still yet to make a real start on delivering our new hospital. Recently the state health minister, Kim Hames, admitted that the state cannot specify the cost benefit of pursuing their preferred option of a privatised model for the new hospital. The state government must be able to establish that there is a legitimate benefit to our community in pursuing a privatised model for the new hospital rather than proceeding to the public option-(Time expired) has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Treaties Committee Report Debate resumed. Committee on Treaties reviews the following significant treaty actions: amendments to appendices I and II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, ratification of the statute of the International Renewable Energy Agency, entry into an agreement with France on cooperative enforcement of fisheries laws in sub-Antarctic maritime areas and entry into a healthcare agreement with Slovenia. The report also deals with one minor treaty action. MAIN COMMITTEE",208,Statements By Members

347,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (6.55 Pm),"Report No. 111 of the Joint StandingThe committee supports all of the treaties examined in this report. However, the committee has made an additional recommendation in relation to amendments to appendices I and II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. These amendments affect three species of shark that range in Australian waters: the porbeagle, shortfin mako and longfin mako. Due to risks to these species, each is now listed on appendix II of the convention, obliging Australia to work with other countries to conclude international agreements for their conservation. In this regard, Australia is participating in multilateral negotiations for a memorandum of understanding on the conservation of migratory sharks that will include these sharks. The inclusion of these sharks on appendix II has an additional ramification in terms of Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. All species on an appendix for which Australia is a range state must be listed as migratory species under the act, and such listing came into effect on 29 January this year. This listing has caused considerable concern amongst recreational fishers, who are now prohibited to fish for these sharks. The committee received more than 40 submissions to its inquiry, largely from recreational fishing groups and individuals opposed to the EPBC Act listing who challenged the scientific basis for the listing and raised concerns about a lack of consultation about the legislative change. The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts has acknowledged it did not consult with recreational fishers or conservation and environment groups about these amendments. Given the nature and number of submissions received, the committee has recommended that the department review its consultation processes for environmental treaties to ensure that more effective consultation is undertaken with all potentially interested parties. The committee was unimpressed with the long delay in tabling these amendments in the parliament. The amendments were adopted in December 2008 and automatically entered into force for Australia on 5 March 2009 but were not tabled until 25 November 2009, nearly nine months after they had entered into force. The committee considers that the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts needs to more effectively manage its treatymaking process to ensure treaty actions are tabled in a timely manner and that this committee’s time frames are respected. The committee reiterates the point raised in its previous report-the value of the committee’s inquiries to the treaty-making process is undermined when there is insufficient time to properly consider a treaty or to allow public examination of a treaty. I now turn to the statute of the International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA. IRENA is a treaty-level intergovernmental organisation that has been established to promote the widespread and increased adoption and sustainable use of all forms of renewable energy technologies. The organisation is currently in an interim preparatory phase and will enter into force on 8 July this year. IRENA will be a centre of excellence for renewable energy technology and a significant mechanism to facilitate international engagement on this issue. Through prompt ratification of the statute, Australia will be able to engage with the international community on renewable energy technology development and deployment, and take an active role in development of IRENA and its work plan. IRENA will allow Australia to strengthen cooperative ties with countries both in and outside of our region and move beyond Australia’s traditional engagement with bodies such as the International Energy Agency. In particular, membership MAIN COMMITTEE of developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region is likely to bring further international attention to the energy challenges faced by this region. The Agreement on Cooperative Enforcement of Fisheries Laws between the Government of Australia and the Government of the French Republic in the Maritime Areas Adjacent to the French Southern and Antarctic Territories, Heard Island and the McDonald Island is intended to tackle illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the territorial seas and exclusive economic zones surrounding these territories. Such fishing is a serious threat to the marine environment and the sustainability of valuable fish stocks. This agreement will formalise previous ad hoc enforcement activities undertaken with France to enforce fisheries laws and will greatly improve efforts by both countries to address illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Southern Ocean. Activities that are authorised by this treaty include boarding, inspection, hot pursuit, apprehension, seizure and investigation of fishing vehicles believed to be acting illegally. I commend the report to the House. Treaties Committee Report Debate resumed. Committee on Treaties reviews eight significant treaty actions: taxation information exchange agreements with Gibraltar, the Cook Islands and the States of Guernsey; agreements on the allocation of taxing rights with the Cook Islands and the States of Guernsey entered in conjunction with the taxation information exchange agreements; an exchange of letters amending the agreement between the government of Australia and the government of New Zealand concerning a joint food standards system; and new agreements on social security with the Czech Republic and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Two minor treaty actions are also included. The committee supports each of the actions considered in this report, and I will direct my remarks this evening to the content and purpose of the eight significant actions. I turn first to the five taxation agreements. These treaties have a common object: the elimination of harmful tax practices amongst low-taxed jurisdictions in accordance with OECD standards. We do not know the full level and type of economic activity between Australia and the Cook Islands, Gibraltar and the States of Guernsey. All three however are recognised offshore financial centres, and AUSTRAC data indicates that the flow of funds is significant. The proposed new treaties will help Australia combat this threat to the integrity of our tax system. Three are tax information exchange agreements which essentially follow an established model format. Both parties are obliged to exchange information which is foreseeably relevant to the administration and enforcement of domestic tax laws. Where the party does not uphold the information necessary to comply with a request, it must use its relevant information-gathering powers to obtain it. The two additional taxation treaties with the Cook Islands and the States of Guernsey provide for the allocation of taxing rights in order to prevent double taxation of the same income. Australia offered these agreements to encourage entry into the information exchange arrangements. The committee understands that Gibraltar did not take up the offer. MAIN COMMITTEE",209,Committees
348,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (7.01 Pm),"Report No. 112 of the Joint StandingI turn now to the exchange of letters amending the joint food standards system. This system is a cooperative bilateral arrangement involving the governments of Australia, New Zealand and the Australian states and territories. It provides the framework for the timely development and review of food standards appropriate to both countries. Draft standards and amendments become part of the legally enforceable Food Standards Code following consideration and endorsement by the ministerial council, a deliberative body comprising relevant ministers from all jurisdictions. The exchange of letters will amend aspects of this process to give effect to the recommendations of a 2007 report. It will remove the ministerial council’s power to call for a second review of a draft standard or amendment. It will also remove the automatic requirement for the council to seek review at one jurisdiction’s request. Two further changes will affect the adoption of standards in exceptional or emergency situations. A single exceptional circumstances mechanism will apply to both parties, enabling separate standards to be created only in response to specific risks. The exchange of letters will also create additional obligations for jurisdictions adopting temporary standards, where there is not sufficient time for the normal drafting process to take place. The committee supports these measures to improve the efficiency of the system, notwithstanding the fact that another review into food-labelling law and policy is currently underway. The committee has been assured that the present measures will not undermine the outcome of that review. I turn finally to the new bilateral agreements on social security with the Czech Republic and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. These treaties add to the 23 bilateral social security agreements Australia has already ratified. Agreements of this nature assist Australian residents to access certain social security payments which they are entitled to receive from another country. Specifically, the treaties covered in this report will cover the Australian age pension; and the Czech and Macedonian age, disability and survivor’s pensions. Once the treaties enter into force, people living in one country will be able to lodge a claim for a pension with the other country. Restrictions on the portability of payments will be removed; and avenues for mutual assistance will be provided to help ensure people are paid their correct entitlements. The committee is conscious that these agreements impose an administrative cost on Australia which will not be fully offset by the reduction in the cost of age pensions. This is due in part to the small number of persons eligible under the agreements. In noting that these numbers are small, the committee has not lost sight of the fact that the improvement in the pension incomes of eligible Australians will be significant. The committee accepts that the social benefit to be realised in this instance outweighs the net cost to Australia. In concluding my remarks this evening, I thank the numerous agencies, individuals and organisations who assisted in the committee’s inquiries, and I commend the report to the House.

Ms KING (Ballarat) (7.06 pm)-I am pleased to speak on this motion in recognition of the sinking of the Montevideo Maru on 1 July 1942. The story of how so many Australians died on board the Montevideo Maru, despite it being our nation’s most horrific maritime disaster, is little known. This Japanese transport freighter was carrying over 1,000 military prisoners of war and civilians. Over 800 Australian soldiers and 206 civilians were believed to be locked in the ship’s hold when she sank. No Australian survived-the biggest single loss of life in our nation’s wartime history. Many of those who died were members of Lark Force. Lark Force comprised the 2nd/22nd Battalion AIF and supporting units, 1,400 soldiers in total. The 2nd/22nd Battalion, which formed the nucleus of Lark Force, was originally based at Mount Martha, on the Victorian peninsula. The majority of these men came from Victoria, from rural and metropolitan areas. The force arrived in the island on 26 April, tasked with protecting the airfields and seaplane base at Rabaul. The force was ill equipped and was vulnerable to Japanese attacks. The Japanese began bombing in January 1942, and by the morning of 23 January Lark Force commander Colonel John Scanlan ordered a withdrawal from Rabaul, stating that it was ‘every man for himself’. Of these Australian troops, around 400 escaped and returned to Australia. Of the remaining troops, over 800 became prisoners of war and 160 were massacred at Tol Plantation. Those remaining members of Lark Force were taken prisoner by the advancing Japanese army and were placed in POW camps in Papua New Guinea. Australian and European civilians who were living and working in Rabaul at the time were also taken prisoner by the Japanese army and placed in the POW camps. In late June 1942, the troops and civilians were taken to the port city of Rabaul, where they were boarded onto the Montevideo Maru, which was scheduled to carry them to Hainan Island, in China, which was occupied by the Japanese at the time. En route to Hainan Island, the Montevideo Maru was intercepted by the American submarine the US Sturgeon. Unaware that there were Australian POWs on board, the US Sturgeon torpedoed the ship at 2.29 am. Eleven minutes later, the ship sank. It is thought that most drowned where they were imprisoned in the hull of the ship as it took on water. From my own district of Ballarat, they were Corporal Cheney, Private Gribble, Corporal Hicks, Lance Corporal Hodder, Lance Corporal Kirkpatrick, Private Ladner, Private Morgan, MAIN COMMITTEE Private Reid, Private Tulloch, Private Wythe and Private Godfrey. Private Geoff Godfrey’s brother Alan is in Parliament House today with his two daughters. Of the Australian civilians to have died in the Montevideo Maru, one was Walter James Ryan. Walter had moved to the island in 1931 to work for a local trading company. Walter was due for long-service leave in December 1941 but decided to hold off while his wife, Frances, moved to Sydney to settle the children into schooling. Walter was looking forward to following later in 1942 but he did not return home. Walter’s daughter Julia Richardson lives in my own electorate. She has said, like so many of the men and women who are here today, that their life was put on hold for over three years while they waited for the hope of news of their father. The impact of this tragedy was felt by people right across our country. Loved ones and relatives of those Australians killed have carried the unbearable and unimaginable burden of losing a loved one at war. Amongst these mourners are members and former members of this House. I respectfully acknowledge the loss of Reverend Syd Beazley, the Hon. Kim Beazley’s uncle, and of the grandfather of the Hon. Peter Garrett, both of whom were on board the Montevideo Maru on that fateful morning. As part of my contribution, I would like to read some words that Kim Beazley has sent specifically for this evening: Families of those who lost relatives and loved ones in this our greatest loss at sea would be deeply grateful for recognition of their sadness and pride. Most of us left now are too young to have known the fallen but they live richly in our family legend. Australians are good at somberly recognising the sacrifice of their fellows. Opening the nations arms through the Parliament to embrace the dear lost of the Montevideo Maru is part of a fine tradition. The relatives of Syd Beazleyand, I am sure, many of those here todaywould be warmed by this embrace. The story of the Montevideo Maru will live in our nation’s history. It is remembered on the national prisoners of war memorial in Ballarat and on other memorials across Australia and internationally. In this parliament, I formally acknowledge those who died on the Montevideo Maru and I pay my respects to their families and their friends who are present with us today. of the coalition, to add the support of members on all sides of the chamber to the motion that has been put forward by the member for Ballarat and which has been spoken of todayprincipally, of course, to recognise the sacrifice of those Australian servicemen who lost their lives aboard the Montevideo Maru some 68 years ago. As someone with involvement in the Montevideo Maru Foundation since my election in 2001, I want to pay particular tribute to Cynthia Schmidt and James Kennett who I know worked alongside so many others, all of whom have been tireless advocates of the Montevideo Maru and the need for recognition of Australia’s worse maritime disaster. Of what has been the worse maritime disaster there is still too little known. I know from the time that I have spent speaking face-to-face with people like Cynthia of the genuine grief and the need to have closure through a definitive answer to questions that have lingered for far too long. The facts of the Montevideo Maru-the capture of the Australian Lark Force personnel and the civilian interns, as well as what we know about the circumstances of the ship’s sinkinghave been, today, relatively well documented, both in the House and by the member.

350,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (7.11 Pm),"It is indeed a privilege to rise this evening, on behalfstands in contrast to the history-that for so long so many people had no real clarity about the circumstances that took place. WhatI want to talk about today-and I am mindful of the presence in the public galleries of survivors, of relatives, of family and friends-is the need for closure and the need for certainty for so many Australians who lost family members either on the Montevideo Maru or in the days before the ship set sail. In the past I have sponsored petitions in this place calling for the government to conduct an inquiry, and for a search for the Montevideo Maru. It is important to acknowledge that not everyone is of the same view with respect to the relevance of that. But I have been persuaded over the years that an inquiry, and looking into the feasibility of a search, is the direction in which we should go to help to provide closure for those who still question who was on board and who was not. In many respects, today is just a start. The formal recognition by this nation’s parliament is something that has been well overdue for too long. But it is just another step on the journey. I know, from having had the opportunity just this afternoon to speak with family members, that there is still a great desire for more to be done. That is why I was pleased that both the government and the opposition committed $100,000 today towards an ongoing search, as part of an ongoing commitment to bringing closure to the families involved. On this important occasion, when the families of victims have travelled from around Australia to be in the House of Representatives today, I want to renew that call for closure. For Australia’s worse maritime disaster and following the joy of finding the HMAS Sydney and the Hospital Ship Centaur, I believe that we as a nation should expect nothing less. I also think we should give consideration to a national day of remembrance to be celebrated on 23 January-the anniversary of the fall of Rabaul, New Britain, New Ireland and the surrounding islands of New Guinea. The reality is that, despite this being Australia’s worse maritime disaster, there is not enough public awareness of the ultimate sacrifice made by more than 1,000 Australians in this incident. Though most Australians know of the HMAS Sydney and the search for the Centaur, fewer Australians would know anything about the tragedy of the Montevideo Maru. It is my sincere hope that today will represent a turning point in the ongoing story of the Montevideo Maru. I would also like to place on the record my profound respect and admiration for the Australian men and women who gave their lives in this horrible disaster. Though not a lot, and certainly not enough, is known about their fate, we can be certain of their bravery and sacrifice in the defence of our nation. I have no doubt that all the people in the gallery today and all of those who read of this in subsequent days will stand proud of the fact that that sacrifice was not for naught but for our nation. sonnel, all single men, who died as a result of the sinking of the Montevideo Maru.

The time allotted for this debateEgypt: Coptic Christians Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Andrews: That the House: (1) notes that: (a) there are around eight million Coptic Christians living in Egypt; (b) freedom of religion is a universal human right; (c) Egypt is obliged under international law to ensure the protection of racial and religious groups and individuals; and (d) Coptic Christians in Egypt continue to suffer religious persecution and discrimination; and (2) calls upon the Egyptian government to guarantee that Coptic Christians and members of other religious communities and minorities enjoy the full range of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 80 million people are Christians. According to tradition, Christianity was introduced to Alexandria by Saint Mark, making it one of the oldest Christian communities in the world and indeed the oldest in Africa. Originally a reference to Egypt generally, the term ‘Copt’, deriving from the word ‘Aigyptos’, is now used to describe Egyptian Christians. After the Arab invasion of Egypt in the 7th century, the Copts became a minority but remained a significant and prosperous group. Indeed, they remained an important group working with Muslims towards the freedom and independence of Egypt in the early part of last century. The Washington Institute for Near East Policy has noted: … Christians worked side by side with Muslims in the creation of modern Egypt. In the 1919 uprising against British occupation, Coptic priests were preaching in mosques -including Cairo’s prestigious al-Azhar Mosque -and imams were preaching in churches as a symbol of national unity. The trend continued until the 1950s … However, during Nasser’s pan-Arab socialist regime the Copts were targeted because of their wealth and were reduced to second-class citizens. Many have emigrated, including a relatively small but significant number to Australia. During the past three decades of the rule of Hosni Mubarak the discrimination against the Copts has increased. They are regularly targeted for discrimination and have been subjected to increasing violence from Islamist jihadi radicals. One such case occurred when six Christians and an off-duty police officer were massacred as they were leaving a Christmas service in January this year. This follows a series of other incidents in which hundreds of Copts, unfortunately and tragically, have been killed over the last 20 years. Despite constitutional guarantees of religious freedom, Copts face discrimination and persecution. In practice it is virtually impossible to build or repair their churches. It can be very difficult to obtain travel documentation, and converts to Christianity are unable to alter their ID cards although no such obstacle stands in the way of converts to Islam. This is not a motion against Islam; it is a motion calling for religious freedom. Egypt is not alone in restricting freedoms, including religious freedom. The persecution of religious minorities, including Christians, Jews, Baha’is and Sunni Muslims in Iran, is an egregious example of such persecution-and the restrictions on Christian churches in China is another. Egypt has an opportunity to show leadership. It can be a force for toleration and moderation in the Middle East. It can embrace its obligations under international conventions and MAIN COMMITTEE",215,Private Members Business

This would be welcomed by Copts in Egypt, as it would by some 70,000 Copts who have made Australia home but are concerned about the plight of family, friends and associates who remain in Egypt. I join with members of the Coptic community in Melbourne, Sydney and elsewhere in calling on the government to voice its concerns about this matter and to restore the special immigration assistance to Copts that existed under the previous government. the Coptic congregation and community in and around my electorate of Hindmarsh and, of course, those further afield who are concerned by the persecution taking place in Egypt. Father Philopos Boghdady, of Adelaide’s Saint Mary and Saint Bishoy Coptic Orthodox Church, and his congregation have welcomed me with open arms to many of their community events and services. I have learnt of the intimidation of Coptic Christians in Egypt and the dangers that threaten their lives. Of course, this is of most grave concern. I have been invited to share in the warmth and hospitality of the local Coptic Church congregation and I appreciate the good works of His Grace Bishop Suriel, the head of the Coptic Church in Australia and New Zealand, whom I have met on a number of occasions. But Coptic Christians have endured an unprecedented increase in blatant hostility in the country of their church’s origin. As we heard earlier, we are talking about a Christian Church whose origins are very old. The Coptic Christians have been in Egypt since the early days of the Byzantine Empire. Saint Catherine’s Monastery on Mount Sinai dates back to the 6th century and has been in use as a centre of Christian teaching and learning since that time, not just for Egypt and Byzantium but for the entire Christian world. Most regrettably, the threat that the church endured some 1,200 years ago is making itself very evident again today. The desire of some to destroy the Coptic religion is not a historic point of interest but a very real concern as we speak. On 21 June 2009, with the assistance of state security, a mob assaulted Coptic Christian households in Egypt destroying their homes, their crops, their livelihood and any meagre sense of security they may have had. This assault and destruction of people’s lives was perpetrated on the basis that the state security forces and the mob suspected that the Coptic Christians in question were celebrating mass and practising their Coptic Christian religion-they were doing no more than that. The response of the state authorities to this violent outburst was the forced reconciliation of aggressors and victims, which consists of a compromise: the aggressors promise not to further assault and destroy the victim’s person, family and belongings as long as the victim promises to give up the practice of their religion. This is modern Egypt, and this is considered fair and reasonable and currently passes for justice. Following these attacks the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom said, ‘This latest incident is another example of the upsurge of violence against Coptic Christians we have seen in the past few years. The commission has long expressed concern that the Egyptian authorities do not do enough to protect Christians and their property in Egypt nor do the authorities adequately bring perpetrators of such violence to justice.’ The upsurge in violence against Coptic Christians continues and continued on 7 January this year. A congregation of Coptic Christians were celebrating Christmas in church. On leaving the church and entering the street they were sprayed with bullets and, as we heard, six were shot dead and 15 others injured. On 13 March a mob of some 1,000 besieged a Coptic church in Mersa Matrouh, hurling stones at the church and trapping 400 parishioners inside MAIN COMMITTEE",216,Private Members Business

The free practice of religion, if it is Christianity, is blocked by the authorities. Church buildings are vandalised. It so happens that repairs, as we heard earlier, need a licence, a licence which too often takes a ridiculous amount of time to be issued and before works proceed buildings are demolished by state authorities. Before new religious buildings works are approved, the building plans are declared contrary to law by virtue of the planned building having too close a proximity to newly established mosques. After their family is terrorised, possibly arrested and even tortured; after their home is destroyed with all private property; after their source of income is destroyed, their family uprooted and their home burnt to the ground, what can they do? Leave. The intended consequence of this sectarian violence and oppression is sectarian cleansing. I ask members to support the motion before us. (Time expired) the member for Menzies’ motion before the House. I have a great interest in the issue of religious freedom: the ability of people to choose their own religion and then be able to practise that religion without fear of persecution. Unfortunately, the attack on Christianity in certain places around the world seems to be increasing. I have spoken previously in the House about the issue of apostasy-those who convert from Islam to Christianity-about how often they are persecuted, sometimes threatened with murder and sometimes killed. I would like to raise an issue before I move on to the specifics of the situation facing the Coptic church in Egypt and that is the matter of Mohammed Hegazy. In 2003 he converted from Islam to Christianity. He then sought to be recognised legally as a Christian-the first person in Egypt to do this. Under Egyptian law, sharia law, once someone is within the faith of Islam they have no choice. They are not allowed to convert. When Mohammed converted, I understand that a fatwa was issued against him. His father also threatened to kill him. This was all because of a personal decision to convert to Christianity. It was not just him; his wife also converted. I believe they now have a daughter three years old and it is said that, unless she elects to convert to Islam at the age of 10, she will also be killed or under threat of death. SoI think there is a major problem in Egypt. There are major issues with regard to religious freedom and no more so than in the persecution that has occurred, as has previously been said by other speakers, since the fifties and particularly in the seventies. The number of incidents is increasing, even in the last year. Certainly it is a major problem in that country. The people there are suffering. Although we might say that it has been somewhat good for Australia, because two-thirds of people with Egyptian ancestry who live in Australia are Coptics, we have been the beneficiary of the persecution. But it is not right that someone feels they have to leave their homeland for the safety of their families or that they should be forced to leave rather than face economic deprivation as a result of the archaic arrangements regarding the Coptic Christian faith as imposed by the state in Egypt. It has been said that the police and the security forces seem to be a bit reticent to act when required. When people and churches are being attacked, they do seem a little reticent to arrive on time to actually achieve something. Fundamentally, substantial change is needed within Egypt. It is hard to know exactly what to do, because it would appear that the government, bound by sharia law, is working according to the principles of that law.

355,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (7.27 Pm),"I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution oncuted-all for the sake of religious oppression. It is a shame and it is outrageous. We as a parliament should make a very clear point to Egypt, and the government should make a very clear point to Egypt, that this is not the way a modern country acts and it should change now. port the motion moved by the honourable member for Menzies on the rights and freedoms of religious and other minority groups in Egypt, a country of 77 million people who are heirs to a great civilization and a country with enormous potential in land, resources and energy. Sadly, some of this potential has been wasted by many decades of poor government. Ever since Colonel Nasser and his colleagues seized power in 1953, Egypt has been a dictatorship and the current ruler, Hosni Mubarak, has been in power for over 30 years, with no real opposition to his regime allowed. I note that his son Gamal looks like being the regime’s favoured dear leader of the future. Although there are worse regimes in the Middle East than Egypt’s, people have suffered under oppression, corruption and the failed policies of the Mubarak regime. Egypt’s indigenous Christian minority, the Coptic Christians, have survived many changes of regime for nearly 2,000 years. The motion refers to eight million Egyptian Christians, although I have seen estimates of up to 12 million or 15 million. Visitors to Cairo, which is about 20 per cent Christian, can see magnificent Coptic churches and schools. Egypt’s constitution guarantees religious freedom and, for the most part, Copts and other Egyptians can worship and educate the children. But it is a disturbing fact that Egyptian Christians face increasing levels of harassment, discrimination and violence, particularly in small towns and rural areas. Over the past five years there has been an increasing incidence of violence against Egyptian Christians. In January this year, six Christians were killed in an attack on a church in Naj Hammadi. There have been similar incidents this year. The police did little to stop them, and the courts rarely convict those responsible. Egypt’s state controlled media draw a veil of silence across these incidents. Christians also complain of systematic discrimination in government employment, such as the police and civil service. That is why an increasing number of Egyptian Christians are immigrating. Not many people realise that we have about 70,000 Egyptian Christians living in Australia. I know some of them well. Some of them are very high achievers, and some of them are good friends. They are, of course, very welcome and make a great contribution to our Australian society, but it is a tragedy that members of such an ancient religious community should feel no choice but to leave their homeland. The deteriorating position of Egyptian Christians reflects the rise of militant Islamist groups in Egypt in recent years. Islam is a great monotheistic religion itself. I deliberately used the word ‘Islamist’ rather than ‘Islamic’ because ‘Islamist’ refers to people who use a great monotheistic religion for a political purpose, not the religion itself. These groups seek to further their aims by attacking the Christian community. The rise of these groups has been made easier by the lack of economic opportunity and political freedom under the current Egyptian regime. Instead of reform, the regime deals with these groups through repression, which only enables them to make more recruits. Egypt could learn something from Indonesia about how to defeat militant Islamism through fostering democracy and economic opportunity.

356,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (7.32 Pm),"I am pleased to have this opportunity to supcompared to the years of stultifying lack of economic progress in Egypt. One of the crucial ways that Australia is involved is with the very large amounts of economic aid that the American congress gives to Egypt. The Egyptian regime buys Australian wheat, and bread in Egypt is very heavily subsidised in order to keep the fellahin, the peasants, from revolting. This motion refers to other minorities. I would like to mention that there is increasing persecution of gay people in Egypt as well. This is seen as an attempt by the Egyptian government to appease the militant Islamists by scapegoating gay people as well. The industrialised world has faced a big problem as far as Egypt is concerned. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice under President Bush sought democratic elections in Egypt after the successful Lebanese ones. There was such great hope for that region in a brief period back then. The persecution of the Egyptian Copts is a long standing problem that the country faces. While the lack of democracy exists in Egypt that prevents them freely expressing themselves and participating in their religion, it is a great shame for an ancient civilisation and an ancient country which deserves better. motion that supports freedom of religion as a universal human right. Of course, it is a universal human right, one that is supported by Australia and one that we ought to support in other countries and seek to ensure is implemented in those countries. The subject of this motion tonight is the Coptic Egyptian community. The Coptic Egyptian community in Australia has made a great contribution to Australia since its arrival in the 1960s. We are very fortunate to have wonderful communities in Sydney in particular. I want to make mention of many of the contributions of the Sydney Coptic community to life in Sydney, in particular the St Mark’s Coptic Orthodox College, at Wattle Grove; the St Bishoy Coptic Orthodox College, at Mount Druitt; and all of the churches and dioceses in Sydney and Australia. The Coptic Orthodox community in Australia is served by two Coptic Orthodox dioceses with over 50 parishes, two monasteries, two theological colleges and five schools. It is a very successful community. It is a community that is flourishing. It is a community that is law abiding and peaceful and has sought to make the most of the great opportunity that Australia represents-freedom, tolerance and our democratic way. It is estimated there are about 70,000 Copts in Australia. This motion is so important because we ought to stand by all those communities who are being persecuted all around the world, all those minorities who face oppression and intolerance from either governments or other groups within their societies but particularly governments, because a government can be our best friend or it can be our worse enemy. When the state seeks to interfere in those things that it ought not to interfere in, particularly freedom of religion or the choices we may seek to make, it oversteps the mark in a way that produces intolerance, hatred and other forms of persecution. It is well documented that there are many examples in Egypt. The Coptic religion is an ancient religion which broke away from the traditional Roman Catholic Church but is now regarded as an Eastern Orthodox Church. However, in Egypt there have been many, many examples of persecution which involve death, serious mistreatment of families and some graphic examples which I will not relate today. However, I do want to mention that in recent times there has been a substantial increase in the violence against Coptic Egyptians in Egypt, and the Coptic community has suffered greatly. There have been several notable examples that the Coptic Egyptian community has MAIN COMMITTEE",219,Private Members Business
357,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (7.37 Pm),"It is a great pleasure to rise tonight in support of araised with me in person when they have seen me in my office in Sydney. These were the subject of some great rallies in Sydney in recent times. We saw many thousands of people rally in support of a number of people who have been persecuted by the Egyptian government, including a notable court case where two young Islamic men were acquitted of the murder of a Coptic Egyptian person who was horribly dismembered. These rallies were very important to show our support. They received support from the media, including broadcasters in Sydney such as Alan Jones, who particularly sought to highlight the role of the Egyptian Coptic community in Australia and the treatment they had received. It is particularly important that the motion: (2) calls upon the Egyptian government to guarantee that Coptic Christians and members of other religious communities and minorities enjoy the full range of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Egypt has been regarded in the Middle East as a moderate voice of peace and good influence in many ways. However, it does have work to do in relation to its treatment of its Christian community. Often governments have to think about how they can protect minorities within their society from elements which seek to encourage persecution and harm. The member for Melbourne Ports clearly outlined that there is discrimination in Egypt at all levels, particularly from a governmental perspective. Equal rights under the law oblige a society to allow people to choose their own religion freely and to practise it. This motion is so worthy of our support because we are a free and tolerant democratic society that allows freedom of religion to our citizens. It is a great blessing that we do so in our country today and it is something that we should seek to promote and foster in Egypt. We particularly need to stand up for the Coptic Egyptian Christians in Egypt. pired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Initiatives Supporting Working Women Debate resumed, on motion by Ms George: That the House: (1) congratulates the Government on delivering major initiatives to help working women, including the introduction of Paid Parental Leave, the successful implementation of the Fair Work Act 2009 and increasing the access to and affordability of child care; and (2) condemns the: (a) Coalition for its lack of real support in these areas; and (b) Opposition for its failure to support these initiatives that benefit working women and their families. Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (7.42 pm)-I am proud to be part of a federal Labor government that has introduced parental leave, increased the child care rebate and saved working families from the nightmare of Work Choices. These are among the policies of a government that shows understanding and respect for women-for their rights, needs and status. Achieving real equal pay in our workplace is the goal the Labor Party shares with many women around the country, in stark contrast to the Liberal Party, whose love affair with Work Choices left working women’s wages in tatters. Australian women will never forget the much-despised Work Choices, which stripped away conditions such as overtime and penalty rates, leaving MAIN COMMITTEE",220,Private Members Business
358,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Re Ramsey),"The time allotted for this debate has exworking women severely short-changed. The greatest crime of that system was that if you did not cop it quietly on the chin, did not sign the individual contract, your job was at risk. Our government has put an end to all of this. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition now wants to turn back the clock. He is determined that working women should have minimal job security, fewer penalty rates and inequitable pay rates. Thankfully, women around the nation are safe from Mr Abbott’s dangerous workforce policies, as long as he stays on the opposition benches. On our side of the House we have been working hard to undo the shackles put in place by Work Choices and to inject some much-needed fairness back into the workplace. In just 2½ years we have got rid of the Work Choices regime and rip-offs; we have introduced an annual minimum wage review; introduced the right to request flexible working arrangements; introduced new protections on the grounds of pregnancy, sex and caring responsibilities; introduced a new pay equity principle; and introduced Australia’s first Paid Parental Leave scheme, welcomed by families around the nation for the financial security it will provide. The Leader of the Opposition has been consistently ‘dead against’ the idea of paid maternity leave. Remember not so long ago he said: Voluntary paid maternity leave: yes; compulsory paid maternity leave: over this Government’s dead body, frankly. He has been as against maternity leave as he was against a ‘great big new tax’ until of course he decided to do a backflip on both-a spectacular backflip, to be precise, in what can only be interpreted as a desperate bid to win back the millions of Australians he had alienated with his out-of-touch views. The Leader of the Opposition now tells us he wants to introduce a great big new tax on business, which will: … make it easier for more women to choose the most traditional role of all. In short, his parental scheme is about keeping as many women as possible out of the workforce and tied back to the ironing-board and the kitchen sink. Australian women can see through these political acrobatics on the part of the opposition leader. The truth-the actual truth, that is, rather than the opposition leader’s trademark halftruths-is that he has chopped and changed on so many occasions that it is impossible to know where he will end up. His views could be laughably dismissed if he were just an ordinary citizen; but this man is the alternative Prime Minister of our nation and his views need to be placed under public scrutiny. Australian women have not fought for 40 years to have their rights dismissed. We deserve the right to choose how and when we work, to make decisions about our reproductive health and how we balance our work and family life, and to have our concerns addressed fairly in the mainstream of public debate, not by a conservative and outmoded view of women totally at odds with 21st century Australia. I have dedicated my working life to the cause of workers’ rights and women’s rights and I know a danger to those hard-fought rights when I see one. The Leader of the Opposition has never repudiated his core beliefs about women and he had the opportunity not long ago to do so. He said: I think it would be folly to expect that women will ever dominate or even approach equal representation in a large number of areas simply because their aptitudes, abilities and interests are different for physiological reasons. MAIN COMMITTEE I think that says it all. His current small-target strategy will be no comfort when women throughout the nation understand his real agenda and his core beliefs and conclude that he is not deserving of their support. Leader of the Opposition. The member for Throsby has a great record in her activity on behalf of women. She talked about workers’ rights and women’s rights. In her former career she ended up as the head of the ACTU, which is the highest role that you can have within the union movement-therefore, she is a woman in that place in this country at this time. Whether or not there has been an attack on an individual, the opposition leader of today, I would say to the member for Throsby that any politician who takes on the role of leader of a party has to be flexible enough to be able to listen to people and to be able to change his mind. If he has said these things in the past it does not mean that he cannot think through the issues today and go to the Australian people with the reasonable expectation of being heard. Embryonic stem cell research was a very difficult issue for me in a previous parliament, and I was the beneficiary of people around me who were prepared to look at the issue outside the box that I had put myself into at the time. Instead of taking one tack on that very delicate issue I listened to their view of the issue, and that became my view. After educating myself, looking at the issue and listening to the arguments that were put forward from both sides, I came to a position that I did not have at the start of my consideration of the issue and I gave an address in the parliament that nobody expected me to give-and I stand by every word I said in that address. The stance I took surprised both my side of the House and the other side of the House, but it was a very important stance for me to take at that time. I am just making the point that you can change your mind. I like to think that I give leaders of my party what I hope they will give me-that is, every opportunity-if they come up with ideas that they would like to put before the Australian people. I say this to the member for Throsby: when it comes to paid parental leave or the minimum wage, which I would like to talk about in a minute, all of these ideas are eventually tested by the Australian people. In a few months time, every man and woman out there will get a chance to make a decision on the government and on the opposition leader and the team behind the opposition leader. That is the great beauty of this nation and its government. The people of Australia at the last election made a decision, without rancour. They made a decision to change their government. One of the great treasures we have in this country is our stable government. There are people around the world who cannot get up and have this argument. They cannot get up and put forward what Ms George put forward tonight to this parliament. I would say that my role is to let my leader give it his very best shot. If he has to change his views on some things to accord with the community and adopt views that he did not hold before, all strength to his arm if he is brave enough to change those things. We are all responsible for the things we said in the past. There are a few things that have gone out of this mouth that I would love to draw back in and throw away, because I was a different person when I came here in 1990. I was not aware of the issues. We parliamentarians get faced with issues that we have to make decisions on. Outside this profession, in the lives we came from, we would never be faced with these issues in our daily lives-issues that, as you would know, Deputy Speaker, we never thought we would have to face.

359,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (7.47 Pm),"That was a not very veiled attack on theI want to say something about the minimum wage in regard to anybody, male or female. I would love to have the time, also, to talk about Menzies and the Liberal Party and how he saw the role of women as so important to his party. He set up a structure where women had equal place right through the whole structure of the party. If you introduce a minimum wage and you keep raising that minimum wage, the first people to miss out on a job are those at the bottom level. I would love to see the best brains in this country-male or female-work out a way in which we can have those with the least ability in the workforce fully participating in life through work. Ms ANNETTE ELLIS (Canberra) (7.52 pm)-I rise to second this motion on initiatives supporting working women. I am delighted to support a motion that outlines the important steps the government has taken to support working women. Since coming into government, the Rudd Labor government has been working tirelessly to make Australia a stronger, smarter and fairer nation. We have done this because we believe that every Australian should have the same opportunities in life and we want to see all Australians realise their goals. This, of course, includes equal rights for women. Over the past 2½ years, the Rudd Labor government has been busy making changes so that this can one day be realised for every woman around the nation. In this short space of time, we have improved the conditions of working women by scrapping Work Choices and giving parents the right to ask their bosses for flexible working arrangements. We have also taken steps to make sure that historically female-dominated sectors are properly valued and reformed, and we have reformed the early childhood education and care sector to help Australian families meet the costs of child care. Most recently, the Rudd government is extremely proud to have delivered Australia’s first Paid Parental Leave scheme. Australia has waited too long for this reform, which will be available to parents from 1 January. Under our landmark scheme, parents will have access to 18 weeks pay at a federal minimum wage, which is currently $570 a week. The scheme will provide mothers with a choice when it comes to balancing work and family commitments. It will support Labor’s core mission: to make this nation stronger and fairer. Given how far we have come for Australian women over the past 40 years, there is cause for optimism-particularly the Paid Parental Leave scheme, which has taken too long in coming. In addition, Fair Work Australia legislation is a major boost to working women. The principal benefit of the new legislation is that it takes away the unfair provisions of the previous Work Choices legislation that threatened the job security and work-family balance for so many working women. Under the new Fair Work system, modern awards and enterprise agreements will allow employers and working parents to make individual flexible arrangements. Individual flexibility agreements can vary the terms of a modern award or enterprise agreement, to help employees better balance their family responsibilities and help employers retain skilled staff. This is a very big plus for working women. Looking quickly at child care, the Minister for Education, Julia Gillard, and the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth, Kate Ellis, earlier this month announced 190 childcare centres that will receive special grants to upgrade their facilities. Grants of $20,000 will be provided to long day care services in disadvantaged areas-and I repeat, in disadvantaged areas-from this month to help those providers improve the quality of their childcare centres. MAIN COMMITTEE I have absolutely no doubt and I am really very proud to stand here with the member for Throsby and support this motion. Women’s rights are not a joke. We are not an optional extra. We deserve the right to determine how we care for our own bodies. We deserve the right to choose how and when we work. We deserve the right to live in safe and respectful relationships. I do not want to see any of that come under threat. Should there be a change of government, heaven help us, at the election, a lot of that will come under threat, as indicated by the very discussions we sometimes hear in the parliament. The previous speaker made a point about how we can possibly change some things that we might have said at times. I really have a bit of scepticism about that, particularly given that some of the things we hear of we hear consistently. We hear the same sorts of comments about a lot of these issues from the opposition in a consistent fashion. The women that I represent in this place do not want to hear that. They want to know that we are moving forward with programs that are going to support women, and in that way support working families, individuals, whoever out there is needing that support. I am particularly pleased to note in passing-and I think it should be noted-that we have a very high number of women now in this place, though not acceptably high enough, who can argue these causes. We do not do it alone. Some of the male members of the House are very good at supporting us as well. But, as I say, I am pleased to support this motion. I thank the member for Throsby for bringing it forward, and anything we can do to ensure the future advancement of issues that affect women and their families we should stand right behind and support. Ms O’DWYER (Higgins) (7.57 pm)-If further evidence were required that this government is more committed to spin than substance, more committed to talking than doing, then this is it. It is pretty incredible that this government would claim, as it has done, to be the friend of working women. By even the most generous analysis, this government has failed to deliver on its promises to Australian women and their families. Let us start with child care. We were told that there was a crisis facing working families and that hundreds of new childcare facilities were required. The Rudd government promised to address what it called the ‘critical shortfall’ in the availability of childcare places. This was supposed to be the government solution to the double drop-off. After promising to build an additional 260 childcare centres, this government has done a triple backflip with pike and announced that it will build only 38. This has ended up as just another item on the long list of Rudd’s broken promises and failures in policy. Only three childcare centres have been constructed in three years. At this rate, on average of one a year, we have another 35 years to go. The Howard-Costello government’s achievements in helping working women are closely tied to its strong record on promoting economic growth, reducing unemployment and keeping interest rates low. Under the coalition more than two million jobs were created. During the coalition’s term the female unemployment rate fell from its high of 8.2 per cent in December 1996 to 4.7 per cent in November 2007, almost half what it had been previously. In absolute terms this meant that the number of women employed in the economy increased by more than 630,000. This was a remarkable achievement. Job creation is a highly effective way of improving economic conditions for both men and women. More women in work mean more opportunities to accumulate skills and experience, more wealth for families and a high level of social and economic inclusion. Central to emMAIN COMMITTEE ployment participation is a flexible workplace relations system. This government has turned back the clock-not just BH, before Howard, but BH, before Hawke and Keating. This government has gone so far as to wind back reforms championed by Hawke and Keating, returning us to an antiquated system of union dominated bargaining arrangements. This sort of motion is typical of Labor’s propensity to rewrite history to suit its own ideological requirements. Labor would have us believe that the millions of jobs created during the coalition’s term never happened and that Labor’s new workplace relations laws will be good for employment and good for women in the workforce. That is simply not the case, and continually moving motions like this one in support of the government’s own policies will not make it true, no matter how much they try and spin it. So what has brought about this latest attack of hubris and arrogance, writ large in this motion? Why, it is the self-congratulation of the Labor Party, who have-with the support of the coalition-brought in a paid parental leave scheme. But is this the best policy? No. Tony Abbott announced a more comprehensive paid parental leave scheme that would better meet the financial needs of Australian families. The coalition’s policy will provide a payment of $14,138 per week for 26 weeks, with full superannuation, compared to Labor’s policy of $9,780 for 18 weeks and no superannuation. Our policy provides maximum social benefits, whereas Labor’s scheme falls short of delivering real outcomes. The coalition is the only party with the vision, history of achievement and experience required to look after the needs of women in Australia. Labor’s pattern of failure is a pattern that Australian women can do without. In the time that remains to me I just note that the Rudd government is continuing to undermine the efforts of working women to support a family and to support their children in other ways. Under the Rudd government, the cost of living is growing. Inflation is beginning to sneak back into the economy and is now 2.9 per cent. For an economy that is emerging from a downturn, this is a remarkable figure. The government has tried to use quick political fixes such as GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch, both of which have been unmitigated policy failures. Meanwhile, the price of petrol, electricity, groceries, housing and medical services continues to rise. This government has failed the Australian people. It has failed Australian women. has expired.

North West Sydney: Road Infrastructure Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Hawke: That the House: (1) recognises the lack of adequate transport infrastructure in North West Sydney; (2) condemns the NSW Government for its under-funding of transport infrastructure in North West Sydney during the last 15 years; (3) acknowledges that the current lack of transport infrastructure: (a) inhibits the economic prosperity of North West Sydney; (b) imposes significant financial burdens on the residents of North West Sydney through excessive toll charges; and MAIN COMMITTEE",223,Private Members Business
360,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Re Ramsey),"Order! The time allotted for this debate(c) results in a high level of motor vehicle usage and has a detrimental environment impact for North West Sydney; (4) notes that the Federal Government provided only $91 million for planning of a West Sydney Metro railway as part of its funding through Infrastructure Australia and no funding for North West rail link; and (5) calls on the Federal Government to provide funding for the immediate commencement of a North West rail link. this very important motion before the House. The North West Rail Link represents perhaps the greatest single failing of any government policy, state or federal, in the last 50 years. When you examine what the New South Wales government has done about the north-west rail line over time, you see that it is the greatest breach of trust between a government and Australian voters that you could possibly imagine. On 29 November 1998, three months prior to a state election, the New South Wales government promised $29 million for a link from Epping Station to Castle Hill. Since then, the government has re-announced the north-west rail line five times. On9 June 2005, Bob Carr announced an $8 billion, 15-year Metropolitan Rail Extension Program. This announcement included the North West Rail Link, a new passenger line from Cheltenham to Rouse Hill via Castle Hill, with long-term plans to extend to the Vineyard and Richmond lines. On 20 November 2006, the government re-announced the completion of the north-west rail line by 2017-just seven short years away. The first stage, Epping to Hills Centre, would be completed by 2015-it would already almost be complete-and Hills Centre by 2017. Then the government announced the line in June 2007 with an extension from Rouse Hill to Vineyard Station on the Richmond line. Then the New South Wales state government abandoned all plans to build a north-west rail line. Why do we need a rail line in north-west Sydney? Why is it a vital component of the social, environmental and economic infrastructure that north-west Sydney desperately needs? It is because the electorate of Mitchell has the highest rate of cars per household of any federal electorate in this country, because there are no available public transport options. You drive, and every adult in your household needs to have a car. It is not just my electorate. Across the road there are similar difficulties in approaching employment, getting to the city or travelling across Sydney because of a failure of government to plan. We understand that governments can only do their best given the circumstances at the time they are put in, but the New South Wales state government has been in place for 16 years. It has been promised over six or seven times. The rail line has been cancelled, reannounced, cancelled, re-announced, cancelled, re-announced. This is the greatest single breach between a government and an electorate in Australian history. This is holding back the economic development of north-west Sydney. It is placing excessive financial burdens on residents, rate payers and people who have to travel by expensive motorways to and from their place of employment. I quote some examples of people in my electorate going to work every day. This is based on a 48-week working year. Our motorists travelling to the city are now paying $16.90 a day, $84.50 a week, $338 a month, $4,056 a year just to go to work.

361,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (8.02 Pm),"It gives me great pleasure to rise tonight to speak onthat will increase our capacity to get things done in Sydney. However, when you look at the litany of failure of the New South Wales government in these ventures, you see that they are giving public-private infrastructure partnerships a bad name in Sydney. We are losing investment in Sydney because of the failures of the Cross City Tunnel, the Lane Cove ventures and all of the things that are happening with the RTA shutting roads and receiving a payment from a company to force people to use a motorway-something that I think all members here would regard as unethical. In the shadow of the Penrith by-election, we can see that people in New South Wales have woken up to what is happening in north-west Sydney. It is emblematic of a city that is in disarray because of failures of government planning. I note that the member for Parramatta is here. I know that she would be extremely upset at the New South Wales government for breaching its promise to build a Parramatta-Epping rail link. Growing up in Carlingford, I can record my own absolute dismay at the residents in Carlingford not having a line that goes from Parramatta to Epping. But this is about the north-west rail link. It has been talked about throughout the last 15 years. There is a vital need in Sydney for heavy rail lines in the north-west and south-west of Sydney-particularly the north-west-to meet the growth that government has allowed. Government has allowed massive expansion in the north-west of Sydney. It has encouraged it. It has taxed people for the privilege of living there. Special infrastructure levies have been paid. The money has been collected by government, but the state government of New South Wales has abrogated its responsibility. This federal government needs to allocate any money that it gave to New South Wales for a north-west rail line. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (8.07 pm)-I think I could be forgiven for thinking that the member for Mitchell is going to run for state parliament today, because we are of course talking once again about state issues. There is nobody who lives in north-west Sydney-or Parramatta, for that matter-who does not understand the need for the north-west rail line. I would be one of the first to say that it is essential, as in my area are the Parramatta-Chatswood line, the doubling of the Richmond line and the western metro. We do have an extraordinary backlog of public transport rail infrastructure in the Sydney area and, as the member for Mitchell has said, it is a backlog that comes from 50 years of policy failure-many, many years. In fact, the Parramatta line was the first line built in New South Wales. It was built in September 1855. It was a long time ago. Many governments have come and gone since then, and since then we have had a single spur north and a single spur south. So many, many governments, extending long before the current one, have failed us in this area. I suspect that, given the nature of the backlog, which has built up over probably a hundred years, it will last long after the next state government. It is going to take a considerable amount of time for us to deal with that substantial public backlog. That is why I am really happy to see the Rudd government actually move decisively to engage in the policy area of cities and public transport. I remind the member for Mitchell that his claim that it is 50 years of policy failure on both state and federal levels applies very seriously to the Howard government, who spent nothing on public transport infrastructure during their 12 years in office. And can I add to the list that I do not just want a north-west rail line and a Parramatta to Chatswood line and the doubling of the Richmond line and the building of the western Metro; I also want lifts at Wentworthville, Toogabbie and Pendle Hill, I want more trains to stop there and I want commuter parking. We have very, very real issues to deal with when it comes to MAIN COMMITTEE public transport in Sydney and particularly Western Sydney. As for stunts where a member of federal parliament stands up and calls on the government to do something about it, can I suggest to the member for Mitchell that if he is really serious about this he can call on his own side to put their money where their mouth is. I am assuming he is telling us tonight that this is actually a policy of the opposition. Mr Hawke interjectingO’Farrell is going to commit to it. If Barry O’Farrell is committing to it, why are you wasting the federal parliament’s time standing up here and asking for the government to do it? Mr Hawke interjectingnot putting any money into it. I think that is what the member just said. Otherwise there is no explanation for why he is standing up in here wasting valuable time calling on the federal government to do something. If you believe that this is such a priority area, put your money where your mouth is and let us see this in the federal opposition policy. Let us see it costed. Let us see it funded. Let us see it there. That is what you should be doing. It is just a stunt. In my 5½ years here I can honestly say that I have not got up and called for something to happen if I did not think I could make it happen. I do not engage in fooling my electorate in that way. I really think you need to have a serious think about this. I know the press release will go out tomorrow: ‘I’m a good guy, I’m standing up for my community.’ Well, stand up for your community with Mr Abbott and put it in your own policy. There is an election coming up. This is your chance. Stand up tonight and call for yourself to do it. and add it to the promises. At the moment it sounds like what we have is Barry O’Farrell promising something that he has no intention of delivering because there is no money. This is actually a really serious matter and it requires really serious action. In the last budget we allocated $4.5 billion to urban public transport. Again, that is $4.5 billion more in one year than the Howard government put up in 12. So a little bit of history would not hurt from the member for Mitchell. This is a serious matter. These stunts do not help at all. If you think it really is the most serious issue, put it up. designer of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, John Bradfield, first articulated his vision in the 1930s. Western Sydney’s population has increased fivefold since 1940 and its rail has extended only an extra 20 kilometres. Ron Christie was Coordinator-General of Rail when the New South Wales government asked him in 2001 to compose a long-term strategic plan, now called the Christie report. He warned that more than half of Sydney risked being without rail, creating and reinforcing significant inequalities. One of the proposals in the Christie report calls for an independent agency, Transport for Sydney, to be modelled on the successful Transport for London. Consecutive state Labor governments have neglected Greater Western Sydney and continue to promise and delay projects in line with the election cycle. It is not surprising therefore that many residents of Greater Western Sydney and the local government areas that encompass the Sydney region have completely lost faith in the ability of governMAIN COMMITTEE",227,Private Members Business

366,Mrs Markus (Greenway) (8.12 Pm),"Sydney’s rail system has changed little since thements to deliver infrastructure in key parts of our state. It is for this reason that an independent agency such as the suggested Transport for Sydney is so important to delivering real transport and infrastructure results for people in our region. Recently the state Labor government scrapped its bungled Sydney Metro plan, which has wasted $300 million already with zero result for the people of Greater Western Sydney who helped fund this bungled plan with their taxes. Under state Labor, work on a long-awaited express rail on the Richmond line would not even commence until 2015-20 years after Labor was first elected to government. Without even a commitment from Labor as to when work on the line would be finished, it could easily be up to 30 years before work is completed on the project and before Greater Western Sydney commuters have access to express train services. People are already feeling the growing pains of increased population pressures. The Labor government’s consistent attitude of policy on the run means that there will be no time for adequate infrastructure planning as our population increases in order to ease congestion in our cities and to provide adequate and equitable transport options for those living on the outskirts. In areas such as the Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains local people have no confidence that the Rudd Labor government will deliver the infrastructure required to support population growth. A Labor government who breaks their election promises, who cannot safely put insulation into roofs, who cannot build school halls and who flip-flop on major policy issues cannot be trusted to get this right. The NRMA may have been outspoken in condemning the state Labor government’s failure to build infrastructure which can cope with Sydney’s growing population. They too acknowledge that, while commuters welcome the widening of the M2 freeway, people would still like to see more public transport so that they can leave their cars at home, helping the environment when they can. It needs to be noted that the M5 tunnel also opened at capacity and now the M2 requires expansion, an expansion that will increase costs for Greater Western Sydney commuters to an astronomical $22 per day once completed. Governments must plan for the future when implementing infrastructure and must keep in mind that the population of Sydney is growing. That is why the coalition’s plan for adequate and considered infrastructure in line with population growth is so important to the people living in Western Sydney. The coalition is of the view that an efficient freight route from the west to the port is important to encourage economic growth outside the Sydney basin and that it is a piece of infrastructure which will be needed in the long term. Across Sydney, particularly in my area, protecting our way of life by reducing time stuck in traffic and enabling more time to be spent with family is critical. Spending two hours a day in a car to travel 50 kilometres is not a good use of time. We cannot undo the mistakes of years of poor planning overnight. We have to deal with current transport challenges now and learn lessons for the future. Planning for our roads and infrastructure does not simply mean bigger roads; it means improved road safety, integration with rail and other public transport and investing in new ways to move forward. (Time expired) member for Parramatta and I were expecting a litany of projects in the 12 years of the coalition government and there was just one item listed-there was the M7!

367,Mr Price (Chifley) (8.17 Pm),"This has been a very interesting debate. I know thetolls in Sydney. Yet this was the project which had the best cost-benefit ratio of any infrastructure project in Australia. That was the only thing the coalition did-$7 dollars for the punters to use the tollway. The member for Mitchell mentioned his passion for public-private partnerships, and I share that passion. He mentioned the Lane Cove Tunnel and also, I think, the Cross City Tunnel. I have been through those tunnels. I often travel from Western Sydney on the M7 and on the M2 into the city. They are fantastic infrastructure. I do not know what the whingers are all about. In Western Sydney we pay $7 to use the M7. Lane Cove Tunnel is a lot cheaper and so is the Cross City Tunnel. I congratulate the member for Mitchell on announcing that the coalition is now going to fully fund the rail infrastructure for north-western Sydney. As a member from Western Sydney, I have to say that I have some sympathy. I support infrastructure projects for our region. But we are a federal government, and this federal government, in a short two years, has actually given $4.5 billion for rail projects. We are massively funding rail, road and port infrastructure, and we see the economic benefits of doing so. And how much was funded by the previous, Howard-Costello, government in rail and port infrastructure? I am sorry-zip! I was a member of the Hawke-Keating government which actually had a Better Cities program, and it is a pity that the member for Greenway is not here because that funded the busrail interchange at Blacktown, a significant transport hub for north-western Sydney. The Richmond line comes into Blacktown then shoots off. We funded that bit of infrastructure. We also funded the new bus terminal at Mount Druitt. We funded a commuter car park and upgraded facilities at St Marys station. But what did the Howard government do-and I predict the coalition will do the same with our ambitious projects to improve infrastructure-the first time they got in? They got rid of the Better Cities program that was providing significant infrastructure improvements for public transport. I do think that there is a case for more rail infrastructure in Western Sydney. By the way, the member for Parramatta reminded me that of course it was Gough Whitlam, not a coalition government, who actually, all those years ago, funded the quadrupling of the main Western Sydney line. Labor governments actually have a track record of investing in public infrastructure, and we will continue to do so. But I wonder-notwithstanding the promise by the member for Mitchell that the coalition will fully fund this bit of infrastructure-whether Labor’s massive infrastructure program of over $30 billion will see the light of day should Mr Abbott succeed at the next election. I would say they will be true to their form-they will axe the program. And, as far as the member for Mitchell is concerned, I think this rail system is still light years away if you have to depend on coalition governments. expired.

The time allotted for this debate hasPeople’s Republic of Korea on Sunday 30 May 2010, specifically: captain Melissa Barbieri, and players Casey Dumont, Lydia Williams, Emma Wirkus, Danielle Brogan, Ellie Brush, Kim Carroll, Clare Polkinghorne, Karla Reuter, Thea Slatyer, Laura Alleway, Joanne Burgess, Tameka Butt, Lauren Colthorpe, Heather Garriock, Elise Kellond-Knight, Aivi Luik, Collette McCallum, Caitlin Munoz, Ellyse Perry, Sally Shippard, Emily Van Egmond, Amy Chapman, Lisa De Vanna, Kate Gill, Samantha Kerr, Leena Khamis, Kyah Simon, Servet Uzunlar, Sarah Walsh, and coach Tom Sermanni; (2) praises the Matildas for its inspirational leadership to young Australian women and encouraging them to participate in football; and (3) acknowledges the Matildas’ role in the growth of the sport. Ms NEAL (Robertson) (8.23 pm)-I rise in particular to congratulate the Australian women’s football squad, otherwise known as the Matildas, for their victory in the 2010 Asian Football Confederation Women’s Asian Cup. The Matildas beat the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea team 5-4 on penalties following a one-all draw after extra time at Chengdu Sports Centre in China on 30 May this year. This thrilling result was brought home by Kyah Simon, an Indigenous teenager from Sydney’s western suburbs, who scored to secure victory in her first ever penalty shootout. The Matildas are the first Australian team to win the Women’s Asian Cup, beating the tournament favourites, Japan, in order to contest the final against Korea. Ben Buckley, Chief Executive Officer of Football Federation Australian said-and I am using his words, so I take no responsibility for the descriptive terms: The girls have made history today, by winning the first major tournament by a senior team since Australia joined the Asian Football Confederation four years ago. This is an enormous achievement by a team of dedicated, talented sportswomen who have trained for years to reach this level of elite competition. The Matildas are a credit to international football-to the sport of soccer, as we call it in Australia-and they are ambassadors for women’s sport in our community. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Schultz, that the Matildas deserve much greater recognition for this historic win than they have received to date. They have done what no other Australian football team has done by winning the Asian Cup against highly competitive rivals, including Korea, China and Japan amongst many others. More can be done by the national press and media commentators to provide teams such as the Matildas with their fair share of coverage and public recognition. This, in itself, will help the sport to grow. On 20 May this year, the Minister for Youth and Sport, Kate Ellis, released a new report: Towards a level playing field: sport and gender in Australian media, a report that provides a valuable insight into the gender inequality of sports media coverage in Australia. Towards a level playing field revealed that, in 2008, coverage of women in sport made up just 9 per cent of all sports coverage on Australian television news and current affairs. In contrast, male sport occupied 81 per cent of television news and current affairs. This is obviously completely inequitable and unjust. Horseracing by itself receives more airtime in the Australian media market than all women’s sport combined. This lack of coverage in Australia continues to cause serious problems for our women athletes in securing sponsorship. Liz Ellis, former captain of the Australian netball team, had this to say about women’s sport on a recent episode of Good News Week: MAIN COMMITTEE I don’t like the term ‘women’s sport’. It makes it sound like crocheting-you know, something that little old ladies get out and do occasionally. No! It’s women playing sport. For example, the Matildas are the only Australian football team who have ever won anything. So it’s not ‘women’s sport’, it’s just sport played by chicks who are good at it. Sports played by women deserve greater media coverage and public recognition and I rise in the House to give the Matildas just that-the recognition they deserve. They are great sportswomen and I am certainly very proud to be associated with them. I hope that, in future, the national press and media will give these women, and many other women who play sport well, the recognition that they deserve. Ms MARINO (Forrest) (8.27 pm)-I rise to strongly support the comments made by the member for Robertson and to support the motion on behalf of the Matildas and all women sportspeople in Australia. I also strongly agree-and I see, Mr Deputy Speaker Schultz, that you are shaking your head-that women’s sportneeds a serious increase in the amount of profile, recognition and respect it receives, because women in no way commit any less than anyone else competing in sport. The Matildas, as we know, were ranked fourth on the continent when they arrived in China for the 2010 AFC Women’s Asian Cup but, the Matildas being the Matildas, they had a lot of confidence about what they could achieve. That confidence was well placed. As we have heard, they beat Korea in that penalty shoot-out. Even more significantly, we have heard that they were the first Australian team, male or female, to win an Asian title at any level. It was, I have read, Australia’s very first piece of major silverware. They beat their more famous male equivalents to that honour. That is something that has not been appropriately recognised. Melissa Barbieri, the captain, said that the Australian Women’s Asian Cup win over North Korea was achieved with plenty of skill and heart. I think that is what we see in our women athletes. The win qualified the team for the upcoming 2011 Women’s World Cup finals. The Matildas were mobbed by the media and supporters on their return to Australia and I want to see that continue. These were people who wanted to share and celebrate the success and achievements of the team. As we know, these women are very keen to be role models for other young women who want to achieve in sport. Nobody in this room should underestimate the value of sport to young people, particularly in rural and regional communities such as the one I represent, through its encouragement of participation and team-building. The Matildas would be very strong role models for young people such as Tash Rigby and Domonique Fedele, who are part of our South West Academy of Sport soccer and athletes program. To Amy Fortescue, who participated in the under-17 state female soccer team of 2009, and to all those great young girls, who, at a very young age, go out on the soccer fieldted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

371,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Aj Schultz),"Order! It now being 8.30 pm, the time allotDebate resumed from 14 June. That grievances be noted. Budget and how it is affecting constituents in my electorate and what it will mean to Western Australia. I recently spoke about this subject in a matter of public importance but, as the third speaker with only five minutes, I was unable to give this matter all the gravitas that it requires. BeforeI enter into my grievance I would like to say a special hello to Ann Jones, the wife of John Jones, who was aboard the flight that is lost in the Congo. Ann is a member of my FEC and has worked tirelessly for the Liberal Party for many years and her charity work with animals is second to none. Ann may be listening. Ann, my thoughts and those of my staff and the members of the Swan division are with you and your family. We hope and pray for the safe return of John. It is men like John who have built and been a part of the WA and Australian mining industry that supports many lives and families across our great nation. Back to the subject: the implementation of the RSP tax by the Rudd government. In the 28 years I have been in business I do not think I have seen a more foolish act besides the disgraceful insulation scheme and the BER. I have heard people say that this will be the killer of the golden goose, but obviously they mean the killer of the goose which laid the golden egg. To put it simply, that is true. Small businesses in my electorate have already been affected and many more across Western Australia will also be hit hard by this tax. There has been much discussion about the RSP tax and the way it was introduced. The government has said it will pay for increased superannuation of three per cent and that all the workers will benefit from that. The employees may be the beneficiaries of this superannuation, but what they must realise is that it is not the RSPT that is paying for it; it is the employers and it will be coming off their bottom line. So the line that the Rudd government is running out that the RSPT is responsible for the super is just not true. In fact, it is just more Rudd spin. The Rudd gang of four just do not seem to understand the mining industry. They do not understand return on investment and they certainly do not understand financing of the industry or how investment bankers and capital investment groups assess the risks and returns on investments, particularly in the mining industry. To arbitrarily nominate that anything above six per cent is a super profit, again, is just another headline and a load of Rudd waffle. Anyone who has run a business or owned a business knows that if you are going to risk capital you need a decent return. If you can get six per cent from bonds, why would you even bother to take the risk of developing or building up an exploration mine which is so risky? If you knew anything about business-and working for a union does not qualify as a business-you would know that there has to be a reward for risk and effort. This Rudd government has just taken the reward for effort away from the mining industry and the Prime Minister should dump this tax. I do not know why the Prime Minister so dislikes Western Australia but his actions do speak louder than words. Mr Rudd promised us a fairer share of the GST in the lead-up to the MAIN COMMITTEE",233,Private Members Business
372,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Aj Schultz),The question is:,234,Grievance Debate
373,Mr Irons (Swan) (8.30 Pm),"TonightI rise to talk about the resources super profits tax2007 election but, as a state, we only receive 68c of every dollar we raise in GST. It is just another broken promise. In 2007 Mr Rudd also said he would give us a WA infrastructure fund of $100 million. What is that? It is another broken promise. Why should we now believe Prime Minister Rudd when he says WA should expect-and ‘expect’ was the word-to get $2 billion from an infrastructure fund, raised from the RSPT? Mr Rudd, why should anyone in WA believe that and, to tell you the truth, most people in WA just do not believe you anymore. They have stopped listening to you. I say to all Western Australians and to anyone who lives in Western Australia: anyone who supports this tax just does not like and does not want to support Western Australia. All the WA members of parliament who support this tax do not have Western Australian interests at heart. All the WA Labor candidates who support this tax and are out there spruiking their support of the RSPT certainly do not have Western Australian interests at heart. Go out and tell all the families, the workers and the businesses who are supported by the mining and resource sector that you are supporting a tax that is going to ruin their lives. Go out and tell the local printer, the local courier, the local owner of the Telstra shop, the transport companies and the contractors who invest heavily in equipment to earn income from the industry that you support the tax that will ruin their income, their revenues and their lifestyles. And what about all the tradies that those on the other side continually say they support? What will you say to them when exploration in Australia dries up and they have no more work and they hear other people saying that this will not happen? Let me make a prediction, because the Prime Minister just does not get it: this RSPT tax will ruin not only the WA economy but eventually the Australian economy. The only way to stop this tax is to change the government. For all Western Australians who may be listening, I am pleased to note today that the Premier of Western Australia announced that after 12 months of discussions and negotiations the state government has reached a historic-and I will use the word ‘historic’ because it seems to be used around here all the time-new agreement with BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto to amend iron ore rates payments from 1 July 2010. I quote from the Premier’s press statement. He said: From July 1, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto’s royalty rates will change from 3.75 per cent to 5.625 per cent to bring them into line with other iron ore producers and the companies will be able to integrate their Pilbara operations. This will apply to all production by the companies and will generate an additional $340million in State royalties for the 2010-11 financial yearwhich will benefit Western Australians. He goes on: Under the Heads of Agreement signed today the companies will also make a joint one-off payment to the State of $350millionanother benefit to Western Australians. He said that there will be a one-off payment of $350 million to consolidated revenue when the bills reach royal assent, which will be placed in a special account for a new children’s hospital due to begin construction in 2012 and be completed by 2015. Overall, the new royalty rates are forecast to generate an additional $340 million in 2010-11 and $1.06 billion over the next four years. This is a good result for Western Australia, a win-win, as the Premier describes it. It was brought about by 12 months of consultative and open negotiations with the two mining organisations. The way the Premier has handled these negotiations could not be in greater contrast to the way the Rudd government has handled the resource rent tax announcement. MAIN COMMITTEE The Rudd government announced this policy without any real consultation and then proceeded to set up a sham consultation process whilst making the key element of the tax nonnegotiable. This is a government that refuses to consult-not when taxing industries employing thousands and not even when changing flight paths over people’s homes, as we saw when the flight paths changed from and into Perth Airport in November 2008. Fortunately we were able to get up a Senate inquiry into that debacle as well, which the government senators voted against. This afternoon in this place I heard the member for Holt, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Cabinet, talk about openness and transparency. Why did the Labor senators vote against a Senate inquiry into Airservices Australia that sought the truth? ASA declared at the Senate hearing in Perth that the noise issue was only a perception. The people of Swan, Pearce, Canning and Perth know that the aircraft noise caused by the flight path changes is not a perception. At a hearing two weeks ago in Perth, even staff from Stephen Smith’s office admitted that there was an issue with noise in Western Australia, particularly in Perth, from aircraft noise. I go back to consulting. No consultation was done by the Rudd government with the mining industry, and that gives bad policy outcomes. The gang of four running this country at the moment are certainly no experts in business, yet they are making business decisions without seeking advice from or consulting with the people who know. This is no way to run a country, and their approach is doing enormous damage to Australia’s reputation overseas. I will finish with some quotes from the industry, which I hate to admit is the usual form from the government to support their weak arguments on bad policies. Firstly, I will quote Anna Bligh, the Queensland Premier, who said: You can’t expect international companies to make those investment decisions unless they’ve got absolute certainty about the costs of doing business. Herb Elliott, another famous Australian, who is Chairman of Fortescue Metals, said: We now have a huge new tax on the mining industry that will ultimately decimate future investments in new projects and have a negative impact on the value of your investment in our company … He goes on: It’s now clear that this means they have dropped on the Australian people a socialist-style funding and tax device where the government is now your silent partner … the keystone of this tax rests on a Government guarantee to refund 40 per cent of any losses not rebated through the tax system. It waits until a project has failed or reached the end of its life without having redeemed the tax credits. It is of course theoretical nonsense. Who believes that companies could fund 40 per cent of an investment on the strength of some future unbudgeted Government tax credit after it failed? No bank wants to fund a failed project on the premise that 40 per cent can subsequently, perhaps, be reclaimed through tax …. Jobs will be denied to tens of thousands of Australians who would have been employed on new projects. Minara Resources have stated: Under the new proposed tax, if the rules come in, it would be much more favourable to look at investments offshore. With that, I will close and again congratulate the Premier of Western Australia for doing a consulted, negotiable, historic agreement with the mining industry. MAIN COMMITTEE Budget Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (8.40 pm)-There certainly are a lot of myths and untruths out there about the resource super profits tax. We have just heard a few more in here tonight. I happen to believe that the resource super profits tax and reform of the tax regime for mining is good for Australia. I want to take this opportunity in this grievance debate to clear up some of the more ridiculous myths on the resource super profits tax. The first and the loudest one from the opposition-and we have heard it again tonight-is that it will reduce investment. At first glance, if you do not think about it or you are not particularly financially literate, it seems reasonable. How can a new tax increase investment? It can if one tax replaces an inefficient one, and that is essentially what is happening here. Currently, mining companies pay for the use of resources that belong to us through royalties, effectively a tax on volume, payable whether they make a profit or not. The resource super profits tax replaces that with a tax on profit. The fact is that replacing an inefficient tax like royalties with an efficient tax like a super profits tax will drive investment, growth and jobs. Independent modelling supports that position. Remember that the Minerals Council, representing the mining companies, asked for a royalty system to be replaced by a profits based tax. There is general agreement that existing arbitrary and changing state royalty regimes result in less mining investment-and of course they do because they tax production and ignore the costs involved in generating that output. In fact, mining companies pay a tax whether they make a profit or not. Because of that, many of our mines cannot get off the ground and others shut down too early, leaving good resources in the ground. As a consequence we leave far too many commercially viable resources in the ground, valuable resources that belong to the Australian people, purely because the current royalties regime makes them unviable. For low-value minerals and some less profitable mines, the outcome for the company of a new resource super profits tax is likely to be positive, not negative. If the threat of the mining tax was so real, you would expect mining stocks to be getting a bit of a beating at the moment. Yet in recent weeks, when markets around the world responded to the uncertainty in Europe, mining stocks in the Australian stock market performed better than other sectors, not worse. They also performed better than mining stocks in several of our competitor countries. The Australian people own 100 per cent of Australia’s natural resources and they are not getting their fair share. We do believe that some mining companies can pay more tax, but let us keep this in perspective. When you hear the opposition’s claims that the sky will fall, remember that the government only wants to take the Australian people’s share of mining profits closer to where it was under the Howard government in the early 2000s-about halfway through the last government’s term and immediately before the last mining boom. Was the Howard government overtaxing the resources sector then? No, it was not, and nor will this government be. And nor did tax at that level prevent the mining boom which began around 2002. In fact, mining boomed with that tax load. But the Howard government took its eye off the ball. We enjoyed the boom but, arguably, we did not manage it to safeguard us for the future. The profits of mining companies rose but the Australian people’s share of those profits fell. Before the last boom, they got $1 in every $3 of mining profits through royalties and charges but at the end of that boom it was down to just $1 in $7. MAIN COMMITTEE There is a myth that the resource super profits tax will harm existing projects. That is also not true. We are negotiating transitional arrangements and general recognition of past investments. We have also heard a lot of claims about projects closing down-claims that have turned out to be exaggerated or false. We know that the mining companies have cried wolf over and over again. When land rights were introduced, they claimed that would end mining as we know it. The resources rent tax would end development in the petroleum sector. Of course, when we abolished Work Choices, that was also going to bring an end to mining. In the last 15 years or so, we have seen the mining companies claim the end of the world at least three times, and we need to take their claims with a little grain of salt. There is also a particularly mischievous claim by the opposition that the resource super profits tax will cause consumer prices to rise. Independent modelling by KPMG Econtech shows that that is not the case. After all, the vast majority of the minerals subject to the resource super profits tax like iron ore in the Pilbara are shipped overseas at prices set on world markets. For those resources that are sold on domestic markets, Treasury analysis confirms that the super profits tax should not affect the price of gas and coal and, therefore, electricity. The Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism has also advised that it expects there will be no significant effect on electricity prices from the changed tax arrangements under current contracts between coalminers and electricity generators. Then there is the most ridiculous myth that the RSPT is a triple tax on mining, coming on top of royalties and company tax. But let us make this really clear: resource companies will not pay the new resource super profits tax on top of royalties; they will pay the new tax instead of royalties. All companies in Australia are required to pay company tax but a few businesses receive as their primary input the non-renewable resources that belong to the Australian people, as mining companies do. Most companies pay for their inputs. The purpose of the resource super profits tax is to ensure Australians receive fair value for these non-renewable resources that miners extract from our country. No other business would try to argue that they should get their primary inputs for free, courtesy of the Australian people, just because they pay company tax and neither should Australia’s largest mining companies. The common sense reality is reflected in the fact that the miners have always had to pay royalties to reflect the value they are receiving from our national resources. The government will use about a third of the resource super profits tax revenue directly to assist the resources sector. The revenue from the resource super profits tax will well and truly be put to good use. A new infrastructure fund will make infrastructure spending a permanent feature of Commonwealth and state budgets for the first time. It will deliver $700 million in 2012-13 and more than $5.6 billion in the next decade. Without infrastructure funding, capacity constraints will hold back resource sector expansion and push up inflation and interest rates for us all. Roughly a third of the package will promote growth across the economy, addressing the risk of a two-speed economy by taking the brakes off the slower lane. The Howard government presided over the development of a two-speed economy where the nonmining related parts of the economy found it difficult to attract and retain workers and investment. Manufacturers in Parramatta tell me the same thing over and over again: the success of our resources sector drives up the exchange rate, making it hard for other Australian industries to compete on the global stage. In Parramatta, the two-speed imbalance affects the MAIN COMMITTEE ability of smart new industries to start up and grow and for families it drives up inflation and interest rates. A phased cut to the company tax rate to 28 per cent will assist the competitiveness of all Australian industries. The government will also seek to cut the company tax rate further as revenue allows. Small businesses will get a head start on the company tax cut with a 28 per cent rate applying from 2012-13. Small businesses will benefit from a new instant write-off for assets worth up to $5,000. Depreciation for other assets will be simplified, reducing complexity, cutting red tape and providing upfront tax relief. It is a good idea, a sensible idea, in a boom to put some of the returns aside for the future, and our plan does that. When you sell something that is non-renewable to pay for something that reoccurs every year, there is a strong case to save some of the revenues for the future. The final third of the revenue will do just that by going into national savings through superannuation. Superannuation will gradually be increased from nine per cent to 12 per cent. Around 3.5 million lower paid Australians will receive a concession on their superannuation guarantee contributions for the first time. People aged over 50 with lower super balances will be given a more generous contribution cap to allow them to make catch-up contributions. Revenue from the resource super profits tax will cover revenue forgone from the lower tax rate of super contributions. This is a very good policy. We know that a resources super profit tax will work in Australia because we have had one for over 20 years. The sky did not fall when we introduced it. Twenty years later the petroleum sector is still booming. The 40 per cent petroleum resource rent tax has operated on offshore petroleum projects since 1987 and, under it, petroleum production has remained strong. Indeed, Australia’s largest single investment, the Gorgon project, which was approved late last year, is to be developed under the 40 per cent petroleum resource rent tax. I am not going to deny the obvious-the most profitable mines in this country will pay more tax under the resources super profit tax. I am also not for a minute going to deny that owners of those mines will object. But this is good policy. It is in the national interest, and I am prosecuting for the interests of Parramatta families and singles who deserve a fairer share through higher retirement savings, more roads, more rail, more ports-(Time expired) Flinders Electorate: Point Nepean is, I want to make it absolutely clear, a grievance which I bring to this chamber on behalf of my electorate of Flinders. The future of Point Nepean, on the eastern side of the Mornington Peninsula at the bottom end of Port Phillip, was settled three years ago. It was settled because there had been over $50 million in Commonwealth grants and it had been declared an area of National Heritage status; at the time, it was in the first 30 on the list. Beyond that, and still more importantly, it was agreed through the work of the Point Nepean Community Trust-a long, arduous and consultative planning process-that this was to be the site of the National Centre for Coasts and Climate. It was to be the site of a great research facility on a boutique scale that would be one of the jewels not just of the Mornington Peninsula, Port Phillip or Melbourne but of Victoria and Australia with regard to research and the environment. MAIN COMMITTEE",234,Grievance Debate
374,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (8.50 Pm),"It is a pleasure to appear before you this evening. ThereThe things allocated were as follows: firstly, 110 student places; secondly, $7 million for the University of Melbourne to have a fit-out done on its behalf by the Point Nepean Community Trust; thirdly, $2 million of trailing rent over three years, including an escalator to be provided by the Commonwealth; fourthly, a much broader package of over $50 million allocated by the Commonwealth through different sources; and, fifthly, the agreement that, on handing over to the state of Victoria, the state would produce a payment of $10 million to be held in escrow purely for the purposes of the quarantine station area. That is what was agreed upon by the peninsula, by the community and by all of those involved. It was a vision of the peninsula as a centre for environmental research. It was a vision of the magnificent quarantine station area at Point Nepean being open to the public but with an anchor tenant which would be there for the next 50, 70 or 100 years. It was a vision based around marine research and in the tradition of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Bodega Bay marine institute. These are the global models upon which the Point Nepean vision was established. There was unity, commitment and conviction within the community, an operating trust under the chairmanship of Simon McKeon and a system which should not in any way have been subject to the threat of commercial exploitation in place of this vision. Sadly-and this is where I come to the grievance-since the 2007 election this vision has been allowed to slide. I had not thought that was possible. We had established the trust with sufficient money, we had signed a heads of agreement with Melbourne University and we had made sure that the trust had a about 18 months to operate and during which to complete the works on the ground at Point Nepean to ensure that the state of Victoria was handed a functioning National Centre for Coasts and Climate. This has been a personal passion of mine for many years. As I said, there was money, there was an operating body, there was a committed university, there were capital works and there was an unparalleled site. It should be for the benefit of students, the Mornington Peninsula community and marine research. It should not be turned into a hotel which will inevitably fail as we saw nearby with the Delgany Hotels complex. The facts are these: on coming to government the Rudd government, through Minister Garrett, took instructions from the state of Victoria and put on hold almost all works relating to the completion of the National Centre for Coasts and Climate. Why? Because the state had a very different vision. As we saw recently in the Southern Peninsula News, that vision was to establish a large, commercial luxury hotel. This was in breach of every promise that the state had made during 2003, 2004 and 2005. This was in breach of the very campaign that the state waged during that time. The state said there must be no commercial exploitation of this place-that this sanctuary, this special point, should be a place for all Victorians for all time. So that sacred pledge was sacrificed with an instruction from the state of Victoria, through Parks Victoria and the office of the state environment minister Gavin Jennings, to Mr Garrett that the Commonwealth should wind back the works and hold the project in abeyance. The ground works were completed, but the building work which would have allowed the early transition to a National Centre for Coasts and Climate was stopped dead in its tracks. That was unacceptable, inappropriate and simply wrong. After the transition from the Commonwealth to the state at the end of June last year, we saw something very different. We saw the state progressively wind back two visions. The first was the vision for a respite centre for kids with terminal conditions and their families. It is MAIN COMMITTEE extraordinary that a private benefactor who had offered $10 million and had spent $1 million on putting forward a vision for a respite centre for kids with terminal conditions and gross disabilities has been systematically thwarted by the Victorian government. What higher purpose and use could there be for such a magnificent area? I find it inconceivable and simply unforgivable that this has been thwarted. The benefactor still wishes to make that money available but it is impossible. Other than housing some administrators and a small heritage area which had long been in place, the buildings of the quarantine station remain empty. The second element is this: the state immediately pocketed the $7 million which had been allocated to the University of Melbourne. That money which had been set aside for marine education, for research into climate change, for research into the magnificent heritage of Point Nepean-the tidal influence, the marine environment, the ecology of Port Phillip-was gone. That money has gone into the general budget of Parks Victoria. Again, that is a breach of the terms and intention of the handover from the Commonwealth to the state. I have long supported the handover, so long as the buildings will be used for marine education. SoI find it extraordinary that that $7 million was taken. Secondly, we saw Minister Garrett take out of this year’s budget the $2 million of trailing rents for seven years. These are two significant breaches of faith. Parks Victoria says that, under those conditions, Melbourne university is not engaging in discussions. Having spoken with the Vice-Chancellor of Melbourne university I can say to the House that Melbourne university remains committed and would love to proceed with the project. But, without the $7 million that was always set aside as the basis for the deal, they cannot afford it. Without the $2 million of trailing rents they cannot afford it. What we see in its place is a vision, writ large on the front of the Southern Peninsula News, of a luxury hotel. Two things will occur. Firstly, if that luxury hotel does get up, it will be a monumental breach of faith with everything that the community campaigned for over the last seven years. Secondly, if the hotel is established then, as with nearby Delgany-another classic heritage building which was used for a hotel-because of the seasonal nature of Portsea it will inevitably fail. And when it fails these buildings at Point Nepean will be privatised. That is inevitable. The plan as it currently stands is a breach of faith. There is a resolution, a way forward, and that is to return the $7 million to the beneficial use of Melbourne university for the fit-out of the National Centre for Coasts and Climate, to keep faith with that vision and to ensure that in 50, 70, 100 years from now this is a centre of research not a commercial precinct. Refugees in Australia of Vietnamese, the so-called original boat people in this country. In fact, yesterday was the actual date 35 years ago that the first Vietnamese refugees who escaped Vietnam on the cargo ship Truong Xuan arrived in Australia. Yesterday I met Captain Pham Ngoc Luy, who made the heroic voyage from Indonesia to South Vietnam, after hearing about the imminent fall of Saigon on Radio Australia, and rescued almost 4,000 people in their quest for freedom. A wave of refugees then followed, coming to our shores after the fall of Saigon. I do not need to remind the parliament that the Vietnam War, despite much controversy at the time in the West, was one in which Australia along with its allies was totally committed. Therefore, it fell to the governments of Australia, the US and others to take responsibility for the consequences of such a war. Accordingly, Australia decided to play its part and look after people MAIN COMMITTEE",239,Grievance Debate
375,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (9.01 Pm),"This year marks the 35th anniversary of the settlementwho were displaced from Vietnam. We opened our arms and our shores to the innocent families who fled the communist regime. Clearly, we now celebrate the immense contribution the Vietnamese refugees have made in Australia over the past 35 years. Mr Deputy Speaker, I invite you to recall that in 2003, notwithstanding the fact that the Labor Party did not support the war in Iraq, and nor was it sanctioned by the UN, Australia chose to be part of the ‘Coalition of the Willing’. We were assured that the invasion of Iraq was not about regime change but about weapons of mass destruction. No weapons were found. Instead, there was a restructure of the forces of influence in Iraq, regime change certainly occurred and a power vacuum ensued. As a result of this vacuum, tensions and conflicts between Shia and Sunni Iraqis escalated, resulting in thousands of Iraqis being displaced from their homes. Clearly, the unintended consequence of our involvement has been the systematic and consistent persecution of Christian minority groups in Iraq. Assyrians and Sabian Mandaeans in particular are now living with the constant threat of violence and persecution, which is all too real. I am not talking about organised militia groups who have chosen to engage in a fight. I am talking about innocent families, mums and dads, children, priests and other religious leaders who are being targeted, assaulted, and even killed because of their religious beliefs. In May this year the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom released its annual report, which outlined the various threats and acts of violence experienced in countries the United States have designated as ‘countries of particular concern’ when it comes to religious freedom abuses. It would come as no surprise to many people that Iraq is one such country. The commission’s report states: The religious freedom situation in Iraq remains grave, particularly for the country’s smallest, most vulnerable religious minorities. The violence, forced displacement, discrimination, marginalisation, and neglect suffered by members of these groups threatens these ancient communities’ very existence in Iraq. These minorities, which include Chaldo-Assyrians and other Christians, Sabian Mandaeans … continue to experience targeted violence, receive inadequate official protection or justice …. If these words are not convincing enough that there is a real problem in Iraq, the statistics are chilling. According to the commission’s report, in 2003 there were approximately 1.4 million Catholics, Assyrians and Armenians living in Iraq. Today the number is down to about 500,000. Similarly, prior to the invasion there were 60,000 Mandaeans in Iraq; now there are somewhere between 3,500 and 5,000. The others have all left, fleeing for their lives. If you doubt the atrocities being committed in Iraq against Christian minorities, I would also point to the Assyrian International News Agency’s July 2009 report Incipient genocide: the ethnic cleansing of the Assyrians of Iraq. It is truly an understatement to say this is totally disturbing. The details of this systematic and consistent persecution of Assyrians in Iraq include gruesome murders, extortion and violence. The report contains horrendous images of children who have been shot in cold blood because they chose to follow their faith. It shows the burnt out shells of churches which have been blown apart. It also puts a face to the many Assyrians who have been murdered. According to this report, 309 Assyrians have been murdered since the invasion in 2003. In addition to the murders, religious institutions and symbols are being targeted through specific bombings. Undoubtedly this inflicts terror and insecurity on the remaining Assyrian community. As a consequence of the violence, many Christian MAIN COMMITTEE Iraqis have fled to refugee camps in Syria and Jordan. Issues affecting refugees in Iraq and the timely processing of their visas are of particular concern to me. More recently, I have made representations to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship concerning the situation in Syria which has been brought to my attention by local community members. I understand a number of departmental officials have been denied entry into Syria, which has significantly delayed the assessment of humanitarian visa applications for people who have fled Iraq. I also understand that the Syrian government is refusing to grant visas for Australian officials unless they provide access to the files of refugees approved for resettlement in Australia. I find it alarming that these refugees are now being denied the opportunity to have their applications properly assessed by Australian officials because of these decisions by the Syrian government. We are certainly grateful to the Syrian government for looking after these people in the various refugee camps under their administration, but there is also a need for all governments to coordinate in the interests of these displaced people. Clearly these people are displaced essentially because of the invasion of Iraq by the coalition of the willing and the consequences that have followed. Therefore, I believe that, along with the other members of the coalition of the willing, we have a moral responsibility, just as we did in 1975, to deal with the consequences of the war. When the infamous weapons of mass destruction were not found, the then President of the United States said-and this was adopted by the then Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard-that a world without Saddam Hussein would be a better world. That may be so. However, the aftermath of the 2003 invasion-the persecution of Christian minorities and the growing list of displaced people-is something that we need to recognise and address. The special needs of these people and the consequences of our involvement in Iraq will not simply fix themselves; they require a consistent effort on our part, over and above what we are duty-bound to do from our position and our commitments to the United Nations on refugee placement. I reiterate that these people find themselves displaced because of our activities. They are suffering persecution, with extraordinary consequences for families. The vast majority have now moved. They reside elsewhere, in refugee camps, waiting for processing along with other refugees. These people cannot be returned or repatriated to that country that we not only invaded but also left. This is one of the consequences of that. This is something that should have been considered at the time, when the then Australian government decided to be part of the coalition of the willing. This is not going to fix itself. We must have a commitment because of the actions that we took back in 2003. This is a lasting legacy of that invasion. We need to make sure that we take the responsible, moral, correct position when it comes to the repatriation of these people, who have been displaced for reasons not of their making but as a consequence of an invasion of their country. Science Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (9.10 pm)-The crumbling of the Soviet Union and the rest of the Eastern bloc almost 20 years ago would deliver a peace dividend to the West, we were toldand, to an extent, it did. But we were also fooled, lulled into a false sense of security. Sure, it allowed us to initially slash defence expenditure, but that also reduced our military capabilities and, perhaps most importantly, led to a malaise in the West which continues today. Scientific research has stagnated, military and intelligence services have been found lacking, and MAIN COMMITTEE now we are in the grip of a global financial crisis. We in the West almost appear to be wandering aimlessly, wondering what to do next. What caused me to think about these issues was work that I have been doing on both anthropogenic global warming-or climate change, in the current politically correct parlance; I will just call it AGW-and the planned purchase of the new Joint Strike Fighter, or JSF, for Australia, two issues being driven by appeals to authority rather than critical examination of data and evidence. Proponents of both seem to have a form of institutionalised groupthink, an attempt to counter criticism by attacking the critics rather than addressing the substance of their concerns and criticisms. The end of the Cold War caused a loss of focus on what we believe in and stand for. There was no longer any clearly defined threat and no clearly defined goal. The war on terror provided a different kind of challenge, and the global warming debacle has more to do with religion than science, but these have also failed to give the West a common focus. As a result, the West has effectively become rudderless-no pun intended-and priority for research and development and defence expenditure has been lost. Why is this bad? Because much of the blue-sky research and development that in the past came about as a result of defence funding has been virtually eliminated. As a result, the hard sciences and mathematics withered on the vine, with decreasing funding bases and hence reduced interest from the most capable students. Why would our best and brightest want to struggle away with a hand-to-mouth existence when they could have security and a well-paid future elsewhere? So, in a time of often ill-directed policy and increased funding of universities, the numbers of students entering the hard sciences and mathematics have decreased in both real and relative terms. At the same time, the numbers enrolling in soft sciences and humanities have increased significantly. It is important to note that the skills used in the hard sciences, such as physics and chemistry, are somewhat different to those in the soft biological and life sciences but far more so to those in the humanities, and the net result has been a deskilling of our nations in science and technology. When President Bush in 2004 proposed returning to the moon, he stated that it should be achieved by 2020, a period of 16 years. This is staggering. It is twice as long as was required for the Apollo moon landings from the first human being flying in space-and we had done it before. Worse, the effort has now been abandoned. The F15 Eagle fighter was in service about five years after McDonnell Douglas won the contract. By way of contrast, it will take Lockheed Martin more than 15 years for the JSF to become operational-and the F15, by the standards of the day, was the more technically difficult achievement. Another disturbing feature we see in the West today is risk aversion. Mistakes and risks cannot be tolerated, so we end up with slow, incremental advance. This is another part of the protracted nature of so much development occurring now. The critical thinking skills required for so many technical and scientific decisions are no longer as widespread as they once were-a result of the diminishing numbers trained in the hard sciences and maths. More and more of these decisions are based upon non-science-based thinking, where justification of a point of view takes precedence over a decision based on hard evidence. The slide in the numbers and capability of those in the technical areas needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency; otherwise we will end up with a plethora of decisions based on an accepted paradigm MAIN COMMITTEE rather than hard data and evidence. This will result in bad decisions which will affect people’s livelihood and welfare. We see abundant evidence of this with the Rudd government’s so-called policymaking. It is interesting that the policies outlined for Australia’s long-term benefit are, from a realistic government legislation perspective, out in the never-never world of 2020 or 2050. Policies that are actually introduced to the parliamentary legislative agenda are very obviously focus group driven and they are not even focused on views that people may have a year or so in the future but on the here and now. As a result, we have decisions such as the CPRS and the mining supertax, which would have been easy to sell in the context of focus groups but are policies that are unable to withstand the scrutiny of the opposition and others. With the ETS, people like the idea, in the abstract, of saving the planet, but when they realise it will cost them real money, they want real evidence. I have been saying this for years. It is plainly obvious to anyone with any ability for critical thinking, but it has clearly eluded many of the government members. The members opposite that know this whole AGW issue for the bunkum it is have, to their enormous discredit, simply gone along with their party line for fear of the punishment that would be meted out by their party. They had no hard fought policy debate within their party as we had in ours. That is why Labor decision making is so poor. The gang of four hands down the edicts from on high and the rest of the Labor Party must simply go along with it subserviently. It is a travesty for our democracy to think that the collective wisdom of a parliamentary party, which should be around 130 members and senators on the government side, is seen to reside in the minds of a mere four people. It is shameful. With the mining supertax, you once again have short-term policymaking without adequate thought, evaluation or assessment. This is a simple case of politics of envy introduced by the gang of four. They dreamed up this scheme and were convinced that they would be able to sell it to the electorate by telling them that the big, rich, billionaire miners should pay more tax. After all, the government did create a simply enormous, massive deficit that it would have to repay. ‘No more tax burden for the average taxpayer’ was the focus-group-driven analysis-‘No, just those dirty rich miners’. So the tax was sneaked into the budget with absolutely no initial view to consult. Any reasonable approach would have included consultation from the outset and certainly prior to the budget. Suddenly reality struck, with the true situation becoming apparent and people becoming aware this would have a massive negative effect on the nation’s finances. The government is in damage control and has run out of its backflip budget. This highlights the need for a greater emphasis on analytical skills and increased training of people in hard science and mathematics so that decisions in all areas, including government policymaking, are made analytically. We need people trained to appreciate the situation, not situate the appreciation! As such, it is necessary to return to the fundamentals in many of these areas and realise, as President Kennedy said in the 1960s when committing the US to a manned lunar landing that decade: … we do these and other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard. We need to make genuinely hard decisions, not make easy decisions and then simply spin them as hard as has been the case with the Rudd government. MAIN COMMITTEE Climate Change climate change talks were a big disappointment to those of us who believe in the urgency of concerted action to reduce the world’s carbon emissions and hoped for international agreement on genuine and meaningful carbon reduction targets. There is also no question that the defeat of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in the Senate was a big blow to those of us who believe in the need to put a price on carbon, who believe in putting the market to work in delivering least cost carbon abatement and who believe that we have got to start somewhere in turning our upwards carbon trajectory around. These two events at the end of last year were big setbacks. There is no point trying to pretend otherwise. But this does not mean that the fight against global warming can be relegated to second or third order status. Reducing carbon emissions must remain a top priority. I have been contacted by many of my constituents urging strong, effective, urgent action to reduce carbon emissions. I agree with them. Strong, effective action to cut emissions is urgently needed. The good news is that a mountain of work has been done on ways we can reduce our carbon emissions-so much work, in fact, that it is hard to know where to start. There is Al Gore’s book Our Choice: A Plan to Solve the Climate Crisis, with numerous good ideas. But I will start with the recently released report by the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions titled Creating jobs-cutting pollution, the roadmap for a cleaner, stronger economy, with its distinctly Australian focus. The ACF and the ACTU commissioned the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research to conduct economic modelling of carbon emission reduction scenarios. The ‘strong action’ scenario assumed a price on carbon through a carbon trading scheme, along with a targeted suite of policies to reduce carbon pollution without reliance on imported international permits. These policies include: energy efficiency strategies for households, industry and commercial buildings; a rapid expansion of clean energy infrastructure; a cleaner vehicle fleet and public transport infrastructure plan; and targeted regional investment and industry planning. These ‘strong action’ measures lead to a stronger economy, more jobs, better regional outcomes, less debt and higher living standards. The ‘strong action’ measures lead to a stronger economy, with an average 3.2 per cent GDP in the next 20 years compared with 2.8 per cent GDP if the measures are not taken. ‘Strong action’ leads to 770,000 more jobs than ‘weak action’. There will be 3.7 million created across the Australian economy under ‘strong action’, compared with three million under ‘weak action’. Jobs grow across all sectors of the economy under the ‘strong action’ measures to reduce emissions. Jobs growth is not just about renewable energy; agriculture, mining, forestry, fisheries, manufacturing, construction and services all go up, a total of 770,000 jobs up. Living standards also go up. Compared to ‘weak action’, Australians will be nearly 10 per cent better off in economic welfare terms in the period to 2030. Australia will have less debt. If we do not take the ‘strong action’ measures, Australia’s balance of payments will deteriorate over time due to the high reliance on importing international carbon permits and the continued high level of oil imports, which comes with failure to invest in a cleaner vehicle fleet and public transport infrastructure. MAIN COMMITTEE",241,Grievance Debate
376,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (9.19 Pm),"There is no question that the Copenhagen‘Strong action’ results in significant additional benefits through lower oil imports, lower imports of international permits and improved energy efficiency. The Creating jobs-cutting pollution report makes it very clear that tackling climate change will not be at the expense of jobs or economic prosperity. It is quite the opposite. Failure to reduce carbon emissions will lead to job losses and lower our living standards. I commend the ACF and the ACTU on this report, and I commend the report to the government and to the parliament. The Australian Conservation Foundation has also released its 2010 national agenda for a sustainable Australia. It has many worthy proposals. Right upfront it proposes a national population policy to stabilise Australia’s population at an ecologically sustainable level by 2050 and assist other countries to do the same. I have been calling for this for some time, and I commend this proposal to the Minister for Population and to the parliament. I note that the Queensland Conservation and the Sunshine Coast Environment Council are also calling for population stabilisation. I hope other environment groups will follow this example. After all, it is pretty hard to reduce your carbon footprint if you keep adding more feet. The Australian Conservation Foundation 2010 national agenda includes a national feed-in tariff, which I have also supported in the parliament. They propose a greenhouse pollution trigger in federal environmental law and a ban on new power stations with carbon emissions above 0.5 tonnes per megawatt hour. Speaking of coal fired power, Environment Victoria commissioned a report by Green Energy Markets called Fast-tracking Victoria’s clean energy future to replace Hazelwood power station. Hazelwood power station is the most emissions intensive power station in Australia, with emissions of 1.53 tonnes of CO2 per megawatt hour. Hazelwood produces over 16 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions and uses 27 billion litres of water each year. Green Energy Markets looked at two ways of replacing the power which now comes from Hazelwood. It looked at a supply-side-only option, which involves bringing forward a combined cycle gas turbine plant and renewable generation, predominantly wind. It also looked at a supply-side and demand-side combination option. This involves bringing forward combined cycle gas fired generation, as well as 1,500 megawatts of renewables. It also incorporates additional residential, commercial and industrial energy efficiency options that replace around 25 per cent of Hazelwood’s annual generation, as well as 100 megawatts of demand-side management. The supply-side-only option would replace Hazelwood’s output in a way that cuts greenhouse gases by 13.6 million tonnes annually, and the combined supply-side and energy efficiency option would save even more-14.5 million tonnes of greenhouse gases annually. If it happened by 2013, it would cut Victoria’s emissions by 11 to 12 per cent. It would have a national impact, cutting Australia’s greenhouse gases by three per cent, a single measure which, in its year of introduction, would lift the weight we are going to have to lift each year in order to meet the government’s 60 per cent cut by 2050 undertaking and play our role in keeping global temperature rise below two degrees Celsius. The report expects that between 1,900 and 2,500 construction jobs will be created in building the clean energy replacements for Hazelwood. An additional 2,300 ongoing jobs would be created across all activities under the supply-side and demand-side combination option, mainly in energy efficiency activities. How would this be done and what would it cost? If we MAIN COMMITTEE had an emissions trading scheme and a price on carbon it would be reasonably straightforward. Hazelwood’s annual emission of 16 million tonnes of CO2 means that, putting a $20 per tonne price on carbon, Hazelwood has a carbon value of $320 million per year. Green Energy Markets considers, based on public statements made by International Power, that this should be sufficient to cover both the cost of any compensation to International Power to close Hazelwood and the cost of bringing forward clean energy investment to replace the power it now generates. Of course, in the absence of an emissions trading scheme and a price on carbon, finding this sort of money would be a significant challenge for the federal and Victorian governments. They would need to sit down with International Power and negotiate these matters. But let me make the following observations. First, there is a fair case for Commonwealth involvement and assistance, given that the benefits from doing this are national. Second, the costs of inaction on climate change will exceed the cost of action. It is like getting your car serviced or insuring your house: in the short run it costs some money, but in the long run you are glad you did. Third, replacing Hazelwood will not only cut Victoria’s carbon emissions by over 10 per cent; it will free up 27 billion litres of water each year and in drought-stricken Victoria-for a decade now-we could make better use of that water. I commend Environment Victoria for this report and I urge the federal and Victorian governments, and federal and Victorian parliamentarians, to give it the serious consideration that the global warming challenge requires of us all. I believe Australians are hungry for action to tackle carbon emissions. This is certainly true of my electorate, where thousands of citizens belong to GetUp! and support its climate action initiatives, and others join local bodies such as the Moreland Climate Group. WhatI am certain of is this: the climate change challenge is not going to go away. We cannot stick our heads in the sand and wish it away. We must press on with the work needed to turn our carbon emissions trajectory around. At present it is still going upwards. That has to change. Main Committee adjourned at 9.30 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Mr Mohamed Abbass (Question No. 1326) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 11 May 2010: (1) As at 11 May 2010, what had the Government done in respect of the case of Mr Mohamed Abbass, held in Egypt against his will; and what will the Government do beyond 11 May 2010. (2) Has he responded to a letter to him from Mrs Seham Abbass dated 15 December 2009; if so, did he provide any commitments of support of action to Mrs Abbass; if so, what were they and which ones have been delivered. (3) Has the Government given Mrs Abbass any commitments of support or action through any other means; if so, what were they and which ones have been delivered. (4) On what date did the Australian (a) Government, and (b) Embassy in Egypt, last inquire with the Egyptian Government on the whereabouts of Mr Abbass. (5) On what date did the Egyptian Government last provide advice to the Australian Government on the whereabouts of Mr Abbass, and what was the nature of this advice. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), through the Australian Embassies in Cairo and Ankara, has made over 30 inquiries and representations to the Egyptian and Turkish governments (including to the Egyptian Foreign Minister and senior law enforcement and security authorities) and to private bodies (including prisoner groups and human rights activists) seeking information about Mr Abbass’s possible whereabouts and circumstances. The Government has also approached Australia’s consular partners, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, for any information they might possess or suggestions they could make to help locate Mr Abbass. DFAT also engaged NSW Police, the Australian Federal Police and Interpol to assist in the search. However, these efforts have not revealed any information on Mr Abbass’s whereabouts. On 16 April 2008 NSW Police advised that they had suspended their investigation of Mr Abbass’s disappearance as there were no further enquiries they could make. (2) My office has no record of a letter being received from Mrs Abbass dated 15 December 2009. On8 February 2010 DFAT responded to a letter dated 15 December 2009 to the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon Ms Julia Gillard MP. DFAT did not provide any commitments in its response. (3) In a meeting with Mrs Abbass in 10 May 2007, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Mr Greg Hunt MP, undertook to instruct DFAT to review Mr Abbass’s case. The then Assistant Secretary of DFAT’s Consular Operations Branch, Simeon Gilding, wrote to Mrs Abbass on 16 October 2007 noting that the review had revealed no new information about Mr Abbass’s whereabouts, that DFAT had exhausted all avenues of inquiry and that in the absence of new information, there was nothing further DFAT could do to locate Mr Abbass. I wrote to Mrs Abbass on 19 March 2008, noting that I had asked DFAT to make further enquiries with the Governments of Egypt and Turkey. I noted that the Egyptian Government had responded that it had no new information. On 14 July 2008, the then Assistant Secretary of DFAT’s Consular Operations Branch, James Choi, wrote to Mrs Abbas and advised that the Turkish Government had confirmed it had no record of Mr Abbass residing in Turkey and that DFAT had no further information about his whereabouts. (4) The Australian Government, through the Australian Embassy in Cairo, last made enquiries with the Egyptian Government about Mr Abbass’s whereabouts on 25 March 2008. (5) On 25 March 2008 the Egyptian Government advised that it had no information on the whereabouts of Mr Abbass. Relocation Scholarships (Question No. 1338) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 25 May 2010: (1) Will any student undertaking a Vocational Education and Training course be ineligible to apply for the income support payment known as the Relocation Allowance; if so, why would students who undertake these courses not be considered eligible to receive this income support over students who undertake those courses which are deemed eligible. (2) Are some Victorian TAFE qualifications recognised as approved courses for receiving the Relocation Allowance; if so, why, and why are TAFE institutions delivering courses in other States and the Territories not meeting the same eligibility test. Ms Gillard-The answers to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Relocation Scholarship is available to dependent recipients of Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY (Living Allowance) required to live away from home to study, as well as independent recipients in certain circumstances, and who are undertaking an accredited higher education or preparatory course at a higher education institution. The approved scholarship courses which qualify the student for a Relocation Scholarship are defined in the Social Security (Approved Scholarship Courses) Determination 2010 (No. 1) (the Determination). As defined in the Determination, a higher education institution means an institution: established by a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory as a higher education institution, or registered by the relevant State or Territory higher education recognition authority as a higher education institution. Student payment recipients undertaking a course that is not an accredited higher education or preparatory course at a higher education institution as defined in the Determination are ineligible to receive the Relocation Scholarship. The Relocation Scholarships replaced the Commonwealth Accommodation Scholarship previously available to university students. The scholarships also align with the Australian Government’s objectives that: 40 per cent of 25 to 34 year-olds should attain a qualification at bachelor level or above by 2025; and 20 per cent of higher education enrolments at undergraduate level should be people from low SES backgrounds by 2020. (2) Yes, there are accredited courses provided by Victorian TAFE institutions which attract a Relocation Scholarship for eligible recipients of Youth Allowance (Student) or ABSTUDY (Living Allowance). To be an approved scholarship course, a course, including a TAFE course whether in Victoria or elsewhere in Australia, must satisfy the definitions in the Social Security (Approved Scholarship Courses) Determination 2010 (No. 1).",246,Grievance Debate
