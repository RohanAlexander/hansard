303,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (10.03 A.m.),"The Marriage Amendment Bill 2002 relates toThursday, 21 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1963 The civil marriage celebrants program was introduced in 1973 by the then Attorney General, Lionel Murphy. Prior to the commencement of the program, couples had to choose between having their wedding in a church or in a registry office operated by states and territories. It was Lionel Murphy’s vision that those people who did not wish to be married in an orthodox religious setting should have the opportunity to be married in a dignified manner by a member of their community, as an alternative to marriage in a registry office. In those early days, celebrants were selected on the basis of recommendations by members of parliament. That may have been of benefit to both members of parliament and perhaps communities in terms of who they selected, but I think it was conceded that that was pretty ad hoc and far too narrowly selective. That method was replaced in recent years by a policy of appointment to particular areas in response to clearly identified community need, based on data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That data is used to estimate the likely numbers of weddings conducted each year by marriage celebrants in any particular area and is compared with data supplied by celebrants themselves. The program has consistently grown since its early beginnings due to the increasing demand for services by civil celebrants and a corresponding fall in demand for religious services and registry weddings-so much so that in 2001 more than half of all marriage ceremonies within Australia were conducted by civil marriage celebrants. This is a measure of the degree to which Australians have embraced the choice which civil celebrants provide to them. Of course, many celebrants have moved beyond their traditional area of marriage celebrancy to make themselves available to lead other significant occasions such as births, funerals and comings of age. One would generally accept that these occasions strengthen the bonds between families, friends and communities and that they are appropriate to formalise with the presence of celebrants. They are occasions on which we celebrate the higher attributes and aspirations of people among our families, our circles of friends and our communities, or simply recognise the contribution that one of our number has made during his or her lifetime. These are important occasions and, depending on the nature of the ceremony, can provide people with inspiration, renewal, hope and sometimes even a sense of closure. I attended one such occasion in June 2002, which was the memorial service for my friend and parliamentary colleague Greg Wilton, who we all remember with fondness. That service was conducted by one of Australia’s most experienced and respected celebrants, Mr Dally Messenger-of the famous football name-and it was a fitting tribute indeed to Greg’s memory to have the service conducted in the way it was by Mr Messenger. In this way, civil celebrants have an important contribution to make to the life and indeed the health of our nation. Just as celebrants themselves have changed their practices in response to the expectations of the communities that they serve, I believe it is appropriate that the marriage celebrants program move along with the times. The Attorney-General commenced a review of the marriage celebrants program in 1996 which considered the options and also the opinions and experiences of marriage celebrants, celebrant organisations and marrying couples who use celebrant services. A package of proposed reforms was developed and a consultation process was undertaken with marriage celebrants and other interested parties to finalise the changes to the marriage celebrants program. This is not an easy task. One who has met with marriage celebrants and marriage celebrant organisations would find that, being among community leaders, they are quite strong in their views-perhaps almost as stubborn as politicians-but the consultation process was constructive and did obtain genuine input regarding their views and the direction the appropriateness of the reforms would take. I think it is proper to acknowledge the contribution made by a former adviser to the Attorney-General, Ms Zoe McKenzie, who led consultations with celebrants on development of the reforms. Indeed, the celebrants and celebrant organisations that I met with universally commented on Ms McKenzie’s openness, considered approach and 1964 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 March 2002 courtesy in dealing with them. That is a credit, if I might say, to the Attorney-General and the staff that he employed in those circumstances. As a result of that consultative process, there were a number of positive changes made to the proposals which the Attorney-General had initially developed. The reforms aim, basically, to raise the professional standards in celebrancy services provided by marriage celebrants appointed under the program. This will be achieved by the introduction of appropriate training, which will be underpinned by a set of competency standards for all aspiring celebrants. Marriage celebrants will also be required to meet ongoing professional development requirements similar to those required by other professionals. The reforms will broaden and enhance the role of celebrants to include the provision of information on pre-marriage and other relationship services. Celebrants will not, however, be required to assume the role of a pre-marriage counsellor themselves. The reforms will remove the current needs based system of authorisation. This will ensure that aspiring applicants with the appropriate skill and experience, and who meet a ‘fit and proper person’ test, as set out in the legislation, will be able to apply to become marriage celebrants. Indeed, I understand there are a number of people preparing to undergo training in the hope that this legislation will be passed and they will have the opportunity of serving as a marriage celebrant. All new appointments under the program will be based upon satisfying core competency standards, and this will be achieved through a system of accreditation operating in vocational education and training administered by the Australian National Training Authority. While opportunities for training currently exist for marriage celebrants, there is no current requirement for celebrants to have received formal training or to receive it on an ongoing basis. The program proposes that registered training organisations will develop the practical training course, to be modelled on the accredited framework, and that training will be available from a wide range of training providers. Once an aspiring celebrant completes the training course, there will be an additional requirement to demonstrate to the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants that the person is a fit and proper person to discharge the duties of a celebrant. The criteria will include, but will not be limited to, that a celebrant must be of good standing in the community and whether there is an actual or potential conflict of interest between his or her proposed practice as a marriage celebrant and any other business or related interest. Existing celebrants will retain their current authorisation status and will not be required to demonstrate that they satisfy the new core competencies. They will have to satisfy the requirements of ongoing professional development. Appointments will continue to be made on a lifetime basis, subject to satisfying the requirements of ongoing professional development and compliance with a code of practice. All marriage celebrants will be required to complete ongoing professional development requirements. It is envisaged that no more than five to eight hours per year would be required for celebrants to be able to keep their skills up to date, in the form of ongoing professional development. There will be a transition period of five years in the implementation of the revised basis of appointment. During this period, the number of new celebrants will be limited to a 10 per cent increase each year, based on the total number of authorised celebrants in the previous year. So it will be an incremental increase and will avoid, if you like, a flooding of the civil celebrants service. A new Registrar of Marriage Celebrants will develop a mechanism for complaint handling. Celebrants will have a right to be advised of the complaint against them and to put whatever material they think appropriate to the registrar before a final decision is made on any penalty or other sanction. Sanctions may include a requirement that further professional development be undertaken. They may also include the suspension, if necessary, of a celebrant for a given period of time. Only as a last resort is it contemplated that an authorisation would be revoked entirely. Decisions will be subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This Thursday, 21 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1965 mechanism, we believe, will be effective, will ensure the provision of procedural fairness and natural justice, and will replace the current system of complaint handling, which has been criticised by some celebrants as lacking transparency. We believe the new model will be, overall, an extremely positive development. All marriage celebrants will be required to satisfy a code of practice, a copy of which has been publicly available for some time. The code covers matters such as requiring a celebrant to maintain a high standard of service in professional conduct, compliance with the Marriage Act 1961 and other laws, and a range of requirements for the conduct of marriage ceremonies. All celebrants will undergo a performance review every five years. Reviews may be based on a consideration of any complaints received, compliance with the code of practice and satisfying requirements for ongoing professional development. Despite consultation, it is fair to say that many existing celebrants have continued to express some concerns about some aspects of the package of reforms. One frequently expressed concern is that the reforms will result in a substantial increase in the number of celebrants in the market, which will put pressure on existing celebrants, particularly those persons who make a modest living from their practice. It would be disappointing if, as a result of these changes, existing celebrants with expertise, experience and the support of their communities, find themselves unable to continue practice because simply their services are not in demand. We have indicated that on behalf of the Labor Party we are prepared to monitor the operation of the changes to the program in this regard, but, as I have said, we consider that the incremental rate of increase in the registration of new celebrants will substantially protect that flooding of the market from occurring. Celebrants have also expressed concerns about the conflict of interest provisions in the bill. They are contained in section 39C, paragraph (2)(e) of the bill, and that provides that the registrar, in determining whether to authorise a person as a celebrant, must take into account whether the person has an actual or potential conflict of interest between his or her practice or proposed practice as a marriage celebrant and his or her business interests or any other interests. The Attorney-General has provided me with a copy of a letter from the Assistant Secretary of the Family Law Branch of the Attorney-General’s Department to celebrant organisations, setting out the way in which the conflict of interest provisions are intended to operate. The letter states: While there appears to be some difference of opinion being asserted about the intent and interpretation of the provisions, we believe that the provisions do indeed work and will prevent precisely the sort of behaviour that appears to be causing unrest. The provisions will prevent a person having a conflict of interest between his/her interests as a celebrant and his/her business and other interests. The ‘other interests’ will clearly cover, for example, employment related interests. For instance, the example which is frequently discussed is a restriction on the proprietor of a wedding reception venue also being licensed as a civil celebrant for the purpose of attracting business to that marriage reception venue. We, on the whole, consider that protection against conflict of interest to be appropriate. The letter goes on to point out that these conflicts of interest provisions are standard provisions, replicated in a number of pieces of Commonwealth legislation and that a similar provision is being enforced to determine an applicant’s suitability for appointment as a celebrant for many years. Ultimately, however, it will be the responsibility of the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants to apply that test in a proper fashion. I trust that it will be applied in a way which is consistent with the approach outlined by the department, but we have no reason to believe that it will not be. 1966 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 March 2002 One day it may be possible for celebrants themselves to assume greater responsibility for the administration of civil marriage celebrants programs. I think it is fair to say-and I have said this to civil celebrant organisations that I have met-that will only be possible if there is greater cooperation between existing organisations which represent celebrants. Celebrant organisations, such as the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants, have for some years been working towards lifting standards of professionalism in celebrancy. However, the existing body of celebrants is currently not sufficiently cohesive to assume a coregulatory role. In the meantime, it is appropriate that administration of the program be the responsibility of the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants within the Attorney-General’s Department. As I have said, however, the future destiny of that issue of self-regulation, which I think all would concede would be desirable, to a large part depends on the celebrants themselves and their organisations achieving that necessary cohesiveness, at least in terms of their adherence to basic principles. The bill makes a number of other amendments to the Marriage Act. These deal mainly with matters involving changes to the notice of intention to marry under the act, and to make processes in relation to the form more flexible without interfering with the overall integrity of the notice. In particular, appropriately qualified overseas professionals will be able to witness the notice. Currently, only certain Australian qualified professionals, or an Australian consular official, are able to witness the notice. That process has had a negative impact on overseas persons wishing to marry in Australia. The bill provides for guidelines to be developed to assist prescribed authorities charged with permitting the shortening of time between when a notice of intention to marry must be lodged and when a couple can marry. It also provides for overseas passports to be an acceptable form of identification for couples as well as birth certificates. It also removes redundant provisions in the act relating to marriages performed overseas by Australian consular officials. The changes both to the civil celebrants program and to the Marriage Act itself will enhance the professionalism of civil celebrancy in Australia. We believe they complement the moves that already are taking place within the celebrant organisations to enhance the quality of service which celebrants offer to the community. The changes will also benefit those Australians who, in recent years, have sought to be appointed as civil celebrants but who have been unable to secure an appointment due to the idiosyncrasies of the current system of appointment. Most importantly, the changes will benefit those Australians who choose to be married by a civil celebrant as they will contribute to the further raising of this standard of the civil celebrancy service in Australia. amending the Marriage Act, I wish to bring to this House’s attention the general manner in which the so-called family law and marriage law as drafted in the Australian jurisdiction affects the sanctity of marriage and undermines marriage. One of the key purposes of the legislation is to introduce a revised basis of appointment of new marriage celebrants based upon satisfaction of what are called core competencies, primarily by attendance at what are called appropriate training courses, coupled with what is called a ‘fit and proper person’ test. It is worth examining what these three components entail. The three components are: firstly, core competencies; secondly, appropriate training; and thirdly, a fit and proper person test. Who is to be the arbiter of what constitutes core training? What constitutes appropriate training? What standard is applied to be deemed to be a ‘fit and proper person?’ I note that Lionel Murphy introduced the civil marriage celebrants program in 1974. Since that time, divorces have continued to skyrocket in Australia. The Family Court’s statistics show that for every two marriages, one will end up in divorce. More people today seek to deny marriage altogether and simply live together or have children outside of marriage. Still more are electing to simply have no children at all or engage in any relationship. In the last 30",136,Representatives Main Committee
304,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (10.22 A.m.),"Whilst giving support to the provisions of the billThursday, 21 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1967 years, the family law in Australia appears predicated on eliminating assumptions about what marriage is and how it is applied. So what is marriage? Depending on one’s beliefs, marriage has been variously described as a contract, an agreement, a legally binding instrument or some other reductionist terminology. This raises a number of questions as to what is the policy rationale behind such legislation. The Attorney-General, dogged by pressure from prospective marriage celebrants, has bowed to such pressure whilst fundamentally ignoring the fact that marriage is not merely a contract or legal instrument. What has been forgotten, due to liberal ideology splashed with a pervasive dose of empiricism, is that marriage is more than a contract, more than a mere legal instrument. The Family Court of Australia is busy giving judicial recognition to private law rites such as other non-baptised rites of marriage. The courts are quick to recognise that marriage is a conjugal vow, based on spiritual indissolubility, when it concerns private law such as those rites expressed in Islam or Hinduism. However, in secular law the government seems pressed along inexorable trends towards the destruction of marriage. The last 30 years have exposed the worse excesses of matrimonial breakdown in our history as a nation. Divorce rates are at sky-high levels: nearly 50 per cent of all registered marriages. So, too, child support applications continue to rise out of control, along with the contravention of child support orders. The begging question is: how could so many people have chosen the wrong partner in the first place? It is not so much a case of choosing the wrong partner, as of embedding a belief in people’s minds, through our laws, that, ‘Marriage is disposable; if you don’t like this marriage, you are free to leave and try another,’ or ‘Marriage is a trial which you can toss in like a hand of cards if doesn’t work out.’ The point I am making addresses the purpose of the Marriage Amendment Bill 2002 in its attempt to prescribe core competencies in the training of marriage celebrants. I am unfamiliar with what these core competencies will be. However, the familiar and traditional marriage celebrants-namely priests and other members of religious orders-have long standing and rigorous marriage preparation programs that predate the Lionel Murphy amendments of 1974. So, too, a person considering marriage is expected to undergo rigorous marriage preparation well before they each have a partner. Certain religions-like my religion of Catholicismprescribe moral standards of chastity within and without married life so that, upon marriage, I am a fit and proper person capable of remaining faithful and morally and physically disciplined to survive the heavy demands of marriage for life. For that is what marriage means to me-and I stress that I am speaking for myself. What core competencies are going to be the order of the day when selecting marriage celebrants? Will their moral reasoning be the benchmark for their suitability as marriage celebrants? What will the state ensure constitutes a core competency when directing what marriage preparation, if any, a marriage celebrant will require their client marriage partners to do? Will it be a requirement of this government to prescribe minimum secular standards of what constitutes a marriage? We have reached a point of no return in these amendments to marriage law. This government is assisting in the destruction of marriage through amendments which it cannot control. In their desire to pander to the public morality of the day, they are contributing to the reductionism that is being perpetrated on the very notion of marriage. The consequence is that we have a child support social debt running into billions of dollars of unpaid child support, as a result of liberal divorce laws that have created an entire subclass of single parents and their children who live in the most abject poverty. Starved of money, these single parents-overwhelmingly women-are left penniless by their estranged husbands and their children’s fathers, who simply will not, or cannot, pay the bill. I have had a number of those cases through my electorate office doors. 1968 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 March 2002 More careful marriage preparation would go a long way towards solving these and other problems. However, I fear that marriage preparation will not be made sufficient by embedding these so-called core competencies. Will these core competencies test the morality of the individual marriage celebrant? I do not think so. This legislation will demonstrate the same moral relativism that pervades other legislation this government has made in keeping with its love affair with the prevailing morality of the day. That is, every marriage celebrant will be free of any systematised moral reasoning or development in their own freestyle marriage preparation. Marriage celebrants will become the secular priests and priestesses of marriage, deciding who is fit and who is unfit for marriage. Statistically, it is proved that those couples who remain faithful to their religious beliefs have a many thousand times greater prospect of their marriages remaining successful than those who do not have a well-grounded, systematic faith and do not marry within that faith. The role of a civil marriage celebrant is, by definition, devoid of that spiritual dimension. There are unlikely to be any requirements within that core competency component that deal with the spiritual development aspect of the individual, as the state does not see its role in dictating morality. Yet, the entire existence of marriage celebrants is itself an explicit declaration by the state that it has the immediate right and power to decide who becomes a marriage celebrant, upon what basis the celebrant is deemed to be a fit and proper person, and what core competencies are necessary in order for that marriage celebrant to be eligible to be a marriage celebrant at all. If this is so, then with this bill we must accept the fact that government has declared for itself the role of moral arbiter, determining not only who is and is not a fit and proper person to be a marriage celebrant, but also what form of preparation that celebrant is to undergo, and what level of marriage preparation they are to impart on the prospective married couple. I find all this a very disturbing trend. When we consider the financial destruction and the destruction of families and their lives wreaked by the divorce system in Australia, and the arrogant presumption by this government of the role it plays in advocating on behalf of the child, as if it was government who was the natural parent of the child, it leads me to believe that this legislation is moving in an ever more serious direction. The outcome of this bill is for the Attorney-General to kowtow to the sectional interests of a growing lobby group. This government must decide what mix of marriages it wants to have in civic society. Does it want to encourage an administrative system that actively endorses marriage in a true spirit of permanency, or is this House content to continue participating in the drafting of legislation that continues to send the wrong message to those in civic society that would follow our legislation in believing that marriage is disposable, governed and directed from the state alone, as if government has the immediate right-which I say it does not-to validate marriages? Let us in this House not forget one basic fact about our secular law: for those Australians who are not morally bound to Australia’s secular law, in preference of their own personal law-for example, Muslims, who proclaim the sharia law as their personal law, and hence disregard the validity of matrimonial laws as they offend their laws-so too there are a large number of Australians who draw their moral strength from Australia’s secular laws. There are a large number of Australians who, in ernest belief, hold that if a thing is legal, it is moral. That is to say, when the government sanctions divorce in the way we have at the moment, then it is moral to do so; when the government sanctions prenuptial agreements and undermines the totality of marriage, as it has done, then it is moral to do so. So too, the marriage celebrants scheme, if expanded, will result in a proliferation of beliefs, mores and moral virtues that will hold an array of subjective beliefs of what is and is not marriage. It is an open question as to what the policy objective of this new legislation is. A cynical response is that the Attorney-General is simply pandering to the vested interests of a loud Thursday, 21 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1969 lobby group, as I have already indicated. A more measured response might be to infer that the Attorney-General genuinely seeks to improve the standards of marriages and their survivability. Well, I hope he does. However, if it is the latter objective that the Attorney-General seeks to fulfil, then the question arises as to how these core competencies will translate into more robust, long standing marriages. To put it simply, the Attorney-General cannot imbue a moral standard that transcends to the spiritual dimension, in my opinion. Neither does secular government consider that is its role, nor would it publicly assert that as its role. However, government sees itself fit to define these core competencies as surrogates to spiritual formationso necessary for the success or otherwise of marriage, in my view. For if the prospective couple cannot see themselves as spiritually bound, then the prospect of the survival of the marriage diminishes dramatically, in my view. With this diminished prospect comes the begging question: what type of spirituality is understood by the prospective couple? A further question is put: what type of spiritual formation will the marriage celebrant provide or instruct the prospective marriage couple in? We will not hear anything in the core competencies that will attempt to address these issues, and that is what concerns me. For the greater altar of secular governance is liberalism, and with that liberalism comes moral relativism which holds that there is no right or wrong, only difference. Along with such views comes an inability to form deeper relationships in marriage and, ultimately, the divorce rates we see today plaguing Australia, causing matrimonial breakdown, destruction of families, dysfunctional children, hidden and explicit poverty and whole armies of single parents and parentless children, which I see regularly through my electorate office-all flowing from a desire to pander to the public morality of liberalism that proclaims ‘what I believe is therefore right’. If we are to seriously address the core competency issue, and if Australia is to radically increase the number of marriage celebrants in our society and rely on them to be the officiating person who conjugally binds two people together, then, in my opinion, far deeper questions of a basic nature as to what marriage is need to be asked. Our culture depends on the survival and functionality of families. A natural family is the basic building block of our society without which nothing can function. Our social welfare system depends on taxes to pay for them. Our insurance system and all manner of systemic savings patterns depend on the functioning family. If this government does not seriously address the importance of family as the basic social unit of society, we run a progressive risk of repeating the errors of the last 30 years in producing regiment after regiment of broken homes, poverty and despair. Finally, I urge this government to look more closely at what it calls core competencies and to ask itself in all honesty whether these regulations will achieve the ultimate end of forging permanent relationships built upon proper spiritual foundations. Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.36 a.m.)-I rise to support the Marriage Amendment Bill 2002. I make it very clear at the start that I do support the bill. I think this is legislation that is long overdue, and I believe that couples that choose to be married by a civil celebrant should be able to make that choice. For a very long period of time there have been problems with the current system, and I think that the Attorney-General’s moves and this legislation are certainly heading in the right direction. During my contribution I will raise some of the concerns of a constituent of mine who is a long-time marriage celebrant and who has also been a university lecturer. I would be very grateful if in his reply the minister could pick up on some of the issues that are raised by the gentleman in question. As has already been stated, the marriage celebrant program was established in 1973 by the then Attorney-General, Lionel Murphy. It has proved to be very popular with couples in Australia, with some 45 per cent of all marriages in Australia now being performed by marriage celebrants. I really support that choice for couples. I feel that to be married within a church or some other environment is not right for everyone and that because people do not choose to be 1970 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 March 2002 married in a church does not mean that they have any less commitment to each other or that their relationship is any less spiritual. The bill introduces a revised basis of appointment for new marriage celebrants that is based upon the satisfaction of core competencies, primarily by attendance at appropriate training courses and a detailed fit and proper person test. I think that is something that was lacking previously. I think it is very important that, before a person actually becomes a celebrant, they should be very aware of all the issues associated with it and that there should be an appropriate training course, as well as looking at making sure that the person who is applying to become a celebrant is actually a fit and proper person to perform that task. It is a very important role. It is a time when people are making very important decisions about their lives; therefore, we need to make sure that those decisions are based on the right facts. One thing that concerns me a little bit when we are looking at the competencies and the accreditation-and that takes me to the next point-is that the appointment is on a lifetime basis. There should be some requirement in the legislation that people undergo reassessment from time to time and be encouraged to undergo key competency assessments, say, on a fiveyearly basis. At this point I would like to raise the fact that this legislation only applies to celebrants who are in a non-sectarian environment, and that is a slight weakness. It could be argued that the exemption for some religious celebrants is discriminatory and that celebrants from small religious groups-such as Buddhists et cetera-are affected by the bill, whilst celebrants from Christian denominations-such as Catholics, Anglicans, Presbyterians and the Uniting Church-are not. That exemption probably should apply to all people who perform marriage ceremonies because, as I said in the beginning, it is a very important ceremony, it has a very important role in our society and the participants in it, the couple, need to evaluate the reason for entering into such an important relationship. This legislation also creates a statutory appointment of the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants, with employment to come under the Public Service Act 1999-and if I could move now to the concerns raised by my constituent Mr Neil Wright. He sees the fact that the registrar will be appointed from the Public Service as a problem, because for a government that prides itself on private enterprise it seems strange that the position is not openly advertised throughout Australia to attract applicants for the position who are suitably qualified people with the experience and expertise at a grassroots level. He feels that the process will not be very open and transparent and that a bureaucrat who comes from within the Public Service will be appointed to the position, rather than somebody who has considerable expertise working in that area. He is worried that the job of registrar will be a job that is tailored to a particular applicant. He also feels that it is unclear in the proposed legislation whom the registrar is accountable to. From my reading of it, I feel the registrar will be accountable to the Attorney-General, but maybe I am not correct in that. He feels that the successful applicant will be within the Public Service and accountable to somebody within the Public Service and that this is unacceptable and rather muddies the water. I will just go back to the other provisions of this bill. One of things that I think is very important is that it will provide ongoing professional development, it will raise the standard of marriage celebrants and it will provide some sort of uniformity. Currently, it is very difficult for a person to become a marriage celebrant, and this will open up the process. I feel that the introduction of the program and the training components are very, very important-I am probably emphasising something that I have raised before. I would also say that the legislation is supposed to create a more effective and transparent complaint handling mechanism. It allows appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for Thursday, 21 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1971 most refusals to register an applicant. It can revoke the revocation of authorisation or suspension of a celebrant. That is very important. The introduction of a code of practice is also very important, as is the fact that it provides for a public register of marriage celebrants that will be accessible over the Internet. I think that these are all really positive aspects of this legislation. Currently, there are about 1,700 celebrants in Australia and I know that, from inquiries I have had in my office-and I am sure other members in this House have had them-there are a number of people who feel that they can make a contribution as celebrants; some of whom have undertaken courses at TAFE et cetera. SoI feel that for them this is very positive aspect. I should return to the queries that have been raised by Neil Wright. He is concerned about the conflict of interest clause and the restriction on existing celebrants’ activities. He sees it as a bit of a case of overkill, and he sees it as overrestrictive-even including businesses run by families and relatives. He feels that that is a problem in this legislation. Also, he feels that the proposal seems to leave the door open for large wedding venues and others in the wedding industry to put together ready-made wedding packages, which is opposed to the general philosophy of the celebrant being able to deliver a tailor-made ceremony that is something very special for the couple that are involved. He feels that it could just become this great industry. He says it goes against the open choice, nature and ethos of the celebrant program. He also feels that such celebrants, if applying for other jobs in other wedding venues or related businesses, could use their celebrant status as an employment enhancing factor in gaining employment with those businesses. He sees that that would be an unfair advantage. He feels, once again, that it is against the spirit of what a marriage celebrant is about. He also feels that, in the case of such a celebrant appointment, the question arises as to whether the appointment would restrict in any way whether the appointee could or could not leave the venue job and simply marry people anywhere in Australia-that goes to the fact of the current geographical appointment over celebrants, and the fact that he feels that this could lead to an oversupply in certain areas. Other matters that he has raised relate to the training course. He is obviously a person who has put together a training course himself and knows a lot about training, because of his time at university and the fact that he actually lectured to prospective teachers. He feels that there is no provision for an interview for a prospective course candidate or any statement regarding the prerequisites for commencing any such course. He believes that there should be prerequisites and that the suitability of the candidate should be assessed before they are allowed to even undertake the studies, because of the importance of the role that the celebrant has-the importance of the employment; the importance of the job. He also says that the proposed cap of celebrant numbers at 10 per cent for five years does nothing to allay fears that after five years there will be a plethora of celebrants and it will lead to flooding the programs with celebrants. He does not think it does anything to enhance the viability. He says that the average celebrant performs about 30 weddings a year, while 80 per cent solemnise fewer than 50 weddings per year. What he is saying is that it will lead to a flooding of the market and to certain celebrants getting less work. I suppose, to sum up, his real worry is that it is going to lead to a commercialisation of the role of the celebrant. Having expressed his concerns, I will conclude by saying that I support the legislation. I think it is a gigantic step forward. I think it offers the opportunity for many people who have wanted to become celebrants over a long period of time. With more celebrants, it offers choice to couples when they are looking to enter into marriage and it allows them to have the type of marriage ceremony that makes it a very special and memorable occasion for them and to make their commitment to each other in an environment and in a way that they choose. for all of those people who have been registered marriage celebrants and it is important for those people who have chosen or will choose in the future to use the services of a registered",140,Representatives Main Committee
305,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (10.53 A.m.),"The Marriage Amendment Bill 2002 is important1972 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 March 2002 marriage celebrant. There are a number of categories of people who are allowed by the Attorney-General to undertake the solemnisation of marriages. One of those categories is people from recognised religious denominations. They are not dealt with in this bill because for all of the recognised denominations there is a global coverage. So, for the Catholic Church, the Anglican Church and the other major established churches there is a recognised cover. Second, state registrars of births, deaths and marriages have been authorised to do it. They are not dealt with here. The category of people that we are dealing with, as the Bills Digest points out-and I will have reference to this a number of times during this speech-is: ... persons authorised by the Minister to solemnise marriages according to the fit and proper person criteria in subsection 39(2). Within this group there are currently three categories: (i) civil marriage celebrants, (ii) religious celebrants who do not belong to one of the recognised denominationsand this includes Sikhs, Buddhists and the World Harvest Ministries... and (iii) celebrants appointed to deal with special community needs. These latter three categories comprise the Marriage Celebrant Program and are the subject of the Bill. When this program was introduced in 1973, there were 13 civil celebrants. We now have 1,700 civil celebrants and, according to the Bills Digest, a similar number of non-recognised denomination religious marriage celebrants appointed under the program-that is, about 3,400. In total, 45 per cent of all marriages in Australia are now conducted by people who are registered as civil marriage celebrants or non-denominational celebrants. What does that tell us? It tells us that Australia has changed dramatically since the end of the Second World War because, prior to the end of the Second World War, in a society which was three-quarters Protestant and one-quarter Roman Catholic, almost everybody got married in a church. That was the way the society operatedthere was a dominant Judaeo-Christian ethic throughout the entire society. With the postwar migration, we had people from central Europe, eastern Europe and the Mediterranean-still largely within the confines of that Judaeo-Christian ethic. But as the decades have moved on we have taken in refugees from every part of the world. When the White Australia policy was abandoned and the nature of Australia’s immigration policy changed, we took people from all corners of the globe and from all religious persuasions; many of those are religious persuasions which are not in the recognised list. So, this is an indication of just how much Australia has changed. There has been a great deal of argument about, and condemnation of-and we have seen this already again today in the debate on this bill-an enormous amount of weight being put on the changes to the Marriage Act 1973 that former Senator Lionel Murphy brought in. The central argument has been that it is a question of allowing or condoning moral relativism and allowing that, because the changes brought in in 1973 made it easier for couples to divorce and, therefore, easier for them to remarry. The old burdens of the approach to marriage, which we had inherited from England, meant that when people did choose to dissolve their marriages-and throughout the entire history of human populations on this planet, people have joined together and they have chosen to dissolve those unions; this is not something that is new or something that has been occasioned since 1973-the law made it enormously difficult for people to do it. They put as many stops and hurdles in front of them as they could. People were really forced by the law. Where two individuals had determined that whatever their circumstances had been when they freshly entered into a marriage contract between themselves, however much they had changed to cause them to reach a situation where they had decided to dissolve the marriage, the law actually forced them to prove that one person should have blame. It required that either the husband or the wife should have to prove adultery in a court of law; that they should have to have witnesses to that adultery or witnesses to validate the fact that there had been mental cruelty, and so on. Thursday, 21 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1973 I have a positive view of the changes of 1973. I think they more readily humanised the way in which marriage dissolution was made easier. They went to a central recognition that marriage is not about just solemnisation by religious authorities or by other state authorities, as is allowed with the births, deaths and marriages registrars. Marriage is a union of two individuals. There is a person who is there as a celebrant-whether that person comes from a religious denomination or is a civil marriage celebrant-but the people who are marrying are the two individuals. The solemnisation comes from the fact that the celebrant is there witnessing and attesting, and it is usually the case-whoever the celebrant is, whatever the circumstances are-that family and friends are part of a recognition of the fact that these two people have decided that, hopefully, they will spend the rest of their lives together in a loving union. It happens to be the case, when it comes to a dissolution, that the burden of the dissolution should not be placed, as it has been placed earlier in the debate, on the manner in which people get married and on an argument that it is without any spiritual dimension whatsoever if that marriage happens to take place outside the normal denominations. When 45 per cent of people freely choose to access registered agents, the reality is that those people could have chosen to use the services of a minister of religion and they could quite readily have chosen to marry within a church-in most cases they could have chosen that. People who are members of a church congregation are members not because they are bound to be part of a church congregation-there is no mandate whereby a church congregation can compel people to continue to be a part of the congregation-but it is a matter of choice and individual conscience as to whether people sign up to be part of a religious organisation or community and whether they continue to do so. It has been the case in the past that, as our society has changed and as our attitudes have changed, there can be a simple problem-the person can in fact be part of a religious community in a congregation and, because of their personal circumstances, they might find that they are placed outside that organisation. It is pretty simple-if you are a member of the Catholic community and you are brought up within the Catholic faith and it so happens in your life that you come upon a circumstance that the person that you fall in love with and choose to marry is in fact Protestant or some other denomination, and also if that person has previously been married and divorced, well, I am sorry, but thank you very much, the extent of the understanding of the church and its rules do not allow you to marry within the congregation, within the rights of the Catholic Church. That is my circumstance. My wife and I both taught at a Catholic school. I had been brought up as a Catholic; she had been brought up as an Anglican. We taught at a Catholic school-in my case for nearly 10 years; in her case for nearly 14 years-and were both, I hope, effective teachers. That is where we met; that is where we fell in love. I am a Catholic but, because she had been divorced, we could not marry in the Catholic Church, so we had to seek the services of a civil celebrant, Maria Souris, who did a wonderful job. It was outside my normal expectations, having been brought up within the Catholic Church, but I had no choice because there was no priest who was capable under the rules prevailing-and still prevailing-to allow for that. So part of the 45 per cent of people marrying outside the church includes people like me. I found the services that were available to be well and truly worked out. The celebrant was well trained and she was sensitive to our circumstances. There was full participation by both of us in organising the whole marriage ceremony and both of our families were a complete part of that. I think it is passing strange that people who marry in those circumstances can be condemned because they married outside a religious denomination, and it is passing strange that the mechanism that allows people to marry in that way can be attacked on the basis that it is founded upon moral relativism and attacked on the basis that this really is not a true union of people. 1974 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 March 2002 Well, I am sorry, but I have to disagree with the member for Lowe. Individuals make marriages. The celebrants are there as witnesses to the act. Whatever the time and circumstances, whether in a church or outside, it is two people who marry; if they choose to divorce, it is two individuals who do so. In terms of the people who front up to the Family Court, however much some individuals want to blame other agencies, when a marriage breaks up it is the two people themselves who need to bear the brunt of that. Equally, when a marriage is enjoined and people come together in a union it is their individual approach, it is their individual choice, and they should not be barred from having a well-trained set of marriage celebrants to assist them within that. It just so happens that my wife’s daughter got married some time ago and chose a celebrant. It was extremely well run and extremely effective. Within my electorate of Blaxland, there are a number of existing celebrants, and one of their concerns over time has been the fact that people who became celebrants were under pressure from the possibility of a flood of other people coming in, a dramatic expansion. This bill allows a deregulation of this industry. I notice the government has chosen to deregulate the marriage celebrant industry but it has not chosen to deregulate the newsagencies. There is a similar situation there. The newsagencies and marriage celebrants have been on the same sort of basis: within a geographical area you have a certain number of marriage celebrants and, added to that-particularly in an electorate like mine because it is so diverse in terms of the religious communities within it and the different population groups-there is a need for, and a demand for, a number of community celebrants in order to cover the wide spread of people from different groups. One of the constraints, a number of people have felt, has been that there have not been enough celebrants available and that there has been clustering in particular areas. So what the bill attempts to address in dealing with the problems of concentration is to open this up to basically anyone who fits the criteria that are laid down and who successfully gets through the training program. But, in order to address the existing celebrants’ queries, problems and worries, this will be phased in over a five-year period. I think that is a sensible response, given that the basis of this is full deregulation and that those existing celebrants have been doing the job for a long time and doing it well. I just mention in passing someone who did that in an extremely wonderful fashion, Mrs Yvonne Doherty, who was a member of the Bankstown Central branch of the ALP. She gave all of herself as a marriage celebrant until she was taken from us by cancer a number of years ago. She put a wonderful program together. She helped people a lot and she was very concerned to make the solemnising of their marriages as full, as happy and as comfortable as possible. Yvonne was a wonderful example of a person who, in taking this up, gave all of herself to it while she was capable of doing it. There have been a number of other people who have approached me-not just through the period of time since 1996 when I became a member but previous to that when I was working for the former Prime Minister and Treasurer in his electorate office-attempting to get onto the list. There is a long list of people who have wanted to apply and to offer their services. They are people who are well skilled and well known in the community. These changes will allow people of that type to gradually become part of this expanded program. As long as the training and the controls in terms of people being fit and proper persons are there, and as long as the review process is there-because, although there is a lifetime appointment still for this, there is a five-year process to ensure that people remain fit and proper persons to conduct marriages-I think it is a good and positive thing. Essentially, people have voted with their feet. If you go from 13 celebrants to 1,700, plus about another 1,700 from non-recognised denominations, and if you have 45 per cent of the entire population choosing, because they can, to avail themselves of these services, we need to ensure that the codes of conduct, the training and the support mechanisms provided to people who are registered celebrants are solidly put into place. Thursday, 21 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1975 I welcome the review that was undertaken and also generally the steps that have been undertaken here to try to refurbish the arrangements which were set in place in 1973 and the arrangements which, over the intervening period of time, have shown the strengths and weaknesses of the geographical approach and the consideration in relation to local communities. This bill provides a basis for a strengthening of that program and also provides a basis for the ongoing relevance of these celebrants to the people who choose to use their services. The Labor Party is supporting this bill and I am supporting the fact that, for the 55 per cent of people who choose not to use the services of marriage celebrants but to solemnise their marriages within a churchwhether it is one of the Protestant or Roman Catholic denominations, part of the Maronite Church as part of the Catholic Church or one of the various Orthodox churches-those people can freely do that as members of their communities and as members of their denominations because they have chosen freely to be part of that. If they continue to be so and if they continue not to be excluded from the life of their religious denominations by the rules of those denominations then they should happily and rightly be assisted in their marriage preparation by the members of those denominations and rightly married in those churches. But for those people otherwise prohibited, the choice is there-and it is an indication of just how much Australia has changed. I think it is wrong to condemn two individuals who choose to pledge their lives to each other-to regard them as effectively the recipients of an approach based on moral relativism, as the member for Lowe argued-and to pillory people who choose to marry outside the church. I do not find that my marriage is any less solemn, any less purposeful or any less spiritual because the rules of my church forbade my marrying within the church. The strength and the purposefulness of the marriage are not undermined in any way by any form of moral relativism. I think in this regard I can speak on behalf of all of those people freely choosing outside the context of their originating church about the fact that the spirituality, the strength, the certainty and the importance of this union comes from two individuals freely giving themselves to each other and trying to build a life together because of that. Celebrants solemnise and assist; I hope that this assists those celebrants. (Time expired) Anich-who is also a marriage celebrant in the Kennedy electorate and a very well-loved and popular person, and justifiably so-asked me to bring to the attention of the parliament. This is on behalf of all of the marriage celebrants of North Queensland: Just like to draw to your attention to the Parliamentary Debate on the 11 March 2002 re the Marriage Bill. We are hoping that you could attend on our behalf, ie, the Celebrants of North Queensland, the majority of whom belong to the Queensland Association of Civil Marriage Celebrants (Inc).Our group, though isolated from our southern counterparts, have a reputation as being very conscientious and vocal. At least one of our members attend Association meetings in Brisbane, and being in such a busy Tourist Zone, deal with most of the Tourist Resorts and other Venues, and have an excellent rapport with them. As you are aware, we service a vast Tourist area and with the new legislation allowing no limits on the number of Celebrants to be appointed, if Venues were able to have a staff member qualified as a Marriage Celebrant, this would act very much against existing interests of many Celebrants. Most celebrants rely on the income of being a Celebrant as their sole income, and so this would be very much against the existing interests of many of the independent Celebrants who have put a lot of time and effort into honing their skills and providing a worthwhile and memorable Service for couplesas referred to, I might add, by the previous speakerThe phrase ‘conflict of interest’ is the key issue here. In summary it applies that an authorised independent Celebrant cannot have a conflict of interest-i.e. interest in any Business extending from their profession. But if a Venue decided to have a Staff Member appointed, that employee would not in any",145,Representatives Main Committee
306,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (11.13 A.m.),"I would like to read out a letter which Councillor1976 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 March 2002 way offend the conflict of interest restriction under Clause (f) as “they do not have an actual potential conflict ... This ‘employment situation’ would easily be disguised as ‘Wedding Package Deal’. As it now stands, the couples have choices of celebrants to choose from. The Venues have lists of Celebrants, which they put forward to the couple to choose from, thus allowing the couple freedom of choice, as was the whole intention of the Marriage Celebrant Program, as instigated in 1974. When the ‘conflict of interest’ is re-examined under debate, we sincerely hope that you will be in a position to understand the situation and speak on our behalf. I think that we have all seen the movies of the quickie Las Vegas divorces. I do not think any of us have been to the cinema and not seen those on one or other occasions. I do not think that is what we want in Australia, and this legislation-which I am diametrically opposed towould move in that direction. I would like to bring to the attention of the House my very strong support for some amendments to the legislation, which will need some time and some consideration before they are drafted. I will not attempt to do it in the short time frame that I have. Also, I think it should come from the people themselves, because we are rapidly moving into that situation. Mr Iwasaki, from the Iwasaki Resort, said that one of the big things about the Japanese resorts is that they are marriage resorts-you go there to get married and to have your honeymoon. That is all right from the Japanese point of view, but if you take that principle and apply it within Australia and within the wider Australian context, you come up with a very unsavoury sort of procedure. The door is being opened for that sort of procedure here. Even if these people are acting out of self-interest, they are quite right to put in their complaint here. I do not think people should apologise for acting out of self-interest; they have built up a place in their community. Mrs Anich would be a very good case in point. She is the wife of a local sugar cane farmer. They are very hard working people. She has a following, as was referred to by the previous speaker. People respect and like her. She brings a sense of spiritual values-I might even say religious values-to the celebration of marriage, and that is what we want. Everyone dropping in off the street, wanting to make a quid for themselves, and every Tom, Dick and Harry who happens to be an employee at a tourist resort having a licence to create marriages, is definitely not the way we want to travel here. Let me use an example. Justices of the peace were always referred to in the Queensland cabinet, in the decade that I was in the Queensland cabinet, as the ‘little man’s knighthood’. I thought that they were very much were the little man’s knighthood. They were a very wonderful part of the way of life that we had in Queensland, and their destruction by a subsequent Labor government will be the eternal shame of that party and that government, which took away the prestige. The big timers still get the AOMs, but the little people get nothing. The history of this legislation is that former senator Sir Neil O’Sullivan resigned as federal Attorney-General in the sixties because of the widening of the licence to divorce in Australia. He felt very strongly about it. I thought that his actions may have been a little excessive at the time, although I only read about them historically-it was a bit before my time. There is a famous saying amongst people in politics, and not necessarily from the conservative side of politics, that Whitlam and Murphy made it easy to get out of marriage-they were referring to the 1973 bill-but Hawke and Keating made it positively attractive. That is very true. I think every single member on both sides of the House would agree that the Child Support Agency has been a destructive force in marriage such that we have never ever seen before in Australia. I know of numerous occasions when the wife, in particular, became cognisant of what she could get. I represent mining areas, and I am sure my colleagues, such as the member for the seat around Rockhampton and the member for Capricornia-I know Stephen Smith shares this view-are aware that it is absolutely horrific in mining areas. The wives do not want to Thursday, 21 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1977 live in out-of-the way places but, of course, the husbands are on huge money. So this is a magnificent opportunity afforded by the Child Support Agency-‘We’ll leave, take the kids, marry some boyfriend on the coast’-and the husbands stay labouring in the salt mines out in Mount Isa or Kalgoorlie while they are living in the lap of luxury back in the coastal cities. It is a phenomen we know very well in Queensland, and I am sure it is a phenomen that is very well known in Western Australia. People need to have their legislation judged upon its merits. I do not wish to make a political point here because the current government have been in office for nearly a decade now and they have endorsed all of the Labor legislation. None of it has been changed so I do not wish to cast blame upon one side of the House; the other side must share equally the blame that accrues. Legislation and policy must be judged on its outcomes. This is my great argument with national competition policy-and I am going to read from the briefing notes shortly-and I deeply regret to say that national competition policy is mentioned as something with the deepest and most important of spiritual values which we have reduced to a market concept. This is how fanatical and obsessive the national competitive policy people in this place are. They really are very peculiar people. History will judge them very harshly, if for no other reason than their obsessive zeal. Let me come back to judging this legislation, starting with Neil O’Sullivan’s resignation back in the 1960s, to Whitlam and Murphy’s legislation in 1973-which has been referred to a number of times here-to Hawke and Keating’s Child Support Agency legislation and now to this piece of legislation today. This legislation lowers the spiritual values, lowers the quality of the people that will be coming forward and reduces it all to some sort of economic marketplace. Around half of Australia’s children now will be brought up by one parent: one in every two children raised in Australia will be living with only one of their natural parents. When going through the child molestation cases-and the killing of wives and the killing of a family-the number of times one finds that the molestation is by a stepfather is absolutely incredible. The facts are almost overwhelming. I hope that Deputy Speaker Mr Causley does not mind my quoting him, but in a place of great power and influence, Mr Causley said: A government has a right to see that a wife and children get looked after; a government does not have a right to persecute and torture a human being to the point of where he will commit suicide. I doubt whether there is a single person in this House that does not know someone who has suicided as a result of being involved with the Child Support Agency. I became cognisant of three, which I did not know about, in the last three weeks. Looking at the analysis of the huge increase in horrific male suicide rates in this country, you will see that the jump in the graph occurred after the introduction of the Child Support Agency. We had one case that made the front page of the biggest circulation newspaper in Australia, the Queensland Sunday Mailthat of a Kerry Bolton from the electorate of Kennedy. We produced the documents for the newspaper article. He was left with a disposable income of the princely sum of $70 which was to pay for his accommodation, food, toiletries and every other bodily necessity. After the repayment of about $20,000 to the lawyers for his divorce case, which is about average in these cases, and after he had paid the Child Support Agency and had his taxation taken out, this poor man was left with $75 of disposable income. The then head of the Child Support Agency, Moira Scollay, saw nothing in this case that would lead her to change the legislation, nor to change the administration of the legislation. And for a statement of callous total disregard for humanity, the letter of Moira Scollay would take some beating. She was later promoted from where she was as head of the Child Support Agency. The Child Support Agency was established out of the necessity to deal with the massive divorce problem in Australia. The public purse simply cannot afford to pick up one in two wives with their children in Australia. The public purse cannot afford that, so the public purse has decided. It is hard to argue against the logic of having a Child Support Agency, but the 1978 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 March 2002 reason why governments have been forced down this pathway is the massive increase in divorces that are taking place in Australia. I thought that churches like the Lutherans and the Catholics who said, ‘No, you can’t divorce,’ had a primitive attitude and that we should not abide by that attitude. But looking at the alternative, where people feel that they can just walk out of marriage any time they feel like it, I am beginning to rethink my attitude towards the principles that were espoused in those churches at that time. In the case of the Catholic church, I think it has been watered down very dramatically. There is no solution to this problem. Those who, like me, have spent many years as a member of parliament have watched the human misery walk through their door as a result of broken marriages-probably almost one in every two marriages breaks down. One party is completely shattered in such a way that they will probably never recover. Many suicides in Australia stem from this but, even worse, a lot of them live a living death. In the very first hotel I walked into in Mount Isa during my first federal election campaign, I ran into two people who were hopelessly drunk. They had both walked away from their jobs in Mount Isa. Both of them were child support cases and both of them wanted to tell me of a third mate of theirs who had hung himself in Cairns two weeks before. At one time we applied force to prevent people from getting out of marriage. Then we had a period where we applied pressure to try and stop people from getting out of marriage. Today not only is there no moral suasion upon people to stay in marriage, but the Child Support Agency makes it enormously attractive. Let me go back to the Kerry Bolton case. Whilst he was left with $70 to $75 a week to try and struggle by on, his wife had shot through with-if my memory serves me correctly-a lawyer. Presumably he would have been on $60,000 or $70,000, and she was a qualified legal clerk on $30,000 or $40,000. So between them they had over $100,000 coming in. Through the Child Support Agency they got another $15,000. Mr Bolton was living in a building which was scheduled for demolition, and no-one worried much about it. It was out of the way and you could not see it in Mount Isa. It was completely uninhabitable and falling down. It was actually extremely dangerous, but he snuck in there and he was living there. He has no wife; he is heartbroken because his wife has left him. He has no children close by; they are living 2,000 kilometres away. Of course, he has no money. He has no hope of ever getting married again: no-one is going to marry you if you are on $75 a week. The other person is living at a holiday resort town on $115,000 family income. She has three kids; she has a husband; she has a wonderful time. Laws that will facilitate-I do not say allow-that sort of terrible situation are wrong laws and they need to be changed. Some sort of pressure needs to be put upon people to stay inside the marriage bond if there are children involved. If there are no children involved, be my guest and walk out any time you like. But if there are children involved then, I am sorry, you have lost the right to walk out when you feel like it. The minister is here to hear me say that there should be legislation along the lines of compulsory counselling once or twice a week for four to six months. If you are going to create this enormous burden of hardship upon your partner, and if you are going to place this enormous burden of hardship upon the people of Australia-in the sense that they are going to have to foot the bill in a lot of these cases or apply this terrible Child Support Agency regime upon one of the partners-then, clearly, some responsibility, some moral responsibility, has to be placed upon your shoulders. You should not be allowed to just walk out and leave the public purse to pick up the pieces. Picking up the pieces is not just about the Child Support Agency and supporting those children through that period of time. A lot of these children become the victims of crime and the perpetrators of crime in Australia. They lack the sort of parental oversight and support that is needed. Thursday, 21 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1979 On a positive note, I have spent all of my life as a rugby league player or a rugby league official, and it always amazes me that, invariably, the great rugby league players come from a tremendous home support base. Gordon Tallis’s mother has seen every single game of football that Gordon has ever played. Martin Bella’s mother, too-these are people who really have immense respect for their kids, and their kids have had very great parenting. We have the highest male juvenile suicide rate in the world. As a barometer of the unhappiness of our children it is very accurate. On a Richter scale, we are probably running at about nine. There are probably few countries in the world that are running that high. There are few countries in the world that have fewer children than we do: we have one of the three lowest birthrates in the world. People do not want to have children, which is all part of the bigger spiritual picture. The spiritual dimensions are being eliminated here. In closing, I think these words from the bill should be read into Hansard: The current arrangement for appointment of marriage celebrants is based largely regional and special need. The Proposals Paper recommended that these restrictions on the number of appointments be lifted and that appointment be based solely on satisfying a set of criteria ... After the five-year transition period, the ceiling for authorisations would be removed. This is all market stuff-this is national competition policy stuff! It continues: In response to concerns about deregulation of the marriage celebrant market a conflict of interest criteria not included in the Proposals Paper was added to the Billand that is a good thingThis was to allay concerns from celebrants that wedding organiser businesses would capture the marriage celebrant market in a new deregulated environment. What we are talking about here-in relation to one of the most important spiritual values of our society-is market forces! The things that have been said to me by practical people at the coalface who I respect, such as Councillor Yvonne Anich, are that we need fewer people appointed as marriage celebrants, that it should be in the nature of an appointment to the justice of the peace position-as in the old days in Queensland; not the new justice of the peace regime-and that the tourist resorts need to be looked at. (Time expired) ourable members for their comments on the Marriage Amendment Bill 2002 and for the support they have shown for the aims of the reform to the marriage celebrants program that are contained in the bill. As I said in my second reading speech, this bill is the culmination of a four-year process that I began in 1997. I remind the House that the marriage celebrant program was established over 25 years ago to provide marrying couples who do not want to have a religious ceremony with a dignified and meaningful alternative to a registry office wedding. When the program was launched in 1973, fewer than one in six couples chose a civil marriage. Today, over half of all marriage ceremonies within Australia are conducted by civil marriage celebrants. Celebrants, both civil and religious, have been at the forefront of a major social change in only one generation, and their important role has been underestimated. Since the program commenced, the process for authorising marriage celebrants has developed in an ad hoc way, and reform of the program is long overdue. Given that marriage will be one of the most-if not the most-significant commitments couples will make during their lifetimes, they deserve to be able to choose the right celebrant according to their own personal preferences and needs, and to be assured of a thoroughly professional service. This is the philosophy and intent behind the reform process, and it is a philosophy the government shares with the celebrant community. The bill demonstrates that the government has listened to, and acted upon, the concerns of the celebrant community.",149,Representatives Main Committee
307,Mr Williams (Tangney,"Attorney-General) (11.33 a.m.)-I would like to thank hon1980 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 March 2002 A number of members have made comments about the proposed reforms. The member for Kennedy, who just spoke, referred to the national competition policy as influencing the shaping of the proposals. I do not deny that, but it is hardly a key feature of the program. One of the concerns that many members and senators will have received is from those people who would like to be celebrants but are unable to be. We also hear concerns that there are not enough celebrants in particular areas. So there are problems. They are market type issues, and they have to be responded to accordingly. The member for Shortland apparently has a constituent who has raised particular questions with her. I can offer some comments on the questions she has raised. The first comment is that celebrants will retain a lifetime authorisation, but they will be subject to review every five years. So her concern about lifetime authorisation is dealt with under the proposals. The constituent has concerns about the position of registrar. The registrar will be an officer in the Attorney-General’s Department, and will therefore be responsible to the Attorney-General. The selection process under the Public Service Act will be merit based, and all the usual and appropriate safeguards contained in public service appointment procedures will apply. The administration of the program will remain within the Attorney-General’s Department, so it is appropriate that the registrar’s position be filled by the process outlined in the Public Service Act. The member for Shortland’s constituent has concerns regarding the conflict of interest provision. This criterion has been inserted to be used, along with others, to determine an applicant’s suitability for appointment as a marriage celebrant for an extended time. This provision, which will be a standard provision, was actually added to respond to concerns expressed by the celebrant community. It is a broadly worded provision which will cover a range of situations. The member’s constituent apparently has concerns as to whether the celebrants under the new program would be able to marry couples anywhere in Australia. This is a puzzling question-puzzling in the sense that it has been raised at all. Authorised celebrants can already conduct marriages anywhere in Australia, even though they are appointed on the basis of need in a particular town or region. That will continue to be the case. They will continue to be able to marry couples anywhere in Australia. It is suggested by the member’s constituent that the training course would not enable the suitability of a candidate to be assessed. This issue-the suitability of a candidate-will in fact be dealt with under the requirement that a person, in addition to completing training, must also fulfil the ‘fit and proper person’ test set out in the bill. The constituent seems also to have a concern about the market being flooded by new celebrants. The gradual introduction of the new program over a five-year period, with a 10 per cent annual cap on new authorisations, will ensure that this will not occur. Reform of the marriage celebrant program to satisfy the community of the quality and integrity of the program into the future is critical. I believe this package of amendments will be fundamental to ensuring that outcome. The reform of the program will enable the profession of celebrancy to develop and flourish into what is clearly an expanding future. I thank honourable members on both sides of the House for their support for the bill. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Address-in-Reply Debate resumed from 20 March, on motion by Ms Ley: That the address be agreed to. Thursday, 21 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1981 Ms CORCORAN (Isaacs) (11.40 a.m.)-I would like to take this opportunity to respond to the Governor General’s address and to say a few words about the sorts of things I would like to see happen in this country over the next few years. The premise behind my words today is that everybody in this country deserves and has the right to a decent life. Someone asked me recently what ‘a civilised life’ meant. He commented that, for some people, a civilised life is living in a place like New York and enjoying all the hustle and bustle and activities. For others, it is living on a quiet island or in a remote place and enjoying some peace and quiet and their own company. We came to the conclusion that a civilised life is all about living, as distinct from just surviving. For me, that serves as a good definition of a decent life: living and not just surviving. In order to ensure a good society, we in this parliament have an obligation to ensure that everybody is able to enjoy a decent life. We are all human beings, and nobody has any more claim to comfort or to shelter or to food or to a chance to enjoy life than anybody else. In order to ensure that everyone gets a chance to a decent life, it is acceptable in a good society that some people have to give up some of their advantages in order that others might survive or even live. Every society has its powerful and affluent members and its weaker or disadvantaged members. A good society will make decisions that protect the weaker, even to the disadvantage of the strong. A good society will ensure proper care to all its members, whatever their strengths, weaknesses and capacities. We have heard a lot about security lately, and security is one element of a decent life. Let me tell you about the security I believe in. The security I believe in, the security I would like to see, is all about security of employment, security for those in business and security of all of us in times of illness and adversity. The Governor General, in his speech, talks about the characteristic values of the Australian nation, and he says: With political stability and social cohesion that are the envy of the world, with the personal freedoms of expression, enterprise and association more certain and assured than ever before, Australians can pursue whatever individual or collective dreams inspire them. The informed listener could be forgiven for thinking that all people in Australia have access to a decent life. This is simply not the case, and I am not at all satisfied that this present government is interested in ensuring that we all do have access to a decent life. Our security, our ability to enjoy a decent life, is being threatened for many Australians in many ways. One of these ways is the use of language. Senator Barney Cooney made the point recently that what we talk about and how we talk about it has a huge effect on the character of the community we live in. Language is being used as a discriminatory weapon against those in need of support and/or understanding. For example, we are used to the expressions ‘dole bludgers’, ‘dole cheats’, ‘drop-outs’ and ‘drug addicts’, and now we are being encouraged to use words like ‘queue jumpers’ and ‘illegals’. If popular opinion is in accord with what the Prime Minister thinks, he uses the word ‘mainstream’; but if popular opinion is not to the Prime Minister’s liking, he refers to ‘the mob’ or ‘the clamour of the mob’. Recently, there have been reports of moves by the government to reduce the assistance provided to those without work. The words used were that ‘it is hoped that these measures will encourage more people back into the work force’. If you had just arrived from Mars and heard this comment, you would be excused for thinking that there are many people out there choosing not to work. How wrong is that? Right now, there are eight people looking for work for every job on offer. The language has been deliberately chosen to belittle the problem of unemployment, by insinuating that those who find themselves unemployed are not only somehow to blame but also choosing to do nothing about it. The use of derogatory terms is an insidious but effective way of planting judgmental attitudes in our minds. It gives legitimacy to these attitudes without requiring us to seek further 1982 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 March 2002 information. We need to adopt a more generous and civilised way of talking about issues that are serious and that need real and civilised responses. The actions that are being used to exclude some members of our society from enjoying a decent life, and therefore to threaten and remove their security, are easier to spot and are enjoying a growing popularity in our community. An example is the changes to pensions or allowances that help those on less than adequate incomes. It is becoming harder and more timeconsuming to get these benefits and nearly impossible to do so with any sense of security. The current arrangements for the management of family tax benefits and allowances have been in the news recently. We now have the dreadful situation where a family or an individual can suddenly be ‘in debt’-which is another judgmental term-through no fault of their own, often simply because their income has improved unexpectedly. The debt is incurred because ‘the benefit’-which is again another judgmental term-is calculated over the entire financial year. The way to avoid the debt is to overestimate income, thereby reducing the benefits paid through the year, or by not even claiming the benefit through the year and getting it at the end of the year in the form of a tax refund. Both methods assume a family can wait to eat or to pay bills. The attitude and terminology allows and leads those who are not familiar with the intricacies of the social security system to attach the normal meaning to the words ‘overpayment’ and ‘debt’. Those people, not familiar with the system, can be forgiven for assuming that the beneficiaries are rorting the system. Another example of how actions by the government threaten the security of some people is the current breaching provisions. The breaching provisions penalise those on unemployment benefit who do not meet certain tests. These tests are either an administrative requirement, such as responding to a letter or attending an interview, or an activity test, such as keeping job search records. Many factors are either beyond the control of the unemployed person or inherently difficult to manage yet they can contribute to the person not meeting these requirements. The individual may be homeless or moving often and letters may not be received in time. Often, the regulations are complex and because of staffing and time constraints the unemployed person does not receive adequate explanations. Many of the requirements make the assumption that the person is literate. The point is, the breaching regime is more about blaming and budget savings than about providing assistance to those in need. A recent study commissioned by welfare organisations and others has reported that the breaching penalties are unduly harsh, unfair and contravene basic legal principles. Breaching often worsens the situation of the person in need. The effects of breaching also reach out to touch welfare agencies. Welfare agencies are finding that their dollars are being asked to stretch even further to help those who have had their benefits reduced or cut off. The point I want to make is that all these complexities and rules stem from a meanness of attitude, an attitude that is focused on making sure no-one gets a cent more than they are entitled to. The underlying assumption is that the majority of recipients are out there to rort the system. The rules and complexities are not there to assist the very people they are supposed to help. I would like to see a system that throws a security net wide enough to catch all of those in need of assistance and to provide that assistance in a manner that preserves the dignity of those involved, even if this means catching up a few in the net who do not belong there. This is far better to my mind than throwing the net in such a smaller and meaner circle with a focus on exclusion, rather than assistance. The wider net approach reflects the natural generosity and compassion that most Australians have on a personal level which is being drummed out of them on a wider level through the insidious ways I have described. These are examples of the meanness of spirit that is being encouraged by Howard’s government. The language being encouraged and used by the government and others encourages or allows this meanness of spirit to spread throughout our community. It suits the government’s purposes for people to become suspicious of others and it is this divisiveness that sadThursday, 21 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1983 ness and frightens me. This divisiveness does not lead to a cohesive society. The meanness of spirit does not allow Australians to pursue their dreams. Everyone in this country deserves and has the right to a secure and decent life. In a good society, we as individuals, our communities and particularly our governments have an obligation to ensure that everyone is able to enjoy a decent life. There is absolutely no sign that this current government is interested in or even understands this obligation. The second issue I want to discuss today is our political process and the need to care for it. Over the last few years, Australians have become more and more disengaged from the political process. This has to be a concern for all of us. It has to be a concern because our democracy will not look after itself. The democratic process needs nurturing and it needs care. Our system may not be perfect but it is better than many alternatives. It will not last all by itself. It is up to everyone in the country to look after our democratic processes. I speak at many schools and other organisations about the need to care for our democracy. I stress the need for everyone to be involved or interested in, or at least aware of, what is going on around them. I like to talk about our looking after our democracy as being a responsibility, not a right we choose to exercise if and when it suits us. It is easy to denigrate the political process, and it is fashionable to do so. It leads to a point where it is acceptable to be uninterested in politics altogether. IfI were someone hooked on conspiracy theories I would say that this denigration, this indifference, is deliberately fostered by those who have power and who are not interested in sharing this power. I am not necessarily talking about those in power in government. There are plenty of people outside parliament who wield real power in this country. To get back to my point, it is necessary for all of us to take care of our democracy if we want it to survive and function properly. Politicians have a role in this, too. We cannot expect people to have respect for our form of government if they see politicians abusing the process. In recent times, we have seen example after example of very poor behaviour. We have had the ‘kids overboard’ affair; the appalling and totally unsubstantiated slur cast on Justice Kirby; the Wooldridge House affair; and, not so long ago, the Reith telecard affair. These issues are damaging to our parliament, they are damaging to our political system and they discredit all politicians. How can we, as politicians, defend our system of government if the level of behaviour is so low? Whilst the theatre or charade of question time might be just that for those involved, people outside parliament often see little else of parliament, and so judge our processes by what they see of question time. This, to my mind, is a huge pity because it only serves to support the contention that politicians are a blot on the landscape and that our system of government is a waste of time and money. I say we need to improve our behaviour in parliament and our standards outside parliament to improve our own standing-not as individuals, but as a group; but, more importantly, to protect the system of government we have. The Labor Party has put forward some proposals for improving our behaviour in parliament itself. I am heartened that it appears that there is a willingness on both sides of the House to look at ways we can do this. I am also concerned about the way we are led to believe that all issues can be resolved in a simplistic way. We are not encouraging considered debate on complex issues. The simplistic advertising that happens at election time is also demeaning the political process and encouraging simplistic thinking about complex issues. The electorate is being encouraged to think that glib answers are available to all issues. This tends to disengage people, as thoughtful discussion is not encouraged or seen as relevant or necessary. We need to take the time to explain what we stand for. We need to reinstate the notion that reasoned debate and discussion are important and useful in a good democracy. Rightly or wrongly, our system of government is judged by what people see in their parliamentarians and it is up to all of us to do all we can to see that our democracy gets the best care that we can give it. 1984 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 March 2002 In summary, I would like to see a growth, on a national level, of generosity and caring that will see a move toward all Australians being able to live a decent life and to pursue their dreams. The second thing I would like to see is attention being paid to how we can improve our democratic system of government so that all Australians feel that they can be part of that political process, and that it is relevant to them and their daily lives. tribute to Bill Christie, who is in the chamber today and whose final day it is in the parliament-this could be a good thing or a bad thing, I suppose-and who looked after me and my staff very well when we first came to this place in 1993. Bill always exercised a great deal of affability, attention to detail and unerring courtesy. I want to speak about three things in my address-in-reply speech. The first one is the recent election. I come here by the narrowest of narrow margins-64 votes-but, having said that, I am absolutely delighted at the faith placed in me by the electors of Hinkler. Hinkler is always a tough seat, and neither party over the years has been able to take it for granted. It requires three years of intensive work for anyone to hold that seat. Despite the most unusual activities of One Nation in turning preferences against me, their local branch wanted to turn them towards me. I found that quite extraordinary. Not that I sought them or lusted after them in any way, but it seemed to me strange that a local branch had no say in how it could direct its preferences. Also, I had an Independent National who refused to allocate preferences. The combination of these two things put me in a very vulnerable position. But I am happy to say that there was a swing to the coalition in Hinkler of 2.53 per cent and a drop in the Labor vote of 1.98 per cent-nearly two per cent. That vote, and in particular a component of that-a four per cent swing in the industrial city of Gladstone towards me on the primary vote-was enough to sustain the nastiness that was directed towards me in the preferences. Yes, it was a near thing, but I think it was one of the best campaigns I have fought, because the quality of the material, the quality of debate and the quality of the presentation of the ministers who came to my electorate was something I felt intensely proud of. I do not take any delight in beating my opponents, but I think that some aspects of their campaign require mention. They went for a great overkill in the Hinkler electorate. In fact, on one day I had five shadow ministers in my electorate: Messrs Beazley, Crean, Ferguson, Faulkner and Smith. I had two signings of the Beazley pledge. I welcomed those signings, because I turned up with my own corflutes, one of which was a pledge about the Commonwealth Bank and the other was about Qantas. I told my opponent, who staged a demonstration outside my electorate office, that, while I welcomed her to come around and see me with her entourage, I would not be signing the pledge because, first, it was a phoney pledge; secondly, the pledge maker was a serial pledge breaker; and, thirdly, everyone knew where I stood on the 49.9 per cent issue-probably first amongst coalition members, so I had no worries about that. In the words of Tim on TV, we had yet another corflute, and that listed the 14 corporations that the Labor Party sold in office without one iota of hesitation. Also during that campaign-I had not seen this before in the Hinkler electorate-as were made to try to ridicule me. I found that distasteful, not just from a personal point of view but that the political process should be denigrated to that level. In these commercials my eyes were made to roll in my head, and buckteeth were put on me. I thought it showed very poor political campaigning by my opponents. Given the number of phone calls I received in my office, the number of letters and the number of people who called in-some of them claiming to be avowed Labor voters who would not be voting on the strength of that commercial-I got the impression that it did my opponents more harm than good. But my concern was what it did to the political process.",153,Representatives Main Committee
308,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (11.53 A.m.),"Just before I commence today, I would like to payThursday, 21 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1985 I have always thought about Hinkler that we always had very clean elections up until this recent one, and I certainly was not one who added any grist to the mill for a nasty campaign. Nevertheless, despite God only knows how many shadow ministers who came through the electorate, despite the fact that I had the worse position on the ballot paper, and despite the fact that there was a real gang-up on preferences against me, I am absolutely delighted that the people of Hinkler stuck to me, and I pledge to give this three years in government every bit of enthusiasm that I can muster. I would like to acknowledge my campaign director, Rod Wilson, who has done a superb job for elections; my deputy campaign directors, Dick Bitcon and Don Holt, who were very assiduous in their duties; Col Sommerfeld, who is a superb campaign treasurer who watches every cent and keeps the campaign on target all the time; and, in particular, my media officer, Tim Langmead, whose work was simply outstanding. That was enough to sustain us and to return Hinkler, under the most extraordinary and negative circumstances, away from the ALP attack and back into the hands of the government. Two things are seminal in my electorate in the coming three years. The first one is the problem-if you could call it a problem-of the City of Gladstone. The City of Gladstone of about 28,000 people with the Calliope Shire surrounding it-and within the Calliope Shire the township of Boyne Tannum, which is virtually a satellite city to Gladstone with another 7,000 to 8,000 people-are about to become the powerhouse of Queensland. I know members come in here and make those sorts of accusations, but just let me thrill you with what is on the drawing boards in the next three years. There are now significant commitments from overseas companies totalling $6.5 billion. Comalco-which has already commenced-has committed $1.5 billion; Aldoga-which will be an aluminium smelter-$3.4 billion; Austral Calcining-$0.3 billion; and LG Chemicals from Korea-$1 billion. The total is $6.5 billion-quite an extraordinary amount of money. But, in terms of direct employment, it means 1,500 jobs at Comalco, 3,500 at Aldoga, 350 at Austral Calcining and 650 at LG Chemicals. When you add to that the multiplier effect of 2.8 per cent, you can understand what these projects are going to generate, not just in my electorate, but in Central Queensland in particular and for Queensland and the nation as a whole. Already-this may surprise honourable members-Gladstone is responsible for 12 per cent of Australia’s exports by volume and the value of those exports is worth $4 billion a year. It is now the largest multicargo port in Queensland and it represents about a third of the total exports from Queensland; that is an extraordinary profile. And that is on top of the existing industries that are there like QAL-which is an aluminium refinerythe Boyne Smelteraluminium-Thai Corp, QCL-lime and cement-and also Orica, the former ICI. In addition to that, there is Southern Pacific Petroleum with its shale oil plant. So, the town has a particular bent for industry and, not only that, it matches that with an equal commitment to lifestyle. Its local development board won a $900,000 government grant to monitor emissions and matters to do with these industries in making sure that environmental aspects were not overlooked. And the city frequently wins Queensland’s Tidy Towns competition-quite a record for an industrial city. TodayI want to talk about the importance of the recognition by government-state and federal-of the huge challenge that this $6.5 billion worth of investment is going to generate in terms of social disconnection and the need for infrastructure support. Just to give you an example: four years ago I was able to get a port connector road. I went there with the then minister, Mark Vaile, and discussed the matter with the city and shire council, the port authority and the local development bureau. We committed $6 million to a port connector road, which has since been increased-during our sittings in Melbourne when the mayor of Gladstone joined us there-to $7.5 million. 1986 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 March 2002 In all that time we have not been able to get the state government to commit to its share. As you know, under the Roads of National Importance program there has to be an equal commitment from the state government. The state government have been fiddling with this now for nearly four years. At this stage they have flicked the project to the port authority, which has been asked to pick up $4,500,000; to the Department of State Development-I suppose that is the state government, so to that extent they are involved-which picks up $1,500,000; and to one of the other shire councils, another $1,500,000. What troubles me about that is not their tardiness in getting to that point; it is that within the next few years we are going to need another $40 million worth of infrastructure. I just want to be sure that, when I make representations on behalf of Gladstone to the federal government, they are going to be met with equal enthusiasm by the state government. For example, a ring-road will be needed around Gladstone, what is known as Red Rover Road and Kirkwood Road, to take heavy transport in certain directions. There will be another road from near the Aldoga plant to the Bruce Highway. When we talk about Comalco, Aldoga and the existing QAL and Boyne Smelter we are talking about aluminium refining and smelting. In that process, especially in the smelting, certainty of electricity supply is absolutely essential. If you get a blackout and a freeze over with aluminium you have cost yourself not a few million but hundreds of millions of dollars in having to get those pot lines cleaned out and re-established. It requires, then, a triangular duplication: powerhouses at Callide, near Biloela, at Stanwell, near Rockhampton, and the Gladstone Powerhouse. A triangular grid is required because all these industries-including, of course, the IMC project in the electorate of my colleague the member for Capricornia just outside my electoral boundary-will require certainty of electricity supply. On top of that, the huge social infrastructure needs are also going to be enormously important. My brother lived there when Gladstone had its last boom, about 30 years ago. People were living in caravan parks with caravans sitting not on wheels but on Besser block stumps. I suppose those things are tolerable for short periods of time, but we had people living in that sort of accommodation for years. One census I think showed there were 450 people in one caravan park and 600 in another. The social implications, in this enlightened age, of that occurring again would be horrendous. A whole range of measures are going to need to be put in place, by state and possibly federal governments, to make sure that does not recur. One thing being looked at, for example-because the train line from Bundaberg through Gladstone to Rockhampton is one of the fastest train lines in Australia-is to have a suburban service out of Rockhampton, in much the same way as Sydney has the Blue Mountains connection. People in Central Queensland would have a suburban service going from Rockhampton through little towns like Mount Larcom and coming up through Miriam Vale, south of Gladstone, feeding a work force into the community rather than creating a lot of social problems in the town itself. They are big challenges and I signal those in my address today. In the remaining minutes I would like to talk about the Paradise Dam development, which will be essential for the southern end of the electorate, in particular the city of Bundaberg, the township of Childers and the surrounding districts. In Bundaberg alone, we grow around 3.4 million tonnes of cane each year. Last year it went down to 2.7 million tonnes because of adverse conditions, but this year it was down to 2.5 million tonnes. That is a huge hit, when you think about the fact that it is the principal crop in the southern end of the electorate. In a good year we can get 3.8 million; going from 3.8 million down to 2.5 million you get an idea of just what an impact it is going to have, not just on the farmers but on the whole town. Sugar is an all-pervasive crop. You have growers and harvesters; you then have to drag the cane to the mills. When the sugar is made it has to go to the port. Some of the sugar goes into refining; some goes into rum production. Spinning off that is a whole port infrastructure. Bundaberg makes about 80 per cent of the cane harvesters in the world. So when you get a Thursday, 21 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1987 drop in the demand for sugar, it permeates through the whole community. In this speech today, I want to call on the state government to very quickly come to terms with the sort of dam it is going to build at this site called Paradise. Is it going to do it through the DNRM, the Department of Natural Resources and Mines? Is it going to do it through a government corporation, such as SunWater or Burnett Water? Is it going to perhaps have a water board model of farm organisations, local authorities and government? Is it going to have a co-op model, where the farmers would own the dam? Is it going to be a pure commercial operation, where the government will put it out to tender or-as it has been suggested by the government itself now-a PPP model, where it will be a combination of private and public funding? These are very important issues and before anyone can talk about the federal government participating in that, there have to be clear delineations of where the state government is going, what the implications are, especially if commercial people are involved, and what WTO and other implications there might be. When various deputations go to the state government, the standard line is, ‘Oh, the feds are holding it up,’ which is of course quite untruthful because I took all the deputations to the minister at the time, who was Robert Hill, and I can say he was nothing else but totally cooperative. The EIS on the Paradise Dam was approved in record time. Despite the chortling of many state ministers trying to blame the federal government, the hold-up was never at that level. We will require a dam costing somewhere in the vicinity of $180-$200 million; it will be absolutely imperative to the future of the sugar industry. In Bundaberg at present, we have what is known as the Fred Haigh Dam-or the Monduran Dam, as it is sometimes referred to-and it now contains only six per cent of its capacity. By the way, this dam is 1.1 times the size of Sydney Harbour, so if you can imagine Sydney Harbour being drained down to six per cent, you would get an idea of the dramatic impact that could have. In summing up, there are many things to be done in the City of Gladstone, in the Shire of Calliope in the northern end of the electorate and in the Bundaberg, Burnett and Isis areas in the southern end of the electorate. I call on the state government to exercise in both areas a much more focused and timely approach to those projects. Ordered that the address be reported to the House. question: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Western Australia: Electoral System Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (12.13 p.m.)-I rise today to bring to the attention of the House, and certain government members, the need to support electoral equality legislation being enacted in my home state of Western Australia. The purpose of this legislation is to give effect to the principle of one vote, one value in that statethe only state in the Commonwealth, I might say, that has not already enshrined this principle in its electoral laws. It is a fundamental principle of a democracy that every citizen should have an equal say in electing his or her government. That is the basis upon which all honourable members take their place in this House. Imagine my concern then when one such member, the member for Kalgoorlie, spoke in opposition to this principle in the House last week-concerned, but alas not surprised, given the hypocrisy of the Liberal Party on this issue. The new laws, the Electoral Amendment Bill 2001 and the Electoral Distribution Repeal Bill 2001, were passed by both houses of the Western Australian parliament last year. However, the Liberal-National opposition claims that the repeal of these old laws requires an absolute majority-that is, 18 votes-and not a simple majority, which is 17 votes, as occurred to pass the bill. The state government rejects this view. It has followed the advice of the state’s",158,Representatives Main Committee
309,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr P.a. Barresi),"Order! It being 12.13 p.m., I propose the1988 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 March 2002 Solicitor-General. The Clerk of the Legislative Council has taken the matter to the Supreme Court of Western Australian to resolve the constitutional dispute. The hearing for this matter is set before the full bench for three days next month. An alliance has been created in WA to fund an argument against the validity of the laws because it believes that the clerk of the parliament will not adequately present the case. The Liberal and National parties are part of the alliance. The member for Kalgoorlie complained in the House last week that the state government would not provide funding to the alliance to assist it in running its case. It is ironic that when the Liberal-National Party was in state government in Western Australia, it rejected a request for moneys, and also required the then Labor opposition to pay its costs when the validity of the state’s electoral laws were being questioned in the courts. As usual in Western Australia, they want one rule for them and another one for the rest. The member for Kalgoorlie claimed: Any leader of a country based population who does not oppose this legislation is either very stupid or treacherous. How absurd! We are talking of the principle of one vote, one value. I wonder what the views of his own party, and perhaps the leader of the National Party, are with respect to this valid tenet of democracy. These reforms are consistent with the recommendations of bodies reporting on matters to do with the integrity of government in Western Australia, such as the royal commission into what was called WA Inc., and the commission on government which, despite 9 years in state government, the Liberal-National party did not implement. Currently, it takes on average 13,409 people in the country in Western Australia to elect one member of state parliament, compared to an average of 25,860 people in the metropolitan area. This discrepancy, caused by vote weighting, now gives voters in some country areas in WA more than four times the say in electing the government than voters in some metropolitan areas. For example, the seat of Eyre has 9,351 voters for one MP, compared to Wanneroo, which has 41,377 voters for one MP. Under the new electoral laws, all seats will have the same electoral quota-around 21,000 electors-regardless of where the seat is located I would have thought it obvious that the strength of the local member is the key factor in providing the services, support and advocacy a region requires, not the size of the electorate. The reforms will not diminish the potential of local MPs or members of the community to have a voice or to be heard by government. It is acknowledged that there are some difficulties experienced by members of parliament servicing large and remote electorates. However, these difficulties are best addressed by providing additional resources, such as staff, extra electorate offices, travel and communication facilities, rather than by maintaining an unfair and undemocratic electoral system. (Time expired) Shoalhaven Shire: Youth Development Demonstration Project tion to military cadets. The notion was largely brought about by the prevailing mood of the time to accord the youth of Australia an opportunity to participate in the broader processes in the community. Australian military cadets have a long, illustrious history, but after a period of time when they languished they became just shadows of their former selves. However, there has been a successful renaissance, thanks largely to this government. While the Whitlam government’s decision to wind back cadets disappointed many at the time, there remained the undercurrent of tradition that could not be swept away because of fashionable ideology. The cadets are back, and this time we have brought to them more choices in the way young people can serve than what was offered a generation ago. Young people in the Shoalhaven area can now serve a cadetship in an organisation other than a military organisation. They can now serve in organisations such as the Rural Fire Service, the State Emergency Services and many other volunteer organisations.",161,Representatives Main Committee
310,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (12.18 P.m.),"Just a few years ago, an idea was conceived as an opThursday, 21 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1989 In June of last year the Prime Minister, recognising the value of such an initiative, agreed to a pilot program in Shoalhaven. That support was signalled with a commitment of $63,000 to match the $96,000 contribution of Shoalhaven businesses and community organisations. The program, called the Shoalhaven Youth Development Demonstration Project, has been based on a model that was developed in Western Australia in 1996. The Prime Minister, in announcing the funding assistance for the program, said at the time: It will enable 100 young people to volunteer to undertake training as cadets for three hours a week within a range of community organisations. Importantly, it will enable and encourage young people to give something back to their community from an early age and will foster the volunteering spirit in the Shoalhaven area. As if to echo the Prime Minister’s words, the Christmas-New Year bushfires brought out the very best in the volunteers who serve our beautiful part of Australia. The response to the emergency also renewed interest in volunteer organisations, which reinforces the validity of the cadet program in creating a very supportive succession model for all of our fine volunteers. I am pleased to be able to report to the House that the program is well under way and evolving as expected. Thanks must go to Milton Ley, Greg Pullen and Stephanie Robinson, who formed the original committee to set the pilot program. It is their support and confidence that will ensure its continued success. Under the direction of the appointed coordinator, community organisations and the federal government. Mr Alan Mulley and Mr Cliff Maynard of OZISS are doing a magnificent job to bring this project to fruition with their expertise and management skills. However, my appreciation must go to the participating organisations-the State Emergency Service, the Shoalhaven Rural Fire Service, the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol and Ulladulla and Mollymook surf life saving clubs. Without the cooperation of these organisations, arguably there would be no program, and for that I am truly grateful. The value to young people participating is enormous. They will meet new people; learn skills that will benefit both themselves and the community they serve; gain a sense of responsibility and accomplishment; and they will feel accepted and valued. In other words, their sense of worth will be enhanced and, most of all, they will have fun. On 11 February the steering committee met in Nowra under the auspices of the Shoalhaven Area Consultative Committee to discuss the next step, and registered 89 students and two teachers. There are still two high schools to come on board, but I would like to acknowledge the participation of Shoalhaven High School, Nowra High School, St John’s High School and Ulladulla High School. An expression of gratitude must also be extended to the Bomaderry Bowling Club and the Nowra Golf Club for allowing the use of their buses to transport students to and from training. For the project to succeed it must be demonstrated that the wider community supports and encourages the underlying principle. For this to happen there must be bipartisan support. Volunteer organisations ebb and flow, but this project at least tries to promote the flow at the expense of the ebb. That is why it is necessary to have the state government join in and share in the experience. According to the local controller of the Shoalhaven City SES, Mr Ian Borrowdale, the program has been so successful that the youth cadets are now participating in extended training. Mr Borrowdale says that he is more than happy with the results, even though his volunteers have had to put in a lot more time to train the cadets. Some of the cadets have enrolled in rescue courses of their own volition. They also participated, as I said, in the bushfire emergency over the Christmas-New Year period, and what that tells me is that the volunteer ethic is alive and well in these young people and is, in turn, passed onto their peers. I am proud to have played a part in bringing this project to birth, but it will take the faith and support of many others to give it life. Given the encouraging signs the program has pro1990 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 March 2002 duced, consideration should be given to extending the program for another year to consolidate our early successes. Shoalhaven City Council, it must be said, showed its confidence in the program with a contribution of $10,000. I can say that all stakeholders wish the project to continue from January to December 2003. Surely that, in itself, is an expression of confidence that the program is a value added program and should be fully supported. Northern Territory: Pine Gap newspaper articleor a letter to the editor-published in the Centralian Advocate on 19 March 2002. This letter is from former CLP Senator Bernie Kilgariff, someone who is well known and respected in the Northern Territory community and someone whom I personally have a lot of time for. He is properly regarded as the elder statesman of territory politics. I do not always agree with his views; nevertheless, he is someone who has the respect of the community and is someone, as I have said, whom I respect. He is entitled to be concerned about the security of our country. However, I am disappointed that Mr Kilgariff has chosen, through the letters to the editor page of the Centralian Advocate, to attack me without making an effort to talk to me about his concerns or, indeed, to get to the substance of the allegations that he has made. Even more disappointing to me is the quality of his letter. He is entitled to his opinions, but it is the lack of evidence to back up his views that is of concern. One gets used to reading correspondence of this nature in the letters page of newspapers-not the least being the Centralian Advocate-but not when written by a former member of parliament that served the parliament for many years and should know better. His correspondence is ill informed and misleading, it makes a number of false assumptions and demonstrates a complete lack of understanding about what I have said, and he has either deliberately or otherwise misrepresented my views. I have no problem at all with engaging in public debate, but what I am concerned about is the way in which, from my own personal perspective, this letter seems to have come from someone who has completely misunderstood what I have been doing in the parliament and what I have been saying publicly over the last 18 months to two years. The message I have been giving to the Northern Territory community about the question of Pine Gap is not that I am opposed to its existence-and indeed I have stated on a number of occasions the ALP’s strong attachment to the alliance with the United States-but that I have called for all members of parliament, as I will continue to do, to be fully informed about what goes on at Pine Gap. More recently, in an article in the Alice Springs News on 9 May, I implored people to understand the importance of Pine Gap to the Territory economy, and to the Alice Springs economy in particular. I gave recognition to the importance of United States citizens to our local community and to the warmth and regard with which they are held. In that same article I outlined my views that Australia should have an informed debate about Pine Gap’s potential role in the USA’s nuclear missile defence system program and questioned the fact that, while US congressmen can get detailed briefings on the security aspects of Pine Gap, I am unable, as the local member and as a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, to get such a briefing. It seems to me that it is entirely appropriate for me, as the local member and as a member of that joint committee, to request-on behalf of all members of parliament-that we get more appropriate briefings on these matters. In his letter he also raised issues about Australian history. He referred to General Douglas MacArthur passing through Alice Springs as a young soldier. He says that I need a lesson in history. I want to remind Mr Kilgariff that it was Labor wartime Prime Minister, John Curtin, two months before MacArthur’s visit to Alice Springs, who tied Australia’s future security to an American alliance at the expense of our traditional attachment to Britain and that too much",162,Representatives Main Committee
311,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (12.24 P.m.),"I rise today in this adjournment to refer to aThursday, 21 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1991 uncritical reliance on joint defence treaties at the turn of the last century led directly to the First World War-a war that cost 60,000 Australian lives. Perhaps if there were more voices in London, Paris, Moscow and Berlin 100 years ago calling for open and clear public debate on the alliances that these nations were forming, the guns of August 1914 may not have sounded-the tragedy of Gallipoli and the Western Front and Eastern Front may never have happened. More recently, Australia ‘went all the way with LBJ’. In the 1960s our early uncritical reliance on an American alliance led us to Vietnam, and both the United States and Australia still suffer the scars of that conflict. Perhaps it is Bernie that needs a lesson or two in history. I do not apologise for being outspoken about my concerns for the need of the Australian community to be more properly informed about the nature of these treaties and about the nature of the work that is undertaken at Pine Gap and other bases. Cook Electorate: Crime station in my electorate. This meeting was convened by the mayor of Sutherland shire as part of the community’s continuing response to the high level of crime in our area-a level that has also seen the council resorting to putting Cronulla mall under 24-hour CCTV surveillance. Crime is clearly the No. 1 issue in my electorate. The meeting was well attended, with future meetings planned for the Menai area. The level of concern felt by residents is illustrated by the response to a survey I did on the issue late last year which received 994 responses. Since becoming the member for Cook, I have commissioned a number of surveys on a wide range of issues. Never have I had such a strong response to any survey. Of these 994 responses, 94 per cent thought the Sutherland shire had become less safe than it was five years ago, 50 per cent felt threatened by gangs, 89 per cent did not feel safe travelling by train at night, 91 per cent thought police were losing the war against crime and 78 per cent were not satisfied with the police presence in our area. Obviously these figures are unacceptable and, with regard to the last statistic, it is particularly concerning that the Cronulla beach area, one of the biggest problem spots, is being subjected to the sight of police patrolling on bicycles. This is more reminiscent of a scene from A Country Practice than representing an adequate response to a valid concern. I am also yet to talk to anybody who seriously believes that this idea would enable the police to respond rapidly to an emergency, or that it constitutes an effective police presence. What the Cronulla area needs is a mobile policing office on the beach, similar to those at Manly and Bondi. These would provide a far more adequate police presence and allow for quicker and more effective responses than the ridiculous bicycles. I have risen in this House on numerous occasions to criticise the state government on the woeful job they are doing to address the issue of crime in Sutherland shire. I have two major problems, the first being their continued focus on the western suburbs of Sydney at the expense of the rest of the city, and the second their insistence on sticking with a policy of amalgamating police stations-when there is a clear desire for more community based policing. I notice there has been some movement from Mr Carr on this issue in recent months. He has demoted his previous police minister and appointed the media-shy Michael Costa to the position. It is interesting that the previous minister did not make one single visit to the area, despite the fact that crime is the No. 1 issue in Sutherland shire right now, and that is the reason for these rallies being convened. Changes have been made to the sentencing of gang members, and I see that there has been an announcement today to the effect that it will be made more difficult for people charged with certain offences to be granted bail whilst they await trial. These changes are well and good, but they fall short of what is being demanded not only by the people in my electorate but in a common voice around New South Wales.",164,Representatives Main Committee
312,Mr Baird (Cook) (12.29 P.m.),"Last SaturdayI attended a public meeting at Cronulla1992 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 March 2002 There are clear issues related to why this forum emerged in Cronulla mall last weekendthat is, concerns about the level of gang activity, the level of crime and the level of break-ins. Ordinary people from my electorate got out there and expressed their views very visibly. They are concerned about the downgrading of Cronulla Police Station, they are concerned about amalgamations and they are concerned about the level of police who happen to be off on stress leave. There are over 50 police in my electorate who are off on stress leave. That indicates several things, one of which is the overall organisation of the police force. We have a police commissioner who is paid some $450,000 a year, yet the level of stress and discord within the police force is quite apparent. We have somebody in the Premier’s office who is responsible for police; we have the police commissioner; we have the minister, who loves to get out there and get his face in the newspapers. What we want to see is effective action on the ground. The people in my electorate are demanding it. They are expressing their concern and saying it is a major issue for them. They do not feel safe in their houses. They do not feel safe when they go out at night in the area. This situation has to change around, which is why we have had these forums-quite independent of me and developed by the independent Mayor of the Sutherland Shire-where people have come out from all of these areas to say that they have had enough, and that it is time they saw the state government and the state police minister taking some real action to ensure the safety of people in these important areas of Sydney. Port Adelaide Electorate: Fort Glanville Historical Association our of commissioning a world first. The Fort Glanville Historical Association, located in my electorate of Port Adelaide, is based in a restored fort originally built in the late 1800s when a threat from the Russian Imperial Navy was perceived. The actual commissioning was of the restored mechanical loading system for the fort’s 10-inch guns. The restoration was made possible by many dedicated local history enthusiasts and a Commonwealth Centenary of Federation grant. Special mention should be made of the work of the members of the Fort Glanville Historical Association. I would particularly like to acknowledge Frank Garie, the late Neil Francis, Mike Lockley, Russell Sheldrick and Derek Bakker. Frank Garie was responsible for the research, plan drafting and manufacture of the timber components, together with the installation at the fort. The mechanical components were mainly manufactured or obtained and installed, with Frank, by Neil Francis. The pair worked closely together for two years on the project. Tragically, Neil passed away suddenly at the end of February, just as the project was nearing completion. Fort Glanville and the people of South Australia owe much to volunteers like Frank Garie and Neil Francis, because without them Fort Glanville would certainly not enjoy the world leadership status it has today. Many aspects of the history of the fort and of the loading system are typical of South Australia of the late 1800s-that is, ahead of the pack. For example, South Australia was, in 1880, the first government to purchase a new Armstrong protected barbette system. This involved raising the height of the wall at the front of the gun to protect the crew from enemy fire, and constructing the undercover mechanical loading system. The purchase was largely due to South Australia’s new governor, world famous defence adviser and engineer Sir William Jervois, a colonel in the Royal Engineers, who had seen the system while in England. The experts tell me that the system essentially comprises a rammer driven by a cable system and a controlled loading beam that raises the powder in the shell to align with the muzzle of the gun, with the gun barrel in the depressed loading position. The rammer is then activated to load the gun. On the third try, we got it to go with a 7.5 kilogram charge. I think I understood the actual operation but, on a practical basis, I saw it first-hand and it worked. The system was constructed mainly of timber and was thus cheap to purchase, which made it attractive to the British colonies. South Australia’s was a pilot system for later improved",165,Representatives Main Committee
313,Mr Sawford (Port Adelaide) (12.33 P.m.),"On Sunday, 17 March, I was given the honThursday, 21 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1993 versions built in forts in Sydney, Brisbane and Hobart. Fort Glanville’s system was adapted to enable it to fit to an already built emplacement, thus making it unique. However, like others elsewhere in the world-and this is the tale we all know so well today-it became obsolete very quickly in the 1890s due to advances in technology. Possibly because it was a prototype, Fort Glanville’s system was never really successful, and was removed in the 1890s. No plans existed to enable reconstruction, and a vast amount of research has been necessary for the project. It is a great detective story. A small sketch was discovered in a UK patent office, under another examination of papers. This was scaled up and compared with the few remaining fixtures still at the fort. Working drawings were then drafted, and the restoration proceeded from there. The reconstruction and restoration of the mechanical loading system is a world first for such a system. It is a great achievement for the association, and something very special for the Port Adelaide area. It is also something very special for Frank Garie, a dedicated local historian, and, as I said, for the late Neil Francis, a dedicated helper. My congratulations go to everyone involved in the project, and my very best wishes for the future for all members of the Fort Glanville Historical Association. Telstra: Services Ms PANOPOULOS (Indi) (12.37 p.m.)-I would like to continue the adjournment speech I did not finish last night. The Boulding family drove to Wagga hospital the next morning, 4 February. Mrs Boulding did not want to take her daughter home unless the telephone was working, so she called Telstra from a public phone booth at the hospital. Telstra told her that the phone would be fixed by the time she got home, but it was not. That evening, Mrs Boulding walked to neighbour’s house, called Telstra and told them that she was blind, that there were young children in the house and her daughter was recovering from an operation, and that she wanted the telephone fixed that day, as it had not been working properly for three weeks. In true fashion, Telstra told Mrs Boulding that her phone had been booked in to be fixed the following day, and hung up. The next afternoon, 5 February, the telephone was in fact working, although by that evening the service was again spasmodic. On6 February, the telephone was still not working, and Mrs Boulding insisted that her husband drive her to the local post office so that she could call Telstra. The Telstra operator responded by saying, ‘We know that the line is damaged, and we are in the middle of fixing it.’ The operator was in Wollongong, and asked how far the nearest substation was. On being told that it was in Wodonga, 37 kilometres away, she said, ‘That’s a long way away. It’s getting late in the day: it’s 3.30. We have got to try to find a technician who is willing to go out there, and it’s going to run into overtime.’ That evening, as the phones were still not working, Mr Nugent did not want to leave the family alone so he stayed at home instead of going to work. At about 6 p.m., Sam Boulding had a chronic asthma attack. Mr Nugent drove to a nearby telephone to ring an ambulance. Sam’s condition deteriorated rapidly, and he died soon afterwards in his mother’s arms. As if it was not devastating enough for the Boulding family to lose Sam in spite of begging Telstra to fix their telephone, the day after Sam died, Telstra contacted Rose Boulding and told her that she was eligible for $30 compensation. After Sam’s death, Telstra also installed a separate second line and provided the family with two Telstra handsets, satellite service allowing for outward calls, and a mobile CDMA handset. But Telstra does not have a monopoly on insensitivity. The ACA in all its arrogance refused to provide Mrs Boulding with a copy of their report with which she fully cooperated unless she signed a confidentiality agreement, meaning she would not be able to speak to her own family, who had suffered through this ordeal with her. Subsequently, the ACA did apologise and provided the report to Mrs Boulding. Telstra’s treatment of the Boulding family over sev1994 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 March 2002 eral years, and more recently during this recent tragedy, illustrates where their priorities lie. Such priorities obviously do not include providing acceptable infrastructure and services to families in my electorate. Rather, the best we can expect from Telstra is service with a snarl, at worse an arrogant disregard for people and basic communication services that are taken for granted in capital cities. Even the existence of service obligations does not help the situation because they do not guarantee faults will be fixed and Telstra can technically escape being in breach of them. Ever since anyone can remember, Telecom was a byword for arrogance and inefficiency. The name change to Telstra was supposed to cure all that, but that culture has turned out to be too deeply ingrained. No spin doctor or fancy logo can fool the people of Indi into believing that Telstra actually cares about the little person-the home consumer. I want to assure the Boulding family and all my constituents that I will continue to raise Telstra’s incompetence in this House and hope that there are no further tragedies in Indi or elsewhere in Australia. Immigration: Asylum Seekers Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (12.41 p.m.)-RecentlyI received a deputation of young people involved with refugee action groups. They came to express to me their deep concern about the federal government’s treatment of asylum seekers and refugees. This weekend, Palm Sunday rallies in support of refugees are being held across Australia. The purpose of the Palm Sunday rallies is to give all Australians the opportunity to join in a show of compassion and tolerance for the hundreds of men, women and children who are held in detention centres across Australia. I will be attending the Melbourne rally and I do so in particular because many of the young people in Calwell have asked me to attend. The message that my young constituents wish me to convey to the House is their deep concern for what they believe is a lack of tolerance and empathy towards refugees. They have expressed to me their anger and they want to know why Australian politicians support policies that these young people consider to be violations of human rights. My young constituents show a great sensitivity to the obligations we have to each other as human beings, because they have a broad understanding of Australia’s place in the global community. They also understand the complexity of the Middle East conflict and they understand the reasons behind the mass movement of people across the globe. My young constituents advocate alternative solutions to deal with our current refugee crisis, not just here in Australia but on an international level. It does not surprise me therefore to learn that other young people support the views espoused and put forward to me by my young constituents. In fact, public opinion polls conducted for the Melbourne Age newspaper this year illustrate that young people support alternatives to the government’s Pacific solution. On the question of support for the federal government’s policy on asylum seekers, young people showed the least support for the government’s Pacific solution with 44 per cent of all young people supporting the policy compared to 63 per cent in other age groups. At the recent National Population Summit in Melbourne amongst the many participants there were also a number of young Australians from schools around Melbourne. I want to quote 17-year-old Tomah Ball of Melbourne Girls High School, who said: It’s terrible people aren’t thinking about it more rationally ... so much of the debate has become based on racism. Another student Suresh McKenzie from Footscray City Secondary College said that he was ashamed of the Howard government’s policies. Some of my young constituents and others who have deep concerns encouraged me to visit the Maribyrnong detention centre. Main Committee adjourned at 12.44 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Sri Lanka: Ambassador to Australia (Question No. 50) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 13 February 2001: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2737 (Hansard, 9 August 2001, page 29507) and my question No. 2811, is he aware of a report in Colombo’s Sunday Leader of 12 August 2001, that the Sri Lankan Defence Ministry has acquired Russian-made chemical warheads, RPO-A Shamel Rockets, valued at millions of dollars. (2) Is he aware that the end-user certificates for the purchase of these chemical weapons were allegedly signed by the now Sri Lankan Ambassador to Australia, Major-General Janaka Perera. (3) Have these chemical warheads been banned internationally. (4) Does the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), formerly the 1993 Paris Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, prohibit the use of these weapons. (5) Did Sri Lanka become a signatory to this Convention on 14 January 1993, which was ratified on 19 August 1994 and came into effect on 29 April 1997. (6) Will he make inquiries to establish, independently, the allegations against Major-General Janaka Perera; if not, why not. (7) In light of the latest allegations against Major-General Janaka Perera, does he still consider he is a suitable Sri Lankan Ambassador to Australia; if so, why. (1) Yes, I am aware of the report. (2) I understand that end-use certificates are normally signed by the Commander of the Army or Master General of Ordinance. Major-General Perera has occupied neither position. (3) The RPO-A Shmel is not a chemical warhead, but rather a thermobaric weapon. (4) The use of thermobaric weapons is not prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) or any other international instrument, including the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW). (5) Yes. (6) No. The allegations that the end-user certificates for the RPO-A Shmel Rockets were signed by Major-General Perera do not warrant further inquiry because the use of such weapons is not prohibited. (7) Yes. The use of the weapon in question is not prohibited. Education: TAFE (Question No. 61) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) Can he guarantee that the Federal Government policy relating to contestable funding for vocational education and training is not used to establish an artificial training market; if so, how. (2) Is he aware that teachers in TAFE are spending significant time that should be allocated to the delivery of quality education courses in writing submissions and tenders in order to win contestable funds that were once allocated to TAFE; if so, if time and outcomes are the basis of efficiency, why is funding not directly allocated to TAFE. (3) Has he allowed the Australian National Training Authority to ignore the recommendations of the Senate inquiry into the quality of vocational education and training; if so, why and will he ensure that the recommendations are implemented; if not, why not. (4) What strategy does he have in place to avert the impending teacher shortage crisis caused by the forecast retirement of approximately 75% of TAFE permanent staff in the next five years.",166,Representatives Main Committee
314,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) What commitment will the Government make to promote teacher education and recruitment in light of present and future shortages of TAFE teachers. (6) Has his “growth through efficiencies” policy significantly contributed to the casualisation of the teaching staff in TAFE; if so, how will he address this issue. (7) How will he address the needs of distance education for rural and remote communities by efficiently funding on-line and E-commerce training through the public education provider TAFE, including Open Training and Education Network-Distance Education in NSW. (1) The Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) Agreement 2001-2003, between the Commonwealth, States and Territories, includes the broad purpose: ‘to enable flexible training to be delivered by a wide range of providers that are responsive to their clients.’ The only agreed national policy relating to contestable funding in the vocational education and training sector is the User Choice policy. A commitment to User Choice policy is an element of the current ANTA agreement. Under User Choice, public funding flows from the State or Territory training authority to the chosen provider. Implementation of the policy was agreed originally by the Commonwealth, States and Territories in 1997. The policy is flexible and allows States and Territories to implement it taking into account their resourcing decisions and differential markets within States and Territories. (2) The employment and management of the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) workforce is a matter for the States and Territories. (3) The Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) is accountable to the ANTA Ministerial Council comprising Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers responsible for vocational education and training. ANTA is not subject to my direction. The Government response to the Senate Inquiry into the quality of vocational education and training was tabled in the Senate out-ofsession on 16 May 2001. (4) As noted in response to question (2) the employment and management of the TAFE workforce is a matter for the States and Territories. The National Centre for Vocational Education Research will be funding a study of the national TAFE workforce as part of its 2002 funding round. This work may assist in identifying whether any national response is required on this issue. (5) See answer to question (4). (6) The “growth through efficiencies” policy applied to the ANTA Agreement 1998-2000 and does not apply to the current ANTA Agreement 2001-2003. As noted in (2) the employment of TAFE teachers is a matter for the States and Territories. (7) The Commonwealth is assisting to meet the needs of rural and remote communities with on-line learning and e-commerce training as part of its overall support for on-line vocational education and training through the Australian Flexible Learning Framework.
