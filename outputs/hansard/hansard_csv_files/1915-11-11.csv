Yesterday a representative of the jress put a question to me arising out of a cable that referred to the disposal, or reported sale, of some 8,000 tons of wheat on the Baltic Exchange. I said that I knew nothing of the matter, and that all Australian wheat had to go through the scheme. I repeat that; but I believe that the wheat referred to was imported from oversea to meet the shortage, and that, as it has been found in excess of immediate requirements, it is proposed to re-export it, and it has been sold. I am told by the Minister of Trade and Customs that there are only 2,000 tons of this wheat of which the sale is recorded. However that may be, only oversea wheat will be permitted to leave, unless it passes through the scheme. Australian wheat must pass through the scheme, sale or no sale. No wheat will go from here except under the condition I have mentioned. Trade and Customs, upon notice1.

Whether any of the State Governments have made application to the External Affairs Department for space in the Commonwealth Offices in London for their Agents-General? 2. If such application for offices were made to the Department could it satisfy the requirements of the States in the matter of accommodation ? m e n t gives t h e in for m a t i o n desired by t h e honourable m e m be r : As far back as 1912, as soon as Parliament ratified the proposal to acquire the Strand Aldwych site for the erection of Australian offices, the Prime Minister informed the State Premiers that it was proposed to accommodate the Agents-General in the building, a tentative design of which was submitted to the Premiers, at the same time. The Premiers were asked to furnish information as to the extent and class of rooms likely to be required for their respective offices. The present position in regard to this matter is as follows :Victoria -The Government of Victoria occupies portion of the present buildings, and pays to the Commonwealth Government to cover rent, taxes, & c , an annual sum of Â£2,200. Queensland haa declined to occupy any space, ns the premises they have leased in the Strand meet the needs of the State. Western Australia has leased a site_ in the heart of London, and does not require any portion of Australia House. Tasmania has declined to occupy space, as the rent asked was considered to be high, and fche Assent-General has been informed that the State will continue to occupy premises at present used by him.

He was informed that the probable date would be the end of March, 1916. South Australia -The Agent-General would not commit himself to any definite arrangement, and would not select any space in Australia House. A shop frontage was, however, provisionally reserved for him. ""The South Australian Government decided to allow the matter to stand over until the Agent-General's (Hon. P. W . Young) report had come to hand. That report has not yet been received. A communication has just been received from the Premier of New South Wales forwarding a copy of the following cablegram received from the Agent-General( MrB . R. Wise) :"" New Offices -Agent-General, South Australia, obtaining excellent site in the Strand, next West Australia, close Queensland and New Zealand, which would afford splendid and ample accommodation for our State and South Australia, permitting each to retain its separate identity, at a cost not exceeding that paid by our State today, and giving far superior accommodation.

"" Young and I both strongly urge Commonwealth Buildings unsuitable, being without separate entrances would destroy distinctive identity of the States. Rooms arc also dark and inconvenient, and site too far east and on wrong side of Strand. "" W ill send particulars by next mail, but to secure reduced prices co-operation with South Australia should be secured. W ill , of course, commit you to nothing without your approval."" The Premier added that the further particulars promised by Mr Wise have not been received, and that he has communicated with the Premier of South Australia requesting a statement of his views on the question generally, leaving the matter to be discussed in detail at a later date if necessary, and that he has informed the Premiers of the other States of the action taken. The Agents-General of New South Wales and South Australia, it would seem, are prepared to add to the cost of Australian representation in London by hiring fresh offices and refusing to avail themselves of accommodation provided by the Commonwealth in Australia House. mi'Vlle nf 914 1 1.

47,Mr Joseph Cook,"Owing to the[3.29] I desire to offer a few words of protest against the proposal to erect an arsenal and small arms factory at Canberra. I was glad to note the answer given by the Minister of Home Affairs to a question put by another honourable -member in relation to the selection of the site for this proposed factory, the reply being that the site agreed upon had been turned down. ber's remarks anticipate the discussion of Order of the Day, No. 7. understand that that Order of the Day is not to be proceeded with. of that. The Order of the Day stands on the notice-paper. not anticipate the discussion of that motion. There is another matter to which I wish to refer very briefly, and that is the friction which has arisen in connection with the work of certain textile factories. ' A great deal of trouble has ocmandeered these factories by taking; the curred because of thedissatisfaction that exists with tlie conditions, hours of labour, and payment for services now prevailing. I understand that an arrangement has been arrived at with the Government of New South Wales whereby, in consideration of certain concessions, the interests of employees in the textile factories will be properly conserved under what is practically the control of the factories by tlie Federal Government. orable member think that the rates of wages should be uniform throughout Australia ? not know that the rates of wages should be uniform, because conditions may differ. The cost of living is higher in some parts of Australia than it is in others, and rents are higher in some parts than in others. These factors have a bearing on rates of remuneration, and were uniform rates to be paid all over Australia, inequalities and hardships might arise which would form a new basis of complaint. While on the face of things it seems reasonable that rates of wages should be uniform throughout the Commonwealth, I do not know that it would be practicable to make them so. Rates of remuneration must depend very largely upon the conditions and circumstances of an industry, and its situation. But due regard sliould be paid to the conditions under which work is done. I understand that the contractors for the supply of textiles to the Defence Department are making enhanced profits. If that is so, it is reasonable and fair that their workers, who are asked to put forward their best efforts to expedite an increased output, should receive some recognition in tbe form of higher remuneration. In the short space of time which has elapsed since the complaints that I am voicing were brought before me, I have not been able to make a personal investigation of the facts, but the source of my information leaves me no reason to doubt its bona fides. . I understand that the employees in the textile factories are not being fairly treated in the matter of remuneration. ' These complaints should receive investigation by the Commonwealth Government, which, although not in all cases the direct employer, is the indirect employer, because it"" has practically conwhole of their output, to the exclusion of private consumers. It appears that, in some cases, bonuses have been paid, but the complaint is that these bonuses have gone only to selected individuals, holding more or less responsible positions, and that while liberal sums have been paid to them, the claims of others whose efforts are no less worthy of recognition have been entirely ignored. So far as the delivery of goods is concerned, the result may be a great slackening of effort on the part of those who are dissatisfied, and in some instances there have been strikes, and, in consequence, stoppage of work. This is a very serious matter at the present time, when every ounce of energy and material should be used to get the best results in the interests of those who are fighting our battles at the front. I have mentioned these matters very briefly, not with any desire to take up the time of the House, but in the hope tliat an immediate investigation will be made into the causes of complaint, with a view to removing' the dissatisfaction which exists, so that work may proceed smoothly, and that the best results may be obtained for the prosecution of the war.

55,Mr Lai Rd Smith (Denison),"him, I have no desire to see industrial trouble arise in the textile factories. ""We have to clothe and supply blankets to the troops that are doing such great and noble work at the front, and a body of good artisans are working in our mills with that end in view. In Tasmania these artisans are being paid a poor, miserable, sweating rate of wage, which is a disgrace to the business with which they are connected. If I have been correctly informed-and my informant is the president of the Textile Workers Union in Hobart, who recently came all the way to Melbourne to place the case before me, and to ask me to do something in the interests of the employees, who are largely women-ver y poor wages are being paid. The president was most anxious that no trouble should arise at this particular time. None of us wishes for trouble at the present juncture. But in Tasmania employees have no means of getting redress. They cannot get Wages Boards, and they cannot go before an Arbitration Court. The Commonwealth Government is paying a huge sum of money to the factories for the work they are doing, hut, speaking generally, the unfortunate employees in the factories have not benefited by any increases in their wages. How can an employer claim to be a loyal subject of the Empirei f he is making huge profits by sweating employees, whose loyalty to the Empire keeps them at work? In Tasmania they would go out on strike to-morrow if it were not that they desire to serve the country in its time of need. Every employee in Australia, by doing his work well, is helping those who are at the front. I appeal to the textile employers of Australia to rise to the occasion, and to show their loyalty to the Empire by paying their employees, male and female, a fair and reasonable living wage. The cost of living in Australia has increased by leaps and bounds of late years. We were told the other day by the Attorney-General that the purchasing value of the sovereign is now something like 14s. 6d. If that is so, how can these employees live on the small rate of wages that they were getting before the war broke out? When they appeal to the employers their appeal, falls on deaf ears. It is time that the Minister of Defence, or some one else in power, took up this matter, and insisted on the so-called loyal subjects of the Empire-the employers-paying those who are serving the Empire so faithfully and well a just wage for what they are doing. Mention has been made in Great Britain of the Australian blankets. They say that at the front nothing to equal them has been seen. These blankets are made by loyal workers, who suffer under terrible conditions, which they endure only because of their loyalty. I appeal to the employers, in justice to themselves and to their workers, and to the Empire to which we are so proud to belong, to rise to the occasion, and not to compel us to come here to make these complaints. If , when Parliament meets again, I am forced to repeat these complaints, I shall certainly use much stronger language, and shall name the firms to which they apply, so that their names may be published throughout the length and breadth of Australia. I am of opinion that that being known, the employers will do more than merely wave flags and proclaim their loyalty in public places. I hope that they will prove their loyalty in a practical way. I ask the Government to take steps to refer to the Public Works Committee, or the Public Accounts Committee, the works and expenditure going on at the Henderson Naval Base. There has been much adverse criticism as to the way in which the work there has been done. The Base is a very important one, and an enormous expenditure will have to be incurred in connection with it. My desire is that the money shall be spent as economically and as efficiently as possible. I have no observations to make from personal knowledge, but as adverse reports have been made public, I think that, in the interests of the country, the Works Committee should report on the work. If the Minister can see his way to bring that about I shall be much obliged to him. the Act they must reportthey are asked to do so. desire for a moment to draw attention to a matter that is affecting a large body of the members of the Letter Carriers' Asso : ciation in a very serious manner.

That sounds very nice, but I want to show honourable members how this order affects the men concerned. ceived by one of them from the MutualL if e and Citizens' Assurance Company Limited, which statesWe are in receipt of advice from the Deputy Postmaster-General that you are requested to effect a further insurance of Â£50 upon your life in accordance with the Commonwealth Public Service Begulations. The annual premium for an insurance of Â£50 in the case of a man who is fiftythree years of age next birthday-and I want honourable members to take particular notice of this-is Â£ 9 3s. The premium for a man whose age is fifty-four next birthday, is Â£ 1 0 10s. l i d . ; so that, in order to and effect this extra insurance, the particular man to whom I refer, who will be fiftyfour years of age next birthday, will have to pay an additional premium of Â£10 10s. l i d . per year. got from the Arbitration Court an increase of Â£ 6 per annum in his wages, he is actually lef t Â£ 4 10s. l i d . per annum worse off than he was prior to the receipt of his wages increment. I believe it is only necessary to bring the matter under the notice of the Postmaster-Generalf or him to stop what seems to be a grossly unjust t h in g ; because, by the action that has been taken, the men concerned are being robbed in a left-handed manner of the benefit of the award they have obtained. I am sorry the Ministerf or the Navy is not in the House, because I want to bring before his notice a matter that arises out of an inquiry held in Brisbane regarding the fitting of a transport. As time is pressing, I can only deal with the case very briefly to-day. I notified him bring the matter forward, and asked that the papers should be brought up in order that I might see them. I understand that they have been here on a previous occasion, though I have not seen them, and I have delayed bringing the matter forward u n t i l now, in order that they might be again laid upon the Library table. They are not there, however, although I am informed the Minister promised them, and that the officers of the Library have tried to get them. I only mention the matter, therefore, now because the adjournment is near, and in order that an officer who has been unjustly treated may have his case fairly dealt with. I ask, therefore, that the Acting Minister will bring the whole of I have a letter rethe facts before the Minister for the Navy for reconsideration. An inquiry was held recently at Brisbane into certain matters arising out of the fitting of transport .4.37. Two officers were involved. I do not desire to mention the name of one, but the other, whose name is Mr Stacey, is seriously involved in the subsequent proceedings. The Minister made a report as the outcome of his inquiry, and after it had been circulated through Australia, Mr Stacey wrote to the Minister asking, in very courteous language, that the whole position should be reconsidered, an injustice upon him removed, and furnished most convincing proofs against the findings of the M in ister. I admit that, at this juncture, I am only speaking from an ex parte point Whilst he has of view. I have only Mr Stacey's case before me, but it does appear to me, on the face of it , and upon the evidence supplied, that this man is entitled to more consideration than he has received. On the 24th November, Mr Stacey, who was then in Brisbane, received a telegram from the Naval Board as follows: In view of labour troubles, Sydney, Minister has decided fit A87 at Brisbane. Transport officer, Sydney, has been instructed Bend you plans first mail, and you are to obtain quotations and submit same by telegraph as early as_ possible. Agents have been instructed detain steamer yours meantime. In his report, the Minister finds that Stacey did nothing to carry out this in struction, and that Commander Burford arrived almost immediately afterwards and took over the control. It is further stated in the Minister's report that, on the last week of my intention to arrival of Commander Burford at Brisbane, Mr Stacey had workmen on the AS7 drillin g holes for bolts, and that thesie workmen were the employees cf Brown and Broad. It is definitely found against Mr Stacey, amongst other things, that he received instructions by telegram, and that he did not carry those instruc-",17,Meningitis Bas E Hospital Impor Tation Of Defence Experts Federa L Capital City Design Nation Al Monument To Fallen Soldiers Nam
60,Mr Groom (Darling Downs) [3.50],"tions out. On these points, a letter was written by Mr Stacey to the Minister, and documentary evidence was given to him showing why his finding should be reconsidered. In the first place, Mr Stacey produced written evidence that, on the receipt of the telegram, he had communicated with three different firms asking for tenders for the fitting out of transport A37, and he also produced to the Minister the replies that he received from these firms, ""showing distinctly that, in this respect, he did not commit any breach of duty. He produced specifications signed by several firms. One of these letters, signed by H . Peters, statesYours of even date, 30th July, asking for replies to the following questions:1. Were you notified by me that transport AS7 was to fit at this port, and that tenders were invited? 2. If so, when and how? 3. Were you afforded facilities to tender, and what information was supplied you to tender on? 4. Have you any means of verifying the fact tliat you were tendering for this work? 5. Did you sigh uie following specifications on 28th November, 1914? Ha questions (1) and (2) we were notified by you by telephone on Friday, the 27th November, I believe, and invited to tender. 3. I called at the Naval Office on Saturday morning, thc 28th, but as there were three or syth (Brown and Broad's foreman) discussing the plans, I said I would call after lunch. ThisI did, and was introduced to Commander Burford by you. You supplied me with the general plan, and about seven detailed plans, also blue-book of transport regulations, with pages that applied indicated. 4. Our latter-book will show that on Monday, 30th November, we wrote a letter to fit out transport A3"". I have read only part of the letter, as I desire to be brief; b u t Mr Peters says in this letter that, on Monday, 30th November, he had the tender with h i m . Tn another letter, Messrs. Wildridge and Sinclair Limited, Brisbane, wroteWe were notified by you that transport AS7 was to fit at this port, and that tenders were invited. We received tbe above information on Thursday, 26th November, 1914. We were afforded facilities for tendering, including the inspection of a number of plans, specifications, &c. Our letter-book and telegrams in this office support the above statements. A letter was also produced from Hancock and Gore Limited, stating that, on 26th November, they were informed by telephone. These show clearly that the M i nister's finding that Mr Stacey disobeyed his instructions was absolutely without foundation, and that he d i d the very things that the Minister says he did not do. These letters I have quoted were put before the Minister to induce him to reconsider his findings. Sir JOH N FOEBEST -What Minister was that? Acting Minister for the Navy. The next point is this: The Minister states in his report that Commander Burford stated that, on his arrival at Brisbane, Mr. Stacey had workmen on board the A 37 drilling holes for bolts. Includedi n the letter Mr Stacey wrote to the Minister was a number of sworn statements signed by men, in which they declared that no drilling had at that time been done by anybody at all. Here is one signed by James P. BellI was foreman of drillers for Messrs. Smith, Faulkner, and Company on the work on board transport AS7 while fitting at Brisbane in December, 1914. I commenced work on board that vessel on Tuesday, 1st December, 1914, and prior to that date no drilling for horsestalls or troop fittings of any kind had been done on that vessel by my employers or any other firm or men. Similar sworn statements are made by Archibald Campbell, and others also from Brown and Broad. Again, the M in ister states in his finding that Mr Stacey disobeyed instructions, in that he caused Messrs Brown and Broad to put workmen on the transport. As a matter of fact, Mr Stacey did nothing of the sort, and a letter signed by Messrs. Brown and Broad was tendered to the Minister, in which they show that their contract was not made with Mr Stacey at all, b u t with Commander Burford, who was his superior officer at the time. The letter reads as follows: 2nd December, 1914. you that your tender for painting and carpentering work on transport A37 has been accepted, and you are directed to proceed with the work immediately. G BURFORD, Commander R.N.R., Superintending Transport Officer. It will thus be seen that this contract was made, not with Stacey, but with ComÂ» mander Burford, the Naval Officer at Brisbane. Clear and specific evidence on the point was given to the Minister, who was asked to reconsider his decision, and to withdraw his finding against this man. He declined, however, to do so, and Stacey",18,Meningitis Bas E Hospital Impor Tation Of Defence Experts Federa L Capital City Design Nation Al Monument To Fallen Soldiers Nam

62,Mr Groom,"Mr Jensen, the thenhas l e f t the country with this stigma resting upon him . It is unjust that, in public documents, such findings should stand on record against h i m , when they are shown to be contrary to evidence. I have no interest in this matter other than the desire that justice should be done, and I have no personal knowledge of Stacey. It was represented to me that he had been treated unjustly, and, on the facts put before me, it seemed to me that his case needed to be ventilated. now to another extraordinary point of this matter. The Minister for the Navy reportedI find that, from the evidence taken, large point, I think, quantities of timber, amounting to over Â£2,000, in the A37 were supplied by Brown and Broad. It was Mr Staccy's duty to keep a sharp looksidered this man's case, and where out, and see that all the timber required was of the quality it represented to be. I And, as a fact, that he did not. I refer to pages 24 and 25 of the evidence. Mr Campbell, in giving evidence on page 24, states that he had looked through the accounts, which do not show second class timber, and yet he is prepared to swear that 50 per cent, of the timber was second class. That report was dated 21st A p r i l , and on 31st May last Mr Maeandie, the Naval Secretary, wrote to Messrs. Brown and Broad Limited as followsAs regards the accounts for fitting up AST, I am to invite your attention to the statement of your Mr Brown at the recent inquiry held regarding this ship, that a quantity of second class timber had been placed on board, and also to the evidence generally regarding the supply of second class timber to the ship. As your accounts for A37 contain charges only in respect of first class timber, the Department is not prepared to pay them as rendered. Subsequently the Department looked into tiie whole matter, with the result that, on l l t h June, 1915, the following letter was addressed by the Naval Secretary to Messrs. Brown and BroadWith reference to my letter of 31st May, I very much regret that an error has occurred in connection with the scrutiny of accounts for AST, and it is found that second class timber has been charged for in the accounts. Here was a complete reversal of the whole position of the DepartmentI therefore request that you will consider the above-mentioned letter as cancelled, as it is quite plain that second class timber was included in the account, not first-class timber alone, as my letter stated. . . . And yet Mr Stacey was dismissed. not going fully into this case now. There are other facts which could be brought out. Afr. Groom. whether or not Mr Stacey had disobeyed the instruction with reference to preference to unionists. On that question a great deal of evidence was taken, and I should have liked to have seen the papers bearing upon it , in order to satisfy myself. Mr Stacey denies the charge, and there is no doubt a conflict of evidence on the point. It is contended by him that the allegations that he w i l f u l ly disobeyed the in I come structions of the Minister by employing non-unionists, and that he allowed second class timber to be charged as first class, are without foundation. The latter is clearly shown. In the circumstances, therefore, the Minister might fairl y have reconi t had been shown that the charges made against him were not in accordance w i th fact, he should have been prepared to admit it . A Minister suffers no loss of dignity in admitting that a mistake has been made. If a Minister finds that a report is wrong, he should not hesitate to admit it . A f t e r all, it is more important that justice should be done than that any mere question of dignity should be considered. I have not heard the Minister's explanation, but it seems to me that he might well have acceded to this man's request ""that the inquiry should be re-opened. Notwithstanding the facts contained in the documents to which I have referred, the Ministerf or the Navy replied to this request, "" I do not in tend to re-open this inquiry, and my decision given must stand."" That was his attitude, although there were on the Departmental files papers showing that his findings were contrary to fact, and that, while those findings remained on record, a permanent injustice was being done to the man concerned. As the Ministerf or the Navy is not present, I shall not deal at this stage with other facts relating to this case. I have availed myself of the first opportunity to bring the matter before the House and the country. I admit that I am putting it , at the present stage, only from the point of view of the man against whom these charges were made, and I recognise that both sides of a case must be looked into, in order that justice may be done. But it seems I am to me that tEe documents on the file are such that a judicial tribunal would declare that a primd facie case had been A third point involved was as to made out for further investigation.

By so doing he will oblige me very much, and will do justice to the man concerned. sire to say a few words upon a matter connected with the Expeditionary Forces whicli has been causing myself and others a good deal of concern. I refer to the great amount of sickness amongst the troops at the front. Even allowing for the somewhat unusual hardships which the men are undergoing, the .amount of sickness is altogether out of reason, and the nature of that sickness provides cause for serious thought. have heard replies to inquiries in this House which I have no hesitation in saying are altogether misleading. Honourable members have been told that no cases of typhoid have occurred at the front. I have good reason to believe that, in spite of the use of difThe importance of the matter will justify ferent serums, there have been many cases of typhoid and other diseases, of which the injection of serum was supposed to be an absolute preventive. I have reason to believe also that there are in the medical branch of the service experts who condemn the general application of these serums to our soldiers. I have not sufficient details to permit me to elaborate the subject at length, but it is a fact that many of our troops who were almost entirely healthy until the in protest. jection of the serum collapsed in wholesale numbers soon afterwards. It is said by those who favour inoculation that the ill ture ago. health is only temporary, but, having regard to the formidable lists of sick men, I am afraid that the ill-health is more serious than the military authorities would have us believs. I desire the Government to endeavour to ascertain the real opinion of medical men associated with the Expeditionary Forces regarding the efficacy of inoculation. medical men condemn the methods that have been adopted, and I think the subject is of sufficient importance to justify searching inquiries that will get past the inevitable and insurmountable blocking of members who seek the truth in these matters. There is too much throwing of dust in the eyes of the public and members of Parliament by the responsible men at the head of affairs in the Defence Department, and I am getting very tired of such treatment. I much regret that the Minister of Defence is not a member of this House, which is directly responsible for the management of defence matters. It is undoubtedly very difficult to get anything like directness of dealing, owing to the Minister of Defence being a member of another place. However, I ask the Treasurer to get into communication with the Minister, point out the inordinate amount of sickness amongst the troops, and ask him to have inquiry of a confidential character among the various medical men associated with the Forcesi n regard to inoculation as a preventive of disease. I do not wish to express my personal opinion on that method of treatment, but I believe that some of the mediI cal authorities regard it as being open tc very serious objection. I only ask that the Department shall ask for the opinion of those who are qualified to give it , and to ask for that opinion in such a way that medical officers shall not be placed at a disadvantage with their superior officers. the Government giving it immediate attention.

I maintain that these lads are not physically capable of enduring the strenuous work of a campaign. Many of them are not receiving proper preparation for the task they will have to perform. I know of a .lad of eighteen years and five months who presented himself at Victoria Rarracks as a recruit for the artillery section.

The apprenticeship phase of this question should appeal to honourable members opposite.

I am a member of the Public Works Committee, but I claim the right to express m y opinion on such matters as these on the floor of the House. Some Ministers, and perhaps some honourable members, seem to think that they have arrived at a happy solution of the difficulties of supervision in connection with Defence expenditure when they have imported from another part of the world & man who is called an expert. We have seen some o i those experts, and I would much prefer a practical man if he has proper lines upon which he can work.

In conclusion, I hope that there will be the strictest inquiry into the Naval Bases, and that we shall see that the money is wisely spent upon them. A t this time of stress, when we are asking people to pay' taxes and make sacrifices, we must be careful in regard to our expenditure. I hope also that Ministers will proceed cautiously in regard to the retention of some of the experts already in the Commonwealth, and in regard to the importation of others. [4.50] I join with those who have urged the Government to pause before either pulling down the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow and removing the plant to Canberra, or embarking on a very much larger proposition of building an enormous establishment with the necessarily complicated plant that will be required, and the certainty of having no output from it within eighteen months from the present time. I could understand the attitude of the Government if there was any reasonable possibility of these works being constructed in time to give us the output in need of which we so sadly stand; but we have only to consider how long Ministers took to realize their responsibilities in regard to working a second shift at the Lithgow Factory to see how hollow their protestations are in this regard. Having been associated for the greater part of my life with a district in which the mining industry is carried on, it was always a matter of wonder to me why they should have taken so long to come to a decision in the matter. I had an opportunity of visiting Lithgow a little while ago, and of seeing the marvellous machinery there, and I must say that the work that is being done is of a very high character. We have had no complainfs from the f r o n t in regard to the quality of the output. To my mind, the only trouble is the remarkable slowness with which results are produced. do what we desire to do in the present war, the question of cost need not be considered so much as speed of production. That is the point which is of vital interest, and which justifies the cost, or proves the downfall of those who f a i l to take advantage of their opportunities. Something has been said with regard to the manner in which the Defence Department has treated those who have suffered, are suffering, or are liable to suffer, from cerebro-spinal meningitis. I am astounded at the ignorance among some professional men as to the prevalence of this disease and its existence amongst us for so long a period, because a leading Collins-street practitioner has informed me that for two years before the war broke out he was never without a case of cerebro-spinal meningitis on his list. been a very grave suppression of information. notifiable disease. Medical practitioners cannot be blamed in the matter. They are not expected to notify a disease, even though it be contagious, so long as it is not on the list of notifiable diseases. notifiable disease if it was so prevalent as the statement of that medical practitioner would indicate? the honourable member will not read into ray remarks a construction which they were not intended to convey. I did not say that cerebro-spinal meningitis was prevalent. I said that it was existent for two years before the outbreak of the war. Cases were occurring in Melbourne and its suburbs constantly. Honourable members seem to lose sight of the fact that it is really not a disease so much as it is a complication or sequel of other diseases. In many cases where the primary cause of death was certified as pneumonia, the real cause of death was cerebro-spinal meningitis supervening on pneumonia. Thus we can realize how the existence of the disease escaped public notice, although it was known to medical practitioners of the standing of the gentleman to whom I have just referred. I am glad to note that the State Government of Victoria are awakening to a proper sense of their responsibilities in this regard, because the State Department of Public Health, on And the cost. the recommendation of the departmental If we are to Medical Committee, has issued a very terse and significant leaflet, copies of which I should be pleased to see sent broadcast throughout the Commonwealth.

In this leaflet the whole paring myself for any military work that matter is brought up to date, technical terms are avoided, and the language is so simple that it can be easily understood. A proper consideration of it would set the public mind at rest. My main point is that this is not primarily a disease. It is often the sequel to, or complication upon, another disease. carrying the germs for days, weeks or months, and not contract the disease, but may convey it to others whose conditions are more favorable for its reception. That this statement is true is proved by the fact that, though a large number of cases were being treated in Melbourne in general hospitals-isolated , of course, from ordinary cases-in no case was it communicated to any of the nurses. Certainly, in one case, it was communicated to a medical man at the Base Hospital, who sacrificed his life in the interests of gendered by the statement that my selecscience, and who, through overwork, anxiety, and responsibility, was so run down that ho became, a suitable subject for it . Wright, was a distinguished member of his profession. promise, he laid down his life with just as much devotion and heroism as has been displayed on the field of battle. pital brings me to my own connection with it , and a few words of explanation may not be out of place from me. Of course, during the time. I was in charge of the institution I was prevented by the militarv regulations from communicating anything to the press, or even to Parliament, except through the recognised official channel. My appointment was not a matter of favour. It was not, as was suggested in another place, because of some social influence that I possessed, or some outside position which I hold, that I was dragged out of the ordinary citizen occupation and given a position of great trust and grave responsibility. As a matter of fact, the reason for my appointment was that which was stated by the honourable member for Ballarat the other night. I was appointed because I was next on the list for such an appointment. For more than twenty years 1 had been a member of the Defence Forces of Australia, having joined under the old volunteer system. I was not paid for my services in the early part of my military career,.but I felt that I would be doing my duty by that means in premight be required at some future time. For over twenty years I was an effective member of the Force, keeping my attendances and doing my work. I attended camps, where, more than once, I was in complete and sole medical control, and I was second in command of the largest light People may be horse camp ever held in Victoria, if not in Australia. In addition. I had to pass examinations to secure promotion "" I am not going to give the marks obtained at those examinations, both written and oral, but on presenting myself for examination for Major, and subsequently the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, I obtained sufficient marks to entitle me to be recorded as "" highly distinguished "" in both courses. This explanation should dispose once and for all of any suspicion that may have been ention was unfair or improper. But there is something more that I would urge. It is that I am the product of the military This medical man, Captain system of Australia, the product of the citizen soldier system. I am not, and A young man, f u l l of never desired to be, a professional soldier, but, as a citizen, I have recognised, and endeavoured to do, my military duty. I have done this in an unobtrusive fashion, Reference to the Base Hosnever appearing in uniform except when on duty, and never using my military title except when doing my military work. The Clerk of the House can tell you, Mr. Speaker, that many years ago he asked me if I desired my name to be recorded in the proceedings of this House with the military rank to which I was entitled, and I said, "" Certainly not."" That is the attitude that I have always adopted, and I suppose it is why some persons were surprised'to learn that I had any military status, knowledge, or training. I wish to impress it on honourable members that if ihere were any want of knowledge, training, or capacity, it would be the system, not the individual, that should be blamed. I do not wish to blow my own trumpet, but in my life there has not been a thing that I have taken in hand in which I have failed, and it is not likely that the word "" f a i l u r e "" would be written over this particular work. I resigned my position, not because of ill-health, but because my constituents desired me to place mv services at their disposal in the referendum campaign. I had reluctantly to choose between two duties, and I felt that my duty to my country was higher than my duty to the military authorities. willingly, I asked to be relieved of work with which I considered it to be a high privilege to be associated. I leave it to those who haye succeeded me to say whether it was or was not properly carried out. I askhonorable members to try to realize what they are doing before they indulge in criticism based largely on ignorance. They may see an onnortunity to tilt at one who is not a member of the party to which they belong, but they should consider whether they may not thus injure a principle which some of them hold very dear. I have been astounded at the remarks about some of those who have qualified by sacrifice and service for military employment. When the War Committee was being appointed, I heard a distinguished member of this House say that, in his opinion, no man of military experience should be a member of it . He was a candidate for election to the Committee, and seemed to think it of importance to disclaim military experience. be a maxim with some persons that the less you know about a matter the more competent you are to discuss it . tinguished member to whom I am referring would be the last who would support such a dictum. period of our national and of our military history, and I ioin with the honourable member for Maribyrnong in asking that more confidence be placed in our own men; in those who have been trained here, and know what Australian conditions are.

Why should there be an over-mastering desire to send abroad for everything that we require of special excellence? turns down Australian inventions, which the British War Office accepts. that has happened. I do not except any one from my criticism. It is a trite saying that distant fields appear greenest. No doubt they do. But we should not belittle what is of our own manufacture or production. When we read of the magnificent heroism, the unmatched bravery, and, above all, the marvellous initiative displayed hy our men on tbe field of battle, we should take heart, and acknowledge that, under proper conditions, we Therefore, most unmay produce here those who can be looked to, in the future, to uphold the best traditions of our magnificent Empire. am pleased that the Minister of Home Affairs is here, because I wish to have his attention for what I am about to say, and, as a business man, he is likely to do things. Much has been spoken in this chamber concerning defence matters. We have heard eulogy of our troops, and many complaints have been voiced. I suggest that, in addition to everything that we may do now for those who are fighting, we might also, in the near future, take into consideration the advisability of reserving at the Federal Capita] a site for a national monument to those who have fallen. suggestion. It will be carried out. few days at the Federal Capital, enjoying its beautiful scenery and magnificent climate. On a hill, not far from Mount Ainsley, looking south and west towards the mountains, is the site reserved for a town hall, and one of the best in the Territory. If my suggestion is entertained, I think that we might well erect on this site a national monument after the fashion of the Arch of ""Victory erected We are at a crucial by the Germans after their war with France in 1870 and 1871, or like the Statue of Liberty at New York, which will stand for all time. The work could be paid for out of the public funds, or raised by a public subscription, and the monument could face the mountains, or look towards the heart of Australia. At all events, we should perpetuate for all time the memory of the events that are now happening, and erect a memorial to last through the ages in recognition of the bravery of the Australians who have Department fought and died for their country. I think, too, that in the naming of the streets of the Federal Capital we might well remember the pioneers of the Federal movement. the streets after the members of the Federal House. that.

There are men like the Chief Justice of the High Court, and the late Sir Henry Parkes, whose names, I think, should be associated with the Federal Capital. We should not take names from other countries when we can recognise in this way the services of our own people. I trust that my suggestions w ill be considered worthy of consideration. -The suggestion of the honourable member for Bendigo regarding the naming of the streets of the Federal Capital is a good one, but it seems to me that we should do better to choose well-sounding native names, and thus perpetuate the memory -and the ideas of the Australian aboriginals whom we have displaced. We are doing well in Queensland in adopting, for new railway stations, wherever possible, local aboriginal names, and as we cannot be proud of our treatment of the original inhabitants of Australia, the least we can do is to perpetuate their memory and their ideas. of the aboriginal names are very expressive, and could well be made to serve for the streets of the Federal Capital. Some of the members of this Parliament may consider that their names should be immortalized, but future generations may not have the exalted idea of either the ability or honour of these gentlemen that they have themselves. Names are likely to be forgotten. Reputations are very ephemeral. easy for a man to be popular for one day and shortly afterwards to be so badly forgotten that, unless his name is attached to his portrait, nobody recognises it . Some time ago, visitors wandering round the Queen's H a l l admiring certain productions/ artistic and otherwise, were heard to ask who the' various protraits were supposed to represent. Now that the names are attached, it is easy to pick the various individuals out. But every time. I look at that portrait gallery I am reminded of an old piece of poetryDante we know because he's tab-eared, Virgil wo know by his wreath; Old Homer we know by his wide, shaggy beard, And the rest by the names underneath. And that is about the only claim to fame many politicians have. In any case, the present generation of Federal members is not likely to be in danger of having such honours as those suggested by the honourable member thrust upon it , unless the Minister of Home Affairs is going to put more go into the actual building of the Capital than has been put into it during the past two or three years. ber say what feature of the city the M i nister is likely to call "" Archibald. "" more than likely that the Archibald Avenue will bisect the O'Malley Circus. But we are muddling along in the building of the Capital city. Honourable members are very comfortable in Melbourne, and many reasons, particularly the scarcity of money, might be urged in favour of suspending work there. But I suggest to the Minister that it is time something was done to push along, and the first step is for the Department, or the Parliament, or the Government, to arrive at some definite, clear, and final position with regard to the city design. Up to the present time, no decision that gives a final approval to any particular Some city design has been come to. Although Mr Griffin's design received the first prize, and has been subsequently altered to meet local conditions, the best that we have arrived at so far is that one modification of the original design is generally accepted as the basic plan for the Capital city. It seems to me that the time has arrived when we should know definitely, distinctly, and finally, which plan contains the design that is to be the basis of It is very the city. When that has been done, I would suggest that the building be entirely removed from Ministerial control. I have such a profound conviction that the Federal Capital wil l be a satisfactory centre of political and social activity, that I am convinced, if a scheme is properly organized, that the area is capable not only of making itself pay, but of providing money for its own completion and extension. If a board consisting of three capable men, with f u l l local powers of construction and expansion, were appointed to work out the city design, and given an advance loan of Â£2,000,000, in annual instalments of Â£500,000, within a very short period, the revenues from the Territory would be sufficient to meet the futur e needs of the city.

[5.31] -The Prime Minister has made it perfectly clear that the only matter now before the House is the repeal of the writs for the referenda. That is the only question with which we are concerned, and I imagine that every honourable member, no matter on what side of the House he sits, will give the B ill his most cordial and hearty concurrence. In my judgment, it will save this country from what undoubtedly would have been, in this time of war, a national scandal. very glad that the proposal for the referenda has been withdrawn. I have no intention of discussing the merits of the questions that were involved in the remission which was to be made to the people on the occasion of the referenda. But since the power to initiate proposed amendments of the Constitution is by the Constitution itself vested in this Parliament, I think it is due to the public that one should enter some protest against the use of sub-section x x x v i i . of section 51, in stead of tlie popular provisions of the Constitution, contained in section 128, for the purpose of the transfer of general powers. I emphatically draw a distinction between general powers, which are exceedingly comprehensive, and the transfer of a specific matter from the States to the Commonwealth under I claim the right to speak to this question, because, in the Federal Convention, I drew attention to the possibility of sub-clause XXXVII . of clause 51 being abused, and used for purposes for which it was not intended. Honourable members are aware that, prior to Federation, we had a Federal Council of Australia. It was formed, I think, about 1884 or 1885. I remember writin g on the subject when I was waiting for ad; mission to the Bar. A proclamation by Queensland, making New Guinea a British protectorate, or sphere of influence for me Commonwealth, had not been altoA l l that I am doing gether adopted by the Imperial Government, and about 1883 or 1884, a meeting of State Premiers was called, out of which the Federal Council grew. It was established by delegations from the Parliaments of the States. Specific powers were to be given to this Federal Council, which was a body without executive and without finance. It had power only to pass laws that the States, which had delegated these powers to the Council, were expected to put into force. The provisions for the delegations from the State Parliaments, which were contained in the Federal CouncilA c t , were inapplicable, in my opinion, to a Constitution such as ours. When the Convention was sitting in Melbourne in February, 1898, attention was drawn to this somewhat incongruous sub-clause of clause 51. Mr. Deakin, while dealing principally with the question of finance, incidentally pointed out that it sqemed inconsistent with clause 121-no w section 128 of the Constitution -whicl i deals with the amendment of the Constitution. I interjected, "" Strike the sub-section o u t . "" Then the official report proceedsthe difficulty. laws under the sub-section.

I do not think that one can be blamed for statin^ his views on what has been done in regard to this matter, because the neonle look to us as the initiators of any amendments. As to the war power, if I could honestly see that these amendments were necessary to give the Government power which may not be exercised now, I would not for a moment oppose them, but I cannot for the life of me see where the lack of power exists. America, with less comprehensive power than is possessed by the. Commonwealth, President Lincoln stepped in and did what was necessary, and was able to carry a long war to a successful issue. They are able in Britain, without the exercise of powers other than -those we possess, to conduct war, and in an extraordinary emergency we, as they, could apply the conditions of martial law, and afterwards by a retrospective Imperial Act obtain an indemnity for what has been done. Such a necessity does not exist in Australia. We have never had martial law. and we do not want it . I would much nrefer the amendments to have gone to the people, even without further argument or elucidation, thus respecting the real intention of the Constitution, than that we should resort, even in the stress of a great war emergency, to the method of transferring powers which are utterly incongruous with sub-section x x x v i i . of section 51 of the Constitution. was never very much enamoured of this proposal, and after the proposal to withdraw portion of the B ill , and having listened to the speech of the honourable-member for Angas, I feel very insecure in regard to the attitude which is being adopted, and more than ever dissatisfied with the trend of events. from bhe honourable member for Angas that it is possible for the States to temporarily transfer these powers. other portion of his remarks he said that a transfer of the general powers could only be done technically, and that what was necessary to give proper weight and effect to the transference was a massed referendum, in order to ascertain the will of the people. I agree with the contention that the only way to ascertain the will of the people is by means of a massed referendum; but I suppose very few honourable members would advocate that course as a proper method of altering the Constitution, In fact, such a procedure is impossible under the Constitution, and the smaller States would take exception to such a method of settling these questions. The honourable member for Angas expressed the fear that this method of bargaining with the States is equivalent to going behind the backs of the people. That is exactly what I feel. The honourable member has said that for the life of him he cannot see that the Government Under the Constitution of cannot do everything under the War Precautions Act that they will be able to do by the proposed grant of powers. If that be so, the powers whioh we are supposed to get from the States really mean nothing to us. with regard to the war. upon which difference of opinion is likely to arise, and in regard to which the States are likely to make some alteration.

164,Mr Hampson,"We ought to benot the slightest doubt that when this agreement is discussed in the State Parliaments, they will endeavour to insert conditions that will l i m it the use of these powers to war purposes only. If the States, or some of them, do not carry out their part of this agreement, which we are told will grant f u l l powers to the Commonwealth apart from war purposes, in what position will the Commonwealth be? If the scheme miscarries so far as the State Parliaments are concerned, we shall have postponed the reference of these questions to the people for twelve months at least I should say that what is desired by the majority of honourable members on this side, and by the .Labour party generally, is that we should get these powers permanently, and as the referenda proposals are hot to be submitted in December, I think that a clear understanding with the States should have been arrived at, and announced to Parliament so that there could be no ambiguity and no mistake in future as to our attitude on the question. Thef u r ther the proposal goes the less I like it . I have no intention of offering any opposition to the measure; indeed, the measure is so obviously necessary, in view of the agreement that has been arrived at, that opposition to it would be altogether ridiculous. regret that the Prime Minister has agreed to eliminate paragraph 3 of the preamble. This is the first time in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament when a B i ll has been introduced to recall writs issued legally and properly for , an election or referendum. It is an unusual precedent, and people, particularly in the future, will naturally be anxious to know the reason why this method of procedure was adopted. The reason and justification for the B ill appears in this paragraph, which liaments for their acceptance or rejection. contains a plain statement of fact. It has no party colour, and no objectionable features, and yet the Prime Minister has agreed to withdraw it . We are all thoroughly well aware that the only reason for the introduction of the Bill is conwill have been kept; but if the measures tained in the words it is proposed to delete. The objection raised by the Leader of the Opposition may be very satisfactory from his own point of view. I quite concur in the disappointment felt by honourable members opposite at not being consulted in regard to the agreement, but that was not the faul t of the Prime Minister, [271]2 or of the Government, or of honourable members on this side. The Premiers of the States, who are responsible governing authorities, collaborated with the responsible governing authorities here, and arrived at a legitimate, proper, and reasonable method of procedure. If the Opposition here, and the Opposition parties in the State Houses, were not consulted, it may be regrettable, but I do not think that that is a sufficient justification for the elimination of the reason for this unusual measure. I do not wish to enter into a discussion of the virtues or vices of the agreement. I believe that the agreement is a very honourable and satisfactory method of arriving at a common understanding at this particular juncture, and I cannot see why any exception should be taken to a plain statement of facts. I regret very seriously that the Prime Minister has agreed to the elimination of the words. I regret that the Prime Minister, on the spur of the moment, should have agreed to strike out these words; and I shall vote for their retention. words are in order, because, in my opinion, they are not relevant to the Bill. only reason for the introduction of the B ill .

W it h these exceptions the whole of the proposals go before each of the State ParThis, in my opinion, represents absolutely the irreducible minimum, so far as the members of the Labour party are concerned. If the measures are passed by the State Parliaments then the compact are amended or rejected it will be competent for this Parliament to simply take up the proposals where they were l e f t , and, as soon as possible, whether the war be over or not, to submit them to the people.

No lawyer would say for one moment that the preamble of the B ill can have any legal effect. It The may be looked at, but it cannot affect the position; at any rate, the preamble to this B ill cannot. Now, I wish to state the position in the light in which, as it appears to me, honourable members on the Opposition side of the chamber regard it . They have been, as is well known, opposed to the amendment of the Constitution as submitted by us-som e of them were in favour of certain of these proposed amendments of the Constitution, some of them were opposed to any amendment, and all of them were opposed to the submission of the proposed laws to the people at the present time. The Agreement which has been arrived at by myself, on behalf of the Government, and the States, whereby the States agree to hand over to the Commonwealth the powers asked for with such limitations as are set out in the Agreement is completely repropositiona proposition moved from this arena. For this Agreement honourable members opposite are not responsible-the majority of them do not believe in it . The Government have entered into this Agreement, and is now doing that which is necessary to give effect to their part of it , by postponing the referendum, provided the States would give the Commonwealth the powers agreed upon. In order to do this it is necessary to withdraw the writs; otherwise a poll must be taken. I give the honourable member for Maribyrnong my assurance in a most positive way-and it w ill be in dorsed by every lawyer in the Housethat the excision of the words suggested can have no bearing whatever on the Agreement between this Government and the States. If it did, I should not agree to the proposed amendment. The preamble to the B ill which is to be in troduced into the State Legislatures to give effect to the States' part of the Agreement recites a number of I see nothing in the B ill to facts which have been agreed upon, and the Bills to be introduced are in a form which has been agreed upon.

I discussed with those who were competent to discuss it the advisableness of a grant of powers from the States to the Commonwealth, when the representatives of the States approached me with the request that I should so discuss it . The Agreement has been arrived at. Two State Parliaments, have already taken steps to carry out their part of it . The others w ill shortly follow. The honourable and learned inember for Angas has expressed doubt as to what subsection xxxvii. of section 51 was in tended to do. In his view the Convention never intended that such a use should be made of the provision; but every, lawyer knows perfectly well that the benevolent intentions of the framers of legislation are quite immaterial ; what is material is what the actual section or sub-section says. In this case the sub-section is perfectly clear. The States are clothed with ample power to do what they have agreed to do. While I agree with my honourable and learned friend as to the methods contemplated by the framers of the Constitution to be pursued in amending the Constitution, nevertheless sub-section x x x v i i . of section 51 does provide ample and sufficient means by which the States can clothe the Commonwealth with any powers they please. amendment of the Constitution ? one knows also that there is another method, namely, an amendment of the Constitution Act by the British Parliament. However, I leave the matter there. I am satisfied that there is no other way by which a temporary alteration to the Constitution could be made than by the one proposed. The Constitution does not contemplate it , nor provide for it , except in this way. It is the only way by which we can get a temporary grant of these powers any facts. during the war and for twelve months afterwards. I do not propose to discuss the Therefore, I hope matter any further, except to say to those who have taken exception to the suggestion to amend the preamble that such an alteration will in no way affect the validity of the measure or the Agreement arrived at between the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the Premiers of the several States.

I understand that objection has been raised to the statement of the fact that a certain arrangement has been made between the Commonwealth and the States. I am quite satisfied with the explanation that has been given, as I am also satisfied with the proposal to supend the taking of the referenda poll; because, as the honourable member for Perth has interjected, there were some doubts as to what the result would be if we submitted these alterations to the Constitution to the vote of the people, but now there is no doubt as to the result. We are about to remit these matters, by agreement, to the Legislative Councils of the States, and, of course, we may be quite sure they will give us all the powers that we desire. Why refer these measures to the mass of the people when we do not know how they are likely to vote on them, or what we are going to get, when we can bo sure as to what we are going to get from the Tory Legislative Councils of the States? We should always withdraw proposals from the decision of the party of which we are not sure and entrust the decision to a party of which we are sure. For that reason we, as good Democrats, are withdrawing the referenda writs in . order that we may refer these matters to people who will not give us the powers we seek. Of course, we shall still be in the same, old, happy position of being able to blame some one else, and of resting the responsibility on some one other than ourselves. I am perfectly satisfied that there could not be any better arrangement, because every honourable member opposite is agreeable to it. When I see the Leader of the Opposition agreeable to this proposal, I feel that I must be on good, safe Democratic ground. When I read in the newspapers that the honourable member for Flinders and the honourable member for Balaclava have been conferring with the PrimeM i nister and settling this matter, and are supporting the agreement arrived at, I know that we must be quite right in accepting it .

This is only one objection to the proposal. The Minister told us that, on account of the large amount of money involved, it would be quite possible that a low-level bridge would have to be constructed over the Katherine River. tions, a low-level bridge is a mistake. A low-level bridge crossing a coastal river where the flow is great lasts t ill the first flood. is small, the bridge is under water often for days, sometimes for weeks. So that, in one case, a low-level bridge is useless for a long period, and in the other case it is an absolute danger. what kind of river the Katherine is. but, from its geographical position, I should assume it to be a alow-running flood river like those so common in the inland of Australia. flood sometimes. bridges over both classes of rivers, and in both they were dismal failures. I hope the Government will not for a moment consider the establishment of such a bridge over the Katherine. We were also told last night that wooden sleepers cannot be used because of white ants, and the Minister stated that he would advocate steel sleepers. But, he added, owing to war conditions, the cost of such sleepers would be twice as much as in normal times. It is not likely that this line will carry other than a very light traffic for many years to come, so that there will be great difficulty in making it pay undar any circumstances, even if erected in the cheapest manner possible; and that argument seems to me to be sufficient to just if y the postponement of the line. chief reason advanced for the continuation of this work just now, however, was that there are 400 or 500 immigrants working on this line, for whom further employment must be found. The argument that we must construct this railway because there are several hundred immigrants from Patagonia, very few of whom can even speak English, strikes me as being very The weak. They may be good men or not, but it is a very wrong principle that, at the present time, we should spend money that might be used for the defence of Australia, in keeping 400 or 500 polyglot imI have already migrants from South America working in the Northern Territory. the responsibility of having brought them here. that responsibility, there should be any amount of occupations calling for men where they will be of use in meeting the Under any condigreat crisis before us.

That argument alone should be sufficient to warrant the postponement of the measure. So much money is required for other things which, under present conditions, are more urgent than this, that I intend to vote against this B ill by way of protest against misdirected expenditure.

But I would point out to honourable members that the bridge across the Katherine River, originally estimated to cost Â£100,000, will be replaced by this low-level bridge, which is to cost only Â£1,900, so that a very considerable saving of the public funds will be effected, and a bridge constructed that will be quite sufficient for ordinary purposes.

208,Mr Finlayson,"In view of theof the north-south railway, this section is necessarily required. Whether we should now proceed with its construction is open to argument; but there can be no question that, sooner or later, for strategic reasons, as well as for developmental purposes, the line from north to south will have to be built. only from the north, but also from the southern end. alone being referred to the Public Works Committee for report, the Minister of Home Affairs should be expected, when the House meets next year, to table a proposal to refer to the Committee, or to a committee of experts, the whole question of railway connection from north to south, so that we may have an understanding clear and distinct as to what is to be done between Oodnadatta and Bitter Springs. Such a line would involve an expenditure that would not be justifiable at present. Buti f gradually and steadily, rather than spasmodically and erratically as at present, we build this line, continuing each year, section by section, in an orderly and systematic manner, the construction of the north-south railway, the whole question will be settled satisfactorily a few years hence, and we shall be sure of protection as far as such a railway is able to afford it . As to the particular section immediately under consideration, honourable members might be advised that the line, as far as it has been built, is not of much use. It is clearly stated in the reports that from Darwin to the Katherine River, and particularly from Pine Creek to Katherine, the country is rather poor. Pine Creek is the present terminus, and, although I have not been there, I , like other honourable members, am sufficiently well acquainted with the literature on ths subject to be able to say that from Pine -Creek to the Katherine River is the poorest part of the Territory between Darwin and Bitter Springs. In the immediate vicinity of the Katherine, and thence on to Bitter Springs, there is splendid pastoral and mining country. capacity ? it is one beast to the square mile. be proud of; yet the estimated revenuederivable principally, if not entirely, from cattle traffic-fro m this section of the line is about Â£12,000 per annum. The best pa&toral country is south and south-west of the Katherine River. It is well understood that the cattle traffic over the section between Bitter Springs and th? Katherine River, and along to Port Darwin, to supply the new meat works now nearly completed, will provide by far the major portion .of the revenue. long way. now, when things are so dear? vanced is that it will provide work for the men already there. That is why the B ill has been brought forward by the Minister without waiting for a report from the Public Works Committee. On tliat phase of the question I expressed my views last week. If this expenditure is to be in curred only to provide employment, it is had business. Unless there is some better purpose to be served, and greater good to be achieved, then the expenditure of Â£320,000 on the line just now is not warranted. But the point to be remembered is that the proposal is to extend the present line into country offering some prospect of revenue, whereas if the line stops at the Katherine there w i ll be no such prospect. the additional 65 miles? here is business lying open to the railway. The extension towards the south will open up fresh country and induce new the settlement. Some two years ago the Government bought a number of sheep, and, by way of experiment, took them from Avon Downs to Bitter Springs. The reports received show that the experiment has proved very satisfactory. The sheep have been there now for nearly two years. They seem to be becoming acclimatized very well indeed, so that if the line is extended there is a prospect of encouragement being offered to sheep farming in this particular locality. The water supply and grasses are good, and there is good W h a t is its carrying open-timbered country. There are no engineering difficulties, so that there is everything to induce us to extend the line. The estimated ordinary running expenditure is about Â£11,800, and the estimated T h a t is nothing to revenue about Â£ i 2 , 0 0 0 . That does not allow a very big margin. The estimate of expenditure does not include interest on the capital cost of construction. The Commonwealth Government, however, can",40,Katherineriver To Bitte R Springs Railwaybill Second Reading

In view of an early adjournment, the House ougnt to be furnished with some information as to the intentions of the Government during the long recess. We have been fifteen months at war, and up to the present we have been told very little as to what has been done in the way of turning out shells, heavy guns, anil so for t h , so tliat we might do our proper share in the prosecution of the war. We have it from the Minister of Home Affairs that it is intended to establish an arsenal on Federal Territory; but we have also been made aware that there is no reasonable probability of that arsenal being available during the present crisis unless length. We have no evidence of any serious endeavour on the part of the Government to get into communication with the various factories all over Australia, with a view to the turning out of munitions. Our expenditure, as already pointed out, is very nearly Â£2,000,000 a week, and considerably over Â£1,000,000 a week is devoted to the war. It is probable that Â£1,000,000 diverted to the assistance and organization of the factories already in existence would mean the production of large quantities of shells. What we have failed to do is to show our adaptability in this great national crisis-to devote the existing machinery actively to the manufacture of munitions of If that were war. In the Allied and enemy countries, this production has'been multiplied many times over, not because of new machinery, but because of the utilization of the existing machinery ; and, in this reI should like the Treagard, we have been woefully lacking in Australia. It is the duty of the Government to get into communication with those interested in the great factories here, and arrange, if necessary, to in demnify them against loss after the war, so that there may be sufficient inducement to t u r n out the required material. It is, as I have already said, a great-reUnder all the flection on Australia that steps in this direction have not been taken already.

I sincerely hope that, before we separate, some statement will be made on behalf of the Government, showing what is proposed in this regard. We are proud of our young men, who, reared in an atmosphere of peace, have set an example of bravery and self-reliance to the whole world. But, as stated over and over again, the men in the workshops engaged in the manufacture of munitions are just as much at war as are those on the battle-field. It is in this latter respect that we have failed, because the necessary initiative in organization has not been shown by the Government. criticising generally the work of the Defence Department, which has undertaken a huge task, and, under all the circumstances is carrying out a great work.

Time is the essence of the contract; and we must, as speedily as possible, increase our production of munitions of war. It is estimated that, with a complete new Factory at Canberra, we are not likely to get additional rifles under two years; so that there is considerable advantage on the side of manufacture at the present Factory at Lithgow. There seems to be some doubt as to whether there is to -be an immediate start made with the Factory at Canberra; but even' if there were, about two years must elapse before it could be in operation.

242,Mr Hampson,"We are asked t ober give me the opportunity of explaining? [ 9 . 3 ] f u l for in regard to the consideration that has been extended to me by honourable members. The criticisms that have been offered, on the whole, have not been very adverse. In fact, they have been f u l l of complimentary references, which have been a little embarrassing at times, especially when the honourable member for Bourke has been in the chamber. I moved the motion, I did not give much information, partly because I had not had and partly because I was under the impression that honourable members wished to get nearly all the business done this evening. Until 1 o'clock to-day I did not know that the Prime Minister was going to the Old Country, and at that hour I had to ask the Treasury officers to prepare two Supply Bills, one covering sixteen pages, dealing with the ordinary expenditure; the other covering about five pages, dealing with the expenditure on new works and buildings. The Leader of the Opposition has asked how much money has been voted for the current financial year. SupplyB ill , Â£8,281,581 for ordinary services and war expenditure. In the next SupplyB ill we voted Â£15,745,469. the next B ill we voted Â£6,901,735, and now we are asking for Â£15,545,608, and if this amount is voted we shall have agreed to an expenditure of Â£46,474,393 for ordinary services and war expenditure. For the information of the honourable member for Bendigo, I shall read the abstract of the schedule in the B ill . information could have been supplied later. It was intended, in the Committee stage on the B ill , to give honourable members the opportunity of obtaining it ; but, since it has been asked for now, and in order to save time, I wish to say that Â£7,900 is set down for Parliament, including the salaries in connection with the Senate and House of Representatives, Library, gardens, &c. A sum of Â£82,240 is set down for the Department of the Treasury, covering the salaries for two months and embracing the cost of the administration of invalid and W ill the honourable memold-age pensions, war pensions, maternity allowance, and taxation offices. This vote, also includes the Government Printing Office and the office of the Governor General. For the Department of the A t torney-General, the sum of Â£12,570 is I have a great deal to be thankset down. I could take up the time of honourable members for an hour by dealing with the various items, but I do not think the honourable member for Bendigo will ask me to do that. When he gets the B ill he will see what the Government propose to do. In the meantime, it will be sufficient if I quote the abstract to the schedule. It reads as follows:WhenÂ£ The Parliament ... ... 7,900 The Department of Prime time to prepare it , Minister ... ... ... 8,945 The Department of the Treasury 82,240 The Attorney-General's Department ... ... ... 12,570 The Department of External Affairs ... ... ... 108.808 The Department of Defence ... 14,229,260 Tbe Department of Trade and Customs ... ... ... 88,745 The Department of Home Affairs 117,090 The Postmaster-General's Department ... ... ... 890,050 15,545.608 Refunds of Revenue ... ... 50.000 Advance to the Treasurer ... 650,000 Total 16,245,608 We voted, in the first The honourable member for Bendigo has said that it is not a business-like method of doing business to pass Supply Bills of In this kind and have no opportunity for criticism of the finances until the end of the financial year, when the money has nearly all been spent; but ever since I have been in Parliament the same exception has been taken to the method adopted by the Government in ofiice in presenting Estimates to Parliament. I surmose that all This Governments are alike. They bring in their Estimates as soon possible in order that there shall be the greatest opportunity for talk. It is perfectly legitimate for those who are outside the Government to offer as strong criticism as they can offer, but it has verlittle effect upon the Government: and the onK thing for honourable members who are supporting the Government to do is to trust it .

Besides this, we shall have voted for ordinary purposes Â£11,144,393 out of an estimated expenditure for the year of Â£12,628,405. It is impossible to give any detailed and definite items at this stage, partly because I have not had the time to obtain them, but more particularly because at this stage it is impossible to accurately estimate what our Naval and Military expenditure for the year will be. I stated the other evening that the British War Office is at present bearing the expense of maintaining our soldiers at Gallipoli, Alexandria, and in the hospitals on the Mediterranean, and will make a claim for reimbursement later. Of course, we do not know what that claim will amount to. I trust that honourable members will allow the Bil l to pass without much discussion. T promise them that they shall have the Estimates at the earliest possible date, and in time for the fullest consideration. Without doubt, the Prime Minister will afford them several days for a discussion of the various items.

But, having listened to this debate since its initiation, I have been disappointed by the absolute silence on the part of Ministerialists regarding the honourable gentleman's undoubted merits. has not been here. have not been travelling about the country with my qualifications painted on my bag. I deplore the change that is coming over the Treasurer.

But old habits are diffifacture of war munitions, and thus is not cult to put aside, and to-nieht, when invited by the honourable member for Bendigo to say something about his Estimates, he seemed to slide back into the I shall not. I ask practices of long ago, and said a good deal without explaining anything. He has It is only a fortnight, read to us the headings of the Estimates, as supplied by his secretary; but, regarding the financial situation generally, I Upon the passage am lef t with the feeling that he is as ignorant as I am. I would remind the honourable member for Bendigo that, it is not fair to ask a Treasurer to explain the finances of the country out of his own head. To any explanation of that kind an informal Board of permanent officers is necessary, and the preparation of documents, to be read in due course. I ask honourable members if it is not a fact that when the other evening the Treasurer was able to read his speech he was profoundly more interesting and illuminating than he has been to-night when extemporizing ? I do not wish the honourable gentleman to take that remark as a reflection upon his capacity. He is the only Treasurer since I have been a member of this House who has endeavoured to make a statement about the finances out of his own head, and it has been such a lamentable failure that I do not think it will ever be attempted again. As it is intended to adjourn early to-morrow, I shall not occupy much time now. I am prepared to trust the Government and the Treasurer. To the latter I am thankf u l for the promise that at the end of the financial year, when the money has all been spent, he will not introduce a B ill to prevent us from criticising what has been done. We are to have an opportunity of discussing the damage after it is over. No doubt, the honourable gentleman commences his Ministerial career with the best of intentions and supported with the best advice.

I am glad that the Government of New South Wales has shown a sense of responsibility and practical patriotism in this matter. We are not doing much in the manufacture of munitions, because the price offered for shell bodies is not high enough. It uas been demonstrated to me that they cannot be made for the money. As was well said to-night by the honourable member for Wimmera, the Government might well divert a great part of the money that is being voted, to encourage a number of private firms to undertake this work. Nothing is more important than that the war shall be brought to a successful issue, and that speedily. I strongly advocate special effort in this direction. But the Government, instead of helping in the process of annihilating the enemy, has emissaries abroad who are making foolish suggestions, and are thus retarding progress. posal to remove the Small Arms Factory to Canberra, with which I have had to deal ad nauseam, has interfered with the only manufacturing centre which is contributing to the supply of munitions. member must not discuss that matter, as it is set down on the business paper to be dealt with . it in support of my statement that the Government, instead of facilitating the output of arms and ammunition, has thwarted effort in that direction, and to show that Ministers are not alive to the necessity for the manufacture of death dealing weapons.

But I would like to remind the honourable member that one vote is worth a ton of it . moves that some of tliis money be spent on munitions I will support him. honourable friend would make several calculations before he did. We know him quite well by this time. The Treasurer has told us that for the ten months our total estimated outgoing is Â£46,000,000. A t that rate the total expenditure for the year will be a little over Â£55,000,000 for all purposes, excluding special appropriations, which amount to Â£12,000,000. If Â£12,000,000 is deducted from a total expenditure of Â£74,000,000 there will be a balance of Â£62,000,000. The Treasurer has just stated that our outgoing for the ten months is at the rate of Â£55,000,000 a year, so that there is a discrepancy somewhere. I have no doubt the figures The procan be put right on analysis, but they do not appear to be correct as they were given in the carefully-prepared statement by the Treasurer the other day, and as given in the total amount of the Supply Bills now submitted. What the explanation is I do not know. In the meantime I call attention to the item in the SupplyB ill for defence, which amounts to Â£14,250.000. That is at the rate of Â£7,000,000 a month, or Â£84,000,000 a I am merely mentioning year. cannot multiply Â£14,000,000 for the two months by six in order to get the year's total. We spent only Â£5.000,000 during the quarter commencing July and ending September.

275,Mr Joseph Cook,"I am not gothan the ordinary rate of expenditure for the year, we may find ourselves under the necessity of having to deal with heavy supplementary Estimates at the end of the year. What members want to know is whether the expenditure is within the year's estimates, or whether the estimates are beiug exceeded. Had the late Treasurer been here we should have expected bim to tell the country what effort he was making to economize on the ordinary expenditure. We cannot expect a statement from the honourable member on that score, though I trust he will look closely into the Estimates when he gets into his stride. There is nothing more subtle or insidious than the way departmental expenditures are piled up, unless strict and careful watch is kept over them. I never knew a Department that did not want a million or two more than it gets. As I have already said, the test is not so much what we can do with as what we can do without, while the war lasts. I should like the honourable member to reconcile the figures quoted in his recent statement with those presented to the House as covering the requirements of the year. His statement that Â£46,000,000 is required for ten months would indicate a yearly expenditure at the rate of Â£53,750.000, whereas the outgo should be Â£74,000,000, less the special appropriations. Â£5,000,000 or Â£6.000,000 to be accounted for. I suppose, however, we can get no more out of the honourable member. We have done our best, and we shall have to leave him at that. As a last word ITiope the Treasurer will devote himself to seeing whether this money is really required for the ordinary purposes of government, and whether it is not possible to greatly restrict the ordinary outgo in order that some of the special taxation imposed for war purposes may be appropriated to the relief of the burden shortly to be imposed upon the people of the country, and the obligations they will have to meet in days to come. A few days ago members had the opportunity of discussing the financial situature on Defence, a total of Â£46,474,393. tion upon the statement by the Treasurer which was supplementary to the statement made by the ex-Treasurer on 13th August last. I do not think it is necessary for me to deal with the general financial position to-night because of that. Under the present B ill the Treasurer is asking for Â£15,000,000, Â£13,000,000 of which is for the Expeditionary Forces, and the balance for other purposes. It is stated that this sum will carry our defence obligations to the end of the year. If it does, I think we may be satisfied. My own opinion is that the future expenditure on the war will be very much larger than it has been in the past. The number of men in the A r m y is increasing, and is considerably greater than it was when the estimate of Â£45,000,000-that is Â£38,000,000 for the Military and Â£7,000,000 for the Navyas the year's expenditure, was drawn up in August last. Many more men have enlisted. Men are being enlisted daily, and instead of Â£45,000,000 being sufficient to cover the obligations of the Expeditionary Forces, I am inclined to think the sum will have to be doubled next year if the war continues. This is the fourth provision we have made for the Expeditionary Forces during the present financial year. Tn the fir<>i Supply Bill for 1915-16, Â£5,000,000 was provided for them; in the second, Â£12,000,000; and in the third, Â£5,080,000; while in this case we are asked to vote Â£13,250,000-makin g a total of Â£35,330,000. It was estimated, on 12th August last, that the expenditure on the There will then be some Expeditionary Forces including the Navy-for the year would be Â£46,000,000. If that estimate proves correct, we shall thus need to provide nearly Â£11,000,000 more to carry us through to the end of the financial year; but, if we are fortunate, the Â£13,250,000 which we are passing to-night may prove sufficient. In addition to the amount provided for the Expeditionary Forces including the Navy, and excluding statutory appropriations and new worksa sum of Â£11,144,393-includin g the amount set apart in this Bill-ha s been voted for other purposes in connection with the current accounts of the year.

In respect of new works during the current financial year, we shall have provided for an expenditure of Â£3,629,686. In discussing this B ill , we have not cast upon us the duty of reviewing the financial position of Australia. We did that only a few days ago; and, seeing that of the expenditure for which this Bil l provides Â£13,250,000 is for the Expeditionary Forces, and Â£2,295,000 for other purposes of ordinary expenditure, our duty to-night is a very simple one. The Government must have this money in order to keep the Forces at the f r o n t prothe expenditure on stores, by enabling perly supplied. [9.50] A good deal has been said regarding the enormous amount which tlie Treasurer is asking the Committee to grant, and, as one who was in the first Federal Parliament, I feel inclined to rub my eyes and to wonder where I am when I look at these figures. We there dealt, in fear and trepidation, with an annual expenditure of some hundreds of thousands, whereas to-day honourable members seem to deal with an expenditure of many millions as airily as if they had no responsibility in the matter of where the money is to come from, and where it is to go. uttered by the Leader of the Opposition, nothing has been said as to the necessity for economy. I am not going to suggest that tlie people of Australia will expect us to be parsimonious in the expenditure of money for the successful prosecution of the war. They will be prepared, as the ex-Prime Minister said, to gwe their last shilling in order that the war may be brought to a successful termination ; but they will be prone to ask. and justified in asking, that there shall be some proper supervision over this expenditure. something which, perhaps, he knows already, but which I trust he will keep well in mind, and that is that the system we have adopted is a bad one. doing our duty by those who are going away to defend us and to maintain the integrity of the Empire, I am most anxious that we should remember also our duty to those who are providing the ways and means which we are at present discussing. ber point out any method by which we might exercise better supervision? point is that the means we have adopted for securing our supplies in times of peace are bad enough, but in time of war are absolutely ruinous. The process of requisition and of supply from either the Ordnance or Supply Department is radically wrong, and should not be allowed to continue. An ordinary business man would never think of following the methods that are being perpetuated by the Defence Department. "" The method of absolving from responsibility those on whom, undoubtedly, is cast the responsibility of them to shelter themselves behind the excuse that they have nothing whatever to do with the securing of those stores, can result only in wicked extravagance, ruinous loss, and very great danger of interference with efficiency. I do not know whether the Treasurer wants anything more than that : but I think I have said sufficient to indicate to him that he has among his many heavy duties one that will require all his energy, tact, and judgment to adequately discharge. The method to which I have referred is obsolete and extravagant. It is f u l l of circumlocution and red-tape. There is no short-cut for those anxious to do the work. In W it h the exception of the few words many cases the system has become so intolerable to men who desire to have supplies thai t iey are paying out of their own pockets for the things they urgently require rather than wait unti l the various branches of the Department satisfy the demands made upon them. That is the position which a cursory examination of the Defence Department discloses, and it exists to a much greater extent than I have indicated. I am sure that the Treasurer, with his zeal and his desire to do his duty to the people of Australia, will do his best to put an end to a system which, although it might have advantages I desire to tell the Treasurer in time of peace, when a leisurely course is possible, and with proper scrutiny is absolutely necessary, yet in such a time as this is opposed to all ordinary business While procedure, and will involve us in a terrible amount of expenditure, which, with proper precautions, could undoubtedly be avoided.",50,Departments Rifl E Ranges Supply

I in the construction of rifle ranges and in the provision made for rifle shooting generally. which is urgent more than another in this time of war, it is the provision of facilities for rifle practice. Y e t very little, if any, additional facilities are being offered for this important arm of defence. To-day, the Minister of Defence has an opportunity that, perhaps, will not occur again in a life-time. Always the amount of money available for expenditure on the construction of rifle ranges and the provision of facilities for rifle practice in ordinary times of peace is limited. But to-day our men are going to the f r o n t without having had sufficient practice with their rifles. MrW . ELLIOT JOHNSON -Some have not had any. that statement is only too true. If the war in Flanders has taught us one thing more than another it is the need that still exists for expert rifle shooting, as nothing prevented the Germans from through to the coast in the early stages of the war but the fifteen rounds of rapid fire from the rifles of the British Army. little book called.

It was the expert rifle shooting that kept the Germans back, and whatever may be done with machine gunsand I admit their worth-the time is not yet. when we can dispense with the individual rifle shots. But what are we doing in Australia ? L e t me state a concrete case, which I believe to be typical. In fron t of my residence, near Sydney, tliere is a rifle range, which, being in a deep gully, is very safe. I think it is equipped with two targets. the club any rifles? rifles, b u t there are only two targets to supply the men of the whole district with refer to the dilatoriness shown practice. The result is that the members of the club have a chance to shoot once in three months. Men are being sent to the f r o n t without practice. There, at a If there be one thing convenient place, is a range on which to erect targets, but I cannot induce the Department to put the targets there. There is no excuse for that neglect. The construction of targets is work which any ordinary man can do, b u t it is not being done. The trouble is becoming very serious. A littl e money spent in this way, and a littl e effort by the Defence Department, would increase immensely the efficiency of the Forces that are being sent to the front , I am afraid, all too sadly inefficient in the use of a most important arm of our Defence system. I should like to know from the Minister of Home Affairs-for his Department is responsible-wh y we cannot double and treble the facilities for rifle shooting throughout COOK -I am afraid Australia. There is no lack of money in these days. The House is prepared to vote the Government any number of millions of pounds, if necessary, for that very important service.

There stands a range requiring only the erection of targets, but year after year, in this war time, men cannot get rifle shooting practice, because the Department is so sadly lacking in this regard. Home Affairs Department rather than the Department of Defence. tween the two Departments this fatal deficiency inheres. If steps are not taken soon to correct this state of affairs the matter will become a public scandal. hustle on. any difficulties connected with the construction of targets, I could understand the delay, but there are not. Yet year after year the Government refuse to do anything. If the Department has not sufficient inspectors or workmen it should engage more. There is all this imperatively vital work to be done, yet we cannot get any of it put in hand, no matter how hard we t r y . This is a matter affecting no particular district, nor does it relate to ordinary rifle practice in time of peace. doubly urgent and all-important, and I should like to hear from the Minister a definite statement that he intends to do something to remedy a national neglect. [10.7] -The honourable member for Parramatta has complained that there is a rifle range in his electorate which has not been fitted up. A much more serious grievance exists. equipped rifle ranges, and men anxious to practise on them, but they have no rifles. Isi t not a farce to ask men te practise with rifles that are entirely out of date ? About a week ago I was present at the opening of a rifle range where a number of men were anxious to practise, but there were only available three modern rifles, and they were privately owned. All the other rifles had been called in by the Defence Department. That was a perfectly proper thing to do if the Department wanted those rifles for the troops, in order to give them an opportunity of practising before going to the front . But on the Estimates Parliament voted a Considerable amount of money for the 'control of rifle clubs and -the provision of ammunition, ,yet the members of clubs have no rifles with which to practise. I admit that ammunition is issued to the clubs now, although it was not before. The bungle that took place in regard to the ammunition was about the worse ever made by any military authority in the world. There were men crying out for ammunition, and the Department was replying that it had no ammunition. The rifle club at Camperdown had no ammunition, although eight or ten cases were lying in the local dril l hall. A f t e r a considerable amount of delay, the Department decided that the ammunition belonged to the L i g h t Horse, but, owing We w ill get a to most of its members having enlisted, that corps had practically ceased to exist. Ultimately, after doing the rounds of the Department, I succeeded in getting four cases out of the ten made available for use by the rifle club. It is useless to spend money on rifle ranges, and in distributing ammunition, when the rifle club members are without rifles. Another matter to which I desire to refer is the resumption of land which, I admit, is absolutely necessary for Defence purposes, and so for t h , and the failure of the Department to make any attempt to settle for the land. Liabilities in respect of land This accommodation has become acquired for rifle ranges were left by the last Labour Government as a legacy to their successors. The Labour Government were anxious to produce a good balance sheet and say that they had paid for (Corangamite) everything, although there were a number of these outstanding accounts. I know that the acquisition of land is very difficult to arrange, but cannot the M in ister take the matter in hand, and ascerThere are properly tain if some of the outstanding accounts cannot be settled ? I do not say that the price some of the owners are asking is fair, but why should not the Department attempt to balance its ledger, and settle all accounts promptly? When the honourable member for Darwin was in office on the last occasion, it was even then the practice to resume land and make no attempt 'to settle for it . ready to settle, but I could not get the owners to meet me and talk business. in respect of which the Department absolutely refused-to make any settlement, although the owners were asking a f a i r price.

In those circumstances the owner is uot likely to approach the Department. Unless the Home Affairs Department takes steps to arrive at a settlement, the account will remain open until a new Government comes into office, and the owner will wait for a good opportunity to settle at a price satisfactory to himself. I am now referring to a case in which, in my opinion, the land is worth about one-third of what was asked for it ; and I think there ought to be some way of bringing the owner and the Minister together, so that a reasonable price might be arrived at. However, rifle clubs are most important to us at the present time, representing, as they do, an arm of defence that costs the least of all. Wherever possible, such clubs ought to be estabment cannot absolve themselves from relished, and the members supplied with rifles. It is no good putting up more ranges if there are no rifles; and I hope that the Department will do its best to send at least half-a-dozen to each of the clubs. I am not suggesting for one moment that the equipment of the Forces going to the front should be curtailed, for these men ought to have every opportunity for practice, and should he able to take their rifles away with them. I do not know whether or not it is a fact, but I have been told that many troops are leaving for the front without rifles. O'MALLEY A man can is a serious one; but the difficulty could be overcome if the Small Arms Factory were put on a business footing, so as to enable it to increase its output. [10.17] I should like to support the remarks made by the honourable member for Corangamite. As to the rifle clubs O'MALLEY -Then it is a in my own district, it would seem that the Departments are trying to put every obstacle in the way of the members getting the rifle practice they desire. When the new rifle was introduced, the longer range made it necessary to have some alteration in the ranges in the interests of the safety of the public, and for this further land was required. This gave the excuseI use the term advisedlyfor further delays, which have continued ever since. I know of a case in which a permissive occupancy is sought of Crown lands in order to enable a range to be opened for practice; hut for months and months there has been a game of battledore and shuttlecock between the Defence Department and the Department of Home Affairs, with the latter of which, I think, the matter now rests. I can assure the Minister of Home Affairs that the members of the particular club to which I refer are sick and tired of groinir once a week for ordinary drill, which is all they have to do, in view of the fact that for over twelve months they have not been allowed to go on the range. In my opinion this is a scandal, for these men have their own rifles, and are anxious to use them. Many members of this club have gone to the front, and I am sure that they are less effective because of the inaction of the Department. The Governsponsibility, and the State Government are also implicated. The State member for the district, who belongs to the Labour party, has been indefatigable in his efforts to have the matter dealt with by the State; and I am assured that when the case does reach the Lands Department it will be settled in five minutes. So long, however, as the matter remains with the Department of Home Affairs nothing can be done. I hope that the reproach, which is only too well deserved, will be removed from the Commonwealth Department, because rifle",53,Second Reading

Minister of Home Affairs) [10.20] I ask honourable members who have any such troubles as those presented to-night to either send a wire or a letter to me direct, at the Department of Home Affairs. At present I am there at my table like a muzzled dummy in the absence of my digest. I do not know anything that is going on, and I shall not know unless honourable members complain. I may say that when I was previously Minister of Home AffairsI saved Australia Â£197,000 in the purchase of land. In this connection I had a savings book, but I find that it has also gone. Always, as Minister of Home Affairs, I have been prepared to give every man a square deal. I settled for Duntroon in twenty minutes when there was a probability of a lawsuit. I got Mr Campbell to come from England, and the day after the formal inauguration of the Federal Territory we settled the matter. much, perhaps. both satisfied at Â£35,000 less than the price asked. Is it the idea of honourable members that a public trustee for the Commonwealth should pay more than would a private individual? I can only say that, as trustee for this country, I shall not pay more than I would pay privately as King O'Malley. make the same kind of bargain for the State that I would for myself. I stepped into office only last week, and I at once endeavoured to know what was going on. not suggest that his predecessor did not leave the place in tip-top order? make any charge against either the honourable member or my predecessor. I only know that the Minister's digest, of which I was so proud, is gone. I repeat that if honourable.members know of any citizens who are not getting a square deal, they ought to quietly write to me, when I shall see that all the necessary business is done at once. [10.25] I desire to know from the Treasurer whether, included in either of the Bills before ns, there is any provision made for an extension of the Lithgow Small Arms Factory, and whether any part of the proposed expenditure is to be on the construction of an arsenal at Canberra? I should further like to know whether any provision is being made in these Estimates for the manufacture of machine-guns, shells, and other munitions? We hear much about the necessity for economy at the present time, and we all recognise that we are going through a period of great financial stringency. We are ready to give any money that is necessary for the production of munitions, or to help in the prosecution of the war in any way, but if we think that there is an expenditure of tens of thousands of pounds, which is not required for war purposes, there ought to be the closest scrutiny. -I s it the intention of the Government to continue spending large sums of money on the ordinary compulsory training of our hoys? I observe that there is an item of Â£80,000 for this purpose; and I think that the money could be much better spent in drilling recruits for the war. At the present time we want to train men, and not boys. [10.27] -In the Bill before us there is no provision made for the Small Arms Factory, and, in the second Bill, we do not deal with any Home Affairs Estimates for new works.

The Government have issued instructions to the Deputy Postmasters-General to curtail'expenditure wherever possible, and, iu many country places, this curtailment has taken the shape of closing receiving offices. According to the financial statement made by the Prime Minister some time ago, the total expenditure is to be increased by something like Â£9,000,000, and yet we find a paltry saving of this kind suggested, at the expense of country post-offices. However, I hope that the people of the country will be afforded nil the postal facilities that they undoubtedly deserve.

I have been informed that but a small percentage of these men, on whose training we have spent a large amount of money, has gone to the front , and as I know that many officers who are willing to go to fight for the Empire were prevented fro m doing so, I hope that Ministers will defend our Permanent Forces, who have volunteered for active service, from the charge of having cold feet. submitted a question to the PrimeM in ister to-day in regard to British subjects resident in the Commonwealth having been deprived of their electoral rights. I was speaking of Sikhs and Gurkhas. The Constitution provides that where these subjects were entitled at the inauguration of Federation to vote under a State law to be on the Commonwealth electoral roll. The Prime Minister asked me to cite some special cases in which these British subjects have been deprived of their electoral privileges. I have two cases-thos e of Sutchait Singh and Lucca Singh. The former has resided twenty-five years in Australia; he is a propertv-owner, he served five years in the Indian Army at Singapore, and only recently his nephew, Suntoke Singh, fell fighting for the Empire on the western front. I draw a distinction between those subjects of the Empire not of a white race who are coming into the Commonwealth and those who are at present resident in Australia; but I consider that, in view of recent happenings, it is due to us, in a spirit of fair play, to review our electoral legislation in regard to these people. Frime Minister turned the subject, and said that, at the termination of the war, he would see that all naturalized citizens would be required to re-declare their fealty to the Empire; but that issue is beside the question I raised. speaking of British-born subjects, and I ask the Cabinet to give earnest consideration to people who have done a great deal more for the Empire by risking their lives for it than any one in this chamber.

This Factory has supplied more than the British authorities lay down as necessary for the troops who have left our shores, and they have also supplied the requirements of the Botha Government in its campaign against the To-day the Germans in SouthA f r i c a . Great improvements have been effected. Quite recently a cap factory has been established, and I understand that the complete cartridge is now being manufactured in Australia.

Another soldier went out for the service of his country in the f u l l life in the British Army, will be treated. possession of all his faculties, and my houorable friends opposite did not demur to voting him twelve months' pay. The widow of Major-General Hoad received a sum similar to this. Major-General Hoad was simply doing his duty in peace time, and my honourable friends opposite did not object to that grant. They thought it was a fair thing. They viewed in the same light the grant to Brigadier-General Gordon. Here we have the case of a man who gave his life to his country. He rendered distinguished service above that of the ordinary military man, and yet some honourable members opposite decline to put his widow on the same footing as these others. That is the way in which the honourable member for Ballarat's ideas of equal justice will receive their best illustration. Nothing that we can do for these people is too much, so far as we can afford it ; but we shall do no injustice to the widow of any soldier in the ranks by voting Major-General Bridges' widow this sum. The honourable member, I venture to say, will not find a soldier who has been at Gallipoli that will say the Parliament did wrong in voting this money. orable member know that? Minister of External Affairs interjecting in this way? simple question. orable member asks it , as he generally does, in a very simple way. Is he, or is he not, in favour of this grant? does not expect such interjections from a responsible Bridges was not an ordinary man in any sense of the word, and should not, and cannot, be treated, on any lines of justice, as an ordinary man. He was responsible for the efficiency of those Forces that have won for Australia renown throughout the length and breadth of the whole world. He devoted his life to the service of the Australian soldier; and, in my judgment, if we could poll to-day, the whole of our soldiers, and the whole of the service, we should find them voting, to a man, for this grant and very much more. This case stands by itself. We are treating this man's widow far more illiberally than the widow of any man of similar rank, who happens to lose his Let us treat General Bridges' widow as the widows pf other distinguished generals who lose their lives will be treated. Here was a man distinguished amongst the many distinguished generals who have fallen, and there is not one of them whose widows and families w i ll not be treated more generously than we are proposing to treat his family. I hope that my honourable friends who have opposed this grant will be satisfied with what they have done. They can do no good for the soldiers in whose interests they speak by persisting in the course they are taking. They may injure this case, but they will not better their own. I , therefore, beg of them to let this case stand on its merits. I speak warmly on this question, because I was in intimate association with Major-General Bridges at the onset of his career in the new Australian Army. I had the honour and privilege of appointing him to his command of the Military College. If those who are objecting to this proposal knew as much as I do of his self-sacrificing devotion to duty they would not hesitate to vote this sum. L e t it be said to his credit that he never valued money. When I offered him that position, at an increase of 50 per cent, in his salary, he was not anxious to take it . He had not been long in London, and although he was receiving there only Â£800 a year he was not at all anxious to accept the temptI am asking only a ing offer that I made him. He did not value the monetary side of the position, and never did throughout his life. The result is that his widow and family are in greater need than they would have been had he looked after their interests One from this mercenary point of view. I am most anxious that we should not develop Minister. Major-General a wrangle over this matter, or make in vidious comparisons. This case stands by itself. I hope it will be so regarded, and that we shall mete out this small modicum of justice to the widow and family of one of the most distinguished soldiers who has fallen on any of the fronts in connection with the operations now proceeding in various parts of Europe He stands side by side, and will compare favourably, with the best generals, and we are not treating his widow and family liberally in any sense of the word in the amount we are proposing to vote.",60,Chairman Th E Standing It In The Abstract

If the honourable member for Corio were ever lucky enough to occupy a seat on the Treasury bench, I venture to say he would not be prepared to do the increased work, and accept the increased responsibility, for the salary he receives as a private member. Honourable members are asking the Committee to do an impossible thing. The late General was responsible for practically the whole military system of this country. He built up the Military College, and bore the entire responsibility of the initial work of the Australian troops in Egypt and at a pension of Â£156, and we are not objecting to that. interests of the widows of privates, I am missing the opposing the honourable member's proposal for equality of treatment, inasmuch as the widows would be the losers by the adoption of it. hope I shall be always found voting with the side that attempts to treat fairly those on the bottom rung of the social ladder. My contention is that the The Leader of the Opposition put up a good case for his class, but had he been speaking for the privates his speech would have heen very different. I recognise the class from which I sprang, and which I represent in this House, and my endeavour will always be to secure justice to them. The argument advanced by the honorahle member for Indi is not tenable. The honourable member for The honorahle member for Wannon has said that the pension of Â£156 is a shabby amount to pay to the widow of General Bridges, and the Government have brought down this Bill to give her a measure of extra justice or generosity. I do not intend to say a word against the amount proposed to be paid to Lady Bridges. The honourable member for Indi and the Minister of Customs, however, will persist in speaking of the amount as representing three years' salary of the late General; they will not realize that it represents also his pension for about thirty years. Would honorahle members be prepared to pay to all widows a pension equivalent to three times the amount their husbands had been earning prior to enlisting? Would those honourable members pay three years' salary to the widow of a man who prior to going 'to the front, had been earning Â£900 a year as a bank manager?

424,Mr Anstey (Bourke) [11.52],"Ithe grant is based on the salary of General Bridges for three years. But what is the motion before the Committee? It is that it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purpose of a Bill for an Act"" to provide so-and-so. The resolution does not refer to a basis of three years' salary, but it suspends in connection with the relatives of this man an Act of Parliament. What does that Act say? It lays down in clear and definite language what pension shall be paid to the relatives of not only the highest soldier in our Porces, but the humblest privates who fall in fighting the battles of their country. That is the law which we carried unanimously twelve months ago. What situation has arisen which should induce honourable members to nullify the Act and say that to the relatives of a particular individual its provisions shall not apply ? The law which the Treasurer proposes to annul says that the pension to the dependants of General Bridges shall be a certain amount per annum, and it is now proposed to provide them with an amount equal to their pension for a term of twenty-nine years. I do not object to honourable members giving the family that amount as a lump sum, or Â£100. A ll that I contend is that the right should be extended to the widow or the mother of a private soldier, or a lieutenant, or .a captain, or a colonel. But my honourable friends say that the widow of a private soldier who fell on the field of battle shall not have that privilege. The Treasurer says that the proposed grant to Lady Bridges is not to be taken as a precedent, and other honourable members say that there shall be a distinction between the widow of a general and the widow of a private soldier. The Government propose that, so far as the vast majority of the soldiers who fall on the battlefield are concerned, the pension system which is formulated and enacted, shall apply, but that it shall be made null and void on behalf of the widow of a particular individual. All that I ask is equality of treatment. Pensions Act provide for preferential treatment between a general and a private soldier? if a man is a private, or a lieutenant, or a captain, or a colonel, or a general, he shall receive a certain amount as pension; and the Government are now asking the Com[272] mittee to make the Act a dead letter in one case. If it is intended to commute the pension for the relatives of a particular soldier, let honourable members give an equal privilege to the widow of every soldier.' I can imagine what little heart the Treasurer had for the work which was put before him. He said that, had not General Bridges gone to the war, and had he fallen from a horse here and died, something would have happened. He was so hard up for an argument that he had to imagine a case. Plenty of -doctors, lawyers, and men who earned hundreds of pounds a year prior to the war enlisted as private soldiers, and gave up their lives on the field of battle. Why not say that, as regards the compensation to their relatives, the Pensions Act shall be null and void, and that they shall receive a grant based on the annual income of their husbands prior to the war? That would be equity and justice. Take the case of a lawyer, or a doctor, or an architect, who earned an income of Â£300 or Â£500 a year before he threw away his chances in life and shouldered arms in the defence of his country. His pay as a private soldier was only 5s. or 6s. a day, and the pension provided for his widow under the Act is a miserable pittance. For such widows there is to be no consideration shown.' The Minister of Trade and Customs and the Treasurer sit cheek-by-jowl with the members of the Opposition who are trying, not to do an act of justice, but to secure a special privilege to a particular person. Why do they desire to commute a pension of Â£160 a year into a lump sum of Â£4,500, based on a life of twenty-nine years? Simply because it will be better for the widow to take Â£4,500 in a lump sum instead of twelve or fourteen years' pension at Â£160 a year. The Minister of Trade and Customs has interjected that the widow of a deceased soldier would lose by commuting her pension to a twenty-nine years' life. She would if she were a young woman, but if the she were between forty and fifty years of age she would gain by accepting a lump sum of Â£1,500. It is claimed that General Bridges had three clasps.

Treasurer could not defend this proposal on the grounds of justice. He could not reconcile his own conscience to it . In my opinion, social influences have brought to bear to give to one man that which cannot be given to other individuals. member cannot get over the argument that he was a representative man. the honourable member for Corio was pointing out that some widows of deceased soldiers received comparatively little in the way of pension, the Minister of Trade and Customs interjected that, in those cases, the widows must have other incomes. General Bridges some other source of income?
