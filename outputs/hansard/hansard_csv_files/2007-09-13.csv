Thursday, 13 September 2007 ----Housing Affordability Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (9.30 am)-New figures from the Supreme Court of New South Wales on mortgage repossession orders have recently become available under freedom of information, and they are cause for considerable alarm. They reflect a trend in my electorate that many people are feeling less secure-there is less job security and there are rising costs, rising interest rates and high levels of personal debt. Eleven years after John Howard claimed that he wanted Australians to be relaxed and comfortable and just a few months after his insulting statement that working families have never been better off, we have rising levels of insecurity. And now we have proof that their concerns are founded in reality-rising rates of mortgage repossessions. In Parramatta we had as many mortgage repossessions in the first half of 2007 as we did for the whole of 2006. In Wentworthville in the first half of this year that they reached the same level that they did for the whole of 2006. In Northmead the writs of possession issued in the first half of this year were double what they were for the whole of last year. In Blacktown, one of the worse suburbs affected, repossessions from January to July of this year have already reached the alarmingly high figure of 41, which is well on the way to the 48 writs of possession issued in 2006. These figures do not take into account the number of people who sell their home to avoid it being repossessed. We on this side of the House have positively nagged the government, trying to convince them that, in spite of their view that working families have never been better off, many families are struggling, as are singles, pensioners, sole parents, people on disability pensions and working people generally. Rising interest rates, steep rent increases, higher petrol prices, rising grocery prices, rising childcare fees and workplace insecurity caused by the extreme and unfair Work Choices are all taking their toll on working families and individuals in Western Sydney. The Prime Minister, John Howard, has simply stopped listening to Australian families and the many community organisations that have begged for more support for affordable housing. He did not even notice the mounting financial pressures people are facing when he claimed that Australian working families have never been better off. Now, with an election looming, the Prime Minister has rediscovered the need to plan for the future. How can the Prime Minister look to the future when he does not even see the present for individuals and families living in Western Sydney? Here is the proof of what any member in this House would know if they spent any time at all out in the community: repossessions are at double the rate they were last year in many of the suburbs around Parramatta and Blacktown, rents are going through the roof and working people and working families are doing it tough in Western Sydney. They need a government that will act. A Rudd Labor government will work on housing affordability. Kevin Rudd and Labor have a real plan. The people of Western Sydney need action and they need a government that actually notices the problem. MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Information Queensland Produces 85 Per Cent Of Queen

The way has been cleared for the people of Redcliffe in my electorate to record their opposition to the loss of identity and local voice in the merger that has occurred with the Pine Rivers and Caboolture councils. Of course, it has taken the intervention of the Howard government to take a stand against this attack on local democracy. We gave people back their vote and their voice, in this terrible attack by Labor, and there was nothing but support from their federal colleagues. It was also we who stared down the Queensland government’s draconian threat to sack councils that gave people their say-a ridiculous circumstance that Queenslanders should never have imposed on them. With the way forward cleared, the Redcliffe City Council has now taken up the opportunity to pursue a vote, and that will be a red-letter day. The other change has been the sudden departure of Peter Beattie, the main architect in this grab for power-the man who believed that he could rule for 100 years, who has the personal responsibility for all of these years of stuff-ups and who has left this terrible mess and plenty of other messes for someone else to clean up. I wish Anna Bligh well but, if she really wants to make her mark as Premier, she should wind back these terrible experiments called amalgamation. I join John Howard in calling for Anna Bligh’s first action in becoming Premier to be the repeal of the amalgamation laws. The existing boundaries should be retained for the planned March elections. This is the only appropriate course of action for the people of Redcliffe and the people of Queensland. Ploughing on against the wishes of the people will only show how undemocratic Labor is and that it never changes its spots, just like a leopard. I say that because Labor’s form is predictable, in that it will cave in to the demands of unions on almost every single issue. This process has been driven to give unions more access to their local government employment sector to prop up their flagging membership. Labor has given its union mates a third of the seats on the transitional committees-that is right, 30 per cent of the transitional committees is made up of unionists. The Labor candidate standing against me is, not surprisingly, an AWU unionist. She claims to have a Redcliffe background, but she does not get this issue. ‘People raise it with me, but not in the context that it is my fault and I should do something about it,’ she said to the Australian last month. Well, plenty of people having raised it with me, I have decided that I will find a way forward, and that are what being a member of parliament is all about. (Time expired) Banks Electorate ing election will be the 24th election where electors have had an opportunity to register a vote. I first campaigned in 1974 when I joined the Labor Party, so this will be the 14th campaign I have been involved in. It will be the seventh that I have contested for the Labor Party. The seat is not an easy seat. In difficult times there have been some very close results. At the last election I managed to win with a majority of one per cent. After the redistribution it is now 3.2 per cent. MAIN COMMITTEE",133,Statements By Members
284,Mr Melham (Banks) (9.36 Am),"The seat of Banks was created in 1949. The forthcomSoI find it extraordinary that at this point in time the Liberal Party have yet to select a candidate against me. Apparently that is a phenomenon in eight other seats in New South Wales. That is treating their Liberal supporters in Banks with contempt. Normally you get into the field and you fly the flag on behalf of your party. Personally, I am relaxed because I regard it as an endorsement that a party that spent $300,000 at the last election and were confident that they could win are, as yet, not able to field a candidate against me. I have certainly put a lot of effort in over the years, and that effort has paid off. I think it is fair to say that polling shows that, but for incumbency, the seat might have changed hands. But this performance by the Liberal Party will be remembered by locals, and they will be held in contempt for it. I saw the performance of the Prime Minister last night where he pleaded for another term because he had more things to do and he set a time limit on when he would go-something that I call ‘the High Court option’, that he would leave at 70, because now, with the constitutional change, High Court judges retire at 70. He did not quite say ‘70’; he said ‘well into the next term’. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you are a countryman and you know that when you have a wounded animal you put it out of its misery. You do not allow it to continue, because it can inflict suffering on those around it. This Prime Minister does not want to leave, but could you imagine what he would be like if he were elected again for the next two years? He did not tell us about Work Choices before the last election. What is he going to do after the next election, if he is elected, in relation to add-ons to Work Choices and a whole range of other things-the ‘never, ever’ man? He tells us that he made this pronouncement last night because he believes in honesty and being fair dinkum with the Australian electorate. He was not fair dinkum on the GST when he said ‘never, ever’. He was not up-front with the electorate in relation to Work Choices. In relation to ‘children overboard’ he was not fair dinkum in telling the electorate what had actually happened, and there is a litany of other matters in which he was not fair dinkum. When you combine those factors, I think the electors of Banks will do one thing: they will help return a thumping majority for a Labor candidate and for a Labor government. (Time expired) Parkinson’s Australia to sponsor a breakfast meeting on behalf of Parkinson’s Australia. This year Parkinson’s Australia has taken the initiative in promoting itself more vigorously than in previous years, and I like to think that some of this enthusiasm has flowed from the fact that three years ago we set up a parliamentary Parkinson’s support group. It has been an invaluable exercise in raising awareness of the blight of Parkinson’s, which is an incurable disease affecting younger and younger persons. I really did not appreciate how insidious this disease is, how prevalent it is or the chance that each and every one of us could be exposed to it in the future-either directly or indirectly-especially as we get older. But it is not something that Parkinson’s Australia can do alone, and they came to us for assistance. The purpose of the breakfast was twofold: firstly, to expose as many parliamentarians as possible to the existence and activities of Parkinson’s Australia and, secondly, to present to the Minister for Health and Ageing a report by Access Economics that was commissioned by Parkinson’s Australia. The report is titled Living with Parkinson’s disease: challenges and positive steps for the future. If any member would like a copy, just let me know. I thank the MAIN COMMITTEE",134,Statements By Members
285,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (9.39 Am),"Last month during the last sitting week I was privilegedminister for health, my colleague Tony Abbott, for coming along to receive the report on behalf of the Australian government. In 2005 over 54,700 persons were diagnosed with Parkinson’s; 28,100 were male and 26,600 were female. According to the report, the prevalence of the disease is expected to grow by about 15 per cent over the next five years, in part due to demographic ageing. In economic terms, the cost of this disease was estimated to be in the order of $6.8 billion in 2005 alone. In human and emotional terms, the cost is considerably higher, as anyone caring for someone with Parkinson’s will tell you. I found being confronted with the realities of the disease quite an emotional experience. Several months previously, our group was briefed by two neurologists retained by Parkinson’s Australia: Dr Andrew Hughes, Consultant Neurologist at Austin Health in Victoria, and Dr John O’Sullivan, Consultant Neurologist at Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital. Their presentation, particularly the video they screened of a sufferer in the advanced stages of the disease, had a huge impact on me. I commend that footage to you, because if you have no sense of connection right now you certainly will after you have seen it. It is that compelling. I would like to thank the CEO of Parkinson’s Australia, Norman Marshall, who was appointed this year and whom I am happy to describe as an ardent advocate for the cause. He is highly assisted by Jason Thomas of the consultancy firm Sinclair Thomas, who have taken on the running of this campaign on behalf of Parkinson’s Australia. I believe that under their hand Parkinson’s Australia and the repercussions of the disease will become more visible in the years to come. The breakfast was attended by a number of eminent persons, as well as individuals who had contracted the disease, although I was rather disappointed not to see more parliamentary colleagues from both sides of the chamber. In saying that, I thank my colleagues Teresa Gambaro from Petrie and Kerry Bartlett from Macquarie for being there. More needs to be done, and we in this House are best placed to facilitate change in an effort to ease the misery. I commend the Parkinson’s Australia and Access Economics report to you and urge other members to make contact with the Parkinson’s Australia people to discover how they can help. (Time expired) Ministerial Responsibility much fanfare about improving ministerial standards and accountability. But, after the Prime Minister’s ministerial code of conduct claimed ministerial scalps by the bucketload in its first 18 months of operation, the Prime Minister declared it not a death sentence and it has been all downhill from there. There was no ministerial responsibility taken for the debacle over weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. The absolute low point was this: there was no ministerial, or indeed any, responsibility taken for the AWB scandal. The Minister for Foreign Affairs minister and other ministers ignored dozens of warnings and permitted an Australian company with a legislated monopoly on wheat exports to pay $300 million in kickbacks to Saddam Hussein. We had the Cole inquiry into this scandal and the government hid behind this inquiry, refusing to answer questions in the House of Representatives or Senate estimates committees on the grounds that an inquiry was taking place. But what has become of the inquiry? Nothing. The AWB’s export monopoly remains in place, with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry continuing to veto applications from any other company wanting to export wheat. What on earth has happened to the criminal charges the Cole inquiry recommended be laid MAIN COMMITTEE",135,Statements By Members
286,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (9.42 Am),"This government came to power amidagainst senior AWB personnel? The Attorney-General is just sitting on this matter. I have heard that people who would expect to be witnesses in the AWB scandal trials have not even been contacted by police. It is nearly a year since the release of the Cole report. What on earth is going on? Now the equine flu virus has got into Australia as a result of the breakdown in our quarantine arrangements. Just as in the AWB scandal, the government has set up an inquiry to be carried out by one of its favourite sons and is now hiding behind it. What can be done about such lamentable standards of public accountability? The good news is that the Australasian Study of Parliament Group Accountability Working Party has produced an excellent report, titled Be honest, minister! The report is the work of former Victorian MPs Ken Coghill and Race Mathews from the Labor side and Alan Hunt-a great former member-and Victor Perton from the Liberal side, as well as distinguished academics and public accountability experts. I do not have time to do justice to its many recommendations, but I do recommend it to anyone interested in lifting the low standards of public accountability which now apply in Australia. Its recommendations include making federal ministers’ staff and advisers answerable to parliamentary committees, as state ministers’ staff can be compelled to do, to stop ministers hiding behind their staff. They propose a simple, innovative and effective form of electronic registration and disclosure of lobbying to deal with this murky area of special access by vested interests to federal ministers-access which is often invisible-and they propose the reform of freedom of information legislation to restore the original intent that information not be withheld except on very limited public interest grounds, such as where national security is genuinely at risk. (Time expired) Flinders Electorate: Environment am)-I want to raise the role of the public in two important environmental issues within my electorate of Flinders. The first is in relation to the Mornington Peninsula and in particular the proposal by the state government, which is supporting a bitumen plant at Crib Point. This is a proposal which has problems. Firstly, it would be a bitumen plant with all of the incumbent problems within a residential area. Technically, it is defined as port land; in reality, it would be surrounded by residential housing and a community who rely on that area as their home. Secondly, it would bring large, B-double trucks through the middle of Crib Point, through the middle of Hastings and potentially through Tyabb. It would have an impact on Bittern and all of those communities. So that proposal, as it stands, is unacceptable. There is a forthcoming public protest and I urge everybody who has strong views on this issue to oppose this plant. It would also destroy the proposal for the Otama submarine, which would be a wonderful outcome for Crib Point. My position is very clear: tourism, not a bitumen plant; tourism, not bitumen trucks at Crib Point, Hastings, Bittern and Tyabb. There should be a plebiscite if the state is determined to proceed with this process. I repeat: there should be a public plebiscite. I want to take that same principle and apply it to the proposal that the state has for a desalination plant near the towns of Kilcunda and Dalyston-again within my electorate. Although technically the plant would be just outside the electorate, these two towns will be affected directly and absolutely. There is, of course, a need for secure water supplies. The first priority must be to clean up the Gunnamatta Outfall, recycle that water and end the practice of dumping 400 million litres a day, or 150 billion litres a year, of waste sewage just off our coast. If MAIN COMMITTEE",136,Statements By Members
287,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (9.45that is done, then that will provide an extraordinary leap forward, which may well take away the need for a desalination plant. No matter what, the community must have a say. I challenge the Victorian government to give the community a say through a binding community plebiscite for the desalination plant as well as for the Crib Point plant. We have already made that commitment, and that is the beauty of it, but there is no commitment from the state to allow for a binding plebiscite to stop the Crib Point plant and give the people of Dalyston, Kilcunda and Bass Coast an opportunity to determine their own future. Ms Hall interjectingallowing the community a say. (Time expired) Member for Moreton of the Prime Minister’s decision to cut and run from the prime ministership if he retains his seat and his government, come the next election. But there has not been much coverage of the Prime Minister’s failure to defend the integrity of the AFP having regard to the scurrilous use of parliamentary privilege by the member for Moreton earlier this week. On Tuesday, the member for Moreton, in what I am confident will be one of his last contributions in this place, launched a series of attacks on the AFP, claiming that he was a victim of a high-level conspiracy and questioning the motives and independence of the AFP. The member for Moreton said: ... political strings are permeating even through the highest levels of law enforcement such as the Australian Federal Police ... Yesterday in question time, when asked about these attacks, the Prime Minister, obviously more concerned about the numbers in the Liberal party room than about the integrity of the AFP, did not utter one word of support for those police officers under attack. Rather than defending the good name and integrity of the AFP, the Prime Minister decided to defend the member for Moreton. The Prime Minister should not tolerate such attacks under parliamentary privilege. Police are in a unique position. They are subject to an oath of office. The oath grants police enormous powers and places particularly great responsibilities on these officers. It is a great personal responsibility that is at the heart of their profession, and it is a personal responsibility coupled with a deep personal commitment that distinguishes police officers from other members of the community in many respects. A failure to defend their integrity-integrity that is at the very core of the profession of a sworn police officer-is nothing short of a personal attack on every serving police officer, be they state or federal. As anyone who has had any involvement with or any knowledge of the AFP would know, there are proper channels through which allegations such as those raised by the member for Moreton could be followed up and investigated. After all, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity has recently begun operating under this government. That process is available to the member for Moreton, but he did not seek to avail himself of it. He sought to make a personal and scurrilous attack on the good name of police officers, using parliamentary privilege. Police officers and their families deserve better than a Prime Minister and a government that fail to defend their integrity. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE",137,Statements By Members

289,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (9.49 Am),"There has been a great deal of reporting this morningMember for Moreton Roads am)-The problem with the argument of the member for Werriwa is that many AFP officers think that what the member for Moreton said is dead on the money. The member for Moreton has been denied natural justice in this matter, and that is a real shame. Week after week in the newspapers, he has been called the ‘disgraced member for Moreton’, and now we find he has no charges to answer. I certainly feel the way the member for Moreton and many AFP officers feel, in that it took six months to conclude a relatively simple investigation. I think that is the flaw in the argument of the member for Werriwa. I need to speak in the parliament about roads. In my electorate in Townsville, roads are a very significant issue, and I am pleased to report to the community that the Townsville ring road, which I promised at the last election, is well underway. It is a new, high-speed motorway that will link the northern beaches through to James Cook University, the hospital and Lavarack Barracks. It will cut travel times by up to 20 minutes. When it opens, the community will be delighted. It will be open within about 12 months. building it and the community will understand that that is the way it should go. We are about to start work on the four-laning of the Bruce Highway, between the Woodlands Shopping Centre and Veales Road. That will take away the deathtrap intersection with the Mount Low Parkway. The people of Bushland Beach will be very pleased. Looking ahead, we want to start work on the port access road. That is a $190 million project which will be funded by state and federal governments on a fifty-fifty basis. It is something that is timely, having regard to growth in the Townsville port and the Townsville region. I am determined to make sure that that project gets the green light and goes ahead. I would also like to draw the parliament’s attention to my commitment to build a superhighway south of Townsville, from the Cluden turn-off through to Vantassel Road. We will four-lane that section. That section right now is overloaded. The number of vehicles it services a day warrants four-laning. It will also be a flood mitigation project because the highway gets cut in times of heavy rainfall at that location. That is a $110 million project, and I intend to deliver that to the electorate, along with a number of other road projects that are very important to the people of Townsville and Thuringowa. I look forward to making those final commitments in due course, as we approach the coming election. Education quences that the Howard government’s education policies have had for my electorate of Bendigo. This week the Minister for Education, Science and Training announced an additional 605 Commonwealth funded places for Victorian universities. This is a welcome move, but one that goes no way to rectifying the damage the Howard government has inflicted on tertiary education in this country. The major tertiary institution in Bendigo, La Trobe University, was not in a position to even apply for any additional places, because it could not be confident that those places would be filled by prospective students.

293,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (9.55 Am),"I want to use this opportunity to refer to the conseaffairs. We are in the middle of the biggest skills crisis this country has ever seen-a crisis that is holding back economic growth and reducing the quality of life for regional Australians. La Trobe University’s predicament is a direct result of the 11 years of neglect and underfunding by the Howard government. Since 1996, annual Commonwealth funding for universities has fallen by a third, from 0.9 per cent of GDP to about 0.6 per cent today. Commonwealth grants to universities have decreased from 57 per cent of total government revenue in 1996 to 41 per cent in 2004. The Howard government slashed $5 billion from university funding between 1996 and 2002. La Trobe University alone had $227 million effectively cut from its Commonwealth funding. The reason why regional students are not even applying for the current available places is that the cost of university education under the Howard government is spiralling out of reach. Recent surveys by the Age newspaper found that one in six regional students who won university places are choosing not to enrol, compared to one in 15 in Melbourne. The survey found that regional students were put off by the high costs and prospects of having to leave home to pursue those studies. The currently depressed rural economy makes it more difficult for regional students and their families to meet these costs. It is scandalous that the Howard government has allowed this situation to happen at a time when increased skills and qualifications are vital to Australia’s economic prosperity. It has been more interested in forcing its ideologically driven industrial relations policies on unwilling universities and destroying the student union movement than it has been in improving educational outcomes. The rocketing cost of higher education is making second-class citizens of regional students, and the government appears completely oblivious to the expensive but unfair tertiary education system that it has created. If the Howard government is re-elected, the costs of going to university will only increase. Labor believes more can and must be done to reduce the costs of tertiary education for regional students. Labor’s comprehensive education revolution will bring equality of opportunity back into university education. It will once again put a tertiary education within the reach of those regional students who are bright enough to earn a place at university. In 1999 the Prime Minister said, ‘There will be no $100,000 university fees under this government,’ but now we have more than 100 degrees in public universities that cost over $100,000. The Howard government broke its promise on full fee paying degrees. It is now out of touch with the expensive and unfair system that it has created. Broadband ernment for metropolitan areas; it also recognises the importance to Australia of rural, remote and regional areas. The $113 million Clever Networks program, which is part of the $1.1 billion Connect Australia package, is enabling the roll-out of broadband infrastructure and innovative services to the regional and more remote parts of Australia. I was particularly pleased that recently on the Sunshine Coast we had a visit from the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, the Hon. Helen Coonan. She announced funding of $2.9 million for the Maroochy Shire Council to facilitate business innovation and productivity and to increase service delivery options. There will also be a contribution made by Allegro Networks, the University of the Sunshine Coast and the Maroochy Shire Council totalling $3.4 million.

Second Reading Debate resumed from 21 June, on motion by Mr Nairn: That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment Bill 2007 is to make changes to the Australian government civilian and military superannuation schemes. Labor supports this bill, but our concern is not about what is in it; it is about what is not. From1 July 2008 this bill will remove the requirement for contributory members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, or the CSS, to make member contributions to the CSS, thereby making all member contributions voluntary and providing members with the same flexibility and incentives to contribute to superannuation that are available to the broader community. It also allows, from 1 July 2008, eligible members of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, or PSS, to elect to leave that scheme to join another superannuation arrangement for the payment of future contributions, which will allow eligible members the flexibility for future contributions that is already available to most of the Australian workforce. From1 January 2008 it enables members of the CSS to obtain early release of their funded account balances on severe financial hardship and compassionate grounds. It provides from 1 January 2008 for the prospective restoration of previously cancelled spouse pensions. It makes consequential and technical amendments and ensures that the entitlement to benefits in the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973, or the schemes. Finally, it addresses an anomaly in the treatment of the benefits payable in that act upon marriage breakdown. A hearing was conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on the act, which I will be referring to later. The Superannuation Act 1976 includes a requirement for contributory members of the CSS to pay basic member contributions of five per cent of their salary for superannuation purposes. This bill includes amendments to the CSS Act that will remove the requirement and allow CSS contributors to elect, on or after 1 July 2008, to cease making member contributions. Amendments to the Superannuation Act 1990 are not required as the necessary changes for the PSS will be made by the APSS amending deed. The PSS Act provides eligibility requirements for membership of the PSS and generally only allows members to cease contributing on leaving employment or retirement. The bill includes amendments to that act that would allow eligible PSS members to elect to cease membership of the scheme, preserve their accumulated PSS benefit and have their future emMAIN COMMITTEE",140,Statements By Members

296,Mr Bowen (Prospect) (10.00 Am),"The purpose of the Superannuation Legislationployer contributions paid to an accumulation scheme, thereby having access to the government’s broader fund arrangements. These changes will commence on 1 July 2008. The bill also amends the Superannuation Act 2005 to allow eligible PSS members who have elected to join the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, or the PSSAP, to become members of that plan. Whilst Labor is supportive, I must say, frankly, individuals who elect to reduce contributions will be disadvantaging themselves and should carefully consider such action, particularly seeking advice from the fund or other financial advice about the financial detriment of doing so. The bill contains amendments to the CSS Act that will, from 1 January 2008, enable CSS members to obtain early release of their funded account balances on severe financial hardship or compassionate grounds to the extent allowed under the regulatory framework established under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. The bill will enable the positive restoration of pensions for persons who have previously had their spouse pensions cancelled upon remarriage. Prior to 1976 in the Superannuation Act 1922 civilian scheme and 1997 in the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Act 1948 and the DFRDB Act, spouse pensions were cancelled on remarriage. Cancellation never applied in the PSS, CSS or military superannuation scheme. Although provisions cancelling spouse pensions on remarriage were removed from the 1922 act scheme in 1976 and the DFRB Act and the DFRDB Act schemes in 1977, spouses who remarried before the cancellation provisions were removed continued to be affected by the former provisions. From1 January 2008 restrictions on the restoration of spouse pensions that were previously cancelled when a spouse remarried will be removed prospectively upon successful application. The changes will also apply to persons who have previously had their spouse pension only partially restored. The bill also includes, as I referred to earlier, amendments to the CSS act as a consequence of the government’s Better Superannuation reforms. The main amendment will ensure the continued payment of employer productivity contributions for a member who cannot make member contributions because they have not provided their tax file number. This is consistent with the arrangements in the broader community, where employer contributions would still be payable even though the member has not provided their tax file number. The Better Super reforms generally commence from 1 July 2007. The amendments in relation to the CSS Act may commence between 1 July 2007 and 1 July 2008, depending on the particular amendment. Amendments to the PSS Act are not required as the necessary changes will be made by the PSS amending deed. The bill also amends the DFRDB Act to improve access to reversionary benefits in certain circumstances where the retired pensioner commenced a marital relationship after the age of 60. Currently a spouse’s pension under the DFRDB Act scheme is generally not payable if the pensioner who commences a marital relationship after the age of 60 dies within five years of the relationship commencing. The bill removes the restrictions on the payment of benefits following such post-retirement relationships. However, a pro rata rate of a spouses pension will be payable where the relationship existed for less than three years immediately before the pensioner’s death. Where the resulting rate of the pension is small, it may be commuted to a lump sum in some cases. These amendments will also apply to the MSBS and the necessary changes will be made by amending the MSBS trust deed and rules. MAIN COMMITTEE It is proposed that the new postretirement marriage arrangements will commence on a day or days to be fixed by proclamation or six months after this act receives royal assent. These changes will ensure consistency between the military schemes and the civilian schemes. Labor believes that this should date from the operative date for the civilian schemes-namely, 1 July 2003. There was no satisfactory explanation given to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for why this did not happen. The parliamentary secretary has indicated consideration of act of grace payments. The number of people advantaged by greater retrospectivity is very small-less than 10 a year-so the associated cost is negligible. Certainty and consistency should apply to widows and Labor asserts that it would be better if this were covered by the act rather than act of grace payments. The bill will address an anomaly in the family law provisions of the DFRDB Act to allow family law orders to be applied as intended. As the current legislation stands, family law orders only apply to a current lump sum or pension. This amendment only applies to a second and subsequent or later pension or lump sum that is paid as a result of a period of effective service that begins on or after the day on which this amendment commences. The amendments relating to voluntary member contributions for CSS members and a choice of fund for PSS members are part of a package of measures announced in the 2007-08 budget which overall will cost approximately $160 million over four years. As I said in my opening remarks, what causes the opposition concern is not what is in the bill; it is what is not in the bill. There are a range of contemporary issues that need to be considered, particularly against the background of the various reforms to private sector superannuation that have occurred over the past 20 years. These issues include indexation provisions of pension entitlements; interdependent relationship reversion pension benefits, a promise made by the Prime Minister but not delivered upon; the tax increase that members of the MSBS will suffer as a consequence of the 1 July Better Super changes; the ability to salary sacrifice; real super choice and portability; the value of the 10 per cent rebate for untaxed schemes and income tax treatment of non-super income at age 60; the foreign defined benefits schemes such as those covering the Australian staff working for the United Nations-again, consequences of the 1 July Better Super changes; transition to retirement provisions; and the tax treatment for class A military invalidity pensions. Again, many of these matters were canvassed at the Senate finance and public administration committee hearing into the bill, but very few answers were received from the government. Labor is particularly concerned that the various actuarial and other modelling carried out by the Treasury on a number of these matters has not been made public, despite constant requests by the shadow minister for intergenerational finance, Senator Sherry, at many Senate committee hearings over many years. The government’s response to Labor’s concerns in the matter of superannuation in military matters has been arrogant to say the least. They have arrogantly said there is no problem and that the Labor Party do not know what we are talking about. The veterans community would certainly beg to differ and has certainly been very vocal in support of the Labor Party’s position, as the Labor Party has been very vocal in support of the needs of veterans. That has been articulated by the shadow minister for veterans affairs and by the Leader of the Opposition, who has made this a priority for the opposition. The shadow minister for veterans affairs will MAIN COMMITTEE be following later in the debate. He will be moving a second reading amendment which refers to some of the matters I have addressed in these remarks. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (10.11 am)-The coalition government has consistently worked to provide incentives for Australians to boost their retirement savings. The record of this government on superannuation is exemplary given the 13 years of mismanagement under Labor before the Howard coalition government came to office. Let me remind you, in light of the amendments to be moved by Mr Griffin, that it was the Labor Party that actually defunded the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme, or the DFRDB. They took all of our veterans’ contributions in DFRDB, rolled them into consolidated revenue and left it as an unfunded Commonwealth scheme. It has been left to this government, in the form of the Future Fund, to come forward, to step up to the plate, to do the hard yards, to say, ‘No, you can’t spend this; no, you can’t spend that,’ to save the money and to build a Future Fund. And now we are looking at a situation where our Commonwealth service public pensions, our public sector public pensions and our Defence public pensions will be funded. They will not be an impost on my children. My children will not be paying double tax for something that the taxpayers of previous generations should have and have already paid for. So my children’s tax will be going to support their standard of living. With the Future Fund that we have reinstated you will see the veterans cared for by their own contributions and their own employer contributions, and that is how it should be. There was a magnificent announcement yesterday by the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs of a support package worth more than $330 million to index veterans affairs disability pensions with MTAWE. That is something that the veterans community has been asking for. They have asked us to go further in terms of also pegging DFRDB with MTAWE. On our calculations, that is a $6 billion promise. I know Bernie and co. from the veterans community say: ‘No, it’s not that; it’s only $35 million. You can do this for $35 million.’ Heaven help us if the ALP ever get into government because, if they are taking those types of sums, making those types of rash promises and taking out-recklessly-$6 billion per annum, how many hospitals will go unfunded? How many schools will go unfunded? What will that do to our education sector? How do we respond to something like the equine influenza? When some outside shock hits our economy, where do we get the wherewithal to run with that? The previous speaker was talking about contemporary issues within the veterans community. I have superannuation locked up in MSBS, Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme, and I would like to see that rolled over. I, like everyone else who did less than 20 years in the military, would like to see our super rolled out. Certainly in the time. I have been in parliament I have seen MSBS perform in a manner where, after administration costs, mine actually went backwards, whilst private sector funds were streaming ahead at 10 per cent and 15 per cent. But the cost of doing that is something that needs to be looked at and needs to be considered. It is certainly something that this government is looking at in a responsible fashion. Certainly the amendment which looks at removing the tax increase that applies to members of MSBS as a consequence of the recent Better Super changes is something that I would like to see passed. As for a few of the other issues that have been raised by the opposition in relation to military super schemes, we have restored the reversionary benefit for people who have remarried pre-1979. MAIN COMMITTEE The opposition want to implement the same date as that of the civilian schemes. This can be done by other measures. Again, it shows that they really want to use a hammer on an eggshell rather than working through, in a fiscally responsible manner, issues that are put to them by the veterans community and by the people who have funds invested in these unfunded schemes. They go on to a number of other contemporary issues, which no doubt have been canvassed widely amongst the various communities affected. This government’s track record on superannuation is exemplary, and the opposition’s track record on superannuation is woeful. Every time they have seen a bucket of funds accumulated for people’s super, they have gone and raided the hollow log. Every time. Why would you put them in charge of the cookie jar once again? They have already spent the Future Fund on some broadband infrastructure for the bush or for Australia that we have stimulated the private sector to fund without any recourse to the Future Fund. On several other occasions we have seen the opposition wanting recourse to the Future Fund. Here, again, they are going to have recourse to the Future Fund to allow MSBS and DFA, Defence Families of Australia, to be rollovers. You should see their candidate in Eden-Monaro. He is an ex-military officer. He himself is facing the same fiscal issues that we all do given that we have investments in those schemes, and he has recklessly just proposed the expenditure of $6 billion for his party when he is not even in parliament yet. This is another example of the reckless disregard that the opposition consistently show on these issues. These are complex issues with knock-on effects. I have no doubt that our veterans deserve an increasing standard of living and that it should keep pace with commensurate schemes in the community, but this should not be done at the cost of services that need to be delivered for our children, for the next generation, in critical things such as health, disability, care for our aged and education. We have slowly made major contributions to that with the establishment of our education fund. We see higher education consistently funded into the future. You are seeing from this government consistent financial investment to allow these matters to run the full course. Labor, on a whim, wish to race in and destroy 12 years of good, solid, hard work. I know our veterans communities can get impatient, but I ask them to bear with us. We will be giving a better service, a truer service over a longer period of time. I urge them to remember the ALP’s raid on DFRDB. That is what put us in this situation. Up until then we had a funded scheme. It was a scheme that would have seen us continue in the future independent of any call on taxpayers. Now we find ourselves in the situation that we are in today. Let me go through the history of what this government has done on superannuation to give people an understanding of our commitment to people’s savings. We are serious about seeing elderly Australians living on something more than a straight-out pension, which is the very minimum standard below which we want no Australian to fall. We certainly want people who have been in employment all their lives, who have done serious work with the public sector and with the Defence Force, to really see the benefit of their super contributions and their savings over their lifetime and the same for those who, through various circumstances, have been unable to save and have found themselves totally reliant on a support pension in their retirement. We have introduced a scheme for workers earning less than $28,000 where we contribute $1.50 for every $1 contributed by the low-income earner. That scheme runs up until someone is earning $58,000. Our co-contribution scheme means that $2,500 each year can be contribMAIN COMMITTEE uted to someone’s super and, after a lifetime on a low-income wage, they can retire with substantial savings in excess of a quarter of a million dollars and up to half a million dollars, which will have a significant impact on their standard of living in the future. One of the important things in the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2007 is that it also makes provision for the circumstances of marital break-up, in which we frequently see the female severely disadvantaged if she has been in and out of work. We have looked at a tax rebate to encourage individuals to make superannuation contributions on behalf of their lowincome spouses-that is, for the wife who stays at home or only has a part-time job so that she has time to look after children. I think one of the most important things that we do in life is take time out to look after our children. If you make the decision that you want to dedicate a substantial amount of your time to that, you should not be penalised by your super scheme. The ability to continue contributions throughout the time that you take out of the workforce so that in retirement you have a consistent and continuous history of super contribution is an important landmark that this government can be justifiably proud of. There is capital gains tax relief for small businesses when they roll over their small business. That is a major saving. If a small business is rolled out for retirement purposes, it is free of capital gains tax. We have increased the deduction limits for superannuation contributions made by the self-employed. There are dollar for dollar deductions up to $5,000 for selfemployed people. We find that a lot of mums work from home and that having their own job or small business allows them to superannuate themselves. These are relevant issues because they show this government’s continuing dedication to improving the superannuation savings of not just our Public Service, our Commonwealth sector employees and our defence sector employees but the Australian public as a whole. You can trust this bill. You should go with the government on this one. You should ignore the ALP bleatings because in government they do something completely different and really do not manage super at all well. They now have a shadow minister for intergenerational finance. They never even understood it when they were in government. Do you seriously think they even remotely understand it in opposition? They did not even have a charter of budget honesty. They do not even do regular intergenerational reports. We have all of these reports established and reporting to parliament in an ongoing way to continually remind Australians about our ageing population, our financial obligations to those people, how those must be funded and how we can minimise the call on generations that have not yet had the benefit of their tax payments. We have seen a number of improvements in a number of sectors. I have heard the defence lobby. I obviously have a lot of sympathy for it, given my own financial situation, but I would still stick with the government in coming up with the funds to fund it rather than the ALP’s raid on the Future Fund. That is irresponsible. There are ways of doing this. When Bernie and Keith Tennant and everyone can come up with the rigorous financial investigation into the costings of these things that can really nail it down and we can negotiate things, I think we can deliver for the veterans community in a way the ALP will never be able to. They can make all sorts of wild promises in opposition, but, with 12 years experience in parliament, I know that things are not as easy as the Labor candidate in Eden-Monaro might think they are. He is straight out of the military, obviously. He has realised his pension situation and wants to help his fellow diggers, as we all do. But the opposition amendments are irresponsible. Their MAIN COMMITTEE promises are erratic and funded out of a mechanism that is just reprehensible. It leaves us in a situation where my children will be continuing to pay for pensions that should have been funded and paid for by the pensioners themselves. We have a terrific record on superannuation. We have removed the work test for those aged under 65 so that these people can contribute to super at any time after 1 July 2004. We have introduced a new transition-to-retirement policy allowing Australians aged over 55 to access their superannuation as an income stream while remaining in the workforce. We have abolished the superannuation surcharge, giving a greater incentive for higher income earners to contribute to their superannuation. We have allowed superannuation benefits to be split between married couples who separate. That is doing something for females, who traditionally have been less well superannuated than males in our community. We have increased the safety of superannuation entitlements by requiring quarterly superannuation guarantee contributions rather than annual contributions because we were seeing a number of businesses leaving their employees high and dry in the private sector-and that truly was something the ALP did in government in the public sector. They were leaving them high and dry with the promise on the never-never that the future taxpayer would pay their pension for them. That is a serious intergenerational impost that we have corrected. The list on our record on superannuation goes on and on. I urge the Australian community to understand this government’s rigour, experience, dedication and commitment to the retirement savings of Australians. We are economically sound. We have a proven track record. Why you would consider falling for the very empty promises of the opposition, who, when they were in government, hollowed out the log of the DFRDB, is beyond me. I commend the bill to the House and call for the amendments to be disregarded. Amendment Bill 2007 today I have a number of points to make. As has been mentioned earlier, I do have an amendment. I would also like to pick up on some issues from the previous speaker. I would like to start by saying to the member for Lindsay: all the very best. I know she is retiring at this election. I am happy to consider her to be someone on the other side of the House who I have a good deal of time for, and I wish her all the very best with her retirement. I am sure she will keep busy and lead a productive life. Having said all that-that is the nice bit, but then here is the catch-there are a couple of things that she said which I would like to try and address in the context of the circumstances around superannuation and the history of this area. There is no doubt that defence superannuation is a very important part of the benefits provided to our defence community, and there are very good reasons for that. There are also very good reasons why, in many cases, it should be treated differently to others, because of particular circumstances around defence service. Also, it is true to say that it is an area where there have been a range of urban myths and legends have grown over the years with respect to what has actually happened historically with defence superannuation. I would like to pick up on a couple of those on this particular occasion. There are many in the veterans community who have accused Labor of dismantling the former defence superannuation scheme-the DFRB, the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Scheme-in the early seventies. The member for Lindsay referred to that. Again, that is not really the case and it is not really clear. We need to MAIN COMMITTEE",141,Dfrdb Act Relating To Post Retirement Marriages Is Consistent With The Treatment In Civilian
297,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (10.28 Am),"In speaking on the Superannuation Legislationunderstand the history of what actually occurred with respect to the changes to defence superannuation at that time. The chronology goes something like this. In 1970, the then Liberal government, headed by John Gorton, formed the Joint Select Committee on Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Legislation in September 1970 to examine the operation and suitability of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Scheme. The committee provided its report, which was commonly known as the Jess report, to the Liberal government in May 1972. It concluded that the DFRB was unnecessarily complex. Its recommendations covered a range of things that included: the establishment of an entirely new contributory military super scheme on the grounds that DFRB lacked simplicity and was incomprehensible to servicemen; a recommendation that the new scheme be an unfunded scheme; a recommendation that all contributors to the DFRB fund be transferred to the new scheme; a recommendation that the retired pension be indexed to average weekly earnings; and a recommendation that the existing DFRB scheme, comprising members’ contributions, be transferred to the Commonwealth. As is not unusual for a conservative government, the McMahon government, as it was at that stage, sat on the report for some five months. Then, on 26 October 1972, the last sitting day before the election, the Prime Minister at the time, McMahon, outlined his response to the review. His response was that the government would amend DFRB without creating a whole new scheme but would not change it to an unfunded scheme, and the matter of indexation was referred to an independent expert. McMahon indicated that amending legislation was already being prepared. The point I would like to make in relation to that is that, on the question of funded or unfunded, it took the government of the day five months to come to a conclusion, and then, in the shadow of an election that they were expected to lose, they got scared and avoided that particular recommendation. When the Whitlam government assumed office on 22 December 1972, it accepted several of the review’s recommendations that McMahon had not accepted, such as the need for a new, simpler military super scheme which would be funded on a pay-as-you-go basis and the need to transfer DFRB members to the new scheme to ensure administrative simplicity. It referred the issue of indexation to an independent expert. The new military super scheme at the time corrected several disadvantages in the old scheme. Under DFRB, a member only received the age pension at 60; the new scheme was based on length of service, not age, allowing for the early retirement of defence personnel. This meant that ex-service personnel could receive a stable income earlier. The new scheme also would allow the commutation of a lump sum and was far simpler. It is important to remember that the committee that actually made the recommendations relating to this was set up by a conservative government, it reported to a conservative government and that conservative government accepted many of its recommendations but in fact only gave its hasty response on the last day that it could before an election that it was expected to lose. The Labor government then came in, acted upon the recommendations-not all of them, but more of the recommendations of that independent committee set up by the conservatives-and then this government, and conservative governments ever since, and there have been a few, never acted to reverse it. It will not address what it says is a fundamental problem with what occurred at that time. So it really is not quite the way the legends have built it up and it does not really take into account what really occurred. Members of the coaliMAIN COMMITTEE tion have been very happy to spread far and wide some of those urban legends, as the previous speaker did. That is why I seek to mention it today. It is a subject on which I will have more to say in the future. TodayI rise to speak particularly about issues relating to serving and former defence personnel and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2007. The bill proposes a range of amendments to both the Australian government civilian superannuation scheme and the military superannuation scheme. Three provisions hold particular relevance for defence personnel and the ex-service community. Firstly, there is the provision from 1 January 2008 to allow for prospective restoration of previously cancelled spouse pensions. This applies to persons who had previously had their spouse pensions cancelled upon remarriage. Secondly, there is the provision to ensure that the entitlement to benefits in the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 scheme relating to post-retirement marriages is consistent with their treatment in the civilian schemes. Thirdly, there is the provision to address an anomaly in the treatment of the benefits payable in the DFRDB Act scheme upon marriage breakdown. These amendments are welcome but they do not go far enough. I have been very concerned about defence superannuation over the last few months and the way in which the government seems to be operating under a veil of silence about the superannuation conditions of defence personnel. It is what is not in this bill that is relevant to defence superannuation and that particularly concerns Labor. There are a whole range of contemporary issues that need to be considered, particularly when set against the background of reforms to private sector superannuation that has occurred over the past 20 years. What has been particularly alarming has been the government’s sluggish response to remedy the tax hike imposed by the Better Super reforms on Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme members, who generally retire earlier, as a result of the new proportioning rule. People were left to wonder why the government was not acting when it was revealed on the military super website that some MSBS members, MSBS, would pay an increased tax on their partial commutation lump sum of up to 413 per cent. The government now says it will fix that, but when will this happen? I do not see such a guarantee in this bill. This is no small matter either. There are some 46,400 contributing members in the MSBS. When Labor first raised this issue, it took several goes to prod the government into doing something about it. Initially, the government refused to guarantee that members of both the forms. The government then protected DFRDB members from the tax increase but refused to explain why it did not extend that same protection to MSBS members. MSBS is the larger scheme, as I said, with more than 46,400 contributing members. Then the government refused to allow the military super review to consider the impact of the tax changes on defence superannuants. Apart from the new proportioning rule, there are a whole range of other superannuation issues that concern defence personnel and the ex-service community. These include, but are not limited to, the indexation method for defence superannuation pensions; the appropriateness of the 10 per cent tax offset, in lieu of tax-free treatment upon reaching 60 years of age, under the Better Super reforms; the taxation treatment of non-super income for defence superannuants over 60; salary sacrifice arrangements for defence personnel; portability of super choice for defence personnel; outdated life tables used to calculate superannuation benefits; MAIN COMMITTEE tax arrangements, including for those medically discharged who are in receipt of class A invalidity pensions and for those who fall under the compassionate or hardship provisions; and alignment between the preservation age of ADF members and the normal ADF compulsory retirement age. We know that the minister has the report of the military superannuation review, which addresses a number of these issues. We also know it is likely that he has had the report since July. With an election just around the corner, what is the government doing? It is sitting on the report. The independent review, announced in February 2007, was to examine the suitability of current military superannuation arrangements in the DFRDB and MSBS in light of recent changes in the areas of superannuation and the Australian Defence Force. Labor hopes that, in the absence of any action from the government, the review will provide crucial data regarding how these issues should be addressed and how military super can be improved. The proper consideration of these issues demands that the review be released immediately. Defence personnel and the ex-service community are entitled to know what the review says and what the government will do about it before the election. Are we going to see a repeat of what we saw with the McMahon government, when the response came only in the shadow of an election being called? Labor’s second reading amendment reflects the range of concerns I have briefly outlined. However, let me quickly discuss two aspects of the bill: prospective pension restoration and reversionary benefits for post-retirement marriages. This bill will enable the prospective restoration of pensions for persons who have previously had their spouse pensions cancelled upon remarriage. By way of background, prior to 1977, under the Defence Force and Retirement Benefits Act 1948 and the DFRDB Act schemes, spouse pensions were cancelled on remarriage. This cancellation never applied to the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme. Spouses who remarried before these cancellation provisions on remarriage were removed from the DFRB Act and the DFRDB Act schemes in 1977 continued to be affected by the former provisions. From1 January 2008 restrictions on the restoration of spouse pensions that were previously cancelled when a spouse remarried will be removed prospectively upon successful application. The changes will also apply to persons who have previously had their spouse pension only partially restored. The bill also amends the DFRDB Act to improve access to reversionary benefits in circumstances where the retirement pensioner commences a marital relationship after age 60. Currently, a spouse’s pension under the DFRDB Act scheme is not payable if the pensioner, who commenced a marital relationship after age 60, dies within five years of the relationship commencing. The bill removes this restriction for post-retirement relationships. This change will provide consistency between the military schemes and the civilian schemes and is a positive measure supported by Labor. However, a pro rata rate of spouse pension will be payable where the relationship existed for less than three years immediately before the pensioner’s death. Where the resulting rate of pension is small, it may in some cases be commuted to a lump sum. I note that these amendments will likewise apply to the MSBS once the necessary changes are made to the MSBS trust deed and rules. It is proposed that the new post-retirement marriage arrangements will commence on a day or days to be fixed by proclamation or six months after the act receives royal assent. However, for the sake of equity between the military and civilian schemes, Labor believes this should MAIN COMMITTEE commence from the date it applied to the civilian schemes-1 July 2003. There was no satisfactory explanation given to the committee on why this did not happen. I understand that the parliamentary secretary has considered act of grace payments and that the number of persons affected by this would be very small-less than 10 a year-so the cost would be negligible. The government has been strangely silent on these issues. It has vacated the field. I know for a fact that veterans everywhere are expressing concern and anger over current indexation arrangements. I am receiving many emails every day about this issue. The level of concern within the veterans and defence community is high and is only building, due to frustration at the government’s neglect of them. The government is shutting its eyes in the hope that this will go away. Many of the matters I have raised today were canvassed at the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee hearing on the bill. Sadly, few if any answers were received. Labor is particularly concerned that various actuarial and other modelling carried out by Treasury on a number of these matters has not been made public despite constant requests by our shadow minister, Senator Sherry, at many Senate committee hearings over many years. What is the government hiding? Why will it not be accountable to the public on this issue and why is it so scared of providing the necessary information for a full and frank debate? The second reading amendment circulated in my name seeks to address some of the deficiencies in the bill that I have discussed today and calls on the government to do the right thing by defence personnel and ex-service members and to provide the data and reports necessary to hold informed and accountable policy debate on this important matter. Serving and former defence personnel deserve no less than a government that is accountable to them on their pay and conditions. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that: (1) in the case of military schemes the restoration of a reversionary benefit, so called widow’s pension to these schemes is not to apply from the same date as civilian schemes, 1 July 2003, but supports Labor’s calls on the Government to apply the same date; (2) there is no provision to remove the tax increase that applies to members of the MSBS as a consequence of the recent Better Super changes but supports Labor’s calls on the Government to remove the tax increase; (3) there is no provision to implement equality of treatment on reversionary benefits for interdependent couples, a promise made by the Government, but yet to be implemented; (4) there are a range of contemporary issues that need to be considered in the light of reforms to private sector superannuation over the last twenty years, including; (a) indexation provision of pension entitlements; (b) interdependent relationship reversionary pension; (c) the tax increase that members of the MSBS will suffer as a consequence of the 1 July Better Super changes; (d) salary sacrifice provision for the public sector; (e) full portability for the public sector; (f) the value of the 10% rebate for untaxed schemes and income tax treatment of non-super income at age 60 and tax treatment of foreign defined benefit schemes such as Australian staff working for the United Nations, again consequences of the 1 July Better Super changes; (g) transition to retirement provisions; and MAIN COMMITTEE (h) tax treatment for class A military invalidity pensioners. and supports Labor’s calls on the Government to further investigate all these matters with a view to updating; and. (5) Treasury has a range of studies, modelling and reports on issues listed above that at the direction of government, despite numerous requests at Senate Estimates it refuses to release and is keeping secret, and supports Labor’s calls on all these to be released publicly”. I commend the amendment to the House. Ms Hall-I second the amendment. time. To this the honourable member for Bruce has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. debate on behalf of the Minister for Finance and Administration, I will say that the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2007 makes a number of enhancements to the Australian government’s civilian and military superannuation schemes. The bill removes, from 1 July 2008, the requirement for contributory members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, the CSS, to make member contributions to the scheme. As a result, member contributions will become voluntary. This will provide members with the same flexibility and incentives to contribute to superannuation that are available to the broader community. The bill also allows, from 1 July 2008, eligible members of the PSS to elect to leave the PSS and join another superannuation arrangement for the payment of future contributions. A member’s eligibility to join another superannuation arrangement will be determined by the choice arrangements that their employer has in place. From1 January 2008, the bill will enable members of the CSS to obtain early release of their funded account balances on severe financial hardship and compassionate grounds to the extent allowed under the superannuation regulatory framework. The bill will also facilitate, from 1 January 2008, the prospective restoration of pensions for persons whose spouse pensions, provided under certain closed Australian government civilian and military superannuation schemes, were cancelled upon remarriage. Upon valid application, spouse pensions cancelled upon remarriage-prior to 1976 in the civilian scheme and prior to 1977 in military scheme-will be prospectively reinstated. Changes to the CSS as a consequence of the government’s Better Super reforms are also included in the bill. The main amendment will ensure the continued payment of employer productivity contributions where a member has not provided their tax file number. This is consistent with the arrangements in the broader community, where employer contributions would still be payable even though the member has not provided their tax file number. The other amendments are technical and take account of the payment of amounts from the CSS fund in relation to release authorities issued by the Commissioner of Taxation and to reflect changed superannuation terminology. The bill also ensures that the entitlement to benefits in the military superannuation schemes relating to postretirement marriages is consistent with the treatment in the civilian schemes.

Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Debate resumed from 9 August. Second Reading tory memorandum to this bill and I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Australian Postal Corporation Amendment (Quarantine Inspection and Other Measures) Bill 2007 amends the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 to provide for the inspection and examination of postal articles carried by Australia Post for interstate quarantine purposes. The bill will implement recommendation 13 of the November 2005 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry entitled Taking control: a national approach to pest animals. The bill will also make other minor amendments to clarify the operation of certain provisions of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989. The Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 currently prohibits the opening of postal articles except in specified circumstances. These exceptions include the opening of articles suspected of containing drugs or articles on which customs duty is payable. Incoming international mail may also be opened in accordance with powers set out in the Quarantine Act 1908. However, opening the postal articles for interstate quarantine purposes is currently not allowed under the Australian Postal Corporation Act. The inspection regime proposed in the bill provides that certain procedures must be followed by state or territory quarantine inspection authorities and that specified records be kept. The record-keeping requirements will be set out in amendments to the Australian Postal Corporation Regulations 1996, which will be prepared with a view to commencing at the same time the interstate quarantine measures commence. The bill has been developed in consultation with state and territory governments and Australia Post. There is general consensus about the proposal, including that the reserved services be exempted from inspection under the scheme because of the low risk of standard letters carrying quarantine material and to ensure that Australia Post’s ability to meet its regulated performance standards is not adversely affected. The scheme will allow prescribed state and territory inspection agencies to identify and examine articles in the course of normal mail processing and enable them to deal with the article MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Dfrdb Scheme And The Msbs Would Be Protected From Higher Taxes Imposed By The Re
301,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro-Special Minister of State) (10.50 am)-I present the explanaunder the applicable state and territory laws. It is expected that participating quarantine inspection agencies will bear the cost of inspection and will assume responsibility for identifying and isolating articles which are believed to contain quarantine material. The bill also addresses the concern that Australia Post is currently treated differently from other delivery agents whose articles are potentially already able to be inspected under the applicable state and territory law. It is expected that, once the bill is enacted, Australia Post will no longer be treated differently to other private delivery agents. At this stage, Western Australia, Tasmania and Northern Territory have indicated a wish to be prescribed in the regulations, which will enable them to take advantage of the bill’s provisions to inspect postal articles carried by Australia Post for interstate quarantine purposes. The other jurisdictions have taken the view that they consider the biosecurity risks associated with the interstate mailing system to be relatively low and that their focus is better directed at the general risk posed by people and personal effects moving across state borders. The bill will enable them to participate in the scheme by the making of further regulations, should they later decide to participate. It is proposed that the interstate quarantine provisions and other provisions in schedule 1 to the bill will commence on proclamation but not later than six months after royal assent. This will allow sufficient time for those quarantine inspection authorities which intend to implement an interstate quarantine inspection scheme to make appropriate administrative arrangements. The bill also contains a number of other amendments. The bill includes amendments to allow compliance agencies such as the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service a discretion to pass information to Australia Post regarding seized articles. This information will, in turn, be able to be passed to other postal administrations. This will ensure that Australia Post is not unnecessarily liable to other postal administrations under the acts of the Universal Postal Union and is better able to respond to queries about missing mail. The bill also contains a measure which will streamline the disclosure of scam mail to consumer protection agencies. Once the bill is enacted, Australia Post will be able to hold suspected scam mail for inspection by a consumer protection agency. If upon inspection the mail is found to be evidence of a breach of a consumer protection law, the mail will be able to be dealt with by the relevant consumer protection agency in accordance with the laws they administer. If mail is not found to be scam mail, it will be returned to the mail system as soon as possible. These changes will better protect consumers by allowing the earlier interception of scam mail than is currently possible. The bill also contains minor technical amendments to ensure that the Australian Postal Corporation Act reflects the introduction of the GST and wine tax. A further measure will provide the minister with the flexibility to exempt Australia Post from the current requirement to prepare a service improvement plan where the minister considers the preparation of the plan is unnecessary in the circumstances. These would include circumstances where the failure to meet a performance standard was beyond the control of Australia Post or if Australia Post had already implemented measures to address any drop in performance. MAIN COMMITTEE The bill also includes an amendment to allow regulations made under the act to deal with determining the level of mail delivery service. For example, this would enable a regulation to set out processes to be used by Australia Post for polling communities to determine whether delivery services should be provided ‘to the property’ if regulation in this area became necessary. I commend the bill to the House. ration Amendment (Quarantine Inspection and Other Measures) Bill 2007. Labor supports this bill as it provides for the removal of legislative anomalies, the prevention of the spread of pests across jurisdictions, the equitable application of the wine equalisation tax, the reduction of scam mail and improved compliance with the Universal Postal Convention. The bill seeks to remove legislative anomalies that currently prohibit the inspection and examination of interstate articles carried by Australia Post for quarantine purposes except in certain circumstances. Currently unless there is a suspicion that the article contains drugs or that customs duty is payable Australia Post is not authorised to inspect an article. However, articles that are moved interstate by carriers other than Australia Post are not subject to the same prohibitions against opening. This bill seeks to resolve this anomaly and is therefore welcome. The government has chosen to apply these quarantine provisions only to those states that wish to be bound and it has made provision for other jurisdictions to opt into this process by amending regulations at a later date if they choose to do so. At this stage only Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory have expressed interest in coming under the scheme. I understand that the other jurisdictions have taken the view that they consider the biosecurity risks associated with the interstate mail system to be relatively low. That various jurisdictions will not participate in the inspection of interstate articles seems to me to undermine the integrity of the system that the bill seeks to establish. This provision may need to be reviewed in the future. The bill also goes some way towards preventing the spread of pest species between states and territories by providing for the inspection and examination for quarantine purposes of postal articles carried interstate by Australia Post. Action and reform in this area are welcome. Numerous submissions have been made to two inquiries held over the course of the last five years. Interested parties called for the Commonwealth government to strengthen the national effort in order to control and manage invasive species. The reports emerging from the two inquiries, namely the Turning back the tide: the invasive species challenge report tabled in 2002 and the Taking control: a national approach to pest animals report tabled in 2005, reflect the strong call for more involvement by the federal government in dealing with the problem of pest animals. The bill before us seeks to legislate relevant recommendations contained within these reports and is therefore welcome. The bill also provides for the opening of international articles where there is reasonable suspicion that GST and/or the wine equalisation tax is payable. Labor supports this amendment as it ensures that an equitable system of taxation and import duty is imposed on all. On the issue of scam mail, which is also dealt with in this bill, various consumer protection agencies have expressed concerns about the increasing amount of scam mail received by households throughout Australia. Scam mail is a serious problem. Unsuspecting and vulnerable Australians can be negatively affected by scam mail, so Labor believes there must be MAIN COMMITTEE",153,Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Quarantine Inspection And Other Measures Bill 2007
302,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (10.56 Am),"I rise to speak on the Australian Postal Corpoeffective consumer protection measures in place at the national level to protect us. Scam mail can arrive in Australia in large batches from a single overseas location in envelopes that are virtually identical. Once identified, batches of such mail can be readily removed from the mail stream. This bill makes provision for the removal of batches of articles from the normal course of carriage where there is reasonable suspicion that the batches contain scam mail. Once removed, Australia Post is required to notify the ACCC, the Australian Securities Investment Commission and/or the consumer protection agency for the state or territory in which the removal has occurred. This provision has the support of the Labor Party; however, I note that it is important that the removal of mail be monitored so that articles are not unnecessarily delayed. The proposed amendments will also allow Australia Post to request information from a compliance agency such as the Australian Customs Service, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service or a consumer protection agency about articles that have been removed from the normal course of carriage for reasons of quarantine or scam mail in order to comply with its obligations under the Universal Postal Convention. Australia Post will be able to request information on matters including the name and address of the sender and/or recipient of the article, a description of the article’s contents and any other information prescribed by the regulations. The compliance agency may accept or refuse the request. While this provision is necessary in order to make a fair determination about how to deal with any mail removed from the normal course of carriage, Labor notes that this amendment may have privacy implications and that any privacy or information-sharing issues that may arise should be dealt with promptly and in a serious manner. The various changes put forward in the bill are sound and sensible. I am also encouraged to read that this bill has been developed in consultation with state and territory governments. I commend the bill to the House. me in the absence of the minister. I just simply thank the member for Grayndler for his contribution to this important debate.

306,Mr Hardgrave,"I thank the member for Grayndler for his contribution. On behalf of Transport and Regional Services Committee Report Debate resumed from 13 August, on motion by Mr Neville: That the House take note of the report. The great freight task report. In opening my remarks I would like to thank the chair, the member for Hinkler, and other committee members. I commend the chairman for his conscientious attendance at the meetings and an outstanding report. I also thank Mr Tas Luttrell, who was the secretary to the committee. This is a landmark report. It will act as a benchmark for transport in Australia, be it road, rail or sea. Fundamentally, the initial task of this committee was to investigate the connection between the ports and other modes of transport. However, the committee in its deliberations and its inspections of ports all around Australia developed some other aspects of the report. The evaluation of the road freight task, the rail freight task, the intermodal activity plus the operation of the ports around the eastern seaboard and Western Australia is to be commended in terms of what the committee observed and some of the recommendations. Obviously the fundamental task facing Australia is the doubling of the freight tonnage by 2020. Everyone in this parliament should be aware that freight movements in Australia in a very short period of time will double so that we will need better roads, better trucks and a better railway system. Of course, the sea trade for exports and imports will need to be improved, as will the operation of our port structure. In the time available I want to refer to some aspects of the report that I have some interest in. As members would be aware, I have had an interest in the rail systems of Australia, having participated in the Tracking Australia report. I have had an ongoing interest in making sure that the rail task is improved, that railway systems do reach the 21st century and that they make a contribution to the moving of freight, both internally and for export. I will deal with some of the aspects in the report. Looking at the containers, which are moving in both the export trade and internally, I will deal with some of the observations that there are increasing numbers of containers being used, there is a growing proportion of 40foot containers replacing the 20-foot size and there is a need to move double stacked containers along rail routes. Those observations cover an enormous number of problems. If you go to the urban areas of Australia, you see different types of containers, but I am delighted that in fact there is a movement to the bigger container, compatible with international trade. I was part of the inspection of the Port of Melbourne. It is worth noting that the Port of Melbourne is Australia’s biggest container and general cargo port. It handles 39 per cent of Australia’s container trade, amounting to 1.7 million TEUs in 2003-04. Melbourne acts as a natural cargo hub. That is a pretty important feature of the Port of Melbourne. Obviously other ports around Australia do play a very important role. It is worth noting that the committee were briefed on the problem of the channel dredging. We note in the report: The port management has plans to dredge the channel to 14 metres. This measure is necessary because 30 per cent of the visiting container ships cannot enter or leave the port fully laden. MAIN COMMITTEE",156,Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Quarantine Inspection And Other Measures Bill 2007
307,Mr Mcarthur (Corangamite) (11.05 Am),"I am very pleased to make a contribution onThat fact is of critical importance. As container ships become bigger, obviously the Melbourne port will have less accessibility, so it is fundamentally important for both Victoria and Australia that that dredging operation is completed. I understand the political sensitivities of environmental concerns and the politics of the people who live around Port Phillip Bay, but in the longer term we need to ensure that that dredging is completed and that the Melbourne port continues to play its pre-eminent role in access for containers into Australia. Some of the issues that the committee looked at with regard to port access included: the channel dredging in Melbourne, as I have mentioned; the removal of curfew restrictions at Port Kembla, which I visited; the rail connection of Web Dock to Melbourne; the review of the capacity of West Gate Bridge; the dock line in Melbourne; the reinstatement of the standard gauge link between Mount Gambier and Portland, which the committee had a good look at; and the overpass at Wellington Road at Portland. There is a great list of other quite significant changes that would add to the efficiency of rail access to ports, particularly on the eastern seaboard. Looking at the rail network, there is a very good summary in the report on the problems facing rail operators, particularly with regard to access difficulty. I note the problems identified in the report. The committee looked at some of the problems regarding access to Sydney from the south, north and west. Historically, the committee are very aware of that access through both the geography of Sydney and the problem of making access to the port through the metropolitan area. Regarding the line from the Queensland border to Brisbane, again the geography is difficult for that particular proposition. Regarding the southern Sydney freight line, it is very important that we can have a single, special purpose freight line through Sydney rather than it being committed to the domination by the passenger lines in the Sydney orbit. The committee had a good look at the problem of the Hunter Valley coal chain, and I think some good work has been done by ARTC in improving that. That is a pretty good system compared to world standards, but obviously improvements could be undertaken. Regarding missing rail links in the Hunter Valley, some of the crucial parts of the Hunter Valley rail link could be improved. Those of us who have been interested in the issue of the line through or around the Toowoomba ranges know that that is a major impediment for the Brisbane to Melbourne line. Regarding the missing rail links in Queensland coalfields, with massive exports of coal, we need to ensure that in 2007 we can do it efficiently. And there is the rail connectivity in Victoria and across the South Australian border. Some of those issues identified problems that the committee found in the rail area. I would just like to quote Mr Vince O’Rourke, who is a very well known and very well respected railway man-a former head of Queensland Rail. He put a most interesting proposition to the committee in terms of the Melbourne-Brisbane link. I think his quote is fantastic. It says what the parliament and governments of all political colours should be thinking about in the future: Regarding the Melbourne to Brisbane railway line proposal … let us build a new railway line, and a decent one. This is a position I was advocating when I was in QR. Why don’t we do something that the rest of the world does? …We see modern freight trains and passenger trains throughout Europe and the great railways of North America. …We will patch up another railway and think we are doing pretty good to get along at 80 kilometres per hour when we should be thinking about freight trains that will travel up to 160 kilometres per hour, which happens in other parts of the world. MAIN COMMITTEE We are suggesting that we should build a modern railway between Melbourne and Brisbane on the shortest corridor of about 1,600 to 1,650 kilometres, west of the Great Dividing Range on the flat country with very low gradients, that it should cater for high speed freight trains up to 160 kilometres per hour and double-stack trains travelling at up to 120 kilometres per hour. It should have the capacity for fast tilting trains that would run between Melbourne and Brisbane and probably more importantly that would service the regional areas of southern Queensland and northern Victoria. In philosophic terms, that encapsulates the thinking of the committee-that we should really try very hard to improve the rail system. We should invest some capital, both private and government money, to look very carefully at that inland route, but more importantly we should have a railway system that works, is modern and can reach those higher speeds. One of the debates that the committee had was the significance of intermodal terminals, and there has been a lot of debate on this subject amongst transport operators on the seaboard and inland. On intermodal terminals, the report says: The intermodal sector consists of two subsystems; one servicing import and export (port oriented) movements and the other supporting interstate freight movements. In many ways these operations are independent of each other, but some terminals cater to both port-oriented and domestic movements. This debate about the operation of intermodal terminals has been going on for some time. There is a strong argument that freight and containers should be moved from the ports to an intermodal terminal and then distributed around the areas of population. It is interesting to note that most of the containers coming into Sydney are distributed in about a 35-kilometre area, so there is a tendency to use road transport. Those other containers are being encouraged to go to intermodal terminals where they can be distributed in an efficient manner. The debate is ongoing, and various proponents of Parkes, west of Sydney, are suggesting that intermodal operations are the way to go. That debate is yet to be concluded, and it is a matter of logistics and the use of modern technology. In Melbourne, the Somerton intermodal operation is showing great promise in view of its proximity to the port and its proximity to the national standard gauge. In conclusion, some of us have had a long standing interest in freight operations. It is not an issue that excites interest in the parliament but, in the long run, the standard of living of Australians will depend very much on the ability of freight to be moved efficiently across this broad continent. The movement of freight from Western Australia to the eastern seaboard is now done about 80 per cent on rail, which is a very big change from what was done historically. The development of the Australian Rail Track Corporation has been a wonderful step in the right direction. Mr David Marchant, who is the managing director of that operation, has proved the theoretical concepts that rail can operate an efficient track system and that independent operators can move on that track system at a profit. This has been a major change in policy position-that, in Australia, where we have had three different gauges going back to the turn of the century, we now have a standard gauge going from Brisbane to Perth, and this is being improved all the time. So there is great hope that this parliament and state parliaments can move in the right direction to inject some funds into the port and rail facilities. There is also hope from the ongoing injection of funds into the national highway system. There is always great debate on the way in which we inject funds into the road network: is it MAIN COMMITTEE done on political grounds or is it done on the rational grounds of improving the national freight task? I commend the report. I have been delighted to participate in these deliberations. I also commend the photograph on the front of the report, which depicts the fundamental argument that some of the freight now moved by road could be placed in the top of a flat-top rail wagon; it shows what could be done at container ports. I hope that the report stands the test of time and that it will be used as a reference work for those who are interested in these important activities of shifting freight through our ports, shifting freight internally and, of course, exporting all those important goods and services that we export around the world. I commend the report. Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (11.20 am)-This report of the House of Representatives Transport and Regional Services Committee inquiry into the integration of regional road and rail networks and their interface with the ports highlights areas of critical need in our transport infrastructure and very carefully documents what is required at each of the various ports to increase capacity, which is a very important aspect of keeping up with the demands of freight in Australia. Having said that, I will be focusing on the port of Fremantle, which is my local port. What is very interesting-and this is something this report highlighted is at just about every single port that we visited-is that, when major cities and regional centres in Australia are building roads and ring-roads to protect suburbs and towns from heavy traffic, heavy through-traffic and road freight, the Western Australian Labor government has been dismantling crucial components of the Metropolitan Region Scheme. This is a magnificent forwardthinking plan for the future growth and transport network needs for the south metropolitan region well into the 21st century. This is a plan that has been in place for over 40 years. The components of the scheme were the Fremantle Eastern Bypass and the final stage of the Roe Highway-stage 8. The Roe Highway road reserve was first set aside in the Metropolitan Region Scheme in 1963 and it forms part of the ring-road system which surrounds the Perth metropolitan region. More than 40 years of planning of a sustainable transport network has now been absolutely destroyed by the Gallop and Carpenter Labor governments. Why? To serve the short-term political gain and self-interest of Labor MPs. The alignment of Roe Highway stage 8 was to have run from the Kwinana Freeway to the Fremantle Eastern Bypass, allowing a controlled, purpose-built transport road to the port of Fremantle. I say ‘was to have run’ because the Fremantle Eastern Bypass has been deleted from the Metropolitan Region Scheme by a Labor government which saw no use for an essential integrated transport system. This action flies in the face of the assistance that AusLink was to give the states. The state Labor government’s decision to delete the Fremantle Eastern Bypass and not complete stage 8 of the Roe Highway effectively destroyed a safe and efficient route for freight and traffic. This has resulted in the ever-increasing lethal mix of commuter traffic and heavy freight on the major highways running through my electorate of Tangney, which is mainly residential with schools, colleges, Murdoch University, retirement villages, a major hospital campus, hospice and shopping centres. The increases in freight vehicles and other traffic also negatively impacts on the electorate of the federal Labor member for Fremantle, who conveniently forgot to represent her constituents who wanted to retain the Fremantle Eastern Bypass. MAIN COMMITTEE ern Bypass built for their own safety and for relief from the freight vehicles that are increasingly invading their streets. However, the member for Fremantle did remember that her state Labor crony Jim McGinty had promised 100-odd voters that he would make their properties more valuable by deleting a crucial road reserve. So much for the one-vote, one-value champion! Thousands want the bypass built-hundreds do not-but Labor does not care. This politically motivated decision was rationalised with junk planning. You know that I am incensed by junk science; the Labor Party have discovered junk planning. They replaced a brilliant and successful transport network system with a six-point plan. Labor seem to love these six-point plans. Have a look through their documents; there are six-point plans everywhere. What was this plan? The big solution, point 1, was to put more freight on rail. Labor’s promise was that 30 per cent of freight would be on rail by 2006. Halfway through 2007, what do we have? Around five per cent to six per cent. Great planning! To achieve Labor’s target, you would have to run 600-metre-long double-stacked container trains at least three times a day through the heritage and tourism precincts of Fremantle. It would take about 15 minutes for each train to get through level crossings. But McGinty’s few voters are happy. They do not live anywhere near the noise and delays. Here is the kicker: even if the government put 30 per cent of freight on rail, what would happen to the other 70 per cent? Do Alannah MacTiernan and her Labor government expect it to levitate over residential areas, schools, universities and hospitals? Of course, it was the Lawrence government that deleted it in 1992, and a Liberal government had to clean up the mess in 1994. Even in those days, Labor ignored expert advice and community needs. The planning department, Main Roads, Fremantle port authority and surrounding councils strongly recommended the retention of the Fremantle Eastern Bypass. This was in addition to independent consultations and over 1,000 submissions from the public calling for the retention of the bypass. History repeated itself in 2004 when the Gallop government deleted the Fremantle Eastern Bypass, yet again, knowing that the need for the FEB was demonstrably greater. The unpredicted growth in Spearwood and the industrial areas in Cockburn, Canning Vale and Welshpool made the need for the completion of the ring-road blindingly obvious. The government’s own consultants had advised against the dismantling of the thoroughly planned integrated transport route. Labor ignored the results of its own consultation process and a record 8,290 submissions received from people and businesses that strongly objected to the deletion of the Fremantle Eastern Bypass. Submissions came from as far away as the Port of Albany in the south. The significance of the freight route to the port of Fremantle was clearly appreciated state wide. Even as late as 1997, the Main Roads report on the Fremantle Eastern Bypass stated that it would provide a vital link in the integrated transport network and that it would remove through-traffic and heavy vehicles from Fremantle streets, with accidents on Hampton Road predicted to fall by as much as 50 per cent. But Labor did not care. The Labor government’s consultants, Sinclair Knight Merz, clearly stated that the FEB and Roe Highway stage 8 were integral components of the freight network-something the majority of residents, transport companies and the TWU had been telling the Labor government free of charge. Did the queen of controlled community consultation, Alannah MacTiernan, listen? No. She rejected the advice of her own department’s consultants and that of the people diMAIN COMMITTEE",157,Committees
308,Mr Hardgrave,Is that why she is retiring?,161,Committees
309,Dr Jensen,"It could be. The majority of Fremantle residents wanted the Fremantle Eastrectly impacted by the cynical and politically motivated decision. The report made a mockery of the WA Labor government’s six-point plan, touted as the alternative to the ring-road. The minister wanted the report rewritten because it did not suit her politically motivated and antiplanning purposes. In order to deal with the pesky objections that were still coming out loudly and clearly from betrayed communities across three councils-Canning and Melville in my electorate and Fremantle in the member for Fremantle’s electorate-the farce called the Local Impacts Committee was formed by Alannah MacTiernan, minister for misrepresentation and misinformation, and chaired by the disgraced former minister Tony McRae. McRae did not even care about his electorate of Riverton because he does not even live there. He even privately admitted that the bypass of Roe Highway stage 8 should be built. The Local Impacts Committee comprised Labor government MPs, members of MacTiernan’s Department of Planning and Infrastructure, and Main Roads Western Australia. They had to compromise their professional integrity by toeing the party line to keep their jobs. They had seen what happened to the engineers who had expressed opposing views to the minister’s intentions. Representatives from the City of Melville and the City of Canning were hopelessly and purposefully outnumbered so that the chair did not have to worry about their votes. These are the council areas through which we are getting this massive build-up of traffic. The state Labor government has spent $32 million on the rail loop at the port. More than half of that amount was Commonwealth funding. It is still only taking about five to six per cent of the freight. With Fremantle Ports planning to deepen the harbour and expecting growth of about 10 per cent per annum, this growth in traffic will be travelling through our suburbs, past homes, schools, colleges, universities, hospitals, retirement villages and shopping centres. Growth in container traffic is increasing by 3½ per cent per annum-501,400 TEUs and growing. The vast majority of container freight has its origin and destination in the metropolitan area. Even the optimistic projection of carrying 30 per cent of this on rail will not alleviate the current and future congestion and its associated dangers on suburban roads. My electorate, and that of the member for Fremantle, will continue to see an increase in road trauma from a lethal mix of heavy freight and family cars as the WA Labor government ignores the need for a completed integrated transport plan. Indeed, when we held hearings in Perth, I put the question to MacTiernan’s bureaucrat as to what studies had been conducted to indicate that the FEB should be deleted. His response was that it was a state government decision. I repeated the question and he repeated that it was a state government decision. In other words, no planning and no analysis has been conducted and a route has been deleted that has been in the planning for over 40 years. We have travelled throughout Australia and had hearings in all sorts of ports and towns. Just about everywhere, they indicated how important it is that ring-roads be completed. What do we have in Western Australia? We have the enviable situation where we have most of a ring-road completed and we have land set aside for the completion of the ring-road; and the state Labor government is deleting the final portion of it-the portion that is actually critical to the entire thing because it leads right into the port of Fremantle. The Labor government in Western Australia need to rethink the way in which they have planned for our future freight task. They need to complete both Roe Highway stage 8 and the MAIN COMMITTEE Fremantle Eastern Bypass to ensure that we have a freight network that is viable in the 21st century. Mr Deputy Speaker Quick. The independence of the chair is absolutely assured; there is no doubt. The member for Tangney has explained the situation very well so that even I, a Queenslander, can understand and visualise the sorts of problems that obviously he and the member for Canning are far more intimately aware of. I think he has done a great service to the parliament with regard to The great freight task report that we are considering. I want to congratulate the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services on the clarity they have brought to the issues in my electorate of Moreton. The Acacia Ridge intermodal terminal is mainly contained within my electorate, and I am greatly indebted to the committee for flushing out something that the Queensland government simply will not fess up to-that is, that the Queensland Rail controlled facility located 15 kilometres from the Brisbane CBD has, according to this report, some 380,000 TEUs, which, essentially, are 20-foot or longer containers, passing through it each year. The thing that frustrates me-and people in this place have heard me talk about this so many times over the years, and we are getting progress-is that the Howard government, under Auslink, had to negotiate contractual access to the Brisbane-Sydney rail freight line, owned and operated by Queensland Rail. It is amazing, isn’t it, that we had to negotiate to get access to a railway line 100 or so kilometres from the New South Wales border to the Acacia Ridge rail freight terminal? The QR freight terminal at Acacia Ridge then unpacks the trains and puts the goods on the backs of trucks, which then rat run through my electorate, down McCullough Street in the main these days. McCullough Street is now reporting about an 80 per cent increase in the number of trucks. People in my area are being confronted by trucks, authorised by the Queensland government to rat run down that road to get on to the Gateway motorway to go to the port of Brisbane, where the other great intermodal terminal referred to in this particular report is located. From 1993 to 1996 the Keating government had a program called One Nation. That program was about building a stronger rail network in certain areas. For the first time ever in history a standard gauge rail line was built from Acacia Ridge rail freight terminal to the Port of Brisbane, running mainly through the member for Griffith’s electorate-and I do not mean any disservice to him by that observation. But if I ever see a train on that line, I will give somebody $100, because they have to negotiate the signalling systems of the Queensland Rail Gold Coast line which runs right through my electorate. In other words, the passengers get the priority, which is exactly what the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services is outlining as a fundamental farce in the way our rail freight and intermodal systems are operating. To sum up: people in my electorate get B-double trucks and 380,000 20-foot containers a year thundering through suburbs, past people’s letterboxes, instead of going down Beaudesert Road and onto the Logan Motorway-the only toll road in the whole state of Queensland. QR refuses to pay a toll to its own government, so it sends all its trucks thundering through my electorate. I welcome this report because it brings some clarity to the argument. It also highlights the folly of the federal Labor Party’s policy to build a $300 million priority road for trucks MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Committees
310,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (11.34 Am),"It is a delight to be able to speak before you,through my electorate. They want to extend the Ipswich Motorway onto the Kessels Road corridor and turn it into a Kessels highway-a six-lane extension of the Ipswich Motorway, giving a green light to interstate trucks, while local residents have to wait for the trucks to pass. That is the plan they have for the corner of Kessels Road and Mains Road. It shows the folly which it is. The report also outlines the plans of the Beaudesert Shire Council to move some of that intermodal work to Bromelton, about 50 kilometres south of Acacia Ridge. But either way, if we make better use of rail and actually bring the trains all the way to, say, the Port of Brisbane, you could have a dry port in Brisbane, where the movement of containers could be undertaken in one spot-the Port of Brisbane. You could have road, rail and sea all co-located in one spot. The basic infrastructure is there, but instead we have a lazy approach, a lack of planning, which simply means local residents in my electorate have to suffer as the trucks go by. Finally, the scariest part of this report is that it forecasts a seven to 10 per cent increase in the number of trucks that will come out of Acacia Ridge. According to this report, King& Co. may have said that Acacia Ridge’s future is constrained by the fact there are so many residential communities nearby, but the point I make is that residents in my electorate are suffering every day-24 hours a day, seven days a week-because of the lack of planning by the Queensland government with regard to the rail freight task. I commend the report to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Somlyay) adjourned. Health and Ageing Committee Report Debate resumed from 9 August, on motion by Mr Somlyay: That the House take note of the report. report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing inquiry into the health benefits of breastfeeding. Due to the pressure of the business of the HouseI was not able to speak to the report at the time; nevertheless, the committee felt that we should table the report because it was World Breastfeeding Week. The report is entitled The best start-report of the inquiry into the health benefits of breastfeeding, and the committee is clear in its belief that breastfeeding really does provide the best start for the youngest and most vulnerable of our community members. The genesis of the report came during the committee’s inquiry into health funding, when a submission was received on the health benefits of breastfeeding. The evidence pointed to the fact that breastfeeding babies would have long-term financial benefits for the health budget in the out years. We could not consider the submission at that late stage but we agreed to have a short, sharp inquiry later into the health benefits of breastfeeding, following the completion of the health funding inquiry. When we first started the inquiry into the health benefits of breastfeeding, the committee noted the amount of guilt and emotion that surrounds the subject. Initially, most of the submissions were from breastfeeding mothers, so the committee actively sought submissions from mothers who had chosen to bottle-feed, to give us another perspective. The committee were very sensitive at all times to the problem of making mothers feel guilty if they had made MAIN COMMITTEE",163,Committees
311,Mr Somlyay (Fairfax) (11.40 Am),"It gave me great pleasure on 9 August to table thethe decision not to breastfeed. Mothers making the decision either to breastfeed or to formulafeed their babies need the best available information, and the committee recognised this need for additional support and information. The health benefits of breastfeeding are numerous and are backed up with evidence. Breastfeeding protects babies against common infections such as those of the gut and the respiratory tract. It lowers the risk of ear infections and allergies and asthma may also be prevented, because the special properties of breastmilk help to give the baby a stronger immune system. The impact of breastfeeding upon chronic disease is also important. Evidence suggests that there is a link between breastfeeding and weight gain in later life. The good early nutrition provided by breastmilk could lessen the risk of obesity in childhood and adulthood. Research is continuing on the links between breastfeeding and other chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. The health benefits of breastfeeding are not limited to the baby alone. Breastfeeding also helps the mother to recover more quickly from childbirth and lowers the risk of breast cancer. The most recent national health survey found that 83 per cent of women initiated breastfeeding when they were discharged from hospital, that several weeks later many women had stopped breastfeeding and that by six months only 48 per cent of babies were receiving any breastmilk. The dietary guidelines for children and adolescents in Australia say that the goal of having 80 per cent of women exclusively breastfeeding for six months ‘is achievable’. The committee found that women want to breastfeed, health professionals want women to breastfeed and babies want to be breastfed, but somewhere along the way something has changed with breastfeeding and it has become a complex activity for many women. So what goes wrong? In the early days after they had given birth, many women found that breastfeeding was a lot more painful and complex than they had expected. They got lots of conflicting advice from different nurses and midwives and found themselves discharged from hospital within a couple of days, trying to learn how to breastfeed at home by themselves. When mothers take their babies to the maternal and child health service they may be told that their baby is not gaining enough weight and that they should give the baby some formula. When mothers go to a shopping centre and try to breastfeed in public they are told to go and do that somewhere in private or told that what they are doing is disgusting. Even at home mothers can be told by their family that if they give their baby some formula it will sleep through the night, which will be better for everyone. At every point along the way it seems our mothers are not given enough support to breastfeed. The committee considers that the Commonwealth government needs to develop a national strategy to promote and support breastfeeding. The rates of breastfeeding in Australia need to be monitored more accurately, especially in remote and Indigenous communities. There needs to be more research in Australia into the health benefits of breastfeeding and into the best ways to promote and support breastfeeding. The committee was told that partners are a big influence on a breastfeeding mother, so they need to be included in breastfeeding education. Maybe there could be special programs for them, like the Talking Dads program at Melbourne’s Royal Women’s Hospital. A key recommendation of the committee is that more needs to be done to educate the community on the benefits of breastfeeding and on how the community can support breastfeeding mothers. The committee found that there was still a strong belief in the community that infant formula was as good as breastmilk. This is not true, MAIN COMMITTEE and the community should be helping breastfeeding mothers rather than telling them to use formula. However, we recognise that it is important to support mothers who for whatever reason choose not to or cannot breastfeed. These mothers need to be able to access information from health professionals, and this information needs to be accurate and informative. The committee considers donor breastmilk banks could be critical in saving the lives of sick and premature babies and found that there were many women in the community who would happily donate their excess breastmilk. The committee visited the Mothers Milk Bank at John Flynn Private Hospital Medical Centre on the Gold Coast and heard from several parents how the donor milk had contributed to saving the lives of their children. The committee observed the work of the Australian Breastfeeding Association in the community and believes they do a great deal for breastfeeding. The committee was so impressed with the support the ABA provides to mothers that it has recommended that a national, toll-free, 24-hour number helpline be funded. Returning to work and breastfeeding are two things that are often difficult to combine. Employers can greatly assist women to continue breastfeeding while working by providing lactation breaks and a room with appropriate facilities and just by being encouraging. We should provide leadership here at Parliament House, and to this end the committee has recommended: That the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate take the appropriate measures to enable the formal accreditation by the Australian Breastfeeding Association of Parliament House as a Breastfeeding Friendly Workplace. The health system has taken steps to improve how it supports breastfeeding, with the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative. The committee considers that this initiative should be implemented in all maternity hospitals and has recommended accordingly. The committee considers that any strategy to improve rates of breastfeeding in Australia needs to provide protection for breastfeeding as well as support and advice to expectant and new mothers. The committee has taken the decisive step of recommending that the World Health Organisation International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes, better known as the WHO code, be implemented in Australia, because the committee considers that mothers need the best information they can get when making a decision on how to feed their baby. I have often said during the course of the inquiry that this is not a witch-hunt against manufacturers. The committee welcomed evidence from the infant formula manufacturers. It acknowledged that, when breastmilk in any form is not available, the only suitable alternative nutrition for infants is infant formula. The committee also reaffirms its support to all mothers. Compiling such a comprehensive report relies on the assistance of many people. The committee would like to thank the many individuals and organisations who assisted by making a submission or giving evidence at a hearing. Their expertise and experience are greatly valued and it laid a strong foundation for our deliberations. We would also like to acknowledge those who spoke from the heart and told us of their experience about breastfeeding. It was clear that for many women breastfeeding was very difficult, and it is a topic that still fills them with emotion. For others, we could see how fulfilling they found breastfeeding to be. The committee was fortunate to hear directly from several well-respected organisations and groups who promote and support breastfeeding in the community. We thank the Australian Breastfeeding Association, the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Uniting MAIN COMMITTEE Church in Australia and the Baby Friendly Health Initiative. There were more groups than I have time to mention, but the committee would like to extend its appreciation for their participation. The committee also thanks the members of the Gulf communities in Queensland at Pormpuraaw and Kowanyama in remote Far North Queensland. We visited these communities as part of the inquiry and were very appreciative of the time that they gave to the committee. I would also like to place on record our thanks to the hard working secretariat staff, under the guidance of James Catchpole. James is in the clerk’s chair at the moment. As usual, James has ensured that his team has provided first-class support. I especially want to mention Pauline Brown, who had carriage of this inquiry. It was Pauline’s very first inquiry, and I do not think I have ever seen in my 17 years in parliament a more conscientious officer. Pauline went through a baptism of fire and came out very well indeed. I would also like to thank Lauren and Meg for their expert assistance. I must thank my fellow committee members for the assistance they provided in the course of the inquiry-in particular, deputy chair Steve Georganas, and the previous deputy chair, Jill Hall. I commend the report to the House. bers of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, especially the chair, Alex Somlyay, the member for Fairfax, for his great chairing of the meetings of this inquiry. I would like to thank the secretariatMr James Catchpole, the secretary, Ms Pauline Brown, and Meg Byrne and Lauren Walker-for all their assistance in making this committee work and run so smoothly. I would also like to thank all the individuals who lodged submissions with the committee and the witnesses who attended the hearings for being part of the inquiry into the benefits of breastfeeding. The inquiry and its subsequent report would not have been possible without the assistance and input of all these people. It was good to see that the inquiry generated nearly 500 submissions-in fact, a total of 497 submissions. There was a great amount of public interest. There was a flood of submissions to the health and ageing committee. At some of our hearings, there was standing room only for people who came to watch the proceedings. The report, titled The best start-report of the inquiry into the health benefits of breastfeeding, found that many different factors may influence a mother’s decision to provide breast milk or to use formula for her newborn child. It found that a mother’s decision to use one feeding method over another may be related to cultural background, the mother’s health or a personal preference. Whichever decision a mother comes to, they should be supported by the Australian community and Australia’s health system because it is the responsibility of every new mother to assess her own personal circumstances when making a decision about whether to breastfeed or to use a formula. It is our role to ensure that the services are in place so that Australian mums have the information they need to make an informed decision. Breastfeeding has been practised for centuries. Breastfeeding is very natural; it is one of the most natural occurrences that takes place in a woman’s life. Somehow, we in the Western world have made it very clinical over a couple of generations. The key to promoting breastfeeding is in educating our society to better understand what it means to breastfeed. Education about breastfeeding and how to breastfeed is very much needed for a new mother in pregnancy and soon after the birth of her child so that she is aware of the shortand long-term health benefits and has all the information in front of her to make an informed choice on MAIN COMMITTEE",164,Committees
312,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (11.52 Am),"I would like to begin by thanking all memwhether she breastfeeds or not. There should be a concerted effort to change the attitude of society so that, once again, breastfeeding becomes a very natural, normal thing that takes place in a woman’s life. How do we change an entire society’s view of this issue? That is the big question. We have somehow, as I said earlier, changed breastfeeding from something that was very natural for thousands of years, passed from mother to daughter, generation to generation, to something that is no longer the cultural norm. The report of the inquiry into breastfeeding outlines the health and other benefits of breastfeeding, noting that breastfeeding protects against gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses and ear infections, just to name a few. These illnesses have the ability to impact adversely on the health of a newborn baby. Breastfeeding has also been identified as a factor in contributing towards lowering obesity and the prevalence of chronic disease later on in life. Despite these benefits, many women who have the capacity to breastfeed are choosing not to breastfeed their child up to the recommended age of six months, let alone to the World Health Organisation’s ideal age of 12 months. Here in Australia, only 18 per cent of mothers are fully breastfeeding their child to the age of six months. To increase the number of mothers breastfeeding their babies up to six months, women need support and advice from health professionals. The report found that the Commonwealth should take a greater role in promoting and educating Australians about breastfeeding and infant health. Poor nutrition in infancy has a significant impact on the future health of many Australians. An improvement in health in infancy would reduce the pressure on our health system. Implementing and supporting preventive measures such as breastfeeding in our health system has the capacity to ease the burden on Australia’s hospitals and medical facilities in the future. We know that demands on our health services are set to rise in the future. We are now seeing an increasing number of children with chronic illnesses in the middle stages of their development. The prevalence of asthma in Australia is one of the highest in the world, affecting up to 14 per cent of Australian children. Breastfeeding may be used as a preventive measure to lower the number of children in Australia who develop respiratory illness later in life. Prevention, as we all know, is better than cure. Provision of comprehensive child and maternal health services, such as breastfeeding support services, will play a vital role in improving infant and child health. Knowing, as we do, the health benefits of breastfeeding, there should be a concerted effort by leaders within the Australian community to break down any inhibitors to breastfeeding within social and workplace settings. From the many various submissions to the inquiry there emerged examples where workplaces persuaded women not to breastfeed at work. Knowing the health benefits of breastfeeding, workplaces should endeavour to encourage women to breastfeed their newborns by creating work environments that are supportive and accepting of a mother’s decision whether or not to breastfeed. We saw some great examples when we visited the Westpac workplace in the city of Sydney, where they had rooms set up so that employees, mothers of infants, who wanted to breastfeed would be able to do so. That was a great example to many other employers. We need to set up these places to encourage mums to continue to breastfeed. MAIN COMMITTEE As I said, parents should be able to focus on their top priority straight after childbirth, their newborn baby, and we have to somehow make it easier for them. There are great psychological and physical health benefits for babies whose mothers spend time with them during the early months of their lives, including the internationally recognised benefits of breastfeeding. In Australia, there are sometimes cultural inhibitors to breastfeeding, such as the stigmatisation of women who feed their babies in public. This creates a series of problems for mothers who want to breastfeed, as they feel they cannot feed in public; they are often driven indoors or out of sight, making it too difficult for them and therefore causing them to give up. This is not the case in many other developing and even developed countries around the globe where there are support systems and open promotion of breastfeeding for newborns, making it more accessible and easier for mothers to do so. In some developed and developing countries where breastfeeding has become culturally acceptable, there is a noticeable reduction in child mortality rates. So it is important that breastfeeding is coupled with peer support. According to a witness in the inquiry, peer support is a proven way of normalising breastfeeding. Breastfeeding rates declined rapidly to the point where in 1971 only about 20 per cent of babies were being breastfed to three months of age. Currently the rate of breastfeeding is up at 60 per cent. Australia is still getting over the normalisation of bottle feeding. Breastfeeding rates did decrease in the fifties, reaching a low point in the late sixties and early seventies. This was a result of a combination of the availability of infant formula and the promotion of the use of formula by the health system. Since then, the breastfeeding rates have increased slowly. From the current available data, a conclusion may be drawn that mothers with newborn babies initially want to breastfeed soon after they give birth. The data shows that the rates for breastfeeding are initially extremely high while the mother is still hospitalised or recently out of hospital. However, the impact of a number of different factors such as demographics, psychological health, physical health, cultural and societal influences have led to many mothers stopping using breast milk to feed their child. In order to ensure that we can continue to accurately monitor the use of breastfeeding across the nation, the inquiry also recommended that there be improvements in the methodology used to monitor breastfeeding. The recommendations included increasing the quality of data on breastfeeding and coming to a consensus on one definition for breastfeeding. With these changes we will be able to collate more accurate data and make well-informed comparisons between breastfeeding and infant health. Representatives of the breastfeeding phone counselling services who appeared as witnesses to the inquiry estimated that they receive around 200,000 calls annually from new mothers who need support. From this data it appears that there is a high demand for support from new mums who are having difficulty feeding their child and are worried about whether they are giving their child the nutrients they require to lead healthy lives. We also saw examples during the inquiry of particular marketing companies that target their products towards infants and toddlers, whether they be formula or other products. There were also claims from companies which manufacture fruit juice that their products included MAIN COMMITTEE all the nutrients that children need for their daily intake. Some of these companies are using marketing tools that impact negatively on breastfeeding rates. Many witnesses to the inquiry brought information forward about the importance of breast milk and how difficult it is to find a replacement that provides the same nutrients to children. However, not all mothers are in the situation where they are able to breastfeed and we should not isolate those people as being poor examples of motherhood. Again, it comes down to the choice of the mum. It is understandable that formula companies are in the market to make a profit and that is why many of these companies encourage the use of breast milk substitutes and run sometimes very effective marketing campaigns. This is where health professionals need to be there to advise mums on the best course of action they should take in order to give their child the best possible care. We need an education campaign about breastfeeding so that women can make informed decisions about what is best for their child. We know independent health professionals need to be available to provide the right information to mothers but without bias. As education among mums about breastfeeding increases, we will be able to be increasingly satisfied that they are making the right decisions and the right choices. So it has become clear as a result of this inquiry that new mums need to be more informed about breastfeeding and to be given the support that they require to provide the best nutritional care for their newborn. debate, having the honour of being part of the committee that looked into the benefits of breastfeeding. It came about actually because, in a previous inquiry we were working on concerning the healthcare system, we had a very good submission from the Breastfeeding Association. At the time, they raised concerns about needs that they believed they had in relation to raising awareness and support for breastfeeding mothers. We thought it would be an opportunity to have a short, sharp inquiry. When we announced that inquiry, I have to say that I was somewhat surprised at the huge amount of interest that it generated. There were a huge number of submissions-nearly 500 submissions came from right around the country. Reading through those submissions, you are somewhat surprised at the lack of understanding on this issue. You have preconceived views in relation to the availability of formulas, for example, and the activities of infant formula manufacturers in marketing their products. We were interested in finding out what was happening in remote and regional areas, particularly in Indigenous communities. When we were seeking information to establish where we should be going in relation to Indigenous communities, we were somewhat surprised at the total lack of information that was available. I listened to much of the contribution by my friend and colleague Mr Georganas and concur completely with what he said. I will not repeat a lot of the information that he provided; I will focus on just a couple of areas. One was in relation to Indigenous health. I guess I started this inquiry with an assumption that Indigenous people in these remote communities would be provided with truckloads of formula and that breastfeeding rates would be quite low. It was very surprising. We had the opportunity of visiting a couple of remote communities in my electorate: Kowanyama and Pormpuraaw. We found that the incidence of breastfeeding in these communities was very high-up in the 90 MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Committees
313,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt) (12.04 Pm),"It certainly gives me pleasure to contribute to thisper cent range. We are talking about breastfeeding for six months and extending that through to up to 12 months. When we had the opportunity of visiting the local community store we found that the availability of formula was quite limited. I have to say that it was provided in a quite responsible way. I think that highlighted to us that there was a lack of information in this area. One of the recommendations was that we need to start to look at this matter closely. What is happening in these remote Indigenous communities is also happening very much in remote Australia generally. I think we need to get a lot more information on that. The inquiry clearly highlighted the very significant benefits associated with breastfeeding, critically up to six months of age and necessary wherever possible up to 12 months of age, in the best interests of the child. We found that some of the public hospital programs were very good. People raised concerns about their preference or where they were encouraged, basically, to put their children onto formula for convenience sake or because they may have been experiencing difficulties in early breastfeeding. Nipple soreness and things like that caused problems and they were encouraged to go onto formula. We actually had evidence from some mothers who were very, very disappointed that they were not given the opportunity to deal with some of the physical problems-the health problems-they had and helped to persevere with breastfeeding their children. In some cases they felt they had missed out tremendously by losing that opportunity when in fact they could have dealt with some of those problems. It may well have been difficult, but if they had had proper support they could have dealt with that and then continued breastfeeding their children. One of the recommendations is to have baby-friendly hospitals where we can ensure that there is the right type of support for nursing mums to ensure that they are able to maximise that opportunity. At the same time, however, we have to recognise that there is a critical role for formula. Unfortunately, there are some mums who just cannot feed their children naturally through breastfeeding. We have to make sure that the formulas available are as good as possible and as close as can be to mothers milk. We have to also make sure that those mums who, through no choice of their own, are compelled to use alternative methods for feeding their infants are not seen as a lesser person for doing that. There were mums who felt very much that they were seen as a lesser person because they did not have the capacity to breastfeed. It is absolutely critical that we recognise that this does occur and that these mums are just as caring and just as nurturing as those that have the ability and the privilege to be able to breastfeed their children. uty Speaker Quick, you would be interested to know that one of the recommendations was to look at how we could turn this place into such an environment. There is a recommendation for the Speaker to consider doing that because, as you are well aware, there are a number of our members who have had children while they have been in service here and it is important that they are able to fulfil their obligations not only to the parliament but also to their children. It was probably one of the more interesting inquiries that I have been on, and probably one of the more enlightening. You assume that you understand these issues and then you listen to evidence from passionate people who are putting forward some very, very strong arguments. I enjoyed it immensely. I think there were 21 recommendations-I defer there to the chair, Mr MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Committees
314,We Also Identified Another Need: Breastfeeding,"friendly workplace environments. Mr DepSomlyay, who did an outstanding job in this inquiry. I see that our deputy chair at that time is here as well. It was probably one of the more enjoyable inquiries I have done. I think it is important that, as recommended, the department provide funds to expand the Breastfeeding-Friendly Workplace Accreditation Program nationally. The other recommended initiative, which I thought was rather interesting and important, is that we are calling on the Treasurer to move to exempt lactation aids such as breast pumps, nipple shields and supply lines from GST. They are an essential part of enabling mums to continue breastfeeding. I take this opportunity to thank the chairman and members of the committee for doing an outstanding job. To Pauline BrownI say: thank you very much indeed; it was great. Of course I thank other members of the secretariat. It was certainly one of the more rewarding inquiries that I have participated in. I hope that, as a result of the work that we have done in this report, we have clearly identified that breastfeeding a child up to the age of 12 months is by far the best way of being able to give kids the best chance in life. It has been confirmed that we are significantly behind many of our contemporaries. When we look at the European experience, particularly the Scandinavian example, we see that we are very much behind. We start off very well with breastfeeding in the first three months but we fall back significantly at six months and our rate is very low at 12 months. There is a lot of work to be done in this area; a lot can be done to raise awareness and deal with workplace relationships. We could also fund the Australian Breastfeeding Association to enable it to expand its current helpline, to make it a toll-free helpline so it can give young mums the information that they need to make breastfeeding happen. With that contribution, I commend the report to the House. I hope that the recommendations will be adopted in full by government. Ms HALL (Shortland) (12.17 pm)-I commence my contribution to the debate by recognising the fine role the Chair of the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing has played. I have truly enjoyed working with him on all the inquiries that the committee has undertaken. He is a fine chairman and I feel privileged to have been a member of a committee which he has chaired. I also recognise the fine work of the wonderful Pauline Brown, who is sitting over there with her head bent! Her research powers and her ability to put together a report are second to none. She has excellent skills. I think the parliament is very lucky to have in its employ someone of her calibre. I note the number of submissions that the committee received: 479 submissions is an enormous number of submissions for a committee to receive on any inquiry that it undertakes. It showed us that this is an issue about which there is a lot of passion and it is something people care very deeply about. I would like to pick up on a couple of the recommendations and then spend the majority of my contribution looking at chapter 8, which relates to the impact of breastmilk substitutes, the MAIF agreement, Marketing in Australia of Infant Formula agreement, and the WHO code, the International Code of Marketing of Breat-milk Substitutes, which are the two different codes that control the supply of breastmilk substitutes. It is also very important to note recommendation 10, which the previous speaker, the member for Leichhardt, referred to. I should have said at the beginning of my speech that I enjoyed working with all members of the committee. Those who have spoken to date-and the member for Ballarat will be speaking a little later-were real contributors to this report. I now turn to recommendation No. 10: MAIN COMMITTEE That the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate take the appropriate measures to enable the formal accreditation by the Australian Breastfeeding Association of Parliament House as a Breastfeeding Friendly Workplace. I raised this question with the Speaker on the last sitting day and asked him to report back to me on it. I was extremely disappointed with the reaction-not from my honourable friends opposite-from some of the government members, because it showed a total lack of understanding of this issue. This is about parliament being a role model for the rest of Australia. If we cannot put in place the right sorts of procedures then how can we ask employers in other areas to do so? I felt that that was a very important recommendation. I would ask government members to ensure that their ministers and other people who are responsible for decisions in this area know just how important it is. I notice that the member for Canning is coming back into the room. When I raised that question, he was one of the members who laughed. The recommendation is in relation to Parliament House becoming a recognised and accredited breastfeeding friendly workplace. There is a very important role for this parliament to play. But that is enough said on that. I would now like to turn to chapter 8 of the report, which deals with an issue of very great importance and one which can make a real difference to improving the rates of breastfeeding in Australia. It also goes to the way that formula is marketed in Australia. Currently in Australia we have the MAIF code of practice, which is voluntarily agreed to by the manufacturers of infant formulas. The first weakness of that voluntary code of conduct is that not all manufacturers have to sign up to it. Those manufacturers that sign up to it commit to it and must abide by it, but if a manufacturer chooses not to sign up to that code of practice there is absolutely no reason why they cannot behave in whatever manner they would like to. I do not think that is good enough. It is very important that women get the correct information about breastfeeding. It is very important that women get the support that they need in relation to breastfeeding and that they are not misled by any side issues. The MAIF code is administered by APMAIF, the Advisory Panel on the Marketing in Australia of Infant Formula. APMAIF looks at complaints that are lodged with it in relation to breaches of MAIF. Members may be very surprised to learn that APMAIF have not submitted a report to parliament since 2005. We had the CEO of APMAIF come and talk to our committee, and I think I can say without any reservation that every member of our committee felt that the penalty for a manufacturer that breached the code of practice would be something like being hit with a wet lettuce leaf. The representatives who came before the committee quite frankly did not understand what it was all about. If a breach occurred, the penalty was to be named in the report tabled in parliament. If the reports are not tabled in parliament, tell meplease help me understand-how that penalty amounts to anything whatsoever. When the representative from MAIF left the committee hearing, I thought he might have handed in his resignation because he could not in any way justify the action of that panel. The WHO code, which Australia was one of the first countries to sign up to, was not adopted by the Australian parliament. In 1992 the MAIF code was agreed to. The WHO code is a minimum standard and it covers both the manufacturers and the retailers. I think the fact that the retailers are not covered by the MAIF code is of great concern. The retailers can display and promote infant formula in whatever way they choose, whilst under the WHO code in other countries that is not the case. The handing out of samples to medical professionals is MAIN COMMITTEE another thing that infant formula manufacturers can do. In countries that are covered by the WHO code that is not the case. The WHO code applies to products such as breakfast cereals, infant meals and drinks, but those are not covered by the MAIF code. On most of these foods it is recommended that the infant is four to six months old. The standard is that babies should be exclusively fed by breastmilk or nonsolids until they are six months old. So just the labelling of these products breaches the best practice for caring for, feeding and providing nutrition to young babies. The table set out on page 135 of the committee’s report details very poignantly the contrast between the international WHO code and the rather flawed code that we have in Australia. Our committee strongly recommended that we adopt the international WHO code. The chair played a very strong part in us doing that. I would have been a little more timid in the recommendation, even though I believed passionately that that was the way to go. When we consider the issue of the WHO code and the MAIF agreement, if the government does not accept signing up to the WHO code, we at least have to have a fallback position. I think that the minimum fallback position is that, if formula manufacturers are to sell their products in Australia, they must be a signatory to the MAIF agreement. Even if you have one group of infant formula manufacturers that are, to some degree, trying to act responsiblyeven if they do not go as far as I or our committee believe they should-we need to make sure that every single manufacturer signs up to that. The manufacturers are bound by the MAIF agreement but I truly believe that there needs to be some action taken to bring the retailers under the MAIF agreement. Otherwise, the area is not being covered properly. I notice that the time for this debate is about to expire. I would refer members to the report. I believe there are a number of really worthwhile recommendations, like those addressing the GST on lactation aids, the baby-friendly hospitals and all those other issues that have been identified in this committee report. Once again, I thank the chair for the role that he has played in the development of this report. Debate (on motion by Mr Randall) adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Member for Franklin Dental Health Mrs Rachael Williams Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (12.30 pm)-CanI just take this opportunity to wish you, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, all the best in your retirement. I did not get the opportunity to listen to your speech yesterday in the parliament but, for my part, I would like to say that the six years I have spent here in your company have been very rewarding. I wish you all the best and thank you for the advice and guidance you have given me over those years. TodayI want to refer to a petition of 179 signatures from my constituents in Calwell calling for the re-establishment of a Commonwealth dental health program, calling for the easing of the cost pressures on working families by contributing to the cost of dental care, calling for some assistance to keep people with preventable dental conditions out of hospital with and MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Committees
315,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (12.30 Pm),"I move:calling for an end to the blame game and to work with the states and territories to fix Australia’s dental care system. Australia’s public dental health system is best characterised as a national disgrace. All you have to do is ask any resident in my electorate of Calwell who is on a public dental waiting list what they think of Australia’s public dental healthcare system under the Howard government and that is exactly what they will tell you-that it is a national disgrace. In my electorate of Calwell, average waiting times for public dental care have now blown out to nearly three years. Whilst three years is a long time, whichever way you look at it for the local residents who are left to suffer what are often painful dental conditions without access to proper treatment, it feels like an eternity to those who actually have to wait with those conditions. With people being left to manage by themselves, stories continue to emerge of local residents who develop irregular eating habits, given the pain they suffer whilst eating. There are many who avoid hot or cold foods or who avoid foods altogether that are too hard to chew. Many resort to over-the-counter painkillers or alternative remedies to try to manage their pain. The fact that this is happening in a developed, wealthy country like Australia, and the fact that it is happening at a time when Australia is reaping the economic benefits of a massive resources and mining boom, shows just how out of touch, unfortunately, the Howard government continues to be when it comes to the basic needs of working Australians. There are now over 650,000 Australians on public dental waiting lists across Australia, including some 140,000 in my home state of Victoria. Delays in their treatment often mean that relatively simple dental conditions escalate into more serious and more complex dental problems. Dental conditions now account for a quarter of all hospitalisations for children, and around 50,000 Australians are hospitalised each year for preventable dental conditions. Australia’s public dental system is failing, and its failures stem from the Prime Minister’s decision, way back in 1996, to axe the Commonwealth funding for public dental care. In 1996, the Howard government scrapped Australia’s $100 million Commonwealth dental program, ripping literally $100 million out of the public dental care system. Since then, the Howard government has presided over the virtual collapse of public dental care in Australia and a massive blow-out in public dental waiting times. What is more extraordinary is that, while state and territory governments have nearly doubled their investments in dental care spending over the last decade to try to fill the gap left after the Commonwealth funding was axed, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing are still trying to blame state and territory governments for the dire state of Australia’s public dental care system. Rather than fix the problem, the Prime Minister and his minister continue to play the blame game and to put politics above the needs of ordinary Australians. Today very few can afford to pay for regular dental check-ups or expensive dental treatments. More and more people are avoiding seeing the dentist because they simply cannot afford it. Their only option is Australia’s public dental health system, but it is a system that can no longer accommodate them and can no longer provide them with the treatment they need when they need it. Indeed, what we are also seeing today is more and more people being forced to take out a loan to pay for dental treatment because of long waiting lists and exorbitant fees. A Rudd Labor government will re-establish the Commonwealth dental program to rescue Australia’s failing public dental health system after 11 years of neglect, and I call on the Howard government to do the same. MAIN COMMITTEE With the few moments left I would like to say that I spoke recently of my constituent Mrs Rachael Williams, who was assaulted in her home one month ago. It saddens me today to report that Mrs Williams died on Tuesday night. I want to extend my condolences to her family. I know that our community has been traumatised by the vicious attack on Mrs Williams, and it certainly has led to many of our senior citizens feeling unnecessarily insecure in their own homes. Rachael lived in Broadmeadows for 50 years, and I think this is a very tragic way for her to end her 91 years of life. (Time expired) Mount Whaleback Mine this House a report on The 7.30 Report on 11 June this year which was basically bogus. It related to signatures from more than 200 people on a mine site at Newman in Western Australia on a petition suggesting that they had been victimised because they had signed on to an AWA. After receiving information from a number of my constituents who are fly in, fly out workers and other people involved in this industry, I sought to have this record corrected. I wrote to Mr Mark Scott, the Managing Director of the ABC, and asked that he investigate the fact that some of the 200 signatures on the petition complaining about an atmosphere of intimidation, victimisation, safety incidents et cetera due to AWAs were bogus. It was found that, of all the signatures on the petition, at least 80 were illegible, many were from people who were not even working at Mount Whaleback and some were names of people who did not even exist, so the credibility of these claims had to be tested. I wrote to Mr Mark Scott that I have over 29,000 workers-in other words, one in three people-on AWAs in my electorate, which is the second-highest figure in Australia, and that he might want to correct the record due to this bogus report. I wrote that the report was obviously generated by the union involved and the ABC had fallen into line to support it, so Mr O’Brien and Mr Peacock should address that inaccurate and unprofessional report. By the way, there are 14½ thousand registered AWAs in Swan. Mr Scott wrote back to me a month later, on 2 August, saying that he had received my letter, that they had looked into this matter, that they had believed it was a relevant story at the time et cetera. I will table all this information because of the time constraints so that it can be looked at properly. He said that the office of workplace safety had gone to the mine site, including BHP, to see whether the mine site was operating unsafely and with a culture of fear and intimidation, and that was found to be incorrect. Mr Scott said to me that he would wait for the state government mine inspectors to do an inspection of this mine site to see if they agreed with the petitioners. I have not heard from Mr Scott since then. He says: ‘Thank you for your concerns. The 7.30 Report will wait for the final report of this investigation and will do a follow-up story depending on the report.’ Well, Mr Scott, you are a bit slow, because I have the mine inspector’s report, by Peter Cawill table this-said that largely the issues raised were not valid. There are at the margins some communication issues, but it says, for example: the record of safety performance at Mount Whaleback mine, which has earned the CEO’s OTC award from BHP Billiton for being the most improved site. There is a higher standard of safety comparable with the higher standards found in other major companies in the region. Of the 43 employees contacted MAIN COMMITTEE",174,Adjournment

We know he has returned to type. He was a former staffer for Gough Whitlam and we know that, as a former staffer for Gough Whitlam, he was a Labor Party employee.

I call the honourable member for Scullin. Leave not granted. Skills Shortages that I think will be impediments to the continuing development of Australia’s economy-that is, the trade skills shortage. In doing this I want to indicate that there has been a lot of discussion in the run-up to the election about who is best placed to run the economy and things like that. I think it has to be acknowledged that the Australian economy has gone through great change over the last two decades, under both Labor governments and coalition governments. One of the things that we cannot forgive a government for is not understanding that changes that occur to the economy can lead to problems, as we are seeing with skills shortages. I was interested to see the document released last year by the Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics, which is part of the Department of Transport and Regional Services, entitled Skills shortages in Australia’s regions. It gave a very good outline of the drivers of skills shortages: firstly, the national economy; secondly, technological change; thirdly, globalisation; and, fourthly, change in regulatory frameworks. Akin to that, the things that are also important are training, wastage, migration and workforce exits. All of these are known. A government that is in control of the economy should know the impact of each of those elements, but we have failed to see recognition of what is going on. Things are often produced as being indications that the government is on top of the phenomena. We have the Minister for Vocational and Further Education indicating that the numbers of apprentices and trainees have increased by large amounts. However, he does not say that, if we are looking at the underlying trade skills shortages, really the number of trade apprentices and trainees has been very much a flat line over the last decade. These are the issues that we really have to look at and look at hard. Let us look at the ways in which the government thinks that it is best placed to deal with these trade shortages. We have the fiasco of the Australian technical colleges. I call it a fiasco because it is a duplicate system. Not only is it a duplicate system; it is a piecemeal system because some areas and regions get them and others do not. The fact is that, even if we have the debate about secondary education in Australia going in the wrong direction and it needing to be dragged back to attend to trade skills and the like, we should say that that is the best area to assist. This is why the solution that will be offered by the Rudd Labor Party in the run-up to MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Docep Acknowledges The Effort Of The Site Management Team And Employees On The Improvement In

332,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (12.44 Pm),"TodayI wish to talk about one of the major problemsthis election is the proper way to go. We are saying that we will harness the resources that are represented by our secondary school network. We indicate that, as a federal government, we will be willing to act as partners with them in to to to address the skills shortages. I have in my electorate the Peter Lalor Secondary College, the old Lalor technical school. It has infrastructure there ready to be resuscitated. It is also used for VET courses for people from surrounding schools, both in the Catholic system and in the state system. It is doing the job. One of the great areas of skills shortage is the building industry in Melbourne. I went there and saw a VET course being conducted in building and construction. People from outside of the Peter Lalor school community were coming in for that course. These are important ways to tackle our skills shortages-relying on 457 visas and bringing people from overseas are not. Of course 457 visas have a role for some of the skills shortages. In Melbourne the trades in which there have been a skills shortage identified include motor mechanics, metal fitters, metal machinists, toolmakers, metal fabricators, welders and sheet metal workers. These are the trades that we should be encouraging our young people to enter. We should be acknowledging that technological change has changed the nature of that work and that these are very good jobs. People can hold their head high if they go into these trades. To indicate that we still have the trade skills shortages that we do because we have not addressed the problem is really a blot on the way in which the government has tackled this problem. I believe that a Labor government under Kevin Rudd will tackle this positively. (Time expired) Mount Whaleback Mine documents I referred to earlier with regard to Mount Whaleback Mine. I again seek leave to present the documents. Leave granted. of Representatives Practice, which says that there is no requirement for the documents to be provided to the other person but it is normal practice. I will read it to explain. It states: It is expected that a Member or Minister seeking leave to present a document will first show it to the Minister at the Table or to the Member leading for the Opposition, as the case may be, and leave may be refused if this courtesy is not complied with. I intend to extend the adjournment time by a few minutes to allow everyone to have their full five minutes. Federal Election and films that have been used in my electorate. My electoral opponent has a brochure out. Three ambulance officers appear with him on the front of this brochure to indicate a fresh approach. I know the rules about advertising. I have no objection to my opposition participating in a robust campaign. But what I do object to is that public servants of the Queensland government are allowed to appear in ALP brochures but not in the brochures of candidates of other parties. This has happened not only with public servants but also with employees of state government corporate entities.

335,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (12.50 Pm),"I want to raise the matter of a number of brochuresThe state shadow minister responsible for ambulance matters, Ted Malone, raised this in the Queensland parliament and the Premier expressed his great surprise. Either the Premier was misleading the parliament or he himself was misled by his ministers. He issued an edict that it was not to happen in future with ambulance and police officers et cetera. But in a very revealing letter, dated 3 September, Mr Ron Monaghan, the secretary of the union that represents ambulance officers, wrote: These officers immediately identified that this contravened the standard operation procedures that state officers must remain apolitical at all times. The officers then sought clarification from senior officers Mr Parr, I might add, is my opponentindicated to them that permission had been given by the then Hon. Pat Purcellthe now sacked minister for emergency services. He went on to say: What has concerned me is the fact that you have come out and stated that these officers should not have done this when these officers were led to believe that they were given permission to do this. In other words, while the Premier is in there saying that it should not happen, the then minister had given permission for his ambulance officers to participate in this particular photo. My opponent ran the line at one stage that he just called on spec because he thought they did such a marvellous job-funny that there were movie cameras and professional photographers with him, but we will give that a miss. In a report in the Bundaberg NewsMail on 23 August, Mr Parr was reported as saying that he thought the picture was arranged by the party office. So he is now implicating the ALP in Queensland in this scenario. I think that they were on their meal break. He said: They gave their permission to be photographed. I believe the advertisement was approved by the former emergency services minister, Pat Purcell. So there you have it. This guy implicates himself, he implicates the former minister and he makes a goose out of the Premier. As I said at the beginning, I have no objection-if this facility were available to candidates of all parties, I would have no worries. It should be available to candidates of all parties or to no-one. If you want to create an impression of ambulance officers-and I have done this with a policing shot-you use an actor. You can use an actor and the back of a police cap and give the impression that you are on a law and order mission. Indeed, I have done that. My opponent could well have done that and not embarrassed these excellent ambulance officers. They do a marvellous job. I have a great respect for ambulance officers and police officers and the work they do. They were made the pawns in this unfortunate episode. I deplore what happened to them and I condemn those who first tried to obfuscate this and then were caught out knowing that it was done from ALP headquarters with the permission-which perhaps should not have been given-of the then emergency services minister, Pat Purcell. Let us clean up the game. (Time expired) Banks Electorate: Talent Advancement Program a local initiative which fosters talented young people. This is the Bankstown Talent Advancement Program, or TAP, as it is known locally.

336,Regarding The Matter As Mr Parr,,180,Docep Acknowledges The Effort Of The Site Management Team And Employees On The Improvement In
337,Mr Melham (Banks) (12.55 Pm),"I rise to take the opportunity to inform the House ofEducation and Training. The focus of this partnership was to identify and support talented young people in the local area. The program is designed for local students who either attend school in the Bankstown-East Hills school districts or reside in the Bankstown local government area. Only students up to year 12 are eligible. This year will see the graduating class as the first to have been with the program from the start of their high school years. I went to a presentation concert at the Revesby Workers Club on Thursday, 6 September 2007, for the 2007 advancement program. It was a sensational concert and all are to be congratulated. The objectives of the program are to identify and develop local talent, to provide encouragement and support through experienced coaches and mentors, to showcase our talent, to develop confidence in our young performers and to provide opportunities for acceptance into other development programs associated with the performing arts. TAP has received encouragement and support from many in the entertainment industry, including its patron, Kevin Jacobsen OAM. Many industry professionals give their time and expertise to support the program and provide their students with coaching and mentoring through regular workshops. Some of those who have donated their time and expertise include Human Nature, Paulini, Sophie Monk, Glen Nutley, Shaun Rennie, Leigh McRae, Pat Dance-Wilson, Amanda BallanHanna, Mathew Waters, Triple Treat Promotions, Sharon Dermody, Toni Pearon, Bryan Brown and Nathan Foley. Many of these professionals are themselves from Bankstown: Col Joye, Vince Sorrenti, Casey Donovan, Paulini and, of course, some members of Human Nature. Andrew Tierney of Human Nature has said: Having a community to support talented kids with opportunities to perform and grow in confidence is something that I believe really helped us. This kind of program in Bankstown is fantastic and I hope will ensure good things keep coming from my home district. Andrew’s mother, Wendy, is the Musical Director for TAP. Wendy, along with a number of other dedicated professionals, including Kerry Sebio, the project coordinator, and Ian Bertram, the sound technician, are all committed to nurturing talent in the Bankstown community. TAP ensures the performers are given the opportunity to perform in order to gain confidence and knowledge of the industry. To date, invitations to TAP participants have included the Sounds of Symphony in Colorado Springs, NRL and ARU half-time entertainment at Telstra Stadium, Australia Day celebrations, many local opportunities within New South Wales, as well as a Disneyland, Anaheim, performance in 2006. Most recently, TAP participants took a trip to perform in Broken Hill, a sister city to Bankstown. I congratulate Bankstown council and the mayors past and present who have continued to support this brilliant initiative. I mentioned the mentors and supporters, among whom is Kevin Jacobsen OAM. He was there on Thursday night and you could just tell that he was bristling with enthusiasm at the young talent that the community was producing. He has seen the very best of the best in the entertainment industry around the world. The Revesby Workers Club, of which I am proudly vice-president, has shown support by providing our auditorium gratis to the TAP organisation so that the children can basically have a first-class place in which to entertain. Indeed, we have had there one of the local newspapers, the Canterbury-Bankstown Express. This is the sort of thing that enthuses our local communities, where professionals take time out to mentor young people coming through. It is MAIN COMMITTEE not a paid thing that they do, but it is probably one of the most enjoyable things that they do. I had the same experience recently when we had Bryan Brown and Rachel Ward at the Revesby Workers Club for some short film initiatives. Bryan Brown has mentored a number of people in relation to that program. I commend the TAP program and those associated with it. Local Government try about the plans for local government amalgamations which were announced by the former Beattie government and which will be continued by the new Bligh Labor government in Queensland. Most of the angst, particularly on the Sunshine Coast, results from the process that was followed: the lack of consultation, the failure by the state government to take into account what local people are saying and, of course, the arrogant, high-handed manner in which the state Labor government was going to axe local governments that were proposing to hold referenda or plebiscites. The Prime Minister and the government introduced legislation, which was debated in the House recently, to enable the Australian Electoral Commission to carry out a plebiscite for any local authority wishing to have one. The cost of those plebiscites would be assumed by the Australian taxpayer. In terms of the Sunshine Coast, I see a lot of merit in merging the Caloundra City Council with the Maroochy Shire Council and the Noosa Council. It would enable us as the Sunshine Coast to advertise ourselves as an entity and to promote ourselves as Australia’s premier tourist destination and, increasingly, as Australia’s most desirable place to live. While we certainly would not want to be like the Gold Coast, we have so often been in competition with it. The Gold Coast has been a single entity for a long time. The former Albert Shire Council merged with the Gold Coast City Council to form Gold Coast City Council a number of years ago and the Gold Coast has been very successful in promoting itself. We as the Sunshine Coast would not by any means want high-rise from one end to the other. We value the fact that we are a family destination. We value the fact that on the Sunshine Coast we have a range of beaches and facilities. Frankly, we have something for everyone, from the 4½and five-star resorts at Noosa and Mooloolaba, through to family based destinations and even caravan parks. But one of the difficulties we have had as the Sunshine Coast is that we have Caloundra, Maroochy and Noosa. While we have had SunROC-the Sunshine Coast Regional Organisation of Councils-endeavouring to work together, it was very much a second-best option. As the local member, I will be pleased to see the three local authorities on the Sunshine Coast merge. But, having said that, I very strongly support the position of the government, which enables the residents of Caloundra, Maroochy and Noosa to express their own views on what the state government has sought to do in a high-handed manner. Following the recent redistribution, the seat of Fisher has been pushed south and now includes part of the Caboolture Shire Council. The Caboolture shire is being forcibly rolled into a new local authority. The other members of that new local authority will be the Redcliffe City Council and the Pine Rivers Shire Council. Again, if the residents of Caboolture decide that they want to have a plebiscite, I will strongly support that as well. The Kilcoy shire is a rural shire which has now also been returned to the electorate of Fisher. Kilcoy shire was particularly concerned that it was going to be rolled into the Pine Rivers Shire Council, Redcliffe City Council and Caboolture Shire Council merger. Kilcoy is MAIN COMMITTEE",180,Docep Acknowledges The Effort Of The Site Management Team And Employees On The Improvement In
338,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (1.00 Pm),"Much has been said in the House and around the couna small rural area that has absolutely nothing in common with those areas, which are on the northern outskirts of Brisbane and are very densely populated and built up. The state government decided that Kilcoy would merge to the west with the Esk Shire Council to form the Somerset Regional Council. The Kilcoy community has elected to have a plebiscite and I have conveyed that message to the Prime Minister. I am hopeful that that plebiscite will proceed, because it really is important that people in Kilcoy get the opportunity to cast a vote on whether they want decades of existence to be abolished by the state Labor government. Having indicated my support in principle for the merger of the three councils on the Sunshine Coast, I am, however, disappointed that the state government has decided to call the merged council the Sunshine Coast Regional Council instead of the Sunshine Coast city council. I hope that, once the merger happens, the new council will be able to obtain the city status that the Gold Coast holds. (Time expired) Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 1.05 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Climate Change (Question No. 5035) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, in writing, on 8 December 2006: (1) What is the latest advice received by the Minister in respect of the detrimental impacts of climate change upon the Great Barrier Reef and does this advice reflect (a) qualitative or (b) quantitative assessment of deterioration over time; if so, what are those details. (2) For 2006, what demonstrable outcomes have been realized by the Minister’s department in respect of protecting whales and dolphins. (3) For the financial year 2005-06, (a) what was the total cost to the Minister’s department of whale and dolphin protection programs and (b) how many full-time equivalent staff worked on those programs. (4) Which Australian indigenous species are most at risk from climate change and what steps has the Minister taken to reduce those risks. (1) Climate change poses a significant challenge to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Changes in air and sea temperatures, ocean currents, sea level, ocean chemistry, cyclones and storms, and rainfall have the potential to cause significant impacts on the GBR. Impacts are already being observed on seabirds, marine turtles and corals from increases in air and sea temperatures. As climate change continues, impacts are expected in all parts of the GBR ecosystem, with consequences for communities and industries that depend on the GBR. The GBR has experienced two major coral bleaching events in recent years: 1998 and 2002. Approximately sixty per cent of the GBR was affected in each event. Although most reefs recovered from bleaching, about five per cent of reefs surveyed suffered severe damage. In the 2006 summer, a severe but localised coral bleaching event in the Keppel Island region affected much of the region and resulted in mortality of approximately forty-two per cent of corals. This is the most damage this region has experienced from coral bleaching. The Government has implemented two key strategies to make the GBR more resilient to climate change. Highly protected areas have been increased from five per cent to more than thirty-three per cent, greatly improving biodiversity protection, and the Reef Water Quality Protection Plan has been implemented, which aims to halt and reverse the decline in water quality entering the GBR by 2013. (2) Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region On 15 September 2006 the “Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region” was signed by Australia at the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme Ministerial Forum in New Caledonia. This MOU was negotiated under the auspices of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals “to foster cooperation, build capacity and ensure coordinated region-wide actions to achieve and maintain a favourable conservation status for all cetaceans and their habitats occurring in the region, and to safeguard the associated cultural values for Pacific Islands peoples”.",182,Docep Acknowledges The Effort Of The Site Management Team And Employees On The Improvement In
339,Mr Turnbull,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:This is a significant step in whale and dolphin conservation in the Pacific and Australia actively participated in the negotiation of this MOU over the past four years in an effort to continue to build support and capacity in the region for the conservation of all cetaceans. International Whaling Commission Meeting, St Kitts and Nevis (IWC58) 14 – 21 June 2006 In June 2006 Senator Campbell led the Australian delegation to the 58th meeting of the IWC in St Kitts and Nevis where they played a leading role in ensuring continued support for the proconservation position. This included effective lobbying of some small island states to abstain on crucial votes on proposed Japanese small type coastal whaling and abolition of the Southern Ocean Sanctuary. The Australian delegation was also closely involved in developing a program of work on shipstrikes for the International Maritime Organisation and the IWC. Australian Centre for Applied Marine Mammal Science The new Australian Centre for Applied Marine Mammal Science was launched in September 2006. The centre is based in Hobart at the Australian Antarctic Division and is funded through the Australian Government’s $100 million Commonwealth Environment Research Facility (CERF) programme. The Government has allocated $2.5 million over four years to the Centre, which will harness the expertise of Australia’s very best marine mammal researchers. Applications for research funding for the first year were called for in September and those received have since undergone a rigorous assessment process to determine the successful applicants. The first contracts were signed in May 2007. Domestic achievements A Whale and Dolphin Research Priorities Conference was held in Adelaide in February 2006 which enabled over 100 managers, researchers, industry and non-government organisation stakeholders to be updated on work done since the previous conference in 2004, and identify gaps and priorities requiring attention for the next two years. Amendments to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act Regulations were enacted in June 2006 to implement the new Australian National Guidelines for Whale and Dolphin Watching developed jointly by all Australian, state and territory governments and agreed to by the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council in November 2005. The fourth annual National Large Whale Disentanglement Workshop funded by the Commonwealth was held in Victor Harbor S.A. in May 2006. Operational staff from all mainland states received training in the latest technology and best practice methods to ensure the safety of those tasked with freeing entangled whales and achieving successful outcomes. To facilitate this, the Commonwealth has also supplied satellite tracking buoys to four states for cases which cannot be dealt with immediately, so that the whale can be re-located and assisted in the future. Natural Heritage Trust funding of $400,000 was provided for research on blue and southern right whale distribution, abundance and habitat utilisation in accordance with the Recovery Plans in place for these species; development of satellite tracking tags; developments in dolphin and seal mitigation methods/devices in trawl fisheries; and support for an IWC intersessional workshop on in-depth stock assessment of southern hemisphere humpback whales held in Hobart in April 2006. Capacity-building workshops on cetacean studies and rescue techniques for whale strandings and entanglements were held in Auckland NZ in September/October 2006. Participation by Pacific Island countries was supported financially by the former Department of the Environment and Heritage. The Department launched a new easily-accessed whales web site: www.deh.gov.au/whales to better educate the general public and students on all cetacean matters and developed new brochures, posters, banners and information packs on whales and dolphins in Australian waters. Nationally agreed protocols for obtaining samples from stranded cetaceans were launched in January 2006 after extensive consultation with all states. These are designed to be used by managers and volunteers dealing with stranding events and cetacean researchers. (3) The following table outlines the costs and full-time staffing allocation to both domestic and international whale and dolphin protection programmes during 2005/06: Total Expenditure Full-time ASL 2005/06 Domestic whale and dolphin protection programme $563,062 2.5 (Approvals and Wildlife Division) International Whale Policy Programme (Australian $494,000 4 Antarctic Division) International Whale Science Programme (Australian $925,755 6.75 Antarctic Division) (4) A summary of the latest scientific estimates of the number of species and communities likely to be threatened by climate change is available on my Department’s website at www.greenhouse.gov.au/science/hottopics/pubs/topic11.pdf. The Australian Government recognises that climate change is a threat to biodiversity. The report, Climate Change Risk and Vulnerability that was released in July 2005 identifies biodiversity as a priority area for adaptation planning. The Government has taken action to prepare for the impact of climate change on biodiversity. Most recently, in November 2006, the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council agreed eleven priority actions to deal with natural resource management and climate change.

340,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Lowe Electorate: Income Tested Fees (Question No. 6152) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Ageing, in writing, on 7 August 2007: (1) In which year were income-tested fees introduced for nursing home residents. (2) For each year since the introduction of income-tested fees, how many nursing home residents in the electoral division of Lowe have paid, or are paying, income-tested fees. (3) For each year since the introduction of income-tested fees, what is the total dollar amount of fees collected from residents in nursing homes in the electoral division of Lowe. (1) Income-tested fees were introduced on 1 March 1998. Only newly entering residents from that date have been subject to the income test. (2) and (3) The Department of Health and Ageing does not collect information on the amount of income-tested fees paid by residents. The Department sets the maximum income-tested fee that the provider may charge a resident based upon the resident’s income and cost of care. The number of residents, who at some point in that year, were assessed as eligible to pay income-tested fees for the Planning Region of Inner West, of which Lowe is an electorate, is shown in the following table. Note that the growth in the number of income tested residents largely reflects the replacement of residents who entered care before 1 March 1998 with residents who entered care since that date.
