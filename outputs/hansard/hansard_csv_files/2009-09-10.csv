Thursday, 10 September 2009 ----McMillan Electorate: Micah Challenge woke up to the sun streaming down on Canberra after some rain knowing that there were thousands of refugee families and former detainees that today were free of debt. This is a happy day for Australia and I am very proud to be a member of this House when this government and this parliament have shown such enormous goodwill towards those families who have had their debt removed. It was a happy day at the Daffodil Festival at Leongatha last week also when the whole town was festooned with the beauty of yellow. At the same time, I was lucky and blessed enough to be asked to attend Leongatha’s Make Poverty History action group, organised for the fourth time to stand up for justice projects as a part of the Micah Challenge. I think Micah Challenge are coming here next week. Mrs Johanna Haasjes was the organiser of the program. What a great day it was to walk into St Peter’s Church with the Reverend Janet Wallis, when the church had been completely turned over to the Micah Challenge people. We had some great speakers-Jesse Poulton, a World Vision youth ambassador, and Mimmie Jackson, South Gippsland’s youngest ever shire councillor. It was a pleasure to hear them both speak. Having tramped the boards and for 20 years of my life sung my songs to make a quid, I was pleased to see there was also a South Coast Christian College worship band. On drums was Luke Toohill, on keyboards and vocals was Christian Van Eck, on guitar was Nick Piening, on bass guitar was Ilene Page and on vocals were Jodie Chisholm and Rebecca Vagg. Amelia Piening composed and sang her own song just after them. What a time it was to hear those young people sing and play in that church. It is not often we go to a function where courage is displayed by people. Excellence was displayed in all the surrounding stalls that day. It was a pleasure to stand there as the local member with a whole lot of people who had a heart for those people who were not well-off. I said in my address that there is only one place where abject poverty should exist. For us in this generation and in the generations behind us and in front of us, the only place we should ever see abject poverty in Australia and across the world is in a museum. We should never see it in lives across this nation. We have a job to do and that is the challenge for all of us. Micah Challenge will be here next week. What a great day it is for this nation. Economy Ms McKEW (Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (9.33 am)-I share the sunny optimism of the member for McMillan. In fact, I rise today to speak about confidence and the confidence that I think you can feel right across the country-in cities, in regions and in my own community in the north-west of Sydney. This is measurable. Only yesterday the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey showed that we were more optimistic about our economic future than we had been at any time since the institute started asking questions about this in the 1970s.

189,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (9.30 Am),"Oh, what a happy day it was today when Itelling a story that I have heard first-hand from right across the country. Whether it is in a poor community like Hilton in Fremantle, where I was a couple of weeks ago, in the central west of New South Wales, in regional Victoria or in our cities, the story from local businesspeople, mayors and councillors is the same: we have held our nerve and it is paying off. As I visited regional and local community infrastructure projects right across the country, there was gratitude and immense relief that the Commonwealth had acted decisively and ensured that the stimulus was broad, deep and appropriate. At a time when we know that economic growth is still weak, smallto medium-sized infrastructure projects identified and undertaken by local councils across the country have really been a lifesaver. They have supported local jobs and buoyed communities. I think communities can see that the government is on their side. This, in turn, has boosted confidence. What Australia has achieved in the last year has been truly remarkable. We are close to the first anniversary of the collapse of the once-venerable Wall Street institution Lehman Brothers. That event and the flow-on effect of banking disasters, we all recall, sent shockwaves through the financial system across the world. Credit dried up and there was fear and pessimism right through the last quarter of last year. We need to remember this and marvel at just how successfully Australia has weathered this storm. In fact, one of my Bennelong constituents said to me after a recent return from Singapore, where he was catching up with the family of his Singapore born wife, ‘I have never enjoyed a visit so much.’ I asked why that was. He said: ‘For years, my Singaporean father-in-law has lectured me about the superiority of the Singaporean economy. But now I had such pleasure in saying to him, “I live in a country that has avoided recession and I work for a company that is still hiring.”’ That is the Australian success story, and it did not just happen because of dumb luck. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank said recently, the size and the speed of the government’s response has been one of the important factors in supporting private demand. Another factor has been the collective effort of employers and employees to work differently. (Time expired) Mitchell Electorate: Hills Community Medical Equipment Pool to an important local community group in my electorate, the Hills Community Medical Equipment Pool, which operates out of Balcombe Heights Estate community buildings in Baulkham Hills. This not-for-profit service is one of the only units of its kind in Sydney and, I am advised, all of Australia. It is run by a core group of about 15 dedicated volunteers and provides a service of medical equipment such as wheelchairs, walking sticks, frames, crutches, commodes, bath boards, shower chairs, stools and raised toilet seats on a short-term loan basis for people who are in serious need of this equipment. These loans are commonly for six to 10 weeks, but there is flexibility for needy and terminal cases. Last SaturdayI had the good fortune to preside at the general meeting of this very valuable community institution and I can personally attest that this is a remarkable service. I acknowledge the following executive members: the president, John Goulding, who was one of the founders of this service in 1981; the vice-president, Leonie Dixon; the treasurer, Bruce Lawson; the secretary, Lyn Tomasone; the assistant secretary, Dianne White; the controller, Rhonda Goulding; the maintenance officer, Alan Stone; the community liaison officer, Jill Morgan; the trustees Rhonda, Bruce and Lyn; and all of the committee members.

190,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (9.36 Am),"I rise this morning to draw the parliament’s attentionby volunteers. All of the equipment is donated by the community or through other donations to the service. I want to make a couple of points about this here this morning. This kind of service-this kind of donating and loan of medical equipment to people who are in need of it for a very low fee-is one that cannot be provided by government. This is perhaps the only existing example of a community medical pool anywhere in Australia. Every time we hear a reference to this kind of service in this place, I like to think that this is an example of what Australia is about and what communities ought to be doing for themselves. There is no way that any government-state, federal or local-in this country could provide this service to people for the amount of money that these community groups charge, and the good work that they are doing for very sick and infirm people in my community is astonishing. What is more astonishing is that hospitals and healthcare facilities actually contact this service-this group of volunteers-to ask them if they have equipment for use in their hospitals and healthcare facilities, for loan and for patients who are leaving. It is absolutely and utterly amazing that the government, with all of its resources and power, asked this voluntary community service-run entirely by volunteers-if they had the equipment to loan to people that were leaving their facilities. It says that things are much better when we care for each other and ourselves than when we rely on government. Dobell Electorate: Central Coast the need for the Central Coast to have a stronger identity and regional recognition. The Central Coast is one of the most beautiful parts of Australia to live in, but unfortunately a lot of our institutions-at government level, at charity level and at business level-are run out of either Sydney or the Hunter. While Sydney and the Hunter are lovely places, the Central Coast wants to develop is own identity. One of the biggest complaints of people on the Central Coast is that our region is never recognised. I think it is important that we look at all the institutions on the Central Coast and see how they can be changed to give a greater regional focus to this beautiful area of Australia. Over 300,000 people live on the Central Coast, yet many of the institutions that look after our region are based in Sydney. One only has to look at the way in which the people of the Central Coast have embraced the Central Coast Mariners to see how much they absolutely want and desire a regional identity. Some of the things we need to look at changing are at various governmental levels. For a start, we have two councils that divide the Central Coast rather than bring it together. We continually have a pull between the Gosford City Council and the Wyong Shire Council. Rather than working together, because we have these two separate councils, we tend to pull each other apart. The region does not work as one. It works as two, because of the way in which these councils operate. There are also a number of New South Wales government departments that do not recognise the region. The one that most of my constituents complain about is the area health service. We have the Northern Sydney and Central Coast Area Health Service. This does not put the focus on their health issues that Central Coast residents want. It also does not match up with primary health care. We have a division of general practice that is Central Coast based and does a terrific job, but we have a mismatch of health resources. We have the New South Wales Business Chamber of the Central Coast. They have organised themselves to represent business on the Central Coast, and that is a good thing. We have MAIN COMMITTEE",130,Constituency Statements

Gilmore Electorate: Petrol Prices gestion put by the Treasury Secretary, Ken Henry, to increase the price of petrol by 10c a litre is adopted, there will be a lot of unhappy motorists out there-none more so than in my electorate of Gilmore, where the car is necessarily and unavoidably king. Why? We have no real alternative public transport system to which people can turn and there are no trains past Bombaderry. Petrol taxes will soon be passed onto the consumer by way of increased fares for buses and trains. All freight costs will go up, driving up the cost of living. Who will be hit the hardest? It will be anybody of limited means, especially pensioners and the unemployed. The Senate Economics Committee concluded in their investigation of petrol prices in Australia: Petrol prices in rural, regional and remote areas are on average, higher than prices in metropolitan areas. Fuel for those people was described as: … very much a non-discretionary commodity. At one point, the price of petrol in Ulladulla and Batemans Bay reached $1.70 a litre. People who lived in the outlying areas of the bay and basin area simply reduced their travel. This had a direct impact on retailers in the major CBDs, who had fewer and fewer people coming through their doors. I well recall the howls from Labor at the time, when they were in opposition, to do something about the price of petrol. They wanted us to cut the GST on petrol; they wanted us to cut the excise. I also remember that when we suggested that Bob Carr, the then Premier of the New South Wales Labor government, adopt the Queensland pricing model to cut his share of the excise, we were met with a stony silence. We actually froze the excise in 2001, saving about 8c a litre at the time. Despite this history, as recent as it is, Treasury is advocating that we hike the cost by another 10c a litre. Dr Henry also advocated an increase in diesel fuel excise for heavy vehicle operators as a precursor for other land transport reforms. If the government had any sense at all they would have no hesitation in discounting such a suggestion outright. This has got tax written all over it and disregards the economic consequences that impacted on Gilmore at that time. Ken Henry’s petrol tax will do nothing except bring money into Treasury’s coffers. If it MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Constituency Statements

But I do appreciate that, with the government’s massive and sometimes reckless spending, which drove up our deficit, someone will eventually have to pay for it. Let us hope that this revenue will not have to come from a Labor tax on the family home. Lieutenant Commander Peter Johnson Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (9.46 am)-I take the opportunity today to place on the record of this parliament the outstanding personal and career achievements of Lieutenant Commander Peter Johnson, late of the Australian Hydrographic Service. Sadly, Peter passed away in April 2007, but on 16 June this year his work and expertise in lidar hydrography was recognised during an awards ceremony held during an international hydrography seminar. Peter was the recipient of the inaugural 532 Award, given to those who have significantly contributed to the advancement of technology and use of lidar bathymetry and airborne coastal mapping and charting. The award was presented at the Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Technical Centre for Expertise 10th Annual Airborne Coastal Mapping and Charting Workshop held in Portland, Oregon, with over 80 representatives from government, academia and industry in attendance. Peter’s memory was also honoured during the evening by the creation of the Lieutenant Commander Peter Johnson Best Practices Award, exemplifying Peter’s dedication, professionalism, initiative and commitment to his field. Recipients of this award will have accomplished a complicated and demanding project or field operation within the previous two years and will be awarded at their annual awards night. Throughout his career, Peter provided significant professional service to the Australian Hydrographic Service, which is based in my town of Wollongong, and is remembered with fondness and respect by its personnel today. In 2004, Peter was awarded a Maritime Commander Australia commendation which highlighted his resourcefulness, initiative and dedication, which has enhanced the Australian Hydrographic Service’s international reputation, and his contribution to the ongoing effectiveness of Royal Australian Navy Hydrographic Meteorological and Oceanographic Force Element Group. Peter served in the hydrography survey sections of the Royal Navy between 1970 and 1989, when he transferred to the Royal Australian Navy. He initially served in HMAS Moresby, after which he transferred to the Australian Hydrographic Office. Since 1994, he was responsible for the Australian Hydrographic Service capability requirements and acquisition and upgrade of hydrographic systems for the RAN. He was the Australian representative to the IHO S-44 Standards for Hydrographic Surveyors Working Group. Peter is sadly missed by his many friends and work colleagues, who were very impressed by his professionalism and dedication. I hope that the recognition of this parliament of his outstanding achievements gives even more pride to his wife, Alaniera, and his five children and their children. MAIN COMMITTEE Breast Cancer Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (9.48 am)-I rise to speak on behalf of the millions of Australians whose lives have been touched by breast cancer and the millions more who at some stage will either suffer from the disease or know someone who does. BreastScreen Australia has done a remarkable job since it was established in 1991. It screened more than 1.6 million women in 2005-06, undoubtedly saving many lives when problems were detected early. In 2006 2,618 women died of breast cancer in this country, and tens of thousands more every year suffer the physical and psychological trauma of aggressive therapy for the disease. We should never forget that for every woman who is diagnosed with breast cancer and for every woman who feels distress at the possibility that she has developed the disease there are partners and children, fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters who are sharing their pain. With this in mind, I am astonished by suggestions this week that BreastScreen Australia services be restricted to women in higher risk age groups. Of those being tested today, 26 per cent are women outside the target group of 50 to 69 who feel concerned enough to seek screening for this terrible disease. Some are saying we should turn them away-or turn away at least those under 45 or over 75-that their concerns are not worthy of state funded screening and that a simple check for the disease is an extravagance, despite the fact that many women outside the key age group develop breast cancer each year and many die from it. Proponents of this plan say it will save resources which can then be diverted to ensuring more women in the higher risk group are tested. Members on this side of the House are amongst the staunchest critics of wasteful expenditure, but we recognise that some things are beyond putting a price on. I for one do not want to live in a society which does not care. Public education may reduce the demand for screening by many women in other age groups, but even if it does not we must continue to extend the service to all women who are concerned enough to take that step of seeking a test. If they do have breast cancer, it needs to be picked up early and treated. The epitaph that they could have been saved but for a few dollars more is not one that I want to put my name to. Lindsay Electorate: Australian Red Cross decision taken by the Australian Red Cross to close its voluntary aid service in New South Wales. The Red Cross movement right around the world performs outstanding work helping those most in need and is supported by global networks of dedicated volunteers, individual and corporate sponsors and the goodwill of the general community. The Australian Red Cross is no exception. They are at the front line of natural disasters and national tragedies, offering a consoling word while helping people to piece their lives back together. They played a key role in mobilising the nation to dig deep for the victims of the Victorian bushfires earlier this year and they perform outreach services in some of the most remote parts of the country with vulnerable Indigenous communities. As one of the patrons of the Penrith branch of the Red Cross and as a long-time supporter of the organisation’s activities in my community, I can attest to the incredible passion of the volunteers and the enormous contribution they have made over a long period of time. That is why I was disappointed to learn that the Red Cross plans to close the 95-year-old voluntary aid service in New South Wales. The VAS has sent qualified first aid volunteers to sporting and community events for almost a century, and I could not begin to imagine how many peoMAIN COMMITTEE",132,Constituency Statements
194,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay) (9.51 Am),"I rise to speak about my disappointment with theple have benefited from the work of these volunteers. The VAS does not charge a fee, which makes it an accessible first aid service for many struggling community and sporting organisations-many of which are in the most disadvantaged communities and cannot afford to pay for the services of the New South Wales Ambulance or St John Ambulance. Any donations the VAS receives for its work are sent to the Red Cross to be included in its larger fundraising pool, which supports the full breadth of services the Red Cross provides. On 13 June this year, the men and women of the VAS were called to a meeting by the Red Cross and told that they no longer fell within the organisation’s strategic priorities and they would be shut down, effective from 1 December. There was no consultation with any of the regiments before the decision was made, a process that has deeply hurt the volunteers who joined the VAS and donated their time on weekends and public holidays because they believed in the integrity of the Red Cross. In my community, the 15 members of the Nepean VAS between them have more than 300 years worth of experience and the group’s regional liaison officer, Mrs Yvonne Cassidy, has given 31 years of service to not only the Nepean VAS but also the broader Red Cross organisation. The Nepean VAS has been self-sufficient for a number of years and fundraises extensively for the Red Cross, even being named last year the most outstanding VAS regiment in New South Wales. In my view, the Red Cross is turning its back on the experience and dedication of these dedicated volunteers. I would hope that they recognise the incredible service that these volunteers and the VAS perform for the community and that they reverse this short sighted decision. Cowan Electorate: Ballajura Primary School place about the successes of people and organisations within the suburb of Ballajura, this is the first time. I have spoken about Ballajura Primary School. Last FridayI attended the Ballajura Primary School athletics carnival and I was greatly impressed with what I saw. I immediately noticed that there were a lot of parents there-in fact, probably more parents than children. I think that is a sign of a school with good morale. At the athletics carnival I was also informed that in the last couple of years the average attendance at P&C meetings had risen from six to 30-another good sign that Ballajura Primary School is doing things right. In 2008 the P&C were able to raise $17,000 for an adventure playground. In my view, that sort of parental commitment to the school and the education of the children demonstrates a very strong school spirit. Another way strong school spirit can be judged is by its student numbers. I understand that Ballajura Primary School expects to be the largest of the four primary schools in Ballajura in 2010, with more than 600 students from kindergarten to year 6. While the primary schools in Ballajura are all very good, Ballajura Primary’s Principal, David Wanstall, attributes the school’s popularity to the excellent academic and pastoral care programs. I would like to speak specifically of one of the school’s programs, the learning difficulties project, which is being run in partnership with the School of Inclusive Learning. The project is designed to identify and implement successful teaching practices while also identifying why students are failing to achieve literacy and numeracy at appropriate levels. The project includes best practice assessment strategies and evidence based remediation practices. Principal David Wanstall and associate principals Jane Schorer and Jane Conley have led the proMAIN COMMITTEE",134,Constituency Statements
195,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (9.54 Am),"AlthoughI have spoken on many occasions in thisgressive staff of Ballajura Primary School in comparing current teaching practice to evidence based world’s best practice. The staff have embraced structural reorganisation in pursuit of maximum student performance through new approaches in assessment, content, instructional strategies, instructional skills and classroom management. When I first walked into Ballajura Primary School five years ago it was pretty much a normal school with the same challenges and approaches of all schools. It was a solid and effective educational facility. Things are very different now. Over the last three years the attitude has changed greatly. You can feel the confidence at the school among the students, parents and staff. The determination of the staff to continuously improve the school is one factor that has driven a number of changes. Ballajura Primary School is a strong and determined school. The leadership team has provided the initiative and led the way. The parents have picked up on this and are supporting the positive drive of the teaching staff. The conditions have now been met for the students to achieve their great potential, and I look forward to their and their school’s future success. Shortland Electorate: Overseas Aid Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.57 am)-I would like to acknowledge the presence in the chamber today of the year 11 students from throughout Australia who are here representing Rotary. I welcome them to the parliament and hope that they enjoy their time here. I rise to present a collection of letters and cards containing the thoughts of people from the Summerland Point Community Baptist Church. They have requested that I do this on their behalf for the world’s poor. The cards that I have received all state: This year 27,000 children in the developing world will not live to see their fifth birthday. Australia can help by devoting more of its aid budget to child and maternal health. Please ask the Prime Minister to raise health aid to $1.2 billion by 2011. This will be around 20 per cent of the aid budget. It will see Australia giving its fair share to the aid funds needed by poor countries to build effective health systems. I will read from a couple of the letters from the children. This one is from Shae Bruhn: At present I am sitting at the table with a bunch of healthy children that have lived past their fifth birthday. To think that children are dying from preventable reasons is completely unacceptable. Please advocate for the poor of Australia and over the world by promoting an increase in financial aid. And from James Bennett: Listen carefully and you will hear the cries of young children. I am 13 years old and I am glad to make it past the age of five. I would like to see Australia give more money to help poor children of the world so they can go to school, have water and health care and more birthdays. Some adults wrote to me as well. Ursula Hardy said: I would ask that government increases the aid devoted to children and maternal health in developing countries. Our country and people are blessed with an abundance of resources, and aid to those less fortunate in our country and overseas is one way we can help and share our blessings. I would ask that you increase aid to $1.2 billion by 2011-12. Ruth Murdoch says: When I see on television children who have malnutrition I grieve, especially when I know that there have been times when food has been dumped in Australia when growers cannot get the price they want. How can we as a nation turn a blind eye to the situation? MAIN COMMITTEE I have beautiful drawings from people and I have other letters that express similar concerns. I am privileged to place on record the words of the community of Summerland Point Baptist Church and, at the same time, acknowledge the work that the Hon. Bob McMullan MP, Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance, and the Rudd government have done in this area to date. (Time expired) for the documents to be tabled. In accordance with standing order 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. Ms LEY (Farrer) (10.01 am)-I am very pleased to speak on the Foreign States Immunities Amendment Bill 2009. This is a bill where I think there is absolutely no difference between the government’s and the opposition’s positions. When I explain what the bill is about, everyone will understand that. It is about giving foreign firefighters immunity when they come to Australia to fight fires. It never fails to inspire and amaze me, when there is a natural disaster, particularly a fire-and we reflect on the recent Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria and fires that affected my electorate in western New South Wales, in Kosciusko and in Canberra in 2003-how people come to help. I could be way out in the west of New South Wales in the middle of the week in a small town where there is not a tree to be seen and find that many of the farmers and businessmen have left their communities, their jobs and their families to go sometimes for weeks on end to elsewhere in Australia or elsewhere in the state to fight fires. It seems when disasters strike those men and women hear the call and everything else becomes of secondary importance. It is encouraging to realise that that sense of community when it comes to fighting fires extends not just nationally but internationally. Australians have benefited greatly in recent years from the expertise and resources of US firefighters. Their contributions in times of dire emergency are hugely appreciated. In the 2002-03 bushfire season, the US sent an infrared scanning aircraft and photo interpreters, together with 36 firefighters and a 20-person crew, to aid Australia. During this time US firefighters shared their knowledge and experience with Australian firefighters. The 2006-07 bushfire season saw some off the worse fires in Australia in over 50 years. Fires burned through 2.4 million acres in the state of Victoria, and 114 American firefighters, two hot shot crews and 68 other resources from the US were dispatched to Australia for a month-long assignment. Our firefighters too have been able to reciprocate assistance on numerous occasions. Australian firefighters’ aid to the US started in 2000. After the 2000 wildfire season, the US realised the value of having effective flexible, cooperative and formal relationships. Australia continued to provide assistance in suppressing wildfires in 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2006 all over the US, including Colorado, California, Washington, Oregon, Montana and Idaho. In 2007 the US Secretary of the Interior, while on a presidential delegation in Australia, personally thanked the Australian firefighters who assisted in suppressing wildfires in the US. The arrangement assists both countries not only in the tasks that each can perform for the other but MAIN COMMITTEE",135,Constituency Statements
196,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"There being no objection, leave is granted",137,Foreign States Immunities Amendment Bill 2009
197,"Debate Resumed From 19 August, On Motion By Mr Mcclelland:","for the valuable experience they gain, which can be put to use in their home countries. A branch manager from Forests New South Wales said: We deploy people not only as a way of sharing our forest fire fighting experience, but to develop skills and provide invaluable experience that our teams can bring back to their home country. Dean Kearney, a firefighter from New South Wales, recalls his firefighting experience in Boise, Idaho, in the US: It was really amazing to see the way these crews worked, with all 20 crew members walking in single file according to rank, both in camp and on the fire ground. It’s not the sort of thing you see on fires in Australia. SoI certainly commend that exchange of experience. It is not just seeing how another country carries out firefighting activities, which will clearly differ for a variety of reasons, but the moral support in knowing that someone has come from so far away to help you in your time of need. The amendment bill that we are debating today will help to further enhance this firefighting experience. It is very much in our interests to ensure that the arrangement continues. The amendment will allow for the establishment of concrete protocols to ensure that aid gets to Australia as efficiently and quickly as possible. In Kearney’s case, he was in Idaho within 48 hours of a request from the US. Of course, when fires break out there is no time to be going through red tape and bureaucratic hoops. We need people to be able to travel quickly and get onto the job as soon as possible. The main concern that the US has about dispatching her firefighters is vulnerability they may have in Australia to liability claims. This legislation will facilitate the formalisation of that arrangement going forward. The Foreign States Immunities Amendment Bill 2009 will provide immunity in tort in respect of the acts or omissions of foreign personnel in the course of rendering assistance. Under our current system, if an American firefighter during the course of duties in Australia were to cause injury or damage to property or other people, he or she would not be protected from liability. In August 2002 a bill was passed in the US to provide tort liability coverage for any international firefighter brought to the US. The US has already taken the first steps to cover our firefighters. Australia itself has acknowledged since 2002 that there are liability concerns surrounding Australian firefighters providing assistance in the US, so now is the time for Australia to offer to US firefighters the same protection that the US has provided to our firefighters since 2002. While of course it is not common here for firefighters to be sued for negligence for something not done, or not seen to be done, in the course of their duties such claims will arise from time to time. Probably, and sadly, they may arise more often as our society becomes more litigious. I note the US case of Capital and Counties PLC versus Hampshire County Council in 1996, where a firefighting officer was held liable after negligently ordering the sprinkler system in a building to be switched off when that building was burning. No government would want to send aid to Australia if there were a possibility of liability claims being made against their volunteers, so this legislation will cure this defect and encourage assistance to Australia in critical times. It is clearly not in our interests or in the interests of any country providing emergency assistance for any deterrent to access to foreign assistance, expertise and resources in times of emergency to exist. So this is sensible legislation which seeks to secure a very important arrangement and which has the coalition’s full support. I commend the bill to the House. MAIN COMMITTEE ing consequences of the Black Saturday bushfires, which afflicted my home state of Victoria earlier this year. The fires ravaged communities, devastated entire towns and resulted in the deaths of many people. We heard in many moving condolence speeches that were given in this House in February of this year the full horror of the fires and their effects on communities. The courageous efforts of local firefighting volunteers, Country Fire Authority firefighters and professional firefighters from other countries were critical in bringing those fires under control and in preventing the even worse damage that would have been suffered had those firefighters not been there to stand between the people of Victoria and the fires. The professional firefighters from the United States made a particularly notable contribution, but that contribution runs the risk of being restricted in future due to potential liability under Australian tort law. The Foreign States Immunities Amendment Bill 2009, which is before the House, addresses this problem and will facilitate cooperation with other countries in firefighting. Countries such as the United States, New Zealand and Canada have contributed to the containment of major bushfires in Australia in recent years. Their assistance has included the provision of personnel and equipment and the development of effective firefighting strategies. Most recently, the United States Department of the Interior dispatched 100 firefighters to reinforce Australian efforts to contain the Victorian fires. Other nations have also made substantial contributions, as seen in the deployment of 116 firefighters by New Zealand and 52 firefighters from Canada. Such assistance was reinforced by the provision by the United States of technical specialists such as experienced pilots for fixed wing firebombing aircraft. The United States firefighters who helped earlier this year and in previous years have been able to provide specialist assistance and training in prevention strategies and preparation for managing bushfires and they have, of course, been on the ground directly working with Australian firefighters in fighting fires. That second aspect is a crucial aspect of the assistance that is being provided by United States firefighters because we have seen that state and territory fire services can be overstretched when fires burn for a long time, running the risk of exhausting state and territory resources. Just to give an indication of the immense assistance that the United States firefighters have provided in recent years, we have had over 170 United States firefighters deployed to Australia over just the last seven years-in 2003 for the very large alpine fires, in 2006 for the fires in the Great Divide and in 2009 for the Black Saturday fires. There is also a point to be made about the very direct and immediate assistance that is provided by the United States firefighters which relates to the training that they receive and the similarity between Australian and United States conditions. What those two things mean is that United States firefighters are able to fit directly into crucial roles at short notice. It is worth mentioning that this is very much a reciprocal relationship. Over 260 Australian firefighters have been deployed to the United States on five occasions in recent years-71 Australian firefighters went to the United States in 2000, 40 in 2002, 47 in 2003, 69 in 2006 and 35 in 2008. These professionals have provided crucial assistance to our local volunteers and our professional Country Fire Authority firefighters. In key locations such as Bendigo, Beechworth and Glenhope, foreign firefighters came to reinforce local brigades and crews after days of exhausting firefighting. The effect on morale must have been significant in knowing that peoMAIN COMMITTEE",137,Foreign States Immunities Amendment Bill 2009
198,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (10.08 Am),"Members of this House saw and heard the devastatple in other countries were concerned and were ready to help those enduring Australia’s worse bushfires. The firefighters from other countries brought with them knowledge and personal experience from firefighting in their homelands. I have already noted the particular direct applicability of US firefighters’ experience of US conditions in enabling them to fit directly with firefighting efforts here. The future contribution is potentially in doubt as a result of potential liability in tort proceedings under Australian law. Currently firefighters from other countries may be liable for a range of events-including death, personal injury and property damage-that result from acts or omissions by them in the course of providing assistance in firefighting efforts in Australia. That has given rise to concern by the United States government. In fact, because of the possibility of its firefighters becoming entangled in litigation here, United States law has prompted these amendments. In particular, there is concern that firefighters might be held liable or might be sued for acts arising from genuine attempts by them to assist those in need. Fear of litigation has some potential to undermine firefighting efforts, as it might distract foreign professional firefighters from the task at hand. One can readily imagine that concerns about being sued might be exacerbated if a US firefighter might be liable for actions undertaken not as a result of something that they have judged to be correct action but because they have adhered to the orders of local officials. That kind of fear places an unnecessary burden on these hard working firefighters from overseas who generously lend us their assistance. Removing the cause of these concerns is likely to help foreign firefighters perform their duties even more efficiently. The amendments to the Foreign States Immunities Act 1985 seek to provide legal immunity to foreign firefighters from proceedings in tort from actions arising from the provision of assistance. The proposed changes to the legislation will not provide immunity from civil liability arising from actions undertaken outside of firefighting duties, nor will the immunity apply to any liability under the criminal law. As a result, the protections conferred by these proposed amendments remain limited in scope so as to address the concerns of firefighters from other nations-but the particular focus is on the request from the United States-but will not create unreasonable exceptions nor affect the overall enforcement of Australian law. By addressing these concerns, enactment of these amendments will further strengthen firefighting cooperation with other countries. In 2001, Australia signed an agreement with the United States to provide a basis for mutual assistance to fight major fires. The agreement has been overwhelmingly beneficial, allowing for American firefighters to assist in Australia and reciprocally allowing Australian firefighters to assist in the United States. I have detailed the recent, large-scale assistance that Australian firefighters have been able to provide in the United States, notably in California. As I think is well known, California has very similar bushfire conditions because of the large extent of its forests and the dryness of its summers. This means it is useful for US firefighters to come here, and it means our firefighters are particularly useful when they go to the United States. Renewal of this agreement is currently being negotiated between Australia and the United States, as it is due to formally conclude in 2011. The terms of the new agreement will provide for more comprehensive assistance, allowing all states and territories in Australia to seek the assistance of the United States. It will provide Australian firefighters with the same kind of MAIN COMMITTEE legal immunity when assisting in the United States, but the United States government has indicated that it is unable to finalise acceptance of the agreement while its firefighters remain subject to potential litigation here. The amendments contained in this bill will address the concerns of the United States and allow the agreement to be finalised. The bill demonstrates very clearly that Australia values the contribution of these firefighters and creates a basis for greater bilateral cooperation in future-not merely with the United States but, because it provides a model, with a range of other countries who have also indicated willingness to assist Australia in its firefighting efforts. I mention in that regard France and Japan, which have very generously extended offers of assistance. to natural disasters. Whether they are floods, cyclones or bushfires, natural disasters are part of our history. Luckily, or by good planning and good grace, our volunteer firefighters are part of our history. They do a most excellent job. Of course, Australia is just like a lot of other countries. We have emergency service and bushfire volunteers to help deal with the natural disasters that affect this country, as they affect others as well. In recent years, as previous speakers have said also, there has been quite a flow of support between nations. We offer our support and they offer it back to us. I welcome this chance to make a contribution on the Foreign States Immunities Amendment Bill 2009, which is designed to provide civil immunity in our courts for firefighters from the USA. This bill, when passed, will help to allow the finalisation of the exchange agreement between Australia and the US, as is being negotiated by Victoria. The bill will provide immunity from proceedings for foreign states and their personnel where acts or omissions occur in the course of their providing emergency management assistance in Australia. The passing of this bill will amend the Foreign States Immunities Act 1985 to provide protection for the personnel who are in Australia assisting an Australian government in their preparation for, prevention of or management of emergencies or disasters. It is a general principle of international law that representatives of foreign states are entitled to immunity from the litigious jurisdiction of the nation in which they are hosted. This originated from the obligation on host nations to provide immunity from prosecution for diplomatic representatives. In Australia, that obligation was enshrined in the law with the Foreign States Immunities Act 1985. Specifically, personnel from foreign states covered under the act included people from heads of state to government officials. With specific regard to firefighters, since the year 2000, following an international agreement between Australia, New Zealand and the United States, firefighters have been sent back and forth between all of those countries. In fact, in 2003 and 2007 American firefighters came to Australia and provided assistance with bushfire threats. A new agreement between Australia and the United States is now required. However, it cannot be finalised until this bill formalises the immunity requirements from tort proceedings for US firefighters resulting from their carrying out their duties. Following the tragic Black Saturday fires in Victoria, it is of particular and urgent concern that we are certain of having US firefighting support in reserve. The Foreign States Immunities Amendment Bill 2009 specifically amends subsections 42(1) and 42(2) of the act, allowing the minister to provide opinion to the Governor General regarding immunity or privilege under the act. It is the case that this bill does not provide immunity for a foreign state in proceedings concerning the death of or personal injury to a person or the loss or damage to property. Although this bill is about legal issues, it is also about MAIN COMMITTEE",139,Foreign States Immunities Amendment Bill 2009
199,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (10.20 Am),"The reality is that Australia has always been subjectdealing with the threats of bushfires and other natural disasters in Australia. Often, we hear from overseas about mass loss of life in floods, earthquakes, mudslides or other disasters, yet we seem to have had so few losses from natural disasters in Australia. Before Black Saturday this year, perhaps that was true, but it has not been since-with nearly 200 lives being lost in that tragedy. Prior to this year, our other large bushfire disasters have included Ash Wednesday in 1983, when 71 people were killed in bushfires in Victoria and South Australia. I remember at that time-on my way to a rowing regatta event, which used to be my sport when I was a lot younger-flying across the country and seeing the huge plumes of smoke, particularly across central to eastern Australia, that were emanating from the fires at that time. Also, in February 1967, in Tasmania, 62 people died in fires and 1,400 homes were lost. More recently, in 2003 here in Canberra, four lives were lost and 530 homes were destroyed. Having lived in Canberra when I was in the Army, it did not seem real that something like that could happen-a modern city, albeit with forests right up to the edge of it. It seemed almost surreal for those of us who have some knowledge of the suburbs that were affected so badly by that fire. While it is important to concentrate on the circumstances surrounding the tragedy of the deaths and loss of property that have occurred in these fires-and we do that in order to learn not only from the mistakes but also from the successes that have taken place-we must also consider that many more lives could have been lost and property destroyed if we had not had our bushfire brigades and if this country did not have the benefit of their courage and dedication. I spend much of my time in Cowan promoting and encouraging volunteers. I am talking about the sorts of people who keep our clubs and community organisations going-school P&Cs, service clubs, RSLs and others. These volunteers are, without doubt, a vital part of our community. There is, of course, another group of volunteers who quite literally on occasion risk their lives in support of our communities. In particular I refer to the bushfire brigades and emergency service volunteers that we have throughout the country, including my electorate and others close to it. With Cowan being an outer metropolitan electorate, there is in fact a bushfire brigade in Wanneroo, and in nearby Joondalup, which is in the Moore electorate, there is the Wanneroo-Joondalup State Emergency Service unit. My friend Mal Washer, the federal member for Moore, is extremely proud to have those SES volunteers based in Moore, although pretty much half of them come from Cowan and half from Moore. We certainly thank them for their service. When I met the SES unit last year, there were 56 members, so unfortunately I cannot take the time to name them today for their dedicated service and commitment to the community, but I would like to mention a few of the leadership group: Karen Condon; deputy unit managers Ian Kirk and Ron Duyvestein; Anne Haynes, the administration manager; team leaders Bill Hansen, Damien Gee, George Moylan, Ken Dewhirst and Steve Faulkner; and deputy team leaders Ian Kidd, Ned Gavan, Paula Gillespie, Peter Higgins and Scott McBroom. Earlier this year when the parliament expressed our condolences regarding the Black Saturday bushfires, I took the opportunity to speak of the Wanneroo Volunteer Bush Fire Brigade and Wanneroo Volunteer Fire Support Brigade. I expressed my appreciation for their courage and the risks they take for the people of Western Australia and, more often, Wanneroo and surrounding districts. I will, however, say this again: it takes a very special person to be prepared to put themselves in the way of extreme danger. These are very special people. MAIN COMMITTEE I really do wonder what sort of country we would have if we did not have people who were prepared to put their lives on the line, particularly in a volunteer capacity. They give up their spare time for the community and, while I understand camaraderie and the esprit de corps is drawn upon as a sense of encouragement for them, the facts are that they could have chosen an easier path. They could do what most people do and adopt the attitude of just leaving it to someone else. This is a job that somebody must do and this nation is all the better because we have very fine Australians willing to stand up and be counted. I congratulate them and I honour them for what they do for all of us. Having diverged from the detail of this bill, I can say that it has my full support and that I look forward to it being passed quickly so that we can be sure that, should they be required to assist with firefighting in Australia in the coming months, there will certainly be no obstacles to us being able to call upon our firefighting friends from the United States. I commend this bill to the House and I commend the government for bringing it forward. Immunities Amendment Bill 2009. As a resident of South-East Queensland, having lived in Ipswich all my life, my family and I have witnessed first hand what natural disasters will do to you in terms of the cost not just to family life but to domestic arrangements and in financial impoverishment. I can recall vividly the 1974 flood-I was a young boy-and the devastation it wreaked when my parents home was eight feet underneath the water and when about a third or more of Ipswich and about a third of Brisbane was under water when Cyclone Wanda came in from the north. I will always remember with fondness the firefighters and the wonderful work that they did to save the lives and the property of so many Ipswichians and people in the rural communities around Ipswich. Last year, I was pleased to have the Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, come to my electorate and visit the Lockyer Valley and meet with the representatives of the various rural fire brigades. I pay tribute to the work they do, particularly in relation to the fires we have had in rural Ipswich, the Lockyer Valley and the Fassifern Valley in the last few years. I also pay tribute to the SES workers, particularly in Ipswich with the terrible storms we have had in the last six months and the devastation that has been inflicted upon the area. I praise also the Ripley Valley Rural Fire Brigade and Jim Runham for the work they do and thank the businesses and the state Labor government in Queensland for the support they give to rural fire brigades. The people in rural fire brigades volunteer their time, effort and money and they make tremendous sacrifices to assist people, particularly in rural areas. I am pleased to say that the rural fire brigades in the Fassifern Valley and the Lockyer Valley make an enormous contribution and are warmly appreciated and valued for the contribution they make and their community spirit in the rural communities in my electorate. The Australian Labor Party has three tenets concerning our foreign policy. The first one concerns our engagement with Asia, including assistance and practical help, particularly in the Asia-Pacific area. We see that expressed in places like Timor, the Solomon Islands and other localities in South-East Asia and through our cooperation with our regional allies such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore on issues concerning people-smuggling, the trafficking of drugs and other areas where the Australian Federal Police are doing tremendous work, working with local law enforcement agencies. MAIN COMMITTEE",141,Foreign States Immunities Amendment Bill 2009
200,Mr Neumann (Blair) (10.31 Am),"I am happy to speak in support of the Foreign StatesThe second tenet of the Australian Labor Party concerns our engagement with the United Nations and our commitment to multinational action with respect to the relief of poverty and assistance to the poor in relation to their health and other circumstances through the World Health Organisation, UNESCO and other vital international organisations. The third tenet of the Australian Labor Party’s commitment internationally is our alliance with the United States. The United States is a wonderful friend of Australia, not just in times of joy but in times of crisis. We saw that in World WarI and World War II. We have seen it on other occasions. We value their assistance in East Timor. We also value their contribution regionally. Many of us as federal politicians have attended wonderful celebrations concerning Victory in the Pacific Day, the Battle of the Coral Sea and other occasions. But it is also about the ongoing practical assistance the United States has provided us and our reciprocal arrangements with the United States concerning firefighting. Parts of the United States are very similar to Australia. Queensland is a state of vastness with respect to not just geography but also the climate that we have. I launched the Queensland Farmers Federation climate change report, funded by the federal government. Queensland suffers tremendous challenges with respect to climate change. We see that not just in floods but in fire as well. The legislation here is really Victorian based, but Victoria is negotiating, in a sense, on behalf of all states and territories of Australia. The conclusion of an agreement with the United States is vital to ensuring that the assistance that the United States has provided over so many years and on so many occasions since the early 2000s can continue. We have seen over the past seven years the United States deploy over 170 firefighters to Australia, particularly in places like Victoria. We have sent over 260 Australian firefighters to the United States on five occasions. This degree of friendliness and cooperation is emblematic of the wonderful relationship that Australia and Australians enjoy with the United States. We need their help and they need ours. It is a matter of friendship, comradeship and good neighbourly relations. We appreciate the specialist assistance they have given us in training and prevention strategies and in the preparation for managing bushfires. We also are very appreciative of the practical, financial assistance they have given us in this regard and of the way in which firefighters can learn from one another in the circumstances. It is very important that at short notice we can get access to their assistanceand they to ours. As someone who practised as a lawyer for nearly a quarter of a century before being elected to this place, I want to say that the issue of tort is a challenge to all of us. When a person is sued they can expect that the plaintiff may claim damages for pain and suffering, loss of amenities, economic loss, Griffiths v Kerkemeyer damage, special damages-many kinds of damages which could be claimed against someone who has been ‘guilty of committing an act or omission of a negligent nature’. If that is the case, firefighters could expect that they could sustain large claims against themselves if they acted in a way which was negligent. So any way we can ensure immunity for American firefighters-our own firefighters have a similar immunity in the United States-is important in the circumstances of helping one another. But this does not mean that, if a US firefighter comes to this country and commits a criminal act of manslaughter, robbery, assault, murder or break-and-enter, that person should be absolved of the laws which govern all of us. That is appropriate. If you go to another country and you decide to traffic drugs, you reap the consequences of the punishment of the legal sysMAIN COMMITTEE tem imposed by that other country. We do not expect that when US firefighters come to this country they will engage in criminal acts, but if they do they should be charged. This legislation before the House does not absolve anyone from criminal acts, but it is important legislation because the United States have made it very clear that, due to their domestic legal arrangements and requirements, they cannot finalise the agreement with us unless the immunity is in place for their firefighters, and we would expect nothing less for ours. This is a good bill. It is a bill which ensures that we can help them and they can help us. It is legislation that should have bipartisan support. We appreciate the fact that those opposite also support this legislation. It ensures that sovereign immunity, which is a very important principle of international law, is upheld. This legislation recognises that we are part of a global community. It recognises also that we need to protect our neighbours’ firefighters, as they need to protect ours. I would hope that my own state of Queensland takes up the challenge in this regard. I hope that we will continue to see in this country our friends from America and that they will receive our sons and daughters over there with the same degree of neighbourliness and the same degree of charity that they have in the past. This is about being a good Samaritan, to use the New Testament principle. I commend the government for the legislation before the House and warmly speak in support of it. 2009 was described quite clearly by the minister in the second reading speech. He said: In Australia, the Foreign States Immunities Act 1985 provides the legislative regime for the immunity of foreign states from the civil jurisdiction of our courts. At present, under section 13 of that act, foreign state immunity does not extend to proceedings concerning death, personal injury or property damage arising from acts or omissions in Australia. This means that foreign governments could be exposed to legal proceedings as a result of sending their personnel to assist in emergencies in Australia. Consequently, this legislation deals with that matter. The minister also advised us: I note also that the immunity would not apply in any criminal proceedings. All of this is a very welcome initiative. Quite obviously, persons coming to our assistance, virtually as volunteers, should not have to worry about being taken on in areas that frequently might relate to the fact that they lit a fire-because we have a paranoia in Australia about the management of forests. Some green group could actually challenge one of these fellows if he were on a bulldozer and pushing down trees. That is how silly our law is, and that is why so many people died in Victoria. There is a need to give these people protection from the abuse of our court proceedings or from some other act, where they are entitled to protection. This is welcomed, and of course it is to be reciprocal, inasmuch as Australian firefighters attending fires in the Northern Hemisphere, in the United States, will have similar protection. It is interesting, from my own personal knowledge of the history of this matter, that, to the best of my knowledge, this exchange commenced when Australia sent firefighters to the United States at the time of the destruction through wildfire of Yellowstone National Park and other areas. I have informed the House before that, as a consequence of those visits, and as the then Minister for Forestry and Conservation, I called a ministerial council. We arranged a briefing for the state ministers by some of the senior firefighters who went and assisted in the attempts to put out those fires in the United States. MAIN COMMITTEE",143,Foreign States Immunities Amendment Bill 2009
201,Mr Tuckey (O’connor) (10.41 Am),"The Foreign States Immunities Amendment BillThe most interesting thing about it, from my recollection-and the horror it generated when I saw 170 people in Victoria murdered by bad public policy-was that a senior firefighter took us through what had happened in the United States. The green activists had taken over and the forests had been put into reserves and then treated by the authorities with benign neglect. Of course, the consequence of that was a massive build-up of forest waste and an overpopulation of the forests. When Abel Tasman landed in, I think, 1642 on the island of Tasmania he talked of a forest consisting of gigantic trees. He measured their diameter in fathoms-a fathom being six foot. He said that you could see for miles-or leagues, or whatever his choice of words was-between them and there was evidence around their bases of burning. That was the original forest in Australia-but, of course, we were talking about the original forest in the United States. The American Indians actually harvested trees and undertook similar burning practices, as did the Australian Aboriginals. And they were safe forests. They were a safe environment. That senior firefighter pointed out to us how the neglect through public policy had created firetraps. He also told us that the heat intensity was such that the soil was sterilised for a metre below the surface. That is evidenced in Yellowstone National Park today. A little while ago-a year or so ago-friends of mine visited the park and were looking for their money back. They said that they thought they were going to see a wonderful forest and they actually saw blackened tree stumps-a bit like the edges of Canberra after it was attacked by a nuclear event. That firefighter told us that Australia was next. When he departed and I asked the ministers what they would like to do about that, they said, ‘We’ll have to put out a press release.’ I then asked-and this is a matter of record-‘What are you going to put in the press release?’ and was told, ‘We’re going to need more appliances and more orange overalls.’ A project was put to us just yesterday by a Territory opposition spokesman attempting to do something about this-and, by the way, he was present as one of the ministers at that ministerial council. He mentioned the McArthur index. It was predicted before the Victorian fires that fires had the potential, because of the fuel build-up on the forest floor and the association of climatic circumstances and ignition-however that might occur-to exceed the scale by 100. My recollection is that the fellow who put out that index-a fellow called Packham-said that at 2.5 on the scale firefighters became useless and redundant and that there was a great risk of death. Looking at the figures again yesterday, it was 25. But it hardly makes a difference, because at 100 people can actually be vaporised and Land Rovers made of aluminium can melt. That is what happened in Victoria. In today’s media, one sees that the royal commission-which the minister also makes reference to in the second reading speech-is now taking evidence. The greatest number of submissions to that commission related to the principle of ‘no fuel no fire’. That the commission have taken this long, considering that summer is nearly upon us-we are into spring-is to be criticised, in my view. They beat up on the firefighters-when, on the scale of the fire, their appliances and orange overalls were ineffective and they could not fight it-but there are also issues around the management practices of the Victorian government. The Victorian government received a report from one of its own committees that identified the need for hazard reduction and hid behind the excuse, oft repeated by the green activists, that more scientific research was needed. What? In 1642 we were told how to do it. In 1694 another Dutch sailor went up the west coast and, when he was off the Swan River as we know MAIN COMMITTEE it today in January, he reported much smoke. They were primitive people with no fire engines, no yellow overalls and no helicopters burning the forest in the middle of summer. Why could they achieve that without personal loss of life or limb? They did it regularly. The forest benefited from it. The eucalyptus tree, our great symbol, is a product of that burning. You can go to areas of Australia where there are significant watersheds and it will be the only places you will find other varieties of trees that survive burning. Eucalyptus thrive on it. We have had a very necessary piece of legislation drawn to our attention. We had a briefing yesterday about a warning system-that is fine, if you are not in a Telstra black spot, of course. We did not need warnings about loss of life and injury, because it was practical to stay with your house if you had properly prepared it for fire and protected it from fire. The intensity of a bushfire means that with reasonable management it is practical to do so. I watched Q&A where the surviving occupants of Marysville were interviewed. One lady who I thought was very credible as she was the local historian said that as they sat on the oval they saw no flames. But all of a sudden everything went black and the houses started exploding into flames. People in that vicinity were actually vaporised. A young pregnant woman trying to get to the oval where there was some clearing and some protection was found dead from asphyxiation on the road. That does not happen in a safe forest environment. That is the first point: no fuel, no fire. On the McArthur scale there is a point at which the treetops start burning and of course that contributes a lot of oil. But, again, it needs the heat from the burning of the debris on the forest floor. Debris rises a metre per hectare per annum. We are advised by the ACT member yesterday that debris levels surrounding Canberra are nearly back up to what they were in 2003. It is all going to happen again. I raised this at one stage when I was minister and a New South Wales bureaucrat accused me of wanting to bitumise the forests of New South Wales. That man should be recommended for some court proceedings too. As far as I am concerned, what happened in New South Wales was criminal by neglect. Yet when the Brumby government were advised by one of its own committees that they had to do something about it, they in fact refused to do so because there were a few votes in it. ‘I’m safe. I’ve got a job in parliament. There is no bush around it. Why should I worry about the people of Marysville and all those other towns?’ Some were lucky enough only to lose their property but many lost their life. This legislation deals with putting out fires, and I endorse every part of it, but in his second reading speech the minister said: Before concluding in terms of this bill, I take this opportunity to welcome again the release of the interim report of the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission. The government has commenced a detailed analysis of the recommendations in the interim report and will continue to provide whatever assistance we possibly can to the royal commission. The patently obvious outcome of about 20 reports is that the forests of Australia are no longer the safe environment for humanity that they once were. Even over years gone by they were not. If they were a private workplace and 178 people were killed in a factory fire, where would the unions and the occupational health and safety people be? They would be outside the front gate putting up the gibbets. They would want the directors of the company put in jail. The directors of the company in this case are the Victorian government-or, if you like, the Victorian parliament, because I do not think the opposition down there has ever made a squeak either. MAIN COMMITTEE The reality is that those people were killed because of the intensity of the fire. There are two factors over which humanity has some control: one is the overpopulation of the forest and the other is the fuel loads accumulating on the forest floor. That is not smart, because, as everybody who has cleared land knows-as you, Deputy Speaker Secker, would know-to keep logs burning you have to keep pushing them together. Australian people were talked into doing away with the Australian forest products industry, yet what did the industry do in the forest? They maintained a road system. As a report to this parliament indicated, after the fires around Canberra and through the Snowy Mountains the roads that had been blocked off and filled in had to be bulldozed so that people could get machinery in to try to put out fires. When the fires had been extinguished, the authorities immediately went in and ripped those roads up again. So they will not be there next time. I can say, on the advice of a person in the Canberra region who should know, that in many places those levels of debris are back to where they were before the fires. What are we doing as a parliament? Do we believe in occupational health and safety? Do we believe in the rights of people to be protected by good management practices and good public policy? We fund every state government in Australia to about 50 per cent of their expenditures. Why aren’t we today-in fact, why weren’t we six months ago-debating a bill for the formation of, for instance, a safety commission for forest management? Surely we should use the power of the chequebook? I might add that there is very little incentive, from an expenditure point of view, for state governments to create a safe environment in their forests, because under the natural emergency agreement with the states they spend the first $5 million, or something like that, and then the poor old federal taxpayer has to fork out the rest. I do not know how much of the reported $300 million or $400 million the Victorian government has had to shell out over and above the public subscription to the Red Cross following these fires, but if the federal government pays for it why should the Victorian government take the logical step of turning its forests-the reserves it has created by law-into a safe environment? The forest products industry did it in numerous ways. They maintained a road system. They thinned the forest. They cut trees out without annihilating the forest. Clear-felling, which was much criticised, never destroyed a forest. As every farmer knows, trees have this wonderful ability to grow back if you leave a paddock long enough without any grazing or ploughing. The reality is that this government, under the national emergency arrangements, has to say, to the states at least, ‘We’re going to put an inspector in, and if your forests are a clear risk because you haven’t managed them properly then you are excluded from those arrangements.’ That is what any insurance company would do. That would be the minimum. I would cut all their money off until they did the right thing. It is they who created these reserves. It is they who got themselves decent votes and preferences from the Greens. All of a sudden they have encountered the events that followed. The legislation most needed in this place is at a national level to address the fact so that we do have an inspectorate. The inspectorate can go and look at forests and if there is not an eight-year turnaround on hazard reduction prescribed burning their money will just be cut off until they achieve it. Either they can do that or they can let the forest products industry back in there. The forest products industry used to put fires out before they became hazardous beMAIN COMMITTEE cause they had D9s, other pieces of machinery and roads to attack it. All that has been lost. (Time expired) Mrs D’ATH (Petrie) (11.01 am)-I rise to speak in support of the Foreign States Immunities Amendment Bill 2009. This is one of those bills that will get no attention in the media and will proceed without any fanfare. However, the importance of this bill should be acknowledged. The Foreign States Immunities Act 1985 provides a regime for the immunity of foreign states from the civil jurisdiction of Australian courts. This immunity is subject to various exceptions listed in the act. These exceptions include proceedings concerning the death of or personal injury to a person and loss or damage to tangible property caused by an act or omission that occurs in Australia. This bill seeks to amend the act to enable a foreign state, and its emergency management personnel, to be immune in tort proceedings under the act for acts or omissions that occur in the course of the foreign state providing emergency management assistance to Australia. It is important to note that this immunity would apply only to acts and omissions of the foreign personnel in the course of providing the emergency management assistance. This means, importantly, that any negligence by a foreign official outside of their duties would remain subject to the jurisdiction of Australian courts. In addition, and equally important, the immunity would not extend to any criminal proceedings. With current negotiations proceeding with the United States for a new agreement that will further enhance the support exchanged between Australia and the United States in relation to fire suppression resources, this bill is not only useful to assist those negotiations but also essential. One aspect of the new agreement which remains outstanding is the status of the United States and its firefighters in legal proceedings that may be brought in Australia. Due to their domestic legal requirements, the United States cannot finalise the agreement unless immunity for tort proceedings is provided concerning the actions of their firefighters in the course of their duties. It is the case that firefighters from the United States under the existing agreement have been assisting with fires in Australia, but it has remained a concern of the United States throughout this time that such legal protections do not exist. Australia’s bushfire season rapidly approaches and the devastating effects of the Black Saturday fires are still very much being felt by the families and communities involved and also by the broader Australian community. In this context it is important that Australia take all necessary steps to ensure strong relationships and formal agreements are entered into with other countries that can provide support in circumstances of emergencies or disasters within our country. This is not to say that Australia does not have its own obligations to assist in relation to emergencies and disasters across the nation, but by taking such action and entering into such agreements we will provide support to our own emergency personnel who may assist those reciprocal countries in times of need. It is reasonable for any country to want to ensure, when sending their emergency personnel to another country to provide essential resources, that immunity is provided in the exercising of those duties while in that country. We would seek such support ourselves for our own emergency personnel. This bill will enable vital USA firefighters to be deployed to Australia over the next fire season. We should take this moment to acknowledge that in the last seven years over 170 US firefighters have been deployed to Australia, on three occasions: for the 2003 Alpine fires, the 2006 Great Divide fires and of course the 2009 Black Saturday fires. Over 260 Australian MAIN COMMITTEE firefighters have been deployed to the United States on five occasions. Because Australia and the United States have similar training and operate in similar conditions, US firefighters can fit into crucial roles at short notice. They provided invaluable assistance during the devastating Black Saturday fires. Let us not forget the human face of these devastating fires. Just this week my local community on the Redcliffe Peninsula have been host to survivors from the Kinglake fires. People in the community have hosted these survivors by billeting them in their homes so that these survivors can spend time relaxing and enjoying life-not something to be taken for granted. The Redcliffe Seaside Traders have organised this visit and have been holding events across the peninsula to raise money in support of the survivors and the great work being done by the Kinglake community. Jenny Wald, one of my electorate officers, was in attendance and delivered a speech on my behalf yesterday at an event held by the Redcliffe Seaside Traders at Scarborough State School to commemorate the victims. I hope the survivors from Kinglake enjoy their visit to the Redcliffe Peninsula, with beautiful Moreton Bay as their backyard. It is certainly a great place to visit. We know that a trip like this cannot heal the pain felt by these survivors, but we do hope that it provides some relief and an opportunity to see that people all across Australia are here to provide support. The people of Redcliffe are certainly renowned for that. On the Australian United States exchange program, it is important to note that the program also provides valuable experience to Australian and US firefighters, helping firefighters develop new skills and knowledge. The new agreement will give equivalent immunity for Australian firefighters when operating in the United States. Of course, this bill does not limit itself to firefighters in the United States. Even though at this stage there is no intention to enter into such agreements, the Australian government is certainly able to create immunity by entering into similar arrangements with other countries. Although fires are a serious threat to Australia, we cannot ignore that many other emergencies or disasters can occur, whether natural or otherwise. Australia is certainly not immune to cyclones, and the American people are still recovering and rebuilding their lives after the consequences of Hurricane Katrina. We also remember disasters such as the Thredbo landslide and Stuart Diver’s rescue, and the Beaconsfield mine collapse with the rescue of Brant Webb and Todd Russell. With those miraculous rescues, our thoughts also go to the families who lost loved ones in those disasters. We will always remember the terrifying tsunami that struck Indonesia and surrounding areas and the devastating loss of life-again, communities that continue to rebuild to this very day. Support came from numerous nations, including Australia, to assist in that disaster. We cannot put a figure on the human toll that arises from the event of an emergency or disaster. We know that the effects are lifelong and widespread. We as a government have an obligation, where circumstances are within our control, to provide all the support we can and to put in place the mechanisms to forward-plan for emergencies and disasters. It is Australia’s obligation to ensure that barriers do not stand in the way of obtaining foreign support when times of emergency and disaster strike. Where countries have the ability to share expert resources, they should ensure that they provide that support. We also have a responsibility, which is to ensure that protection is provided to our emergency personnel and equally that we are providing such support to foreign countries in similar circumstances. MAIN COMMITTEE As I have stated, disasters come in many forms and they are not all naturally occurring. One example of a non-natural disaster emergency, of course, is mining accidents, and the United States and Australia have certainly seen their fair share. These types of disasters can require urgent specialist assistance to save lives and, in cases like these, the Australian government may wish to call quickly on assistance from another country. Of course, this bill does not result in immunity being provided automatically to foreign emergency management personnel that may assist Australia in such circumstances. Rather, what this bill provides is a framework for limited civil immunity to be provided where appropriate on a case by case basis. I hope the passing of this bill will not only assist in the finalisation of a new agreement between Australia and the United States but also lead the way to new agreements and stronger bonds with a range of countries in the exchange of critical resources in emergency and disaster response. The message is simple: the Australian government is committed to strengthening our capacity to withstand disasters and emergencies in order to protect the safety and security of all Australians. I commend this bill to the House. 2009 will permit the states and territories to conclude a vital new agreement with the United States for the exchange of fire suppression resources including firefighting personnel. As the next bushfire season approaches, we need no reminder that emergencies and disasters can have a devastating effect on the lives and welfare of Australians. Only seven months ago on Black Saturday we saw horrific bushfires in Victoria, and many members will recall the impact on the city of Bendigo in my electorate, where we had the worse disaster in our history. I spoke in the debate on the condolence motion for this incident and I mentioned the tragic death of one person and the total destruction of 59 homes in those Bendigo fires. I am now in a position to point out that, even more tragically, the police have now determined that fire was deliberately lit. How anybody could light a fire on a day like that under those sorts of conditions is probably beyond comprehension but that is the unfortunate conclusion the police have come to. To date there has been nobody charged with that offence. The Victorian Department of Primary Industries has provided me with its assessment of farm losses in the fires on the same day at Reidsdale, about 15 kilometres north-east of Bendigo. I remind the House of some of those statistics: 85 rural properties around Reidsdale were affected and almost 6,500 hectares of land were damaged. Most of this was grazing pasture but of note was the impact on two commercial olive-growing operations at Barfold, where more than 300 hectares of olive trees were affected. Although there was significant livestock and wildlife loss, fortunately there was no loss of human life in that particular fire. A royal commission is now investigating the issues and concluding its investigation arising from the Victorian fires as we get ready for the forthcoming fire season. The Victorian government last month warned that this summer’s bushfire conditions could be even worse than those which led to the deadly fires last February. It has identified 52 towns that will be at particular risk this summer. In my electorate this includes the city of Bendigo and several nearby townships around Castlemaine. Our volunteer and professional emergency services workers do a superb job of helping us to prepare for the fire season and helping fight bushfires when they do occur. During the Black Saturday fires in my electorate there were countless heroic efforts to save people and MAIN COMMITTEE",145,Foreign States Immunities Amendment Bill 2009
202,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (11.12 Am),"The Foreign States Immunities Amendment Billpossessions. Many of our firefighters are volunteers who readily give up their time and spare time to protect our communities, and they work tirelessly when called out to a fire. It is no exaggeration to say that we could not survive without them. But we simply do not have enough firefighters for the sort of extensive and long-lasting fires we experienced last February. For some years United States authorities have provided critical help to Victoria in the lead-up to, and during, the annual bushfire season. A cooperative exchange program allows personnel and equipment from one country to be deployed to the other country to provide vital operational assistance. This also allows Australian firefighters to share and develop specialist knowledge and skills by participating in training exercises and study tours. The similarity in conditions in Australia and United States means that both countries’ firefighters are able to fit straight into front-line roles at short notice. This capability has been invaluable during long bushfires, when local resources get overstretched and exhausted. Over 170 United States firefighters have been deployed to Victoria since 2003, including 73 during the Black Saturday fires earlier this year. A new cooperation agreement is currently being negotiated that would apply across the whole of Australia. Victoria is leading the negotiations but, if they are successful, the new agreement will benefit all states and territories. However, the United States has been concerned for some time that Australian law currently provides no immunity from tort proceedings to its firefighters while they are engaged in bushfire assistance activities in Australia. The United States is understandably concerned about its firefighters becoming caught up in legal disputes in Australia, and it cannot finalise a new cooperation agreement without this immunity. Without the new arrangement in place, United States authorities will not be able to provide help to the states and territories in the upcoming bushfire season, potentially leaving our fire services dangerously exposed. This bill will amend the Foreign States Immunities Act so that regulations may be made applying immunity from tort proceedings to a foreign state, including its personnel, where they assist the Commonwealth, a state or a territory to prepare for, prevent or manage domestic emergencies and disasters. The immunity would only apply to acts or omissions of foreign personnel in the course of their duties and would not apply in any criminal proceedings. The agreement being negotiated provides for a reciprocal immunity to be granted to all Australia and its firefighters under United States law. This will ensure an equivalent level of protection for Australian firefighters when they are operating in the United States. The limited and appropriate protection in the bill will allow the United States to confidently deploy its firefighters in response to a request for help from Australia. The new bushfire exchange program with the United States will form an integral part of the fire management and response capacity of all Australian states and territories and will enhance the safety and security of all Australians. This bill is one way the Australian government can support the states and territories as they prepare for the coming fire season and I commend this bill to the House. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (11.18 am)-I do not want to spend a lot of time talking about the technical parts of the Foreign States Immunities Amendment Bill 2009, because that has been well covered by speakers on both sides, but I would like to make some comments, having had some experience working in international affairs in areas where such agreements had to be negotiated. There can always be a response about giving immunity-should or shouldn’t we? From a purist’s point of view, people often say, ‘Well, there are immunities now given for all MAIN COMMITTEE sorts of things.’ The fact is that it is the world we deal in, the world we live in and if we want to get help from other countries and we want to give it then it is necessary to give this immunity in several areas. Not in criminal areas, we never do that. It is civil immunity. We certainly do not want a situation where firefighters or other emergency personnel are deployed to Australia, as acts of goodwill and frequently as volunteers, and are inadvertently tied up in civil proceedings in the courts. This does not include where somebody has a legitimate cause of action in an Australian jurisdiction; that will prevail and be taken to the appropriate authority. So it does not have an impact on that. But because we are interdependent in the globalised framework that we operate in, this is an effective mechanism. It will allow personnel-emergency personnel in this case-to be deployed as needed, and because this will work in a reciprocal way it can give comfort to both sides. But the fact that we have an emergency or a disaster is not a precondition to the use of this regulation-making power. The way I understand the bill, and I know the Attorney would be able to answer this definitively, it will operate on a case-by-case basis. It is overarching legislation with regulation-making power as each situation warrants it. That is my reading of it. will be that regulation-making power there. I admit that I have not read all of the bill, but that is the way I read it at this stage. The regulation-making power will cover foreign states that send their personnel and/or equipment to participate in the ordinary course of emergency management activities. So the regulation-making power can extend to situations where preparations are being made for a disaster but where it has not occurred. It is very important that we undertake those activities and that we undertake that preparedness together, and frequently we do. In conclusion, this bill will provide a key way for the Australian government to assist the states and territories with bushfire prevention and management, because the states and territories handle bushfire prevention and management, and this is a way that the federal government can help. This bill is a key way for us, at a national level, to enhance our ability to withstand disasters and emergencies. I commend the bill to the House. thank the members for Farrer, Isaacs, Cowan, Blair, O’Connor, Petrie, Bendigo and Page for their contributions to the debate. I welcome the support from both sides of the House. I can confirm, in response to the question from the member for Page, that the bill provides a framework for limited civil immunity to be provided where appropriate on a case-by-case basis. Specifically, the Foreign States Immunities Amendment Bill 2009 amends the Foreign States Immunities Act to enable immunity from tort proceedings where a foreign state assists Australia in preparing for, preventing or managing emergencies or disasters. It is an important step to help Australian authorities prepare for the next bushfire season. In particular, I would like to thank opposition members for their bipartisan support of the bill and for their assistance in ensuring the speedy passage of this bill through the parliament in time for the forthcoming bushfire season.

204,Ms Saffin,Thank you. I think it is important that it is on a case-by-case basis and there,153,Foreign States Immunities Amendment Bill 2009
205,Mr Mcclelland (Barton,"Attorney-General) (11.22 am)-in reply-I would like toThe bill is necessary in order to permit the states and territories to finalise an agreement with the United States for the exchange of vital fire suppression resources prior to this year’s bushfire season. For some years, United States authorities have provided vital assistance to Victoria and other states in the lead-up to and during the annual bushfire season. Over 170 United States firefighters have been deployed to Victoria since 2003, including 73 for the devastating Black Saturday fires in 2009. These firefighters were deployed under an existing agreement between Victoria and the United States. While the existing agreement provides for the immunity of United States firefighters operating in Australia, that immunity has never been given effect in Australian law. This has been of some concern for the United States for some considerable time. Victoria and the other states and territories are currently negotiating a new agreement with United States authorities that would apply across Australia. Due to their domestic legal requirements, the United States cannot finalise this agreement unless immunity is in place for its firefighters-in other words, that the terms of the agreement can be enforced and will apply as part of Australia’s general law. Without the new agreement in place, the United States may not be able to assist Australia in the upcoming bushfire season, potentially leaving state and territory fire services dangerously exposed. The bill will facilitate the provision of immunity to the United States by inserting a new regulation-making power in the Foreign States Immunities Act. The bill will allow regulations to be made with respect to a foreign state that assists Australia to prepare for, prevent or manage emergencies or disasters. This will allow for immunity from tort proceedings to be provided to a foreign state that provides such assistance to Australia, pursuant to an agreement of the kind we were talking about. It is important to note that the bill places limitations on the new regulation-making power. The regulation-making power only applies to actions of foreign personnel in the course of providing emergency management assistance to the Australian government or a state or territory government, as opposed to any conduct that they may become involved in outside those duties. No immunity can be provided for actions of foreign personnel outside of their allocated emergency service duties. The bill has no effect in relation to criminal proceedings. Criminal conduct by foreign emergency management personnel will remain subject to the full jurisdiction of Australian courts. I should note, though, that to my knowledge there have been no such incidents from these people who have provided tremendous assistance to Australian authorities. Finally, the bill does not affect the liability of Australian governments, agencies or officers. The general framework of the bill is that it is a flexible option that permits the Australian government to assist the states and territories in future situations where they may urgently require assistance from overseas. There has been some commentary, I understand, as to whether it is appropriate to modify these provisions or permit this exemption to apply by way of regulation. The purpose of that is precisely to provide that flexibility. The regulationmaking power is intended to cover a range of emergencies and disasters, natural or otherwise. It was thought too prescriptive to have the measures set in stone in the legislation rather than creating a more flexible regulation-making power. Of course, the bill does not result in immunity being provided automatically to foreign emergency management personnel that may assist Australia in such circumstances. Rather, the MAIN COMMITTEE bill provides a framework for limited civil immunity to be provided, as I have indicated to the member for Page, where appropriate, on a case-by-case basis. I also recall that any regulation made under the new power will, of course, be subject to parliamentary scrutiny in each case under the scrutiny power that the Senate possesses. In conclusion, the bushfire exchange program with the United States is and will continue to be an integral part of Australia’s fire management and response capability. I should indicate our great appreciation to those United States firefighters who have assisted and will continue to assist Australian emergency workers. Because of their training and the similarity between Australian and United States conditions, United States firefighters are able to fit straight into crucial roles at very short notice. This extra capability is essential during long bushfire campaigns when state resources are overstretched and Australian fire fighters exhausted. The bill does no more than is necessary to provide appropriate protection to United States firefighters, and it allows the United States to be confident in responding to our requests for assistance. It also provides a general framework so that the Australian government may assist the states and territories in future situations where assistance from overseas is required and the issue of immunity arises. As I said when I introduced this bill into the House, it is an important measure to enhance our capacity to respond rapidly and effectively to emergencies and disasters. This contributes to the safety and security of Australians. In turn, it will facilitate Australians assisting with the safety and security of citizens of the United States. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 June, on motion by Mr Bowen: That this bill be now read a second time. morning to speak on the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Financial Services Modernisation) Bill 2009. This bill provides a mechanism for the regulation of margin lending, regulation in and around trustee companies and the regulation of so-called promissory notes. In addition, the bill also provides consistent federal regulation and oversight of these financial services and products by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The bill does present a good example of evidence that targeted reforms, reforms that go to particular parts of the Australian law and in particular to our financial system, can provide a positive result for all participants. This is a good example of where a bill has particularly identified areas in the law for improvement. It has targeted those areas, and it will solve some issues. All three of these financial areas, and the products and services in and around them, are very different. I guess it is appropriate to consider them independently of each other, and that is what I will do this morning. First, let me go to the area of margin lending. The problems surrounding margin lending were highlighted during the difficulties experienced by some financial services organisations MAIN COMMITTEE",153,Foreign States Immunities Amendment Bill 2009
206,Mr Pearce (Aston) (11.31 Am),"It is a great pleasure to rise in the parliament thisas the market turned in late 2007-early 2008. It has been widely canvassed in the press and elsewhere that there are regulatory failings in relation to margin lending. These have included many different areas, but a few of the areas identified include a potential lack of consistent and robust supervision and confusion over the adviser’s and the lender’s responsibilities, particularly in relation to the end user-the end user being the consumer, the customer, who has actually taken out the margin loan. Uniform national regulation of margin lending was agreed upon at COAG in March of 2008, and it was agreed that the responsibility for margin lending would pass to the Commonwealth so as to ensure that it was clearly and consistently regulated throughout our great country. Federal regulation of margin lending was raised in June 2008 through the green paper on consumer credit and financial services reform. Subsequently, in June of this year an exposure draft of the bill we are currently debating was released for public comment. There have been some changes to the draft, which is good to see, as result of the consultation process. The primary change from the exposure draft to this bill has been the extending of the transitional period in relation to licensing. There are three primary objectives of the margin-lending aspect in this bill. Firstly, the licensing of lenders and advisers who engage in margin loans will be mandatory. This will occur by instituting margin lending as a chapter 7 product in the Corporations Act. Madam Deputy Speaker Vale, you will know that chapter 7 in the Corporations Act is on financial services and markets. It is the chapter that particularly regulates all issues relating to financial products and financial services and was instituted as a result of the Howard government reforms under the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program, or CLERP, that the Howard government put in place during its time in office. Margin lending and the licensing of the lenders and advisers will now move into chapter 7 of the Corporations Act. Licensing will be compulsory 12 months after assent to the bill, and that will allow a phase-in approach. People will have up to 12 months to get themselves licensed, but once the 12 months following royal assent have passed it will be law that all people must be licensed. Secondly, margin call responsibility and ambiguities between advisers and providers will be clarified in this bill. I think this clarification is a very important step as any grey areas over margin calls and margin loans has the potential to ultimately negatively affect the investor. Toward the end of the bull market run there were a series of allegations that investors with margin loans were not informed by their financial adviser or loan provider that they faced a margin call. I am sure all members of the House-and, indeed, the whole parliamentconsider this to be an inappropriate and unsatisfactory situation for investors, particularly those investors who have taken out margin loans. Consequently, such investors essentially had the rug pulled from underneath them without warning as their equities were liquidated in order to meet the margin loan debt. That is the way the margin loan system works. Washing away any ambiguities in margin loan regulation is, I think, a positive step. Thirdly and finally, this bill provides additional investor protection mechanisms for margin lending in terms of responsible lending. The responsible lending aspect is to be provided through subsequent regulations, and those regulations are currently on public exposure for comment. I comment here that I think that the omission from the bill of responsible lending arrangements in relation to margin lending is not a good or desirable outcome. Given that these provisions will dictate the way in which a business is to structure its margin loan busiMAIN COMMITTEE ness, I think it would have been much more preferable to have those sorts of substantive elements vested in the bill itself rather than in regulations. I take the opportunity to highlight again that I think the government has a penchant for vesting the substantive measures of bills in subsequent regulations. This is something of a slippery method, because it provides the government the ability to escape some of the scrutiny that the parliament provides. It also fails to provide the business community with any sense of certainty. The reason for that is that regulations are much easier to change on the run than legislation. I think that from a practical, business certainty viewpoint, having these types of areas vested in the actual bill is a much more favourable situation than what we find today. A good example of that is a bill that went before the parliament late last year about short selling. We were told then that this bill was urgent and that the regulations would follow very soon after. I am sorry to say that bill passed this parliament in December of last year and, believe it or not, we still have not seen the regulations for that bill. That is an example of the point I am making about how important it is to vest these types of things in the actual bill. Some 9½ months after that bill was passed in this parliament, the business community still has not seen the shortselling regulations. The next area of the bill is in relation to trustee companies. This bill provides national uniformity which will allow trustee companies to operate across multiple state jurisdictions without different laws and without prohibitive compliance costs. This is another good example, as I said in my opening remarks, of a good, targeted reform. Trustee companies are currently regulated at the state and territory level. There are currently 10 private licensed trustee companies operating in Australia. Trustee company services will, like margin loans, become part of chapter 7 and their products regulated in the Corporations Act. Again, it is a good initiative in my view. Members of the Trustee Corporations Association, the sector’s peak body, have approximately $510 billion of assets under management, according to a Treasury estimate. It is therefore a significant sector of the financial services industry. The bill will provide authority under Commonwealth law for trustee companies to perform their traditional functions, deem such services to be ‘financial services’ and require them, as a result, to hold an Australian financial services licence when selling such services. Another result of moving it in under chapter 7 of the Corporations Act is that these people will now be required to hold an AFLS-an Australian financial services licence. The third area of the bill is in relation to promissory notes. Under this bill, promissory notes will be regulated in the same manner as debentures. All promissory notes will now be subject to additional disclosure and regulatory requirements, which already apply to debentures. All promissory notes issued to retail clients will now be accompanied with a prospectus, appointment of a trustee and the issuance of a trust deed. There have been some notable failures of the use of promissory notes in recent years. Promissory notes are in fact very similar in function to debentures. However, they are regulated according to their value. Under the current distinction, promissory notes issued with a value less than $50,000 are regulated as debentures, while promissory notes issued with a value greater than $50,000 are not subject to debenture regulation and are treated as financial products. This bill will now regulate all promissory notes. It will require prospectuses and trustee documents to be provided. Again, this is a good and positive reform. MAIN COMMITTEE This bill has the three areas of margin lending, trustee companies and promissory notes. I notice here in the chamber that we have the distinguished chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services and a fellow distinguished member of that committee, the member for Parramatta. The three of us have been spending quite a lot of time travelling Australia. The chairman has attended, I think, six public inquiries over the last couple of weeks. I have had the opportunity to attend three of those six in Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney, where we have been hearing first hand about some of the issues in and around margin lending. It is very clear to me that the proposals that are captured in this bill will be very important proposals. They will be positive initiatives that I think will help to overcome some of the stories that we have heard throughout the public hearings in relation to the inquiry that the committee is undertaking into financial services. Overall, by instituting margin lending and trustee company services as chapter 7 products in the Corporations Act and treating promissory notes as we already do debentures, I believe that Australian investors will be the ultimate beneficiaries. This bill does represent worthy, targeted reforms-reforms that go to the act and improve it. This bill proves that this is a good way to ensure that the baby is not thrown out with the bathwater. You do not rewrite of the whole area; you go to the area where there is a particular problem and you put in place some reforms to improve it. This is a good example of how that can be done. Our financial system in Australia has proven itself to be strong and robust. We hear each and every day in the parliament and in the media about the fact that Australia is travelling comparatively very well compared to other like nations throughout the world. There are several reasons for that, but one of the core reasons for that is our regulatory system-a regulatory system that was put in place years ago during the term of the Howard government, where we regulated the financial services industry in Australia. We put in place the so-called twin peaks regulatory model. We created APRA, the prudential regulator, to regulate our financial services from a prudential viewpoint and we established ASIC, the regulator of business conduct. It is through that twin peaks model that we have sustained a very robust and strong regulatory framework for financial services-and it is, as I say, one of the reasons that Australia has been performing well during these very turbulent economic terms. I think these are good initiatives, and I commend the bill to the House. lation Amendment (Financial Services Modernisation) Bill 2009, and I acknowledge the contributions of the previous speaker, the member for Aston, and other speakers on this bill. This bill is quite important. It reflects a range of changes that the Rudd government is making to ensure not only that the financial services sector and the Corporations Act work in unison but also that there is a uniform consumer credit model across this country-across all the states and territories. One principle that underpins this good work is that of consumer protection in ensuring that we have a robust system. We heard from the previous speaker about the twin peaks model, and I concur with him that it is a very important benchmark for how we manage the financial services and products in this country. It is very welcomed that we have this legislation before us, because it bridges a gap that currently exists and that has caused some problems in the past-or, if it not has directly caused the problems, it has certainly been used as an excuse for people not to apply the sort of regulatory rigour that they might otherwise have applied if it had applied directly to them. MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Corporations Legislation Amendment Financial Services Modernisation Bill 2009
207,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (11.46 Am),"I take pleasure in speaking on the Corporations LegisThis bill does two basic things. One is in relation to margin lending and the other relates to trustee corporations. Margin lending, as we have heard in the media over recent times, has been the source of a lot of problems for consumers. People have lost a great deal of moneytheir life-savings, their superannuation retirement incomes-and, for many, even their homes through margin lending facilities and practices. It is important that we separate out the issues and the regulatory issues for how margin lending is covered by law. As it stood, margin lending was not covered specifically by responsible lending regulation and banks, lenders and other issues did not have to adhere to principles. We do not believe this was an acceptable position. We believe that margin lending as a facility should be included. It was specifically excluded from the licensing regime that existed for those people who operated under an Australian financial services licence, an AFSL, because it did not meet the definition of who a licensee was. This bill will bridge that gap, include it and cover issuers of financial products, including issuers of margin-lending facilities. So we are removing from the licensing regime the exemption that they enjoyed. As we will hear from other speakers, and as we just heard, a whole range of issues have arisen in recent times where the matter of responsible lending has been of great concern-and certainly of great concern to me as Chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, which is currently embarking on an inquiry into financial products and services, with a particular focus on the collapse of Storm Financial and Opes Prime. The problems that arose were quite simple. People were encouraged to take out margin loans that were often in vastly greater quantities than they were capable of repaying. They involved large loans. When markets are rising there only appears to be an upside. A margin loan gives you the capacity to multiply or leverage up your winnings, as it were, on the way up but, of course, the tragedy is that on the way down, when the markets and shares and stocks fall, the losses are also multiplied. That is managed through a loan-to-value ratio. It is managed through a buffer or a margin. Normally, issuers of margin-lending facilities will set a maximum of up to 70 per cent. What we saw in the heady days of a rampant bull market was that those principles that were applied were set to one side, and people were encouraged into much larger margin loans that were far beyond what their incomes could support. They were based on the income generated out of the shares that they purchased. That is how margin lending normally works. The collateral that is used is normally offset against the portfolio itself and the portfolio generates the income, which meets the repayments and the interest. The problem for the people who got into trouble was not just the quantum of the margin loan but also their ability to meet the repayments. If it is set at, say, 70 per cent, you need to meet the 30 per cent funding through your own sources. You are meant to have the cash. It is as simple as that. People often did not have that cash, depending on the size of the loan. People used a double-gear method, which means that you either mortgage your home or use the equity in your home. It is quite a dangerous practice when the market begins to fall. A margin call means that you either have to top up your loan to keep it in balance in terms of, let’s say, the 70/30, or the issuer can sell down and sell the shares to meet that call. Of course, the larger the portfolio the more critical that balance is. We heard many sad and tragic stories of ordinary people who were loaned very large amounts of money that they obviously had no income to support. We have seen some tragic outcomes where people did lose their homes or are in the process of losing their homes. MAIN COMMITTEE The Rudd government believe in an efficient, free market. We believe in markets, as does the former government, the current opposition. In fact, on many of those issues we share similar views because it is about providing the freedom for people to invest and to make money, or to lose money for that matter. We have provided the tools and the benchmarks for regulation through the twin peaks system-through ASIC and APRA. APRA is the prudential regulator and ASIC is the securities investment commission-the watchdog, as it were, or the policeman on the beat. And there is the Corporations Act to take out the worse effects of the market. If it were left to run rampant, to run on its own, the ordinary person would have no protection at all from those who would act in an unscrupulous manner. That is really the nub of it. This legislation is about pulling into line and making sure that those who have the capacity and the power, the issuers, adhere to a set of principles and rules. Those rules are contained in this legislation. We are bridging that gap and ensuring that the responsible lending processes and principles that normally apply to other lending also apply to margin lending. It is not just good enough to loan people very large amounts secured against their home where they have no capacity to repay. It is reckless behaviour. It is reckless to lend people far beyond their capacity. It is all okay while markets are rising but, as we have just learnt once again, when markets begin to fall you still have to pay back the loans and the debt. It is important that we put in place mechanisms to measure the market, check the market and balance the market to ensure that while people have the freedom to do as they will with their own money they also understand that when they borrow money it is done responsibly and in a fair manner. I am very pleased that we have moved ahead of the joint standing committee’s report which will be handed down on the 23 November. This is an issue that needed to be addressed and this government, as in other areas, will be moving as quickly as it possibly can to bridge any gaps, fix loopholes and provide more efficient markets and better systems and protections for ordinary people. In this bill the term ‘provider’ has also been clarified in relation to margin lending facilities to make sure that there is no ambiguity or confusion as to who provides what. The consequence of this regulation power is that the issuer, or lender, of a margin facility will be required to be licensed. It is probably fair to say that most people who provided them were licensed anyway, but they were not licensed specifically for this type of loan. I know that out of the changes we are putting forward there will be a change in behaviour. Not merely from the legislative changes we have made but from what has happened in the markets there ought to be changed behaviour in how banks provide margin loans, debt facilities and other types of financial arrangements so that they do it in a more responsible manner. In the end, they are responsible. In the end, they are the ones who are to be held to account, because they provide the finance, the means by which people can get into a lot of trouble. I support the idea that people have a free market to go to in order to borrow funds to invest, but it has to be done in a responsible manner. Laws such as these exist in other forums; they just did not exist specifically in relation to margin loans. We have made absolutely the right move and it is about time. Sometimes it is the case that markets need to fail before you can see the structural problems that exist. It is a difficult and painful lesson to learn, but the response from a good government is to act upon it when in happens. That is what we have done and I am very proud of that. I know that this will in the MAIN COMMITTEE future prevent many people from getting into the sorts of financial difficulties that wipe out their retirement incomes or their home equity. Perhaps even worse, they not only lose their home but continue to carry a debt into their retirement. It is abhorrent that somebody who, regardless of their status in life, has worked hard all their life to own a home and have some meagre savings, perhaps some superannuation, has it wiped out by the reckless lending practices of a third party-which, by their own standards, guidelines and policies, the banks are not allowed to do. They are not allowed to do it because it is bad for people and bad for them; they stand to lose money as well. Of course, they can absorb losses much more easily than an ordinary person can. While it might not have a personal impact on the bank, for ordinary people it is catastrophic; it is a position from which they cannot come back. I reiterate the importance of this bill and acknowledge that the opposition is supporting it because it is good legislation. I will touch briefly on trustee corporations. ASIC has requested that a number of amendments be made to ensure that certain existing ASIC powers under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 are available in relation to trust property held by a trustee company. This is something we also support. Currently, the relevant ASIC powers apply only to financial products, and trustee companies may provide services that do not fall within that definition. It is important to include this provision to make sure that ASIC has the correct amount of power in the right places to deal with issues that arise out of trustee corporations and the holding of property. Our amendments will replicate relevant parts of sections 71 and 73 of the ASIC Act and will allow ASIC to make certain orders, such as preventing the disposal of certain property due to non-compliance with a requirement made under other parts of the act. I am sure people involved in this area will understand the gravity of giving ASIC the power to prevent the sale or disposal of property, in particular if there is a dispute or we are talking about a particular estate. While these are minor amendments, they are very important amendments. This government is committed to a range of very important changes and amendments in terms of financial services and products right across this country-not least the Uniform Consumer Credit Code, which will, for the first time in Australian history, bring together all of the different jurisdictions in this country, the states and territories, into a uniform single platform while maintaining the legislative platforms they hold in each state. I think that is very important given the vastness of our country and our population of only 20-odd million people. I think it is important that, as we trade and move not only capital but people between state borders and territory borders, we have uniform, consistent and robust laws for financial services and products. I welcome all of those changes and the principles that we have applied in these areas. I commend them to the House. cial Services Modernisation) Bill 2009 is a really important piece of legislation-an amendment to existing legislation. It is targeted. It is important because, I suppose, there is nothing like a major shakeout in the financial markets to highlight the need for targeted reforms to the financial system. Sadly, during the unprecedented-at least in our contemporary historyworldwide financial collapse we have witnessed, many Australians have been attracted by the potential to increase their wealth through various schemes and have lost not only their savings but also their homes. MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Corporations Legislation Amendment Financial Services Modernisation Bill 2009
208,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (12.00 Pm),"The Corporations Legislation Amendment (FinanFor those who are retired and unable to return to the workplace, or for whom it is difficult to return to the workplace, despite their best intentions to replace their lost wealth, their adventure into the financial marketplace has taken a heavy toll. We have heard evidence on this in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, and there are some are absolutely heart-wrenching stories. It might be instructive to relate a couple of those in this place. One of the people giving evidence to the inquiry said: Our first contact regarding margin loans came from CGI with a demand for $55 000 within 48 hours. I will talk about margin loans in a moment in a little more detail. In the past some of these financial products have been well known by the business and commercial sector, but many average Australians out there are not fully aware of the complex nature of these kinds of investment packages. For big corporations that may not seem like a lot of money, but to have a demand to pay $55,000 within 48 hours might be a very difficult thing for many Australians. They went on to say: Our portfolio has been sold down completelyand, again, I will explain this in a momentwith proceeds being deposited into a CBA accelerator account, but we had a shortfall of $55 000 in our margin loan. We contacted our advisor and he then realised‘he then realised’: even the advisers did not fully understand what they were getting their clients intoour financial situation-self-funded retirees with no portfolio, no jobs, no income and a $300 000 debt on our home. When our final statement arrived, our LVRthat is the loan-to-value ratio, and I will say a word about that in a momenthad reached 110% before our portfolio was sold down. We decided to pay out our margin loan, rather than continue paying interest on $1.5million. This cost us a break feeso, to get out of this before more damage was done and more debt was accrued, they paid a feeof approx. $44 000. We had pre-paid interest on the loan in June 2008. They go on to talk about the things they have had to do, as retirees, to try and recover their position, to put a roof over their heads and just to afford the weekly groceries. This is a heartwrenching story indeed, and I will relate a couple of others as we go along. The stark reality of the parlous financial circumstances many Australians found themselves in on the back of this collapse is abundantly clear from the many witness statements to the Financial Products and Services in Australia inquiry. The committee is currently examining a number of issues. I think they are important enough, again, to relate here. The terms of reference say the committee is to examine: 1. the role of financial advisers; 2. the general regulatory environment for these products and services; 3. the role played by commission arrangements relating to product sales and advice, including the potential for conflicts of interest, the need for appropriate disclosure, and remuneration models for financial advisers; I am just going to pause there; there are actually nine references. MAIN COMMITTEE These arrangements between financial advisers, bankers and other investment companies present problems in a number of areas. This has become apparent to me in my electorate, with people coming to me, on the back of this worldwide financial collapse, with terrible problems because there has been a conflict between the people advising them and the organisation selling the product, whether that is superannuation or these kinds of margin loans or other products. It is very apparent that there are deep conflicts of interest. It is also very apparent to me, from discussions with constituents, that, quite often, they believe their financial advisers did not fully understand what the implications of some of these products were. SoI think that reference No. 3 of the committee is a very important one and, in some ways, this amendment that we are debating today is also endeavouring to address that. The fourth reference is: 4. the role played by marketing and advertising campaigns; Again, today, many products are sold online, on computer. You can sit at your desk at home and you can get yourself into some awful trouble with online products without fully understanding what the intricacies of those packages or products are. The fifth reference is: 5. the adequacy of licensing arrangements for those who sold the products and services; And the sixth is: 6. the appropriateness of information and advice provided to consumers considering investing in those products and services, and how the interests of consumers can best be served; I will pause again there on No. 6 to speak of one of the cases I had-a very sad case. This case was of a very elderly gentleman in my electorate who got himself into a reverse mortgage. Reverse mortgages can be fantastic products for some people, if they fully understand what the full package is about. And there is an obligation, to be fair, on people selling reverse mortgage products to get a signed statement that a consumer entering into those kinds of packages has got independent advice from their accountant and a solicitor. Nevertheless, some elderly people still do not fully understand the implications of the product. And you do not have to be elderly not to fully understand-some of them would, I think, probably perplex a Rhodes scholar, they are so intricate and difficult. But, with a reverse mortgage, what a lot of people do not realise is that there is a break fee, which was talked about also in regard to the margin loans situation. A reverse mortgage is a handy product for older people who want to stay in their home but have got all their money tied up in it. It is their only asset. So they can unlock some cash from an institution prepared to give them a reverse mortgage. But if they want to break that arrangement anywhere in the time frame of the contract then they are up for very substantial fees. Just the other day I had a letter from someone else who had encountered this product and had a break fee of $85,000. My constituent had a very substantial break fee but, fortunately, when I contacted the organisation they reduced the break fee. But these fees are not well understood. I am not in any way suggesting that we should not have these packages and products available because, as I say, they suit some people, and they are quite good. But if people do not fully understand what they are getting into then they can get a terrible shock when it comes to having to break the contractual arrangement. Sometimes that happens because of emergency situations. In this case, somebody was not well; they needed to move closer to MAIN COMMITTEE their family and sell their home. And those things can happen to any of us. But we need to be aware that these products have clauses in them which can be very, very costly indeed. So consumers do need to understand the products they are getting into, and the inquiry’s terms of reference point No. 7 is: 7. consumer education and understanding of these financial products and services; And the final two are: 8. the adequacy of professional indemnity insurance arrangements for those who sold the products and services, and the impact on consumers; and 9. the need for any legislative or regulatory change. The committee also agreed to look at another matter-to: … investigate the involvement of the banking and finance industry in providing finance for investors in and through Storm Financial, Opes Prime and other similar businesses, and the practices of banks and other financial institutions in relation to margin lending associated with those businesses. I doubt that too many reasonable people would argue that there is not a need for targeted reform to the financial system, and considerable media attention has made it very clear that there are issues, as I said, about the linkages between advisers and lenders, and their individual responsibility to the borrowers or the users of these products. As our shadow minister, the member for Aston, expressed in his speech here a short while ago, there is a need for suitably targeted reforms. We do not have to throw the baby out with the bathwater. We do have a good financial regulatory system in Australia, and I think that has been evidenced by the fact that we have certainly had fewer difficulties than many other countries. It has shown that we have a fairly robust system here. Nevertheless, there are these gaps. For instance, this bill also deals with promissory notes. I remember, as a young person working in a law firm when I left school, coming across promissory notes. They have been around for centuries. But we have no consistent, national laws that really lay out any regulation or legislation in regard to how this product is dealt with. So it amazed me when I saw promissory notes there, because I know they have been around for a very, very long time, and yet I was surprised to learn that they are not covered by any of the current laws or regulations of state, territory or Commonwealth jurisdictions. I understand, though, that the matter of regulating margin lending was agreed to between the states and the Commonwealth at a COAG meeting in March of this year. It was resolved that the Commonwealth would undertake to ensure that there was a robust national regulatory framework governing the operation of margin lending. I know that not everybody is familiar with the term ‘margin lending’, though we hear these words bandied about. For those who are unfamiliar with the term, basically it is about using money that has been borrowed to invest in the stock market or in financial products. Existing investments can be used for this purpose, and they might include real property-that is, your house or your investment property if you have one-and these are generally used as collateral or as a guarantee against the money that is being borrowed. They use what they call ‘gearing’. It has been used a lot. I have been around the property and financial markets for a long time, and gearing was used a lot in the property boom back in the seventies. Having bought their property years ago and having now, with inflation, seen an increase in the equity in that asset, people would unlock that equity without selling the propMAIN COMMITTEE erty. They might still have a small loan as a first mortgage on their home. The home might now be worth another $200,000 or $300,000 more than when they bought it and their mortgage might be relatively small, so they could unlock that equity in their existing asset to use as a start to get into further investments, whether they be property or shares, as we are talking about in this case. That is how gearing is used. It is a common practice, as I said, in the property market. In a boom, it becomes a very attractive option because usually the value of properties is going up and it provides an attractive equity in property for investing in shares and financial products-particularly in the boom that we have seen where the share market was the flavour of the month. While there can be considerable benefits from the financial gains available from employing these methods, they can also significantly multiply the losses when things go bad. Just to illustrate, again, some of the problems that have come out in the testimony, there was a letter of appeal on behalf of a number of unit holders to the inquiry. In their testimony, they said: As a direct consequence of the loss of distributions, there are now thousands of previously self-funded retirees and part-pensioners requiring additional pensions and struggling to make ends meet. In addition, there are many who do not qualify for any Centrelink benefits and have been forced back into the workforce or are having to sell other assets just to live. I know of previously comfortable elderly people having to sell their family homes and live in caravans … an eighty year old lady taking in ironing, another renting her own home and living with her daughter and others selling treasured personal possessions. Sad stories indeed. In this day and age, when so much business, as I said before, is conducted online on the computer, sometimes these options look very attractive indeed. There are many traps for the unwary, especially as the margin lender takes a mortgage over the shares on a loan-to-value basis. If the share value falls, the margin lender can sell, just like that, to recover their loan, to cover their exposure, so they are in the No. 1 position, but this can leave the investor with considerable exposure to the shortfall or the margin. That is what margin lending does. Just to further illustrate some of the problems that arose, another of the testimonies to the inquiry said: We have not received any disbursements and have been told we will be lucky to recoup any of our life savings, the $1 units now being valued at 12 cents). I have had to return to full-time work and we have been struggling financially ever since. We have no savings. We are not eligible for Centrelink benefits. Our weekly wages barely cover our mortgage and modest living expenses. We use our credit card to cover basic bills, electricity, gas, body corp, rates. We do not smoke or live lavishly. We have always been frugal and conservative in our expenditure. We simply ask for justice and real help from anyone in government. It is our responsibility to make sure that, as we see these anomalies and these gaps occur, we tighten up legislation to make sure that the worse of these abuses, in some cases, do not occur again. Interestingly, according to the Treasury, in the June 2008 green paper on financial services and credit reform, margin lending grew from a less than $5 billion industry in 1999 to a $32.6 billion industry in March 2008. In normal circumstances that might be very welcome, but it is not welcome when the system collapses and when vulnerable people who do not fully understand the complexities of what they are getting into are left in financial ruin. It has been a MAIN COMMITTEE largely unregulated industry both at state and at Commonwealth levels. The green paper provided an opportunity for consultations with a view to reform, including on a number of points which I do not have time to go into. AllI can say is that I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate and to join in a bipartisan way to see far better legislation to protect investors in the financial services sector. (Time expired) Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (12.20 pm)-I am pleased to speak on the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Financial Services Modernisation) Bill 2009. Like so many members of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, including the member for Pearce, I have also heard some of the tragic stories of loss and desperation from a range of people who invested their money in the good times, only to find that they lacked an understanding of the consequences of the kind of downturn that we have experienced over the last year. The amending legislation seeks to amend the Corporations Act 2001 and the Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act 2001 to reflect agreements at COAG in relation to the national regulation of margin lending and trustee companies. In particular, any person providing margin loans and advising about margin loans will need to hold an Australian Financial Services licence and will be subject to the licensing conduct and disclosure requirements contained in the Corporations Act and administered by ASIC. The bill also aims to improve the regulatory framework that applies to the issuing of promissory notes and debentures, but today I will concentrate on the first part, margin lending. Ten years ago I doubt that there would have been that many people in Australia who would have known what a margin loan was. Yet today we find that a large and growing number of people have chosen to invest using that form of finance. In short, margin lending is the borrowing of money to invest in the stock market. According to FIDO, the consumer website of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, a margin loan lets you borrow money to invest in shares and other financial products using existing investments as security. Borrowing money to invest in this way, also known as gearing, can increase the gains from an investment but also multiply the losses. Margin loans are offered by a wide range of financial institutions and are often available online. There has been some downturn in the number of margin loans in the last year due to the global financial crisis, but, by and large, the number has grown substantially over the last eight years. In June 1999, less than $5 billion had been borrowed through margin loans but, by December 2007, some 8½ years later, that figure had skyrocketed to over $37 billion-that is, more than a 700 per cent increase. It has not just grown but, arguably, the range of investors has also changed significantly. In June 1999, when there were a small number of investors, one could assume that they were largely institutional investors and experienced investors. But, over the last decade, with the rise in super funds and demutualisation, Australia is in a rather unique position, being one of the highest per capita investors in the world. An incredibly large number of people are coming to investment quite late in life, with relatively little experience, arriving in their senior years with large superannuation payouts or finding themselves literally receiving shares in the mail through demutualisation. That makes us a little bit unique. Perhaps it exposed a large number of our population to risks which they were unaware of or perhaps did not fully understand. Through the evidence provided to the inquiry of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, we found that large numbers MAIN COMMITTEE of people have found themselves in considerable hardship. Anecdotally, they were unaware of the risks of margin lending or perhaps lacked the ability to fully comprehend the risks. During those growth years, margin loans remained largely unregulated-again, quite extraordinary, given the growth over that time. Margin lending has not been subject to the credit regime operated by the states. In fact, until now, margin loans had not been subject to any specific regulatory regime at all. The Uniform Consumer Credit Code, which currently forms the basis of a scheme of state based consumer credit legislation, does not apply to credit provided for investment purposes. Under this amendment, margin lending will be regulated as part of the financial services regime in chapter 7 of the Corporations Act, which means that for the first time margin loan borrowers will benefit from the general investor protection regime contained in that legislation. That means that lenders will have to be licensed by ASIC, as will advisers; advisers will be required to only provide advice that is appropriate to the client’s needs and circumstances; and consumers will have access to independent, free and fast dispute resolution services. In terms of enforcement, all margin lenders for the first time will become subject to the enforcement provisions of chapter 7 surrounding market manipulation, false or misleading statements; inducing investors to deal using misleading information; and engagement in dishonest, misleading or deceptive conduct. As well as the benefits of placing margin loan regulation under the Corporations Act, there will be an additional two specific measures which will further enhance consumer protection. The first is a responsible lending requirement. That requirement is designed to prevent lenders from giving unsuitable loans to consumers. It was quite alarming to find, in the evidence received during the current committee inquiry, that so many lenders do not consider the suitability of the loans for the consumers at all, or their ability to deal with a potential downturn. Under the new amendment, before giving a margin loan, lenders will be required to consider whether the borrower could suffer substantial hardship as a result of taking out the loan, and if that is the case the law says that the loan must not be provided. The regulations which will accompany the legislation will provide further detail of what the lenders will need to consider, including a specific requirement for lenders to consider whether consumers will be at risk of losing their homes as a consequence of taking out a margin loan. The regulations will also require financial advisers to consider the same matters, including the possible loss of a borrower’s home, when providing advice on margin loans to consumers. Had both of these measures previously been in place, they might have gone a considerable way towards avoiding some of the tragic stories of loss that we in the committee have encountered over the last few weeks. The second specific measure clarifies which party is responsible for notifying borrowers when a margin call occurs where both a lender and a financial adviser are involved. Again, the committee members were surprised to find that so many of the lenders did not deal directly with the customer in making a margin call but chose to advise the customer through the financial adviser. There are stories of delays in margin call notifications due to disagreements between lenders and advisers, and we have heard from people who were not aware of their losses until it was far, far too late to act. These are extremely important amendments, part of a larger reform package of consumer protection that we will see rolled out in the near future. This bill is an extremely important MAIN COMMITTEE one-arguably, overdue-as it recognises that over the last 10 years there has been a dramatic increase in the complexity of products and the number of complex products, and a huge increase in the number of inexperienced investors choosing, through advice, to purchase those products. For many people this legislation is, tragically, too late, but it is our hope that it will prevent a repeat of some of the tragic stories that we have heard over the recent year. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Melham) adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Dunkley Electorate: Langwarrin Primary School tion to the difficulties that the Langwarrin Primary School is facing in being fitted up with a Building the Education Revolution building that is not what it is seeking and in being completely ignored by the bureaucracy and the Labor governments that are overseeing this program. I also put on record my frustration and extreme disappointment at-having raised these concerns in the parliament and having been given assurances from the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Education of her interest in and willingness to engage on these concerns-having received possibly the most churlish, juvenile reply that I have seen in 13½ or 14 years in response to legitimate community concerns I have raised in this place. I raised it in good faith. I asked the question with courtesy and respect. I recognise the responsibilities that the minister has. She-in her saccharine-sweet way-reassured the parliament that of course she was interested in consultation. What did I get out of that? Absolutely nothing. I got just a churlish, juvenile, politically motivated letter that showed no interest in the concerns of the Langwarrin school community and no interest in good value for money. As I have said over and over again, the Building the Education Revolution program has funding available and that funding needs to be spent wisely. Those opposite in the Labor Party are just spraying some money around. They are the BS of Australian politics-that is, the big spenders of Australian politics. They are not interested in value for money, and this is an example. I wonder whether the Deputy Prime Minister will put on the plaque in the Langwarrin Primary School that she forced that project on that school community when the school community had pointed out what they could have done with just some of that money to implement their master plan, to give it what it needs. Instead, they are being forced to demolish part of a building that is ripe for refurbishment. If you were at all interested in sustainability, why would you demolish a building just to build another one? They could refurbish that perfectly good building. Schools have been told to take one of these McMac style template projects. Do not ever think about changing anything! Heaven forbid. Do not make it relevant and adapt it to the school’s needs! Do not try and blend it in with the facilities that are there! No, no. Take it or leave it. Kim Jong-il would be impressed with the way this program is being handled. The school community are faced with having to demolish a building that is ripe for refurbishment and that could be demolished at a cost-effective price. They are asking for one of the template half-court buildings and they are being told they cannot have that.

210,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (12.30 Pm),"I rise today to again draw the parliament’s attenmoved and relocated. They are unclear about how to handle the enormous disruption to the school. They are having a building design forced on them because the project managers have said that the Rudd Labor government wants the buildings to be visible from the road. The profile of this project is more important than the education of these primary school kids. They are having to push this building into a place where it should not be and to demolish rooms that are perfectly functional and suitable for refurbishment. But here is the clanger. Do you know what they are going to end up with? They are going to have permanently plumbed portable dunnies. This is the primary school of the 21st century federal Labor style. They are going to have a building demanded by Kevin and loos delivered by Kenny. That is what we are going to have. We are going to have a primary school for the 21st century with permanently plumbed portable dunnies, as a requirement of the project being forced on this community. We have this clear example. If the Deputy Prime Minister could be even remotely sincere and in keeping with her saccharine-sweet assurances to the parliament that she is even remotely interested in this school community’s interest, she could fix this. She could get value for money. She could get change for the Australian public. She would be able to see that the outcome would be in keeping with what the school community seeks. That is what she could do. She could lift a finger and do something about value for money and genuine consultation. We hear a lot from Labor about good-faith bargaining in industrial relations. In my electorate, that is a union coming in and telling an employer: ‘You can’t have anyone represent you. We demand to talk to you in the spirit of good-faith bargaining.’ What about some good-faith consultation? What about some genuine engagement? We have other examples here. We have had a primary school which for many years has had a population of over 150 but for 10 days in about four years it slipped under and went into a different category. Is the minister interested in addressing that and having funding that reflects the genuine population? We have parents in Mornington Park Primary School saying this money could surely be used more wisely. I commend Langwarrin Primary School for their efforts. I have a petition and letters from parents wanting a better outcome from this money piling up. This is a lazy, big-spending government, and they should be focused on getting(Time expired) Jobs Fund: Julie Burgess Maritime Discovery Centre Fund and the jobs that it is stimulating, the jobs that it is retaining and the jobs that we will have in the future. So far, my electorate has been fortunate to receive $4.3 million from the Jobs Fund rounds. The Burnie City Council received $1.26 million for a magnificent waterfront boardwalk project which will link West Park to the waterfront and the CBD. The Mersey Natural Resource Management Group received $267,000 for a weeds-to-assets commercialisation project, which is essentially feral trees being processed and used for timber products. A Devonport based employment firm, the O Group, has been awarded $910,000 to fund a range of community based projects. Only the other day I was able to announce, with the Devonport City Council and my colleague Senator Nick Sherry, a magnificent project of $1.8 million for what is termed the Julie Burgess Maritime Discovery Centre. I know you will be very interested in this, Deputy Speaker: not only does it involve the creation of a centre for information, a cafe and a training centre; it also includes the refurbishment of the Julie Burgess, part and parcel of our maritime history, a boat that was used for fishing, trade and wartime ventures. It will be restored to its MAIN COMMITTEE",168,Adjournment
211,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (12.35 Pm),"I congratulate the government on the Jobsformer glory. The restoration itself will be used for lots of different enterprises and activities. First and foremost, it is going to enhance the shipwright skills, the shipbuilding skills, the woodwork skills and the metalwork skills of people in my district. Those skills are quickly slipping away, but we will be able to enhance them, and those skills will then be passed on to young people-particularly the young unemployed-who will be encouraged to participate in the restoration of the Julie Burgess. I think that is a fantastic enterprise. On top of that, of course, it will become part and parcel of Tasmanian tourism and will enhance it, particularly maritime tourism and general tourism in the local area of Devonport. I see some young ‘dads’ assistants’ with us today in the gallery. The Julie Burgess will encourage families to get on board-literally. They will go along the beautiful north-west coast of Tassie, right through some of our ports, into Ulverstone, into Penguin, into Stanley, into Smithton and then across a beautiful part of Bass Strait to King Island. It is a magnificent maritime legacy and people will be able to participate in that. It will be a wonderful experience for people. Not only that, as part and parcel of the maritime heritage trail that so dominates the beautiful port of Devonport, people will be able to develop hospitality skills through local training agencies. It will be a resource centre for skilling and training not just in boatbuilding enterprises but also in hospitality, food services and refreshments. Not only will the Julie Burgess take you on a lovely sea voyage, it will feed and refresh you while you are on it. I can see dads’ assistants and the families over there making their way on the Julie Burgess through the beautiful Devonport heads, passing the TT line with its two Spirits of Tasmania and the magnificent maritime museum. They will be able to take a punt across the river when they are finished with the Julie Burgess and participate. I want to thank everybody who put up this project. I congratulate them. They have developed a trust, which is made up of Alderman Grant Goodwin; Alderman Graham Kent; Mayor Lynn Laycock; Evonne Ewins, director of community services; Ian Martin; David Kent; Peter Higgins, the chair of the committee; and Timothy Gott.

I do not know how long the Julie Burgess is, but I take it it is a 40-footer. investment and a great opportunity for local people.

By chance and opportunity, I was given a holiday by my daughter at one stageprobably, like you, Member for Braddon, after an election loss. I was sent away with my wife to tour Tasmania. I have to say to those who are listening to this broadcast today that one of the most precious trips you can ever do is a tour around Tasmania. Go and look at the beauty of Tasmania-what it is and how we should preserve it. I think the Australian nation is now coming to a place where we are considering very, very carefully what forests we clear and what damage we do to those forests. There is a balance now coming into play of jobs and opportunities in tourism and other benefits, as the member for Braddon has outlined. But we are going to have to consider where the world stands on climate change and what our contribution is going to be to stopping that. Therefore, if we are going to do any clearing, we have to double the planting. This is coming from a person from a timber area, like the member for Braddon, who has great concern for the jobs that people gain out of the harvesting of timber. Whilst that is crucially important, we now have to look very closely across the whole of Australia that we have the opportunity to green. On Saturday, I am going to Mossvale Park, a beautiful and elegant park in my area which was planted years ago. All of the Landcare people are coming together, but not to whinge about what the government has done-they are over that. I believe Tony Burke, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, has made some changes whereby small groups will now be able to apply for funds for their small projects. These people are coming together on one big day, which I have the opportunity to open-and I am pretty excited about that-to commit to planting a million trees. They have decided as a group to commit themselves to planting a million trees. The member for Braddon has outlined what is going on in his electorate and the opportunities that are there. I am letting him know that in my electorate we are doing something for the environment. It is true and fair to say that members of parliament who I see come to this place consider every day what opportunities there will be for people such as the two very young people sitting behind me. We are making decisions now that will make a difference to their future and we have to keep that in mind at every opportunity.

They are much better performers than I predicted. This finals season I particularly want to acknowledge the sporting clubs in my electorate on Brisbane’s south side. These clubs help promote a strong sense of community and build lifelong skills in our young people, such as Harry Jutsum and Levi Jutsum. These sporting clubs help keep us fit and active during winter. No matter what a person’s age, ethnicity, gender, body type or level of fitness, there is always a role in a team for everybody. We even take people from the northern side of the river; that is how inclusive we are. Whether it is football, hockey or netball, we love our sport on Brisbane’s south side. There is a feeling of anticipation in the air, that sniff-of-winning feeling. Souths Rugby Union Club have managed to progress four and, depending on what happens this weekend, maybe five teams into the upcoming grand finals of the Brisbane Rugby Union Club competition. Everyone on the south side will be cheering the boys on in the coming weeks-maybe not those people who barrack for the Sunnybank Rugby Club, which is also having a very successful season and is also in my electorate. Special thanks must go to the teams, coaches, support staff, management committees and other volunteers-the strappers et cetera-who have all contributed to these great achievements. Also, one of our AFL teams, the Mount Gravatt AFL Club, will take on Southport in the preliminary final of the Velocity Sports Cup this weekend. I know there are many other south side teams in the finals throughout Brisbane and I wish them all the best-not having the time to name all of them. I am sure that they will do us proud. I also recognise the achievements of our junior sporting clubs. The kids have a lot of fun, but it is because of the hard work of parents and other volunteers who give of their time to give our young people an opportunity to learn and play sport. It helps encourage our kids to live healthy, active lifestyles as well as learn important skills like teamwork and perseverance and one of those most important skills: how to lose gracefully. I think society is much better off if people learn that in sport you do lose-there is always a winner and always a loser unless there is a draw-and then you work out how to do so gracefully. It is a great life skill. The Rudd government is also helping our young local sporting champions to achieve their goals in their chosen sports. So far this year 12 young people and one team in my electorate have received grants to help cover some of the costs of travel and competition. This is a great way of helping young people who are selected to compete at the national or state level. In the three rounds this year the grants have been awarded to Crystal Shaw, under-16 girls basketball classic; Mitchell Symonds, Queensland Cricket; Laura David, Australian National Track and Field; Kayla Coombs, Australian Junior Table Tennis Championships; Tegan Head, Pacific School Games, Swimming; Sasha Aleceenco, Pacific School Games, Athletics; Tegan Riding, Australian Age Swimming Nationals; Emma Goodhew, Queensland Junior Squash Championships; Yannick Dixon and Christopher Dixon, Australian Rowing Championships; Robert Bell, Australian Junior Track Cycling Championships; Jake Ott, Under-15 National Basketball Championships; and Yeronga Park Swim Team, 2009 Australia Age Champions. Congratulations to all our sporting champions on Brisbane’s south side. Bruce Dawe says in his poem Life-cycle that sport is an essential part of Australian culture, particularly in the south. I will take that as the south side of Brisbane. I quote this line from his poem Life-cycle: MAIN COMMITTEE And the tides of life will be the tides of the home team’s fortunes -the reckless proposal after the one-point win, the wedding and honeymoon after the grand final … It is coming up to grand final season, so hopefully there might be a couple of weddings and a couple of honeymoons coming out of the south side. Herbert Electorate: Employment Herbert Electorate: 3rd Brigade growth in the northern and north-western statistical divisions of Queensland has been truly remarkable. According to recent research, the region-which is based on Townsville, the capital city of Northern Australia-is ranked equal top in Queensland and equal fourth in the nation for employment growth. The key reasons this has occurred in the northern and north-western regions-the reasons they performed so well-include industrial diversity, a strong public sector, a solid education sector and a growing need for health sector workers. What we find happening is that, in more flexible workplaces, instead of cutting jobs, our North Queensland employers are cutting hours of work in order to retain their key employees. The outlook for strong continued employment growth in our region is sound. However, there remain challenges on the horizon. These include an emissions trading scheme that could suck up to 1½ per cent out of economic growth in 2011-12, with rising interest rates being a concern, and school leavers joining the workforce in January 2010. Congratulations nevertheless to North Queensland for performing so well. On the other side of the ledger are the surging food and petrol prices and accommodation and entertainment costs in the North as well as the increased pressure on the household budget. A cost of living report by Colin Dwyer of DS Economics has revealed that the total cost of living in Townsville has increased by $4,147 for renters and $2,723 for homeowners over the last three years. What is interesting is that the Rudd government has provided the consumer price index figures for cities such as Darwin, Cairns and Mount Isa but not for Townsville. How could the Rudd government leave Australia’s largest tropical city out of the CPI index reporting? Why have we been forgotten? Having CPI figures would enable us to better monitor changes in the cost of living and be prompt in moving towards workable solutions. The other situation for us in the North is that we were going to have the grocery choice to keep food prices affordable for families, but rising food prices have had a big impact on Townsville, where the cost of food is 18 per cent of the average household budget. As with the CPI, Townsville does not have a grocery price index, so we cannot know the full impact on families. That is indeed a shame; it is a slur on Australia’s largest tropical city. I would also like to refer to an article in today’s Australian by Mark Dodd, which refers to the 1st Brigade in Darwin as ‘the army’s rapid reaction force’. That is not correct-it is no such thing. The 1st Brigade is a heavy brigade, and it takes a minimum of 28 days to deploy a heavy brigade. In the Australian Defence Force, it is quite widely said that by the time the 1st Brigade deploys, the war is over. That can probably be sourced to the 3rd Brigade, Australia’s premier brigade, which is of course garrisoned in Townsville. In addition, the article refers to Brigadier Krause’s ‘male and female soldiers’ already in Afghanistan-this is in relation to the story that surfaced yesterday about having women in the infantry. While what the BrigaMAIN COMMITTEE",171,Adjournment

I well remember that, when we last went to the Solomon Islands, the 3rd Brigade took 18 hours from notice-to-go to being on the ground there. That is a tremendous tribute to the commanders and the soldiers of the 3rd Brigade and the infantry battalions at Townsville. I am pleased to see that we are getting an additional infantry battalion, the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, which is due at the beginning of 2012. Our city is looking forward to that, and we are very proud, as a garrison city, of our 3rd Brigade.

He was gunned down in the Iskan district of Baghdad in the middle of the morning, in a busy shopping centre with security controlled entrances and exits. This is not the only example of persecution against Mandaeans. I have been advised that recorded incidents against Mandaeans in Iraq since 2003 include 171 killings, 275 kidnappings and 298 assaults and forced conversions to Islam. As I understand it, they also include four deaths, which occurred in the last week alone. The Mandaean people are followers of John the Baptist and are not regarded as ‘people of the Book’ by Islamic extremists, so they are considered worthless and expendable. The UNHCR, in its April report, noted: The situation of the remaining 3,500-5,000 Sabaean-Mandaeans in Iraq remains of serious concern as they continue to be singled out by Sunni and Shi’ite extremists as well as criminals on the basis of their religion, profession and (perceived) wealth. The UNHCR report went on to say: The fact that Mandaeans generally have no tribal networks and live scattered in small groups, further increases their vulnerability. In addition, non-violence is a basic tenet of their religion. It is important to note that the population of Mandaeans in Iraq prior to 2003 was approximately 60,000. The persecution of Mandaeans and the subsequent decision of these people to flee Iraq is similar to the position of Christian minority groups. The UNHCR also noted in its report that Christians are being targeted by Islamic extremists for being un-Islamic, a charge that equally applies to Mandaeans. A wave of attacks on Christian minorities in Mosul, in October 2008, forced almost 10,000 Christians to flee their homes. As a consequence of these attacks, a large Iraqi security force presence was deployed to the city of Mosul, but mass casualty attacks, kidnappings and targeted assassinations continue to occur on an almost daily basis.

217,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (12.55 Pm),"I rise today to speak out against the religious persecuIn October 2008, Archbishop Jean Sleimam, of Baghdad, told the Aid to the Church in Need conference in the UK that this ‘paralysing fear’ was gripping Iraq’s Christian and religious minority groups, including Mandaeans. The archbishop said that very real persecution remained a huge threat to these people, who have been forced to adopt Islamic practices, including that of dress, and who have been encouraged to leave various areas. In the light of the above examples of persecution, I strongly believe the Australian government should be more disposed to granting humanitarian visas to Mandaean and Christian refugees. As I understand it, very few, if any, visas have been granted to these refugees sheltering in Syria and Jordan. The refugee and humanitarian program is designed to assist those people who are the victims of a level of persecution or discrimination that amounts to a gross violation of their human rights. Mandaeans and Christian minority groups in Iraq are certainly suffering that degree of persecution every day. Regardless of individual political views concerning Australia’s initial involvement in Iraq, I believe the government has a moral responsibility to assist with the consequences of the 2003 invasion and the ensuing instability in Iraq that followed. Clearly, these are consequences that should have been considered by the Howard government prior to committing Australia’s troops to that activity in Iraq. It is now up to the Rudd Labor government to be compassionate, to deal with these consequences and to not turn our backs on the people who most need our assistance. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Vietnam Veterans Family Study (Question No. 850) Mr Billson asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 11 August 2009: (1) How many veterans and veterans’ family members have agreed to participate in the Government’s Vietnam Veterans’ Family Study. (2) What is the optimum number of volunteers needed to ensure an accurate cross section of the veteran and veteran community is represented in the health study, and when is this level of participation expected to be secured. (1) The number of registered participants as at 31 August 2009 was 24,549. This number includes more than 13,500 randomly selected Vietnam veterans, Vietnam-era Army personnel who did not deploy to Vietnam, and their respective children. These four categories of participants are the key groups required in sufficient numbers to make the study scientifically robust. The remaining numbers include partners, siblings, nieces, nephews and other family members of Vietnam veterans and Vietnam-era Army personnel who have registered to provide information to the study. (2) The optimum number of volunteers is 5,000 each of Vietnam and Vietnam-era veterans and 3,000 each of Vietnam and Vietnam-era veterans’ children. The minimum numbers required to ensure valid study conclusions are 3,000 veterans and 1,800 children. The number of Vietnam veterans’ children has exceeded the optimum number. The number of veterans in both groups is currently over 4,000. The number of Vietnam-era veterans’ children is in excess of the minimum required. Registrations will remain open until at least mid 2010. Work has already commenced on some projects and we can now be confident the overall study can be successfully conducted.
