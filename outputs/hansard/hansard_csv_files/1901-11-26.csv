28,Sir Edward Braddon (Tas,"the question of whether we shall meet on Mondays to facilitate the transaction of public business, and thus enable us to secure an earlier and a longer adjournment than would otherwise be possible. The honourable and learned member for ""Werriwa has pointed out the flagrant wrong that would be done to the representatives of New South Wales and South Australia by the adoption of this motion. But I would point out the wrong which the representatives of three other States suffer as a result of having to remain continuously in Melbourne, and of being denied an opportunity of reaching their homes-as can honourable members who live in Sydney and Adelaide-a t the end of each week. tlie representatives of New South Wales can still have Sunday at home other honourable members-al l the representatives of Queensland, I believe, but certainly a majority of them-wh o cannot go home at all. They do not go home. It is the same with honourable members from AVestern Australia, and to a great extent w i th those representing Tasmania. I am not siderations, ' because attempted to go home. When I came to Melbourne, I took a house, and made my -settled abode here until the business of the Parliament is over. But I am speaking for others, and in justice to them. I hope that the Monday sittings will be agreed to, and that we shall be able, by sitting on the -extra day, to bring matters to a speedy conclusion. should like to ask the honourable gentleman whether, as it appears likely to be carried, we are to have a long or a short adjournment over Christmas'? It will make a good deal of difference in regard to the way in which I shall vote, whether the adjournment is to be long or short. If we are merely to hurry over the business and then adjourn for two months or six weeks, I do not propose to vote for the motion. I wish to have a short adjournment. If we are not to finish the business before Christinas I do not care what happens. I am ready to stand as long as I can, and to crawl ou£ when I cannot stand any longer; but I do not propose to vote for giving the Government an extra day simply for the purpose of enabling some honourable members to visit their sorrowing relatives and prevent others from carrying on the legitimate business of the country.. There are so many measures that are so absolutely imperative for the very existence and welfare of the Commonwealth Government-suc h as the Judicature Bill and the Electoral Bill, that we ought to make an effort to pass them; and there is no possibility of proceeding with them unless we have a clear understanding that there is to be a short adjournment over Christmas. If we have an adjournment for a month or six weeks we shall not return to our parliamentary duties before the middle of February, and then it will be May or June before there is any prospect of terminating the session. The Government have had plenty of time to make up their minds. Some gentlemen have been for some past trying to discover the opinions of honourable members, and surely the arithmetical problem might have been solved by .this time, so that the Government might know precisely how the cat was jumping in this respect. speaking from any selfish consame opinion as the honourable member who I have never has just sat down. I should like to have some definite statement from the Government whether we are to have a long or a short adjournment before I cast my vote for the motion. We came here to do the business of the country, and there is no doubt in my mind that the early part of the session was frittered away. We had some weeks' debate on the address in reply. Nearly every honourable member of the House spoke, and some, not content with that, slept upon it . If we are going to who has moved this motion have a long adjournment over Christmas, I intend to vote against the extra sitting day. I fear that the honourable member who took round a petition for a long adjournment was influenced by a sinister motive. He doubtless wished to prolong the session in order to prevent the Queensland members from going home and taking part in the t general election in that State. For that reason alone I wish to know from the Attorney-General whether the Christmas adjournment is to be long or short? also should like to have some information from the Attorney-General.

If we sit from half-past two until half-past eleven, and rise in time to enable honourable members to catch their last trams, that is a fair thing. Christmas adjournment, I do not care whether it is long or short. The Queensland representatives a little while ago wanted a long adjournment, but evidently they have changed their minds. I am willing to fall in with any arrangement on that subject, but I object to sitting here every night until after the trams and trains have gone, when honourable members are put to the expense of hiring a cab or walking two or three miles. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I do not agree with what has been said as to the time in the early part of the session having been wasted. I hold the contrary opinion. I do not know of any Parliament that has got through so much work in so short a time. The Bills brought before the House have been very long and contentious, and it has surprised me that they havegone through so quickly. While I agree that it is a good thing at the present time to sit on an extra -day, yet, as a rule, it is not a good thing to sit more than three days a week. care who the member is, or what his abilities may be, he cannot give due and honest consideration to the work he is expected to do, if Parliament sits more than three days a week. But ou the present occasion, certain legislation is required to be settled as early as possible, and under' those circumstances I agree that we ought to sit on Mondays. But I also agree with the honourable member for West Sydney, in wishing to know whether we are to have a long or a short adjournment over Christmas. If we are to have a long adjournment we shall get well into the latter end of the financial year before the session closes. 1 should like to have an adjournment for about ten days only to get over the holidays, and then I should like Parliament to set to work earnestly to get through the various measures that are urgently required. But if we are to have a six weeks' or two months' adjournment, I certainly object to the extra clay's sitting being granted. I intend to vote for the motion, because we are all anxious to expedite business as much as possible, but I desire to make a few remarks as to the statement that the Opposition are largely to blame for the delay that has occurred in connection with legislation. It is all veiy well for houorahle members on the Government benches, mostly representing Victorian constituencies, As to the who are able to live at home and attend to their businesses, to ask for longer sittings. But honourable members representing other States have to neglect their homes and their businesses in order to attend to legislation. We have already been here for six months, and have certainly done a good deal of work. It has been said that the additional sitting day has been necessitated by the action of certain members on the opposition side. They have said with considerable unfairness that much of the time that has been devoted to discussion here has been occupied by honourable members of the Opposition. I have taken the trouble to go through Hansard, and I think that some honourable members on the Government side of the House will be inclined to wish that Hansard was burnt when I give them a few particulars of what it shows. I have looked through Hartsard up to the 15th inst., and endeavoured to ascertain the number of speeches made by honourable members on both sides of the House, and I have made the interesting do not discovery that while 1,898 speeches were delivered by free-trade members, there were 3,115 speeches from the Government side. Our average is 57 per honourable member who has spoken, while the average for the Government side amounts to 78. The total average for the Opposition side is only 57, while the average for all members is 69. In view of the criticisms of honourable members opposite, I have also examined reports of second-reading speeches on various measures. I find that the Defence Bill was read a first time on the 5th June last, and although it has been brought before us on several occasions, it is still in committee. There are 222 columns of Hansard devoted to speeches by honourable members on the Government side of the House upon the second reading of that measure, and only 165 columns occupied by speeches delivered by honourable members of the Opposition. The Inter-State Commission Bill has been brought forward on several occasions to fill in time; and while there are S4 columns occupied by speeches of honourable members on the Government side upon this Bill, there are only 58 columns of speeches delivered by honourable members of the Opposition. In view of the charge that honourable",19,Additional Sittin Gday
34,Mr Sydn Ey Smith (Macquarie),"members of the Opposition had-wasted time, I felt it was necessary for some one to come forward and -show who has been responsible for the delay. I -admit that the flood of eloquence on the Postal -Bill was largely developed on this side, because while honourable members on the Government side had delivered speeches upon it occupying 51 columns of Hansard, the speeches delivered by honourable -members of the Opposition cover 56 columns. Then we have the Public Service.Bill, upon which speeches occupying 158 columns were made from the Ministerial side, while those from the opposition side occupied only 58 columns. The speeches on the Customs Bill delivered from the Government side take up 68 columns, while the speeches -upon it from this side of the .House occupy only 32 columns. 'There are 122 columns devoted to speeches from the Government side of the House on the Immigration Restriction Bill and 95 to those from the opposition side. The address in reply was a very important matter, and I admit that -honourable members of the Opposition devoted a good deal of time to it . The importance of the matter is illustrated by the Tariff which has since been .submitted. I find that the Opposition speeches take up 427 columns, while those from the Government side occupy 341, which is not -a very great difference. If we take the address in reply, the Postal Bill, the Customs Bill, the Defence Bill, the Inter-State Commission Bill, the Public Service Bill, and the Immigration Restriction Bill, we find that while speeches from the Government side upon those various matters occupy 1,046. columns of Hansard, those delivered by the Opposition cover only 891 columns, or a difference in our favour of 155 columns. going to give us another four hours' speech 1 member refers to my speech on the motion of censure. Honourable members know that I spoke at-a disadvantage on that occasion. An attempt was made to crush out debate. the Government side, and, at the last moment, I rose, unprepared as I was, in order to prevent such an important debate being prematurely closed. I may mention that I have spoken 36 times during the session. as those occupied by the speeches of the honorable member for Bendigo. Every honourable member has a perfect right to speak as-long as he pleases. The honourable and learned member for Corinellahas spoken 109 times to my 36. must have counted interjections as speeches. figures from the index compiled by the Hansard staff. The honourable and learned member for Corio is on the list with 129 speeches, and the honourable and learned member for Indi has spoken on 174 occasions. I find all through thathonorable members of the Opposition have not taken up anything like the time occupied by honourable members on the -Government side. No doubt the Opposition have devoted a good deal of time to the motion of censure and the Tariff proposals, and for very good reasons. As a result of the discussion some very important alterations have been made in the Tariff, and I hope.that others will yet be made as the outcome of the debate. I rose not for the purpose of opposing this motion, because honourable members of the Opposition are anxious to expedite business with due regard to the interests of the Commonwealth. We gain nothing by remaining in Melbourne week after week. The only reason that actuates us in giving so much attention to these -matters is that we feel it is our duty to, do so. We have been sent here to represent the people of the Commonwealth, and our object is to bring about alterations in the iniquitious Tariff submitted to us. I think that before the debate on the Tariff proposals is over, Ave shall find that honourable members opposite have made longer speeches than honourable members of the Opposition have yet felt called upon to make. I am now going to refer to the extraordinary delay that has taken place in dealing with the legislation submitted by the Government. Night after night Bills haA'e been submitted for our consideration, and the debate upon them has been adN o . journed after a short discussion. Take the Defence Bill. It is still in committee, and the real blame rests Avith the Government.

42,Mr Sydn Ey Smith,"I take thefor the delay. They have introduced a number of :Bills which they have no serious intention of proceeding with. That, is shown by the fact that the Inter-State Commission Bill, the Defence Bill, and other matters submitted to Parliament have not been dealt with seriously. It is clear that the Government are to blame for the . state of public business at the present time. Members on this side have continually asked the Government to expedite the consideration of the Tariff. In connection with that question, I may mention that in 1892 it took nearly five months to get a modified Tariff through the Victorian Legislative Assembly. Another modification proposed in 1895 took four months to get through. A t present we have been only six or seven weeks dealing with this Tariff, which is an entirely new One. We have before us really two new Tariffs. One is the "" perfect"" Tariff atfirst Submitted, and which we were informed was going to make every one happy and contented. After a little of the light of day had been thrown upon it, in consequence of the action of members on this side of the House, we found the honourable member for Hume and ' the right honourable member for Balaclava admitting that the Tariff was one which did not please anybody, and the Government have since been trying to please somebody by making important alterations in it . I hope they will continue, in the interests of the people of the Commonwealth, to make these alterations, and any made in the direction of free trade will have my support. ber must not discuss the Tariff on this motion -and we should do all we possibly can -to ferring to it incidentally. We are all anxious to have the Tariff settled as expeditiously as possible. I have shown that that is what I desire by the fact that I have refrained from speaking at length except upon two or three occasions, when I felt compelled to speak to prevent the question being settled without f u l l consideration and the proper explanation of the various items. Only upon those occasions did I take up any time in discussing the matter, and on other occasions, when other honourable members have submitted arguments which I intended to submit, I have been content to sit calmly by and allow their statements of the arguments to go. I think that'is shown by the figures I have collected, which prove that I have spoken only 36 times as compared with honourable members opposite, some of whom, like the honourable and learned member for Corinella, have spoken 109 times and more. -not tell us how many columns his speeches occupy. -taken out that interesting quantity, but I have admitted that on two occasions, in order to prevent the question going without f u l l consideration, I did take up a good deal of time, and I think subsequent events have justified the course I took on those occasions. I have shown that there has been no desire on the part of members on this side of the House to prevent the progress of business. They have not made anything like the number of speeches that have been made by members of. the Government side, nor have they taken up anything like the same number of columns of Sansard. I have no wish to place any obstacle in the way of the Government securing an extra sitting day, because I recognise that it is necessary if proper criticism is to be devoted to the proposals of the Government. We should not, I think, be deterred from properly and fully criticising their proposals by the suggestion that we may have to sit late. So far as I am concerned, if I believed that there was a possibility of tlie public interests being jeopardized, I should not hesitate to take up all night in what I believe to be legitimate criticism of the Government proposals. We are sent here for the purpose of giving proper consideration to tlie measures submitted, 0 I am only rebring about any alteration which we believe to be in the interests of the people of tlie Commonwealth. I have no hesitation in voting for the resolution proposed, but at the same time. I reserve to myself the right to fully criticise the proposals of the Government. MrL . E. GROOM (Darling Downs) I do not desire to detain the House, but I wish to say that the honourable member for Maranoa was mistaken in imputing a sinister motive to an honourable member in connection with the proposed adjournment for six weeks.

I do not think any one can say that I have at any time prolonged debate or occupied the time of the House when I had nothing to say. UnlessI feel that I have something to say, I have no desire to speak. I have a grievance against the Government, however, in that they caused me to speak one night very late, indeed. My constitution will allow me tositaslateasany honourable member can do, and I shall be prepared to stop if the Government insist upon sitting later than eleven o'clock, but I shall have no consideration for them after that hour, because I shall-feel that their desire is to force business through in the early hours of the morning, when honourable members are fatigued, and are unable to attend to their duty.

It takes a fortnight to make a visit to Western Australia; therefore an adjournment of less than five or six weeks would .not do us any good. I should be quite satisfied if it were only a fortnight, if the business of the session could be finished early next year. I trust that whatever the decision may be, it will be announced early, so that honourable members may be in a position to make their business arrangements. It takes fourteen or fifteen days before one can get a reply to a letter to Western Australia.

Its only possible effect can be to enable tlie manufacturers of biscuits within the Commonwealth to increase their prices. In New South Wales,where the duty on biscuits was only Jd. per lb., there were eight biscuit factoriesemploying 830 hands' last year, whilst in Victoria, where the duty was double that levied in New South Wales, there were only four factories, employing 791 hands. In all the States the duties were directed against biscuits imported from neighbouringStates rather than against those from abroad, and the position has been so entirely changed by the establishment of Inter-State free-trade as to render a duty absolutely unnecessary. The Hon. F. T. Derham, the managing, director for Messrs Swallow and Ariel], when giving evidence before the Victorian Tariff Committee in 1894-5, when the duty on biscuits was 2d. per lb., saidAs to our biscuit industry, if you can give us no relief in the duties on any of our raw material, it would be wise to reduce the duties on biscuits, coffee biscuits, fancy mixed biscuits, our own manufactures, at least by one-half. The duty is absurdly high ; it is not wanted, 2d. per cuits were 6d. per lb. in Sydney,.and 5£d. lb. I believe we could go almost so far as to ask you to make it free-trade at once, but 1 think it better to go down to that by steps, and I should ask for one-half. Thuswe find a manufacturer, as far back as 1894, advocating free-trade as regards biscuits. Further on in his evidence, Mr lb. in Sydney, and 5d. per lb. in Melbourne; Derham shows that the imported article was really beaten out of the Victorian market before a duty was imposed. duty of I d . per lb. was imposed on biscuits in Victoriai n 1866, but Mr Derham points out that the importations of biscuits into Victoria, which, in 1856, were valued at £34,650, gradually decreased, until, in 1866, they represented only £432 . Therefore, it is evident that the imported article was beaten out of the market long before any protective duty was imposed. I intend to move that biscuits be placed on the free list. worth) I do not attach much importance to this item, but, at the sametime, I agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that it would be better to strike it out altogether. It simply gives an opportunity to people to say that a duty prevails when, in fact, they are not affected at a l l ; and no doubt in many cases advantage is taken of the This will not be a revenueTariff in order to raise prices against the duty, and it is not consumer. The estimate of revenue fromthis source made by the Government shows that there is very little importation of -biscuits, and I -ask the Chairman to arrange to first take the vote on tlie amendment to strike out the item. ber for Wentworth made the remark that advantage might be taken of the opportunity to raise prices, and in this connection I have some figures which may interest the committee as showing the effect of the different duties in Melbourne and Sydney. In Victoria the duty was I d . per lb. and in Sydney \6\:, and according to the usual arguments which are advanced against duties, one would think that the higher prices would obtain in Victoria; but that is not so. The particulars I have relate to twenty lines of biscuits, in eleven of which the Melbourne prices were under those of Sydney; in three lines the Melbourne prices were the same as those in Sydney; and in six lines the Melbourne prices were over those of Sydney.

If they are wholesale prices, then I can tell the committee there are different prices for biscuits manufactured in Sydney. Whose prices are these which have been -quoted? I quite agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that the manufacture of biscuits is so well established in Australia that no protection is necessary. Biscuits particularly are an article which cannot be favourably competed with from abroad, when the industry here has reached a well-established stage. They require special packing to send across the Line from Europe or from the United States, and only a few of very exceptional kinds are sent in that way. possible, namely, natural protection; and, that being so, the Government ought not to persist in their proposal. 1,000,000 lbs. of biscuits was sent to South Africa. larly Victoria, are competing in this trade with the markets of the world. Biscuits -go to the East from these Statesand compete with British biscuits, and I hope to see more markets wrested for Australia. There is the danger that prices may be raised under a protective duty of this kind. positive assurance that the prices I have quoted are retail. In the one case the quotations are by Anthony Hordern and Sonsi n reference to Arnott's biscuits, which are manufactured in New South Wales. The honourable priced biscuits in Sydney. quotations are by the Mutual Store, of Melbourne, and relate particularly to Messrs. Swallow and Ariell's biscuits. Sir JOHNQUI CK (Bendigo) I am glad the Minister for Trade and Customs from l ^ d . to I d . per lb., but I cannot concur, in the amendment to abolish the duty altogether. A penny per lb. is very slight protection, but that protection is necessary isproved by the actual imports into Victoria last year under a duty of I d . per lb. Last year Victoria imported from the United Kingdom 9,797 lbs. of biscuits, valued at £510, upon which the customs duties collected amounted to £ 4 0 19s. 5d. This fact shows that, even with a duty of Id. per lb. operating, there is a possibility of a considerable quantity of biscuits being imported. If that duty were swept away, the local article would have no protection whatever. one of the arguments which have been advanced against the retention of this duty could be urged with equal force against any proposal submitted by the Government. The contention that our geographical position constitutes a sufficient protection against importation is a theory which has been repeatedly exploded. As has been The industry has the best protection pointed out by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, biscuits have been imported. I understand that some of the manufacturers-one of whom has been named by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie-ha s stated that a duty of I d . per lb. is an ample protection. But in this matter we have to consider the worker as well as the manufacturer. I am anxious that the principle of wages boards should be extended to this and other trades. That, however, is impossible, unless in the first instance we insure the home market to our manufacturers. To suppose that if we remit the duty of I d . per lb. upon biscuits the imports of this article will not I can now give a increase is contrary to the experience of America, Canada, and of every other country.",25,Tariff

Sir"" WILLIAM McMILLAN (Wentworth) -It has been implied by the previous speaker that once a duty is imposed it can never ""be remitted. In other words, all the talk of the last 30 years to the effect that duties should be imposed simply to give a fillip to the local manufacturer, and to enable him to stand upon his legs squarely, is the veriest claptrap. Here is an article which is almost exactly on the same plane as is the baker's bread. Biscuits are made up of products which we are exporting to the extent of millions of pounds annually. Yet we are told that if we abolish this wretched duty of I d . per lb. on the natural product of the country, the local manufacturers will be ruined. That is a very fine comment upon all the fine historical clap-trap of' protection which has been in vogue in this country, but which the people are at last beginning to see through. and learned member for Bendigo spoke in opposition to biscuits being placed upon the free list, and pointed out that 11,000 lbs. were imported into Victoria during the year 1900. I wish to point out that only 10,000 lbs. were imported into New South Wales during the same period. The duty in the latter State was i d . per lb., as against an impost of Id. per lb. in the former. Seeing that with a lower duty operating there were 1,000 lbs. less imported into the free-trade country-whic h has a larger population-tha n was imported into Victoria, the only inference one can draw is that the duty has no effect whatever upon importation. I would further point out that, in the year 1900, Victoria exported 2,600,000 lbs. of biscuits, and New South Wales 650,000 lbs. The base of the product is flour, of which we are also exporters. Yet, despite the fact that the biscuit manufacturer has a cheap product and a ready command of it , we are asked to give him still further protection. I oppose the retention of tliis duty. I would point out that the Treasurer expects"" to derive a revenue of less than £100 per annum from this duty. He has shown clearly that there is an importation of biscuits, and that he desires to give the local manufacturers a further measure of protection. The representative of Swallow and Ariell has admitted that, if we take off the duty upon sugar and currants, that firm will be quite willing that the duty on biscuits should be abolished. If the manufacturers have no desire for this further protection, the Government should adopt their advice and allow the article to come in duty free. The Minister for Trade and Customs quoted the prices at which biscuits were sold in New South Wales and Victoria respectively. He quoted the price at which they were sold by Anthony Hordern and Sons. But I would point out that that firm cannot be compared with many other Sydney firms in the matter of groceries. Biscuits of all kinds may be purchased there at from 10 and 15 to 20 per cent, less than from other grocers. Mutual Store, in Melbourne, which charges the highest prices. be satisfactory if the Minister, in quoting retail prices, will refer to the lists of Moran and Cato, in Melbourne, and, say, those of Lassetter and Co., in Sydney. There will not be any dispute at all about the prices of those firms. If he quotes wholesale prices, I would advise him to use the lists of John O'Connell and Co., in New South Wales, or the Trade Beviev> of that State; and the columns of the Age or the Jourriid of Commerce, in Melbourne. If the Treasurer does that it will be shown that the price of biscuits is increased by the duty levied upon them. Indeed, there is no other object in placing a duty upon biscuits than to increase the price, so as to afford an opportunity to manufacturing firms. The Treasurer has said that the £ 9 2 odd is the sum he expects to receive from biscuits imported into the Commonwealth. New South Wales exports between 600,000 lbs. and 700,000 lbs. of biscuits annually, while Victoria exports more than 2,000,000 lbs. of biscuits. The facts show that while the Commonwealth imports 30,000 lbs. of biscuits, it exports something like 3,000,000 lbs., so that we are really offering a premium to manufacturers. This appears to be tlie case from the report of the Victorian Royal commission. One of the Victorian manufacturers told the commission that he had no desire whatever for protection, but wished sugar and currants to be imported free. That was the statement of the representative of the large firm of Swallow and Ariel!.",26,Tariff

75,Mr Henrywillis,"I think it willleader of the Opposition, in that very unfair and unnecessary jibe at the protectionists in which he has indulged, has attributed to all protectionists an opinion which was expressed by only a few. The bulk of protectionists have never advanced the argument that protection was required only temporarily. I wish to expose certain of the fallacies of the Opposition. It has been said by way of interjection that we might as well say that flour required a duty, -or otherwise it would be imported, and would interfere with the farmer. In New South Wales, where there was no duty on flour during the year 1897, there was imported 1,119,879 centals of flour of the value of £624,000. WhatI desire to show is that there is a possibility of flour being imported into the Commonwealth. I know perfectly well that a large quantity of flour was imported into New South Wales from California during a time of drought, when wheat was very dear indeed; and I , as a member of the Victorian Legislature, endeavoured to induce the Government to take the duty off wheat in order that we might get cheap flour for the people. . Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN is imported to blend with the flour that is made in New South Wales. Jthat flour to the extent of 1,000,000 centals a year is imported simply for the purpose of blending? In the year 1898 the flour imported totalled 410,000 centals; in the next year 918,000 ; and in the following year 217,000. The value varies from £624,000 in the first year mentioned to £217,000 in the second year, £335,000 in the third year, and £8,000 in the fourth. These figures show that, to some extent at any rate, the contention of the acting leader of the Opposition is without foundation. regard biscuits, surely we are not going to be governed by the utterances of a single manufacturer, and one who, in the words of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, has shown himself always prepared to employ cheap labour, and to get the cheapest material he can.

Tlie whole of the ingredients used in the manufacture' of biscuits, with the exception of sugar, can be obtained here cheaper than in any other part of the world. Flour, for instance, is cheaper, and we all know that eggs and butter are cheaper here than in any other place, while sugar is cheaper here than in any by the honourable member for Melbourne-other part of the world, with the exception of England. The quantity of sugar used, however, is so infinitesimally small that it need not be taken into consideration. In reply to the honourable member for Laanecoorie I would state that the second largest biscuit manufacturer in Victoria assured me some time ago that he did not want a duty on biscuits. suggestions made by the honourable member for Laanecoorie was that, in the interests of labour, protection was required for the biscuit industry. As a matter of fact, biscuits are produced chiefly by the use of machinery. In all well-appointed factories up-to-date machinery is employed. a revenue duty, therefore there can be no argument in favour of imposing it on that ground. The return given by the Trea-' surer shows that he does not expect to receive more than £ 9 0 per year in the way of. revenue from this duty. The protectionists have failed to bring forward the names of any manufacturers who ask for the duty, while the names of other manufacturers have been brought forward, who have said that no duty is necessary. In these circumstances I think the amendment moved by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie might well be adopted. is one point to which I wish to refer,, in answer to the honourable member for Laanecoorie, in regard to' the increase of importation of flour so far as New South Wales is concerned. South Australia exports very large quantities to New South Wales, amounting to one-third-sometimes more and sometimes less-of the total importation. Of course that would be entered, as an import into New South Wales, but the fact is that flour cannot be produced in. BrokenH ill , and it has to be obtained from. the place from which it can be sent most expeditiously and at the least cost of transit. The comparison of the prices ruling; in Sydney and Melbourne amounts to-nothing. When we have an export of over 600,000 lbs. of biscuits from.. New South Wales, and over 2,000,000 lbs. from Victoria, it is not a question of a duty or no duty affecting local prices. It is purely a question of quality and taste. Something has been said Ports in regard to declining duties leading to increased importations. The manufacture, of biscuits was commenced in Victoriai n 1854, and in 1856 there was an importation into this State of £34,000 worth; but by 1866 the value of the importation of biscuits, without any duty being imposed during the* whole of the intervening period, had shrunk from £34,000 to £432. The cause of the r reduction was that the State was more suitable for the production of biscuits than were the exporting countries. I can understand why tlie Government have eased in this matter. They will not go to the f u l l length. of some of their convictions, but they w i ll come down to Id. That is the Victorian duty. It is not a protective duty, but the Victorians will beable to dispense with any duty. I believe that in doing this the Ministry w ill have the support of certain representatives of Victoria, because there are certain classes, of biscuits which the smaller States cannot, produce in competition with New South. Wales and Victoria. They cannot afford to. pay £ 1 0 per week for an expert to direct, the manufacture of certain classes of biscuits. I am almost certain that whether we have, protection or free-trade in regard to this item the 86 persons employed in the trade in South Australia will disappear, because of the importations from the largeir States, where the manufacturers have moreeffective machinery. The honourable andilearned member for Bendigo has referred to the fact that there is still an importation! of biscuits into New South Wales. The importation from the United Kingdom into Nefw South Wales which he mentioned",28,Tariff

88,Mr Glynn (South Australia),"Ther eis really not higher than the importation into South Australia, although there we have only one-fourth of the population. The explanation is that special classes of biscuits are imported into the States where they are least produced. They are least produced in South Australia, because the manufacturers .there do not possess the special machinery used in Victoria and New South Wales. The figures relating to the value of importations of biscuits from the United Kingdom to South Australia are a little over £9,000, and those approximate to the figures relating to the importations into New South Wales and Victoria. In the circumstances, I think the case is one for the abolition of the duty, and I am exceedingly sorry that we shall not receive the support of certain honourable members on the Government side.

Item 12-Blue, laundry, per lb., 2d. worth) I think I shall be perfectly in order in saying a word or two at this stage with regard to the series of items which are to be brought under the consideration of the committee in this division of the Tariff. I shall take the Government figures as the basis of the statement 1 have to make. According to the Government figures the duty on blue will have the effect of reducing the imports into Australia by at least 75 per cent. The effect of the duty on cheese will he to reduce imports from abroad by 90 per cent. The impost on candles will reduce the foreign imports by 80 per cent., and in the matter of stearine the duty will be practically prohibitive. I feel that I occupy a very 'difficult and responsible position at the present time. I represent, in the absence of the leader of the Opposition, not only the free-traders in .this House, hut the free-traders of Australia. We have referred on several occasions to the manifesto of the Prime Minister, and to the particular phrase upon which the policy of the Government in connection with its Tariff was based, namely,"" revenue without destruction."" Another of the expressions used by the Prime Minister was McLean, A. "" We can have no extreme protection ; we O'Malley, K. can have no prohibition."" Yet, at the very Phillips, P. outset of this Tariff-afte r dealing with Ronald, J. B. the narcotics and stimulants upon which Spence, W.

C. honourable member is to be at liberty to make general observations of this character, I presume that it will be open to all other honourable members to follow the same course? Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN On the point of order, I desire to direct attention to the fact that there is great difficulty in dealing with this question in any other way than that which I am adopting. We are dealing with the item now before us and others, either as a matter of protection or as a means of raising revenue. We fully understand that the debates upon all these items more or less reflect the views we hold upon the question of free-trade and protection, and we have now come to a series of duties which are practically prohibitive in their effects. I desire in connection with the establishment of that proposition to refer to the fact that Parliament was elected on a certain understanding, and that a series of items which appear in this division of the Tariff practically falsify and repudiate the sentiments expressed by the Ministry in their manifesto. I am not saying that the manifesto is repudiated by me, but that the Tariff itself absolutely repudiates the utterance of the Prime Minister. I intend to prove this by quoting certain figures, and if as acting leader of the Opposition I am to have my tongue tied, I shall have to take a course which I shall be very reluctant to follow, but which would give me the fullest liberty of speech. kind I take it that the acting leader of the Opposition has no more rights or privileges",31,Pairs

So far as the honourable, member draws an illustration from the item of blue, in order to prove that the duty is equivalent to 75 per cent., he cannot be declared out of order when he points to a complete departure from the principles upon which the Government went to the country, on which they were elected, and on which this Tariff was supposed to be framed.. bers are strictly held to a particular words in personal explanation.

No doubt, if items, and, moreover, we have a right to we decide this item in a certain way, the consider the political aspect of the Tariff at Government will have the consideration to every stage of the discussion in committee. give way on those other items.

The acting leader of the' Opposition did somegave an intimation, 'or conveyed a veiled threat, that if he were not allowed to proceed, he would take certain steps which would probably prove unpleasant. I trust there was nothing in that threat, because the work which we have before us affects the whole people, who are anxious to see it brought to a completion. If we allow a general discussion, we shall be breaking the compact we ourselves entered into when the Tariff was introduced, and when honourable members freely availed themselves of the opportunity which was afforded of discussing the general question.

Had the honorable member attempted to deal in detail with those items I should have called his .attention to the standing order; but he made only incidental reference to them. The next point on which I am asked to rule is whether an honourable member has a right to digress from the subject-matter before the -committee. Standing Order 274, in my opinion, clearly provides that no honourable member shall digress from the subject-matter of the question under discussion; and the subject-matter is now blue. So far as the policy of the Government, as expressed .at Maitland, or anywhere else, is concerned, I should not, according to the usage of Parliament, rule that any incidental reference thereto is a breach of the standing order. But any attempt to enter on a general debate, or tb evoke a general debateon the question, would be clearly a breach of Standing Order 274. I have to ask honorable members to confine themselves to the item under discussion. The honourable member for Wentworth will not be in order in going bevond that item. propose to go beyond it ; but I take it for granted that underlying all these items there is a principle-that this Tariff has been'framed on a principlea principle which practically falsifies and repudiates the policy of the Government, as laid down by the Prime Minister at Maitland. It is not we who repudiate the policy -of the Prime Minister; that has been done -by whoever is answerable for this Tariff. I find that in the year 1899, New South 'Wales imported from the United Kingdom 472,175 lbs. of blue. A duty of 2d. per lb. aipon that amount would yield a revenue of £3,934. But the Treasurer estimates that for the whole of Australia only £1,379 will toe derived from this source. Out of that amount we may fairly assume that £1,000 will be collected in New South Wales. venue for New South Wales. fact makes my argument the stronger. We find, therefore, that the trade which at 2d. per lb. would represent a revenue of £3,934 is reduced to a value of £542. In other words, the duty practically prohibits i m honourable portation into New South Wales. I ask honourable members upon the other side who are imbued with any sense of fairness, whether that is "" revenue without destruction "" ? The whole of this importation, and all the concomitant industries connected with it, is to be wiped out. tant industries connected with blue 1 is a difference of £10,000,000 between the trade of New South Wales and that of Victoria, does the honourable member mean to say that we can wipe that trade away without interfering with the labour and industry of the country ? It is absurd. I do not believe in the closing of our ports. We can maintain the commerce of the countiy, and derive all the revenue necessary for the Commonwealth without the imposition of a prohibitive duty. The Minister for Home Affairs stated in his speeches during the recent election campaign that 15 per cent, was a fair duty. Indeed, we have before us a Tariff the principles of which have been repudiated by four Ministers of the Crown. The manifesto of the Prime Minister, the speech of the Minister for Home Affairs, which has been quoted, and the accuracy of which is not denied; I do not the very moderate speeches of one of tlie most moderate men in Australia, the present Vice-President of the Executive Council, and the utterances of Sir Philip Eysh, are all in opposition to its general lines. Out of nine Cabinet Ministers four have repudiated the principles upon which the Tariff has been framed. I feel in a very difficult position. I have closely watched the actions of the two right honourable gentlemen opposite, and I am pretty well convinced that if the Treasurer had been left to himself on Friday last he would probably have reduced the duty upon bacon and hams, which was practically prohibitive. member has no right to say that. through that debate without showing the £ 5 4 2 is the estimated releast temper, and without making this charge of repudiation, because I honestly That believed that the Government would have given way.

When' I prove-as I can from the figures of the Government-that at least 90 per cent, of the trade must disappear, it is surely time for me to protest, not merely as a matter of ordinary argument, but in order to save Australia from national repudiation. I intend in this case to move that the duty be reduced to I d . would be a tremendous embargo upon the import business. A t the same time, as I said before, I am anxious to consider the need for revenue. We have come here to compromise. I claim that on this side of the House we have not attempted to do away with any reasonable duty unless it was inoperative so far as its collection was concerned. We proposed the reduction of the duty of 3d. on bacon and hams only by Id., on the principle that we believed that revenue must be obtained. As the Government themselves have absolutely allowed that there is scarcely any importation of this article at all-onl y £1,379 for the whole of AustraliaI can reasonably appeal to honourable members on both sides to support the reduction. I would ask the Government to consider it in the same spirit in which I have proposed it . If that is done, it will be a guide to us with regard to other duties that stand upon exactly the same footing. It will show us that the Government are doing the right thing, and that they are carrying out in good faith the declaration of the Prime Minister. Then business can be accelerated. But if tlvs reasonable request is not complied with, all I can say is that while I am not going to countenance any obstruction, or the repetition of speeches, it will be necessary for us to fight this Tariff line by line. I move That the words "" a n d on m d after 27th November, Id. per l b ."" be added. prepared to discuss the question whether this duty shall or shall not be I d . a l b . ; but I decline to be drawn into debate on the general principle of the Tariff. That has already been discussed ' in a debate extending over three weeks, when the existence of the Government was challenged. It would have been quite within the province of the acting leader of the Opposition, when the first item of the Tariff was called on, to have a general discussion. But we have passed that first item, and therefore the .question for discussion now is simply the amount of duty on blue. My honourable friend must not expect that the Government o can accept any proposal simply because it comes from him or from any other honourable member opposite. If we think that any proposed alteration is fair and reasonable we have shown our willingness to consider it in a proper spirit. W it h regard to the contention that this duty will Even then it cause a large falling off in the imports to New South Wales, my answer is that, I am glad that that is so, because the result will be to give employment to a large amount of labour in New South Wales. Already one firm, that of Litzner and Co., have shown that this proposed duty has given them a larger output, and enabled them to employ more labour. I find that, leaving out the free-trade State of New South Wales, the duty in all the other States, except Western Australia, was hitherto 2d. per lb. Consequently, we are not'prepared to say that a duty of 2d. is too high. No argument has yet been brought forward to show that it is too high. We are prepared to consider any argument to that effect, but any mere statement that the duty ought to be reduced to I d . without showing reasons why the reduction should be made, is one which cannot weigh with us. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN The importations will be reduced by this duty to the extent of 86 per cent. be. There may be, and will be, a number of; articles, the importation of which will cease in consequence of the manufacture of the articles in the country. But when we find that in Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania the duty has been 2d., are we to reduce it because by the reduction more may be imported into New South Wales? Surely my honourable friend will not pretend that we ought to displace labour that is employed at the present time in four States in the preparation of this article because by the duty we shall reduce importations into the State he represents ? If the Government had found, on comparing the rates in the various States, that in some the duty was I d . , and in others 2d., we might have fixed the duty at a I d . ; but seeing that the duty was 2d. in all the States except New South Wales and Western Australia, we think that 2d. is a fair duty to propose.",34,William Mcmillan Does The Thing Which He Does Hot Often Do When He

Otherwise we shall ask the committee to adhere to the duty proposed. remembered by the committee that a duty of 2d. per lb. on blue amounts to something like 40 or 50 per cent, on the value of the article oversea. That is one reason why the duty should be reduced to I d . Another is that the higher duty will press heavily on the poorest of the poor, who earn their livelihood by laundry work. usually are either widows or the wives of men who earn very small wages.

If the honourable member wants -to institute such a comparison, he should do it fairly-h e should show what is the estimate not only for New South Wales, as compared with the actual importations in previous,years, but what is the estimate for the other States as compared with their respective importations.

The importations of blue from the United Kingdom into Victoriai n 1899 amounted to 77,000 lbs. weight, which, at 2d."" per lb., represents about .£640 sterling. The Government's estimate of the revenue to be received from the importations of blue into Victoria in a normal year is £416, a reduction of about one-third. That, I think, is by no means an excessive estimate of the reduction, when we realize the increased facilities for trade between the States owing to the abolition of the border duties. It is nothing more than what we might expect of an article of that kind, which is freely T h a t makes manufactured throughout the States.

The ACTI NG CHAIRMAN ask honourable members to adhere to Standing Order No. 274, which saysJTo member shall digress from the subject matter of any question under discussion ; nor anticipate the discussion of any other subject which appears on the notice-paper. Of course a certain amount of latitude is permitted for incidental reference, but in the discussion of this item it seems to me that some honourable members have infringed the rule, and I ask them to assist me in .enforcing it . MrM c CAY .conclusion that the choice offered by the .honourable member for Wentworth is pracvtically this :-Eithe r the importation into New South Wales is to be kept up to somevthing like half of what it was formerly, in which case the sale of the locally manufacvtured article must fall very much below its former level, or else we are to follow the -example of the other States and keep up .the manufacture of the local article to its -former level, notwithstanding that in the -special case of New South Wales there will -necessarily follow a considerable falling off -of the imports into that particular State. .honourable member for Corinella has put forward .an explanation as to the purport -of this .duty which differs from that put forward by the right honourable gentleman in .charge -of the Tariff. The honourable member said that this was a duty that was to bring in some revenue, and that if it did not do that it might still be vtermed .a "" revenue"" item. The right ihonorable gentleman in charge of the Tariff --said distinctly that this item was not included for any such purpose, and it is very obvious that it was not. Whati t .appears necessary to prove, according to the right honourable gentleman, is that this duty is necessary for the protection of the industry. I take it that my honourable and learned friend is right in saying that the ideal of the Ministry is "" revenue, without destruction of native industries."" If it can be shown that by taking off this duty of 2d. per lb., or reducing it, those manufacturers now engaged in the production of blue will cease to produce the article, or will be materially affected, I will admit that the Government stand upon excellent ground. Buti f that cannot be proved, I fail to see how they can maintain their position. It appears, accordI must ing to an interview held with one of the chief manufacturers of blue in Victoria, that the chief result of this duty, so far as the trade is concerned, will be to give the whole market of Australia, or, at any rate, of New South Wales, to Lewis and Whitty. Lewis and Whitty's blue appears to be selling at 4£d. per lb. in Sydney. The article with which it has had to compete largely was Reckitt's and Keen's blue. It appears that Keen's blue is selling at 6^d. in New South Wales, and 8£d. in Victoria, which shows I only wish to say in that the 2d. per lb. duty is put on to the price, ami the consumer has to pay it in Victoria. It is now proposed to impose the duty of 2d. per lb. all round, and the obvious corollary is that the proposition would give the market to the producer, buti t gives him the market without any excuse for the duty. He has the market already, and even in free-trade Sydney he is able to undersell the foreign exporter of blue by 2d. per lb. AVhat will he do with this 2d. per lb. duty ? Obviously he will put it in his pocket. That may be the object of honourable gentlemen opposite, but it is clear that I d . per lb. would be all that would be necessary to enable the industry to be carried on. How many people does it take to make blue? What labour is employed in sticking on the labels or mixing up the blue ? Any one would imagine that there was an atmosphere murky with the smoke from a million manufactories in which nothing but blue was produced. I suppose that a few women and children, with very few men, make all the blue in Victoria or other places,' If there is one industry which more than another seems to lend itself to the' employment of female labour and child labour, apparently blue-making is that industry. It calls for the exercise",37,William Mcmillan W E Want Pay As The Minister For Trade And Customs

138,Mr Hughes (West Sydney),"Th eof little ingenuity, and very few trade secrets. But there is a process which is known in connection with the trade, and it is that by which the manufacturer manages to put into his pocket the 2d. of duty on every lb. of blue which he produces. I .am given to understand that previous to the imposition of the uniform the price of Lewis and Whitty's in Victoria was higher than the price of blue in Sydney. for the manufacturers to make that charge ? They did it simply because they were able to do so by the 'market. The Ministers have asked for arguments, not that they want them, but to show they are ready for anything-as, believe, they are. The honourable member for Dalley supplied them with three arguments ; does any man desire more ? The honourable and learned member for Corinella supplied another argument vertently, but he did his best. they have four arguments, that is not sufficient. not want any arguments. excuse, and unless we can supply them with that excuse, we shall not be able to reduce this item by a penny. surely as we are not able to do so, just so surely will it be quite useless for honourable members on the other side to get up and endeavour to persuade us to deal with them fairly and reasonably. argument, but when it is given they affect to disregard it, not that they can disregard argument, for sensible men as they are could not do such a thing. simulation of indifference which I feel persuaded that they do not feel. quoted a paragraph from an interview with the agents of Lewis and Whitty in Sydney, and I can readily understand that the honourable and learned member for Corinella, who represents the intelligence of Victoria, can work himself up into a state of jocular enthusiasm in support of the local manufacturer's blue. consider that the agents of this firm in Sydney are positively enthusiastic over the prospect one can readily understand that a representative, not of the firm, but of the people generally here will derive some measure of enthusiasm, vicarious enthusiasm. there that we should impose a duty which, on the face of it, gives little or no revenue, which was not imposed for that purpose, and J f r . JTwjhes. which, so far as we know, is not necessary to the protection of this industry 1 If it can be shown that it is necessary, then the Government will occupy afairlyfirmposition, although I entirely agree with the honourable member for Wentworth when he says that to impose a duty which they admit is duty equal to 33 per cent., .but which apparently blue is higher than that, is an absolute departure from the revenue-producing Tariff which What necessity was there we were led to expect from them. Is an industry threatened here? Absolutely .no, because the local producer of blue is able exigencies of the now, and was able prior to the imposition of the Tariff, to undersell the foreign dealer. What can be clearer than that ? He did I put on the market at Sydney a blue which he sold at 4|-d. per lb., and the price at which Keen's blue could be retailed was 6 Jd. per lb. That wants refutation, if it can be afforded. It is now proposed to alter inadthe price of Keen's blue to 8Jd. per Now that lb., while Lewis and W h it t y can sell their blue for 4|d. a lb. That is putting I am very certain that they do the foreign article at a disadvantage of They want an nearly 100 per cent. That is not a revenue producing Tariff-that is nothing but pure prohibition. It appears that the mere But just so handling of cases of blue is a work for which honourable members on the other side feel the most supreme contempt. The man on the ship, the man on the wharf, the man on the trolly, is utterly beneath contempt. They They ask for have their eyes on a pallid looking being, working under scarcely tolerable conditions.' I am just as much concerned for the man who handles blue as they are for the women or It is a girls who make it. Some explanation will have to be afforded by my right honorI have able friend how it is that, although this is not a revenue producing item, he imposes such a duty as will put the foreign article at a disadvantage of 100 per cent., when the local .article is well able to compete with that article. When a compromise is offered by the honourable member for Wentworth, the Government When one comes to require some argument. No more argument is necessary than that already adduced. AndI shall be veiy much aggrieved if the Government do not come forward with some offer at least towards a compromise. What reason is We might fairly say with the honourable member for Wentworth that this will bo a Tariff to destroy revenue. There will be no revenue from this source, because I find, from their price-list, that Lewis and",38,William Mcmillan W E Want Pay As The Minister For Trade And Customs

Messrs Lewis and W h it ty have a large proportion of the Sydney trade. the circular issued by the firm in which they refer to the large trade they do with New South Wales. Their price list shows that their blue is sold in Sydney for 4£d. per lb., whereas in Melbourne the price is 6Jd. per lb.

Messrs. Lewis and Whitty will establish a factory there, but that will not make any » difference to the revenue. Sir member admits that Messrs Lewis and W h it ty give the people of New South Wales a cheaper article than the imported blue. different class from the imported article, and the fact remains that so far as Victoria is concerned, they have had the f u l l advantage of a very heavy protective duty. The Treasurer might very well accept the compromise proposed by the honourable member for Wentworth. members on this side of the House had their way, they would abolish the duty on blue, but they see no prospect of bringing about that result, and the amendment is directed to reducing the impost as far as possible. Onethingi n connection with this duty seems to have escaped the notice of the committee, namely, that the protection has had the effect of giving Messrs. Lewis and W h it ty the sum of £11,800. lous. and W h it t y have not benefited, as stated, they are not good business men, because the duty on blue has raised the price of their blue to that extent. What have Messrs. Lewis and Whitty done that they should derive these extra profits at the expense of the community? The people of New South Wales will want to know why this particular Victorian firm should receive such a large bonus. There has been no reason advanced why this duty should be imposed. If Messrs. Lewis and W h it t y were to come forward and suggest that they would give honourable members half of the money to be derived from the duty in consideration of their voting for the Government proposal, we should know where we stood. think the honourable member is in order in suggesting, even by inuendo, that any manufacturer should offer a bribe to honourable members. that if Messrs. Lewis and W h it t y came forward and offered us half the profits they would make out of the duty, we should know how to deal with them. I dare say If I am not to suggest that it would be a most improper thing on the part of honourable members to accept a bribe, that would appear to be casting an amount of discredit should like to see some valid argument advanced why a particular firm should he given this amount of money. Why should we practically guarantee interest to a firm which is supposed to already have a large amount of capital, when farmers, for in stance, are not guaranteed against loss by drought or storm ? The large body of people who consume blue ought to have some consideration, and no excuse can be found for raising the price of the article in the way suggested. If the duty does not increase the price, why is it imposed? Andi f the duty does increase the price, the effect is to tax the large body of consumers. If Messrs. Lewis and Whitty, without the passing of any law, were to endeavour to compel people to pay this extra money, they might be charged with conspiracy.

I believe that there are very few manufacturers of blue in Australia. Indeed, the market could practically be met by one or two factories. The imposition of this duty simply means that we are handing over the additional profit whioh is represented by the amount of the duty to one or two manufacturers. That is a great mistake in face of the failure of an impost of 2d. per lb. in South Australia to induce competition, and the certainty that one or two men will have the whole of the markets of the Commonwealth to exploit hereafter. that we should increase the cost of articles unless some advantage will accrue to the revenue, or unless those who are swayed by protectionist ideas think that they are assisting an industry.

The statements made by honourable members on the other side of the chamber show that the colonial article is sold more cheaply than is the imported article, while it has not been alleged that the quality of the locally manufactured blue is inferior to. that of the imported. Robertson said that the price of blue in Sydney was 4^d. per l b . ; but I would point out that a quotation of that kind is thoroughly satisfied that the honourable member would be the last to attempt to deliberately mislead the committee. He did not state whether that was the wholesale or retail price, or what the quality was. I have obtained from a man Under Inter-State free-trade, in a large way of business in ELerang, the prices of the ordinary articles in this Tariff. He quotes Lewis and Whitty's blue at from 4Jd. to 6d. I find that the price for imported blue in Sydney before the Tariff was, according to Lassetter's list, 7d. per lb., and, since the Tariff, 9d. per lb. The imported blues are selling in Melbourne at from 9d.. to Is. I find that there are three Victorian manufacturers of blue, namely, Messrs. Blogg Bros., Messrs. Grist, and Messrs. Lewis and Whitty. The blues of Messrs. Blogg Bros, and Messrs. Grist sell a t the Mutual Store at 5d., and the blue of Messrs. Lewis and W h it t y at 6d. Seeingthat the imported blues-thos e of Keen, Coleman, and Reckitts-ar e sold in Sydney at a price-higher than that, the facts go to show that the poor, whose cause is. always espoused by certain honourable members for their own purposes, will not be payingmore for their blue by taking the Australian article. I find that the imports. of blue into New South Wales amount to 682,546 lbs., into Queensland to143,231 lbs., and into Victoria 82,259 lbs.,, a total of 908,000 lbs., so that I suppose-, we may say that something like 1,000,000-.

Why should..' we send out of the country for an' .article of this description? The manufacture of blue is a small industry, but there is no reason why it should not be e n couraged.

The amount of the protection is fair and reasonable, and if we want to encourage our agricultural community at all we can fairly extend the encouragement in this direction, where it is particularly asked, where it is a reasonable rate, where the necessity for it has been shown by the experience of the past, and where, owing to the heavy importations, the price of millet has been reduced to an amount which is hardly payable. I trust that we shall not hesitate to do what we can within the duty proposed by the Government, to afford to millet growers the protection which they seek. River district, in New South Wales, from Maitland down to almost Newcastle, where corn and maize used to be grown, millet has been grown for years. It is also grown on the Paterson River, and on the coastal rivers in the north. It is a thriving and powerful industry there. Those who deal in both imported millet and Australian millet mix the two varieties for broom-making, and find that they have no reason to ask for any protection. If New South Wales grows millet, and does not require assistance, I do not see why the other States should ask for a protective duty. to know from the Minister for Trade and Customs how much land in Australia is under cultivation for the growth of broom corn millet. I know that its cultivation has been recommended by the department of New South Wales amongst others. I remember Mr Campbell saying that very few men had made the experiment, but I learn now that some persons have done so. A gentleman who runs a factory in New .South Wales told me that he was' unable to get a supply with any regularity, that -any shortage he had to import, and that one kind of straw it was necessary to import. It does not appear that this duty is imposed -for any otherpurpose than to placate the farmer. I do not think that very many farmers will grow broom corn millet. If 23 N 2 the industry were taken up seriously I should think that 1,000 acres would supply the market. I am afraid, much as I would like to support it, it is one of those duties put on for the purpose of placating the poor unfortunate farmer without helping him. broom millet was £ 1 6 13s. per ton in 1897, £17 Is. per ton in 1898, and £ 2 8 per ton in 1899. A duty of 4s. percental is not am extreme duty; it is equal to about 20 per cent, ad valorem. This is one of thosecases where we can dovetail the raw material into the manufactured article., We can grow millet as well as it can be grown anywhere. I have seen it growing on the King River. It is a fine product; it grows extremely well, and provides a great deal of employment. If we encourage the production of broom millet here, growers will be able to supply the manufacturers, and secure settled prices. Broom millet is essentially a product that can be grown by holders of small plots of good land, and particularly where irrigation can be applied. This duty is not imposed for the purpose of placating the farmer, but in order to encourage a natural industry. from the information supplied by the Government that Victoria is the only Statethat has hitherto imposed a duty on this broom millet. I presume that the object of the duty was to protect the producer, and as it only amounted to 10 per cent, there does not appear to be any necessity for imposing the higher duty now proposed. I have visited some of the broom factories in Victoria, and I havefound that, notwithstanding the special encouragement offered to local growers, thebulk of the millet used in broom manufacture was imported from either New South Wales or America. The millet grown in Victoria appeared to me to be much coarser than that imported from America or New South Wales, but whilst the American millet was even finer than that grown in New South Wales, I was given to understand that it had the disadvantage of being much more brittle. I was also informed that in addition to the customs duty on broom millet a bonus of some £ 5 per ton was paid to the. Victorian growers, and I should like to know whether it is intended to continue this bonus.",45,Pairs

A t any rate .a 10 per cent, duty would be ample. ""bers have requested further information, .and I should like to read an extract from . a letter which has been received from Mr ready foi the market. The various processes of <Cunningham, the secretary to the Miller's Eorest Progress Committee, on the Hunter River, New South Wales. -.dated 6th August, and reads as follows :I am directed by the Miller's Forest Progress -Committee to usk you to bring under the notice -of the Federal Prime Minister (the Hon. E. Barton) the need of putting a fairly strong tax on millet, or broom corn, as it is sometimes called, when framing the Tariff. My committee are led to this course from the fact that manufacturers have more power to have their interests served in 'these matters than producers and farmers, and it is certainly to the interest of the former to have the raw material admitted at alow tariff, while the actual loss to the farmers, who, in establishing manufactured article pays a high duty. The growing of millet has become a standard industry in the Hunter River district, and it is also extenthe grind of competition in other directions. , sively grown on all the other northern rivers. In .fact, plenty can be grown to supply the whole of Australia. Owing to free-trade here, the import.ation of American and Italian millet causes extreme fluctuations in the market. Last year, at this time, it-was between £35 and £40 a ton. At -present it ranges from £10 to £15 owing to manufacturers placing orders in America at the beginning of the season ; and, when these shipments .'arrived, which cost from £20 to £25 in Sydney, -the local millet was arriving on the market, and -growers had to accept the low prices previously .quoted. We therefore think that a fairly stiff tax would prevent this extreme fluctuation, and give us a steady, reliable market. I may state that growers consider from £20 to £25 a ton a good payable price. Here we have a man speaking from experience, plainly indicating the mischief which free-trade does, and applying for the relief -which we think ought to be granted to the -producer as well as to the manufacturer. I have a further letter from the Hunter River, signed by MrW . Johnston, who -writes most intelligently upon the subject. I think testimony of this description is what we I have no recollecwant. It comes from those who have been engaged in the industry, and who are able to point out the disadvantages attached to their present position. Mr JohnstonI should judge, from saysFor some years past a steadily increasing area of land in New South Wales has been devoted to the growth of the species of millets used in the manufacture of brooms. It is a plant requiring much care and attention, and only the best sort of arable land is used, which gives a return in some instances of as much as 7 cwi>. to the acre; but more usually four or even five acres are required to produce a ton. One result directly beneficial to the country at large arising from its cultivation is the amount of labour it demands. The production of 1 ton will not only create as much occupation in preparing the ground, sowing, cleaning, scarifying, &c., as four or five acres put under, say, maize, but on the millet arriving at maturity, will find employment for two men for very nearly four weeks ere it be cutting, drying repeatedly, stripping of the seed, tying, pressing, &c, all which millet has to undergo, cause it to afford more employment to The letter is the workman before it leaves the farmer's hands than perhaps anything the latter grows. At the current price of agricultural labour, the grower has to disburse some £10 or £15 in wages before he can dispose of a single ton. Last year, owing to the failure of the American crop, millet brought from £22 to £30 a ton, thus, after recouping the agriculturist for the rent of his land, labour, risk, &c, showing anything but a brilliant margin of profit for the year on the capital invested. Unfortunately, this year, owing to heavy imports from America, the price is quoted as low as £13 to £15, which represents a grave a new industry requiring so much labour, have in no small measure contributed to the lessening of There are the simple facts.

Miller's Forest is the strongest protectionist centre in New South Wales, and yet it is . admitted that under free-trade there hundreds of acres have been put under cultivation. In spite of that, the Minister is anxious to impose a protective duty equal to 20 per cent. The growers' side of the question has been represented, but the consumers have also to be considered ; and it must further be remembered that millet is the raw material of the manufacturer. If this commoditity has been free of duty in all the States, except Victoria, up to the present, the Commonwealth Parliament ought to place it on the free list. try have made a departure from their usual policy in proposing to give some protection to growers. I was at a loss to understand the reason for their action until I found that the communications read by the Minister for Trade and Customs come from the representative of 25 or 30 constituents in the electorate of the Prime Minister, who, amidst his multifarious duties, has found time to accede to a request that a protective duty should be put on this commodity. of people engaged in the manufacture of brooms than in the growing of millet, and while the former have a protection of 25 per cent., the protection in the case of the growers amounts in some cases to as high as 30 per cent, or 40 per. cent. The number of acres under cultivation is only 1,900, and this mostly for seed and not for broom millet, and yet we are asked to impose a tax on the rest of the people of the Commonwealth for the protection of an industry' which hitherto has been able to exist without any duty. in this instance are departing from their own principles in interfering with what is the raw material of the manufacturer, and they ought really to vote with the free traders,who deprecate the imposition of a duty merely because those interested happen to be within the Prime Minister's electorate. We cannot protect the growers of wheat, maize, or oats, who may cultivate 500 times the quantity of land that is devoted to millet; and yet we are asked to single out this special industry for favour. Therefore, I am thoroughly in accord with the proposal to place this article upon the free list. worth) -This duty is one which, in the very nature of things, ought to be swept away. Its imposition can only result in giving an opportunity to the millet-grower to raise the price of the article. It is absolutely absurd to create an artificial price in the market for the sake of the mere handful of people who would be employed in that industry. But if in the millions of acresof land in Australia there are twenty acres which, under somewhat peculiarconditions of soil and climate, will grow some product that could not begrown elsewhere, the Minister for Tradeand Customs would apparently impose ai duty upon it, and thus raise its price to theconsumers. That is not a principle whichi is worthy of consideration. In all otherStates but one, this article has hithertobeen admitted absolutely free of duty. If we act upon federal principles that fact ought to settle the whole question. I hope that Ministers will yield to the general consensus of opinion with that grace which would become them under, the circumstances. honourable member who has just resumed But there are a greater number his seat reasons, on the one hand, that the effect of the duty proposed will be to increase the growth of millet broom to such am extent that there will be a glut in themarket, and, on the other hand, that there will be an increase in its price. My experience is that when a glut in the market occurs there is a decrease in the price. The honourable member further argues that very few people will be benefited by the imposition of this duty. That is an argument which is used in regard to one industry after another. The number of The protectionists people employed in one particular industrymay be small, but the aggregate of thoseemployed in small industries is very large.

Only a few nights agotwo blind men visited my house, and, when questioned as to their occupation, informed methat they were engaged in the making of millet brooms. Under the Government proposal, these people are to be charged 25 or.30 per cent, upon the raw material, besides having to pay what is equivalent to another 15 per cent, for the carrying of that material to Australia. pay about 40 per cent, upon the raw material, whilst the protection afforded to them amounts only to 25' per cent. The poor farmer of New South Wales has been able to supply not only his own State with millet, but to export it to Victoria and pay the duty upon it . So thriving has he found the business,, that tlie area under cultivation in the Hunter district of New South Wales is rapidly increasing. Positive evidence is, therefore; afforded that the millet farmer does not require protection. The poor blind manufacturer, however, does require it , and, if any one should get it at the hands of a free-trader, it is the blind man. I urge the committee,, therefore, to admit the raw material free. Buti f we are wise we shall strike out the '25 per cent, duty on brooms as well as the 25 per cent, on millet. The price of millet during September was £ 1 5 a ton,, in Octoberi t was selling at something like £ 2 0 a ton, Victoria of 321 tons; 15® tons were imand in November-sinc e this duty was imposed-it has been selling at £ 2 4 a ton. figures quoted by the honourable member for Robertson practically give away the whole position taken up against this proposed duty. Those figures show that before the introduction of the Tariff, millet had risen from £ 1 5 a ton to £ 2 0 a ton. The honourable member assumes that because of the Tariff millet rose to £ 2 4 a ton, but there is nothing to prove that tlie price would -not have gone up to £ 2 4 if the Tariff had not been introduced. There is no proof whatever that the imposition of the Tariff was the cause of thq rise. To those who say that this industiy has been a success in New South Wales, without the aid of a duty, I reply that they have given no proof to the committee to that effect. The Minister for Trade and Customs has read a letter from a district where millet is grown,'and this letter shows that owing to the fluctuations of the market, caused chiefly by importations from abroad, the local production has suffered. Had we ourselves produced up. to the limit of our own requirements^ we should not have had these extreme fluctuations. than we could use, should we not have these fluctuations 1 reaches the limit of its requirementsthe tendency is for cultivation to decrease. I Therefore, they will have to am going toshow that the industiy has not been successfully established in New South Wales. In proof of that I am going to refute some figures quoted by honourable members opposite. They were to the effect that the major portion of the importations into Victoria were of New South Wales growth. What do the records prove ? In 1899 there were imported from New South Wales into Victoria 64 tons of millet. The records do not specifically say that it was New South Wales grown, but I will give the State the credit for that. It is referred to as Australasian grown. The importation of millet from New South Wales 'grown elsewhere than in Australasia was 98 tons, which goes to. prove that New South Wales in the year 1899 imported andreexported to Victoria 30tons more than the export of her own production. But over and above that, in proof of what I have said, I find that out of total imports into ported fcom. the United States of America. In Coghlan the particulars for that commodity are not given. That fact convinces me that New South Wales is not growing, sufficient for her own requirements.. Coghlan gives the value of brooms and brushware imported into New South Wales at £38,000. The total acreage of millet in New South Walesi n 1S99 was only 1,600 acres. I shall vote for giving a reasonable amount of assistance to",48,Pairs

I feel convinced that ultimately we shall he able to raise the whole amount quired for tlie manufacture of brooms in our midst, and that we shall not have to pay one cent more per lb. for the commodity than we piy now. There will likewise be a greater equality in price and not such extreme fluctuations. The growth of millet requiring intense cultivation will give employment to a considerable number of people.

Our natural conditions for the growing of millet cannot be surpassed. The successful establishment of itscultivation is within the bounds of probability. Surely, under such conditions as we possess, and within two years at the outside, we shall not have these extreme fluctuations in the value of the raw material for the broom-making industry. A t the give assistance to the industry. may, perhaps, at the outset, slightly increase the cost of brooms, but the individual buyer will not find that increase I do not think 20 per cent, a very severe tax upon him. It will be the means of giving employment to a considerable number of people, and it must be of this particular article reremembered that in addition to millet beingused for broom-making, the seed is also used for food, while the oil obtained from it is used largely as a substitute for linseed oil, when procurable at a reasonable rate. I consider that it will be procurable at a reasonable rate under these conditions, and, therefore, I shall support anything like a reasonable duty. sure honourable members have listened with interest to the honourable member for Moira. He spoke about a home market for the farmers, and if that could be assured does the honourable it would be a very good thing. One would have imagined from what the honorable mem-' ber said, that the cultivation of broom millet was likely to prove an important industry, and lead to a reliable home market for the farmer. I find that the quantity of broom millet used in Victoria last year is said to have been between6,000and7,000tons. And that quantity. Assuming, however, that the whole of Australia used broom corn on that basis, it would only give employment to 560 farmers, each cultivating not less than ten acres of millet. The cultivation of less than ten acres each would not provide them with a livelihood. I am not aware of the climatic conditions that limit the cultivation of millet, but I assume it can he grown from the north of New South Wales, at. any rate, down to the south of Victoria. No doubt it could be grown as high up as Rockhampton, and probably higher. Practically, then, if the whole of Australia were to use broom millet at the rate I have named, the result would be only to provide employment for 560 farmers throughout the Commonwealth. If this inordinate duty is placed upon broom millet, it will lure a number of men into the cultivation of millet and the first blow will be struck at the unfortunate man who makes brooms. He can derive no possible benefit from the duty, because, if it is true, as the honourable member for Moira has said, that this will only raise the price of broom millet for a time, it will only raise the price of same time this duty will brooms themselves for a time.

Therefore, there is no protection given to the broom-maker under this proposal. As to the growth of broom millet, it is only a minor industry, and at the outside it is not going to supply that all-present and everpressing need for the farmer to find something into which to put his industry, his capital, and his labour, and secure a definite and assured return. If this duty would do that, I am sure honourable members would vote for it. It does not appear to me that it dition of the negroes in America engaged will do anything of the sort. compliment honourable members on the .other side upon their consistency. They are free traders to the backbone, and, although they do speak occasionally in sympathetic terms of the primary producer, they are not prepared to go beyond expressions of sympathy. There has been an attempt, especially in Victoria, to rouse the farmers against the present Government, on the ground that it is not prepared to assist them in any regard, while, on the other hand, it isr taxing everything they use. An attempt has been made to delude the farmer into the belief that he is not going to get anything out of this Tariff', and now a further attempt is being made to prove that assertion by taking away from him the protection which the Government are prepared to give him. The State Government of Victoria agreed to a duty of 10 per cent, being placed upon this product in 1895. It was moved from the then Opposition, and only seven or eight of the staunchest free-traders voted against it, while a large number of honourable members who called themselves free traders, but who desired to help those who were endeavouring to wring a subsistence from the soil, voted for it. Though the growth of this broom corn millet has increased, it has not in Victoria increased to anything like proportions which enable it to take possession of the home market. In New South ""Walesi t has maintained the position it occupied some six or eight years ago. It is claimed that it is due to the magnificent climate they enjoy, and the natural advantages they possess, that the farmers of New South Wales have been able to maintain their production of broom-corn millet; but honourable members opposite, who have told us this, have said nothing as to the social condition of those who are growing the product. They do not tell us that the farmers in New South Wales have made fortunes out of this product, in competing against the outside world, including as it does in this case the black labour of America, because it is in the Southern States of America, and by black labour that the imported broom-corn milletisgrown. Honourable members opposite have not told us the condition of the men who have cultivated these 1,600 acres in New'South Wales, nor have they said that it is any better than the' conin the same occupation. They have been subjected to the competition of tliis inferior class of labour, and have not been able to reap the advantage that they may reap when placed in a betterposition by theimpositionof such a duty as the Government here propose: The amount grown in New South Wales is considerable, but the amount grown in Victoria is nothing like what it ought to be. I regret to state that the Agricultural department in Victoria is far behind that of New South Wales; but here they offered a bonus ; in order to encourage the growth of this product, not altogether on account of the finished product, but on account of the value of broom-corn millet as a fodder ; because it produces in some districts no less than three crops from the one sowing. It s value, therefore, to the communit}' at large', as well as to the agriculturist, cannot be over-estimated. Some of the northern portions of Victoria are admirably adapted for the growth of this millet; but I admit that in New South Walesi t can be grown far better than in this State because of the better natural conditions. land also. honourable member, and I am glad to say that it can be grown there without black labour; and"" if persons engaged in the growth of it there receive sufficient encouragement from this committee, they will be able to compete against that produced by black labour. the extent they will be encouraged to do, if",50,Pairs

' I may say that the sneer about big estates is happily in Victoria justified only in the past. We have very few large estates here now, and they are gradually being cut up through the action of the Government of the State of Victoria, who have been anxious to encourage people to settle upon the land, and more anxious to keep upon the land those already settled there. cannot, except in very favoured localities, become the sole product of any farmer's holding. As has been justly said by the honourable member for West Sydney, it is a minor crop; but these minor crops frequently keep the farmer from starvation, when he finds that his main crop has been a failure. No honourable member who has had any experience of a rural district would ask a farmer to confine the whole of his attention to one crop, or, as he would put it, "" to put all his eggs into one basket."" We have here an opportunity of encouraging men to grow a crop which will have a ready sale in a steady home market, and which will add, not only to their wealth, but to the wealth of the community. This cannot be done under a 10 per cent, duty, because a 10 per cent, duty failed to do it in Victoria. that is the position we ought to take up if I , therefore, think that the Government proposal is a wise one. We are told, that those engaged in the industry in New South Wales ask for this protection, and they probably know their own business better than some honourable members on the other side. I trust the committee will agree to the Government proposal. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) -Honor able members opposite have been telling us what they would like to do for the farmer ; but I do not think that this particular duty is going to do a great deal for him, though it may have some effect in one or two small centres. I would like to remind honourable members that to-day we have hundreds of Victorian farmers leaving this paradise of protection and coming up to Queensland, looking for land to settle there. I am very pleased to see them come, as they make good colonists, and are amongst the best farmers we have. protection. MrM c DONALD I may tell the honourable member that they look upon much of this kind of assistance as pure sham. If , instead of trying to assist them in this wa}', an attempt were made to make the revenue Tariff as low as possible, and force the States into direct taxation, which would break up some of the large landed properties, and give the farmers an opportunity of getting land at a reasonable price, they would then be afforded some assistance.

MrM c DONALD I had no intention of doing so; but we have been told that this duty is a good thing for the farmers, and I wish to show that it is not, that it is merely a sham, and that there are other and better methods of assisting the farmers. I maintain that I am quite justified in saying that we wish to assist the farmers. I deny that this is the best way to assist the farmers, and I say that the best way is to break up the large landed estates, so that farmers may have an opportunity of settling upon their own land. Isi t not a well-known fact that if a farmer wishes to get good land in Victoria, he has to pay from £ 3 0 to £ 5 0 an acre for it ? Where men are compelled to pay such a price for land, it is no wonder that they should need some artificial' assistance. If we take a course of action which will give them land at a reasonable price we shall do far more to assist them than we shall do by the imposition of this paltry duty. This industry has never been considered of great importance, even in Victoria, where the duty has been only 10 per cent, ad valorem, while in other States the article has been admitted free.

If we were to adopt the old Victorian duty of 10per cent., we should be doing, better. There is no State in the Commonwealth where broom corn millet grows more freely than in Queensland. But although it grows almost wild there, no advantage has been taken of that fact to establish any great industry there. I know that there is not much difficulty in growing the article in Queensland, because I have grown it myself, and it does not need much labour.

According to 'their own estimate, the Government expect to receive from New South Wales on this particular item, £1,S76, as against the £30,906 I have mentioned. Thus we have the startling result that by the operation of this Tariff the Government have of set purpose determined to reduce the imports into New South Wales by 94 per cent. to do. and that applies throughout Australia. I ask honourable members who desire to be true to the pledges made before this Parliament met-wh o believe that we should have "" revenue without destruction,"" and that we cannot or should not have either extreme free-trade or extreme protection-wha t they think of a duty which on the very figures of the Government practically annihilates imports ?

In the next place I take my stand upon the question "" A r e we trying to obtain a revenue while at the same time giving incidental protection to the different industries?"" It is a farce to talk for one moment about a Tariff' giving incidental protection when from the very figures of the Government it is abundantly clear that we are practically placing a prohibitive duty upon these articles.

This is a monstrous state of things. In the view of honourable members who have entered tliis House with a fair idea of compromise, with the desire to do what is right for United Australia, and with an inclination -suc h as we have had in New South Wales-to make enormous sacrifices for the sake of union, the present action of the Ministiy strikes a severe Wow at their own goo'd faith.

I do not move for the omission of the item, although as a free trader I am opposed to the imposition of any duty upon these articles.

He tells us that the proposal of the Government is monstrous. But the figures which he has quoted prove that the existing state of affairs in a continent which ought to produce these articles is monstrous. I find that in 1899 the Commonwealth imported 1,000,000 lbs. of butter from beyond its own limits, 800,000 lbs. of which went into New South Wales. It also imported 2,600,000 lbs. of cheese, of which 2,400,000 went into New South Wales. Honourable members have beentold that all that the Government are doing for the producers is a mere sham. Unquestionably, if there is one item in . regard to which we should assist our producers, it is this particular item. Isi t not monstrous that a countiy like ours should be importing such an enormous quantity of butter and cheese ? Cani t be urged for one moment that we cannot make cheese good enough to be consumed by any of our Australian people? Those who desire to import rich cheeses from England and elsewhere should undoubtedly be made to pay duty upon them. I have no sympathy with those who, in regard to these particular lines, will insist upon having the imported article.

The latter duty is nearer to the proposal of the honourable member for Wentworth than is the proposal of the Government. Yet, the Treasurer says it would be disgraceful if we did not impose a duty of 3d. Again, are not these industries assisted by the mere fact of federation? itself has benefited agriculture and kindred industries.

249,Mr Thomson,"Was not the Treasurerso large a duty ? If 2d. was a sufficient protection in Victoria before federation, the other States cannot obtain in competition with her more than that protection, no matter what is put upon the statute book. If Victoria Could maintain a successful industry under lower duties than those proposed in the present Tariff, we cannot give a larger protection than the rate at which it will pay to produce these articles in the most suitable market. Under these circumstances I maintain that if the proposal of the honourable member for Wentworth errs at all, it errs on the side of proposing too high a duty. Certainly the amendment does not warrant the statement of the Treasurer, that it would be a shame if it were accepted and if a duty of 3d. were not imposed. what extraordinary, when an honest attempt is being made for the first time to give the New South Wales farmers protection, that the strongest opposition should come from that State. The honourable member for North Sydney is very tender about tlie New Zealand farmer, and does not wish to shut out his productions; but apparently he has very little sympathy indeed for the farmers of his own State. The acting leader of the Opposition seems to imagine that if protective duties are imposed no revenue will come in. How, then, does he account for this extraordinary f a c t : Out of a total importation of £18,000,000 into Victoria before the Commonwealth was inaugurated; goods to the value of £12,000,000 came in free, and articles to the value of only £6,000,000 were taxable, but, nevertheless, with a protective Tariff, a Customs revenue of from £2,300,000 to £2,500,000 per annum was raised ? That fact is sufficient to show that under a protective Tariff a sum equal to what is required can be raised in all the States. We have had duties upon the products of the dairies in the various States, with the exception of New South Wales, to whose position I shall refer presently. In Victoria the duty has been 2d. per lb. on butter, and 3d. per lb. on cheese ; in QueensThese figures relate to the primary proland, 3d. per lb. on butter, and 4d. pei lb. on cbeese; in South Australia, 2d. per lb. on butter, 4d. per lb. on cheese; and in Tasmania and Western Australia, 2d. pei 1 lb. on butter, and 2d. per lb. on cheese. What has been the result of that protection? I have before me a return of the imports of butter and cheese into the various States of the Commonwealth, for the least three years, from countries entirely outside the Commonwealth. During that period the imports of butter into New South Wales, where there has been no duty, amounted to 1,583,256 lbs. In Queensland, 'where there was a duty of 3d. per lb., only 76 lbs. of butter were imported. In Victoria, the importations totalled 209,610 lbs.; in South Australia, 38,489 lbs.; and in Western Australia, 159,738 lbs.; while in Tasmania, with a smaller duty, there was an importation of 642,385 lbs. Eor the last three years there has been a total importation of 2,583,554 lbs. of butter into the six States, and the extraordinary fact is that where the duties have been highest the importations have been lowest. The people have' supplied their own wants, and the farmers have had the benefit. Let us now take tlie figures relating to the importations of cheese for the last three years. In Victoria they were 369,492 lbs-. In New South Wales, which is just as capable of producing good cheese as is Victoria, the farmers have been deprived of an opportunity of producing it, owing to the absence of a duty, and there has been a total importation there of 6,063,932. lbs. In Queensland, where the duty of 4d. per lb. prevailed, there was an importation of only 55,064 lbs. The importations into South Australia totalled 53,822 lbs.; into Western Australia 378731 lbs., and into Tasmanial81,3051bs.,the total for the six States being 7,102,351 lbs. of cheese and 2,583,554 lbs. of butter. In all, 9,685,905 lbs. of butter and cheese were imported during the period named. Where the duty has been imposed the farmer has reaped the benefit; where there has been no duty he has been robbed of his natural right to produce for his own State. These facts ought to show that the duty we now propose to impose in the interests of the farmer is not a sham one. If a poll were taken of the farmers of New South. Walesi t would be found that not five per cent, would vote against the imposition of a duty on such items as preserved milk, butter and cheese. ducers, about whom the honourable members of the Opposition have had so much to say, and yet when they have an opportunity of giving them substantial and genuine assistance we find that they oppose the proposal to help them _ with all the vigour they possess.",56,Geokge Turner W E Sent New Credit Is Never Given For That Federation
250,Mr Mccoll (Echuca),"It is somemember for Echuca seems to be very much concerned about the interests of the New South Wales farmer, and he has asserted that this is an honest attempt to assist the farmers of that State. It is marvellous to find him coming to the assistance of the farmers of a neighbouring State so quickly, in view of the fact that some five or six months ago he belonged to a party in favour of imposing an ' import duty on daily products of 2d. per lb. on butter, and 3d. per lb. on cheese, which, of course, was against the New South Wales farmers. It is pleasing to find that this change is one result of the union.

266,Mr Joseph Cook,"I rise to order, andhimself to the question now before the -committee. The CHAIRMAN speech is not now before the committee, but the item butter and cheese. MrL . E. GROOM I submit that the industries affected by this proposal are industries which for their proper establishment require the imposition of a protective duty. The true policy of protection has been applied to them, and in this respect we have to consider that we are legislating for the different States, and that in those States certain policies have been adopted.' In Queensland, for instance, the butter and cheese industry was created in two ways, and under what I think the honourable and learned member for In d i -would say was a scientific system of protec-tion. In the first place, a duty was put iupon the article at a time when, in Queensland, we practically produced no cheese; iand, at the same time, the Governanent introduced a proper system of scientific -instruction, so that those engaged in the industiy might be taught proper methods -of production. The course followed has -been justified, because, throughout the whole of the Darling Downs district-in ;places like Yangan, outside Warwick, and other places-the people are producing cheese equal in quality to anything that can be produced elsewhere. We want to con-tinue this, and the time is not yet come for the removal of the duty upon either Tbutter or cheese. '.States are now combined in one Commonwealth, and we have not yet arrived at the -stage when the local market is entirely -supplied by the locally grown article. Until that happens the protection to these -industries should be continued. The Agricultural departments of the various States -will do their best to increase the value -of the protected products, and I hope the ;Government will be firm in insisting -upon the proposal they have made. MrA . C. GROOM (Elinders) The -dairying industry of Victoria was certainly not built up by protection. It was built up first of all by the bonus which -was' given by the Government ten years .ago. The bonus and the departmental -dairies which went to the various centres to teach the people the art of making butter under the factoiy system were the means of the industry growing to -the extent it has done, and developing an 22 o enormous export trade. Tlie Treasurer ga ve some figures to make out that New The Maitland South Wales is a large importer of butter. On turning up Coghlan, at page 496 I find that New South Wales did not import anybutter in 1899, but exported in that year over 7,000,000 lbs. of butter to the United Kingdom, showing distinctly that any butter which happened to come within her borders was not for her *own use, but for export. The sui*plus amount of butter which was. raised in New South Wales in1899 was 4,500,000 lbs., but she exported to the United Kingdom 7,000,000 lbs.,' showing a' difference of 2,500,000 lbs.; which certainly was imported from some other colony, landed, and re-exported. That, I think, shows where the 'New Zealand butter went to. port butter from New Zealand to send it to England. Mr A. C. GROOM -If New South Wales had a surplus of 4,500,000 lbs. of butter in 1899, and exported in that year over 7,000,000 lbs., the difference must havecomefrom some other colony; and as she imported butter from New Zealand only, it follows that it must have come from that colony. In regard to cheese, Victoria is an exporter to the extent of over 600,000 lbs. a year. Therefore the duty is no good tb the Victorian farmer. He does not want a duty of 3d. per l b . ; . he would be quite satisfied with one-half that duty, which The whole of the would be over 25 per cent, ad valorem. I do not think that any import duty should exceed 25 per cent, ad valorem, and therefore I shall vote for the reduction of the duty to l ^ d . per lb. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) -This debate reminds me forcibly of a-similar one in the Victorian Parliament some years ago. We had the importers then telling the House that, if we imposed a duty on butter and cheese, or any other products of the farm and' dairy, we should send up the prices and k i ll a valuable trade. What has been the result of the duties then imposed? In Victoria the producers have, not only supplied local requirements, but have become very large exporters. The productis cheaper; the prices are steadier; and, of course, the producers must necessarily be much better off. New South Wales, which perhaps could produce more than any other under wise legislation, is the only State which has been importing largely. .",59,Geokge Turner W E Sent New Credit Is Never Given For That Federation

One of these manufacturers had been supplied with therawmaterial by an importer, to whom, owing to the unprofitable nature of the business, he owed £5,000. Just about this time the Victorian Parliament were engaged in revising the Tariff, and it was proposed to do away with the duty of £4 per ton on the manufactured article. The manager for the importer pointed out to him that if the duty were removed' he would never get his £5,000 back, and his principal, like his manager, a free-trader, agreed with him that the duty must be retained. manager then suggested that they might induce Parliament to retain the duty by playing on the belief of certain protectionists that protection had the effect of making things cheaper. Mr Trenwith ferred to as a protectionist who held, this view, and it was agreed between the importer and his manager that they must set him going on that line. then presented to Parliament figures show-, ing that some years before, when there was no protective duty on the manufactured "" * article, it was being sold in the Victorian market,at duty was imposed the price had been reduced to £12 per ton. He was also able to show that during the same period the price of. the article in Europe had only been reduced to the extent of £1 per ton, and it was, therefore, made abundantly clear that the protective duty in Victoria had resulted in a very considerable reduction in price. The proposal to abolish the duty was abandoned, and the importer secured his end. Of course there 'was a key to this, but it was. not supplied to the members of the Victorian manager regarded it as their duty to find out what the key was, and he had simply supplied them with the facts of the case in the way best suited to support his own pretensions. had been two manufacturers of the same article, and that they had been engaged in cut-throat competition, with the result Mr Thomas. that one had lost £5,000, and the other some £20,000. The. manufacturer, in whose operations the importer was interested, placedhimself in communication with He mentioned to me that, some his rival, and an agreement was arrived at were prothat immediately the Tariff was passed, they would raise their prices. The result was, that within a fortnight of the passing of the Tariff, the price of the manufactured article was raised by £ 1 , within a month it was increased by £ 2 a ton, and in a very short time the manufacturers' were receiving the f u l l price. Within two years the importer got his £5,000, and the rival manufacturer cleared off his £20,000. I was quite convinced after hearing this story that protection does sometimes result in reducing prices. If there is an industry which does not require a protective duty, it is surely the butter and cheese industry. We although, ought to be able to produce those commodities in Australia without' the help of The protection. We are prepared to allow the cow, which I suppose is the raw material of butter and cheese, to come in free, I am not here as the agent of any importer. I have no interest in any importing busiwas reness.' I wish I had ; I should like to have a interest in something of the kind But I stand here simply on behalf of the consumer, and I say that the people The manager of this country, with all the opportunities they have, and with all the natural facilities open to them for producing butter and cheese, ought to be able to do so. It is. shameful that any farmer should ask for £18 per ton, but that after the a single penny of protection for such articles. In the name of heaven, if we are to have protection for butter and cheese, why not for wool, and sheep, and cattle 1 I shall vote for the amendment of the acting leader of the Opposition, but I feel inclined to ask him to accept the proposal to reduce the duty to 2d. I do so, because I think the Opposition will be defeated upon the amendment, whereas if we accept the 2d. as a compromise, the effect will be to reduce the proposal of the Government, by knocking off I d . on butter.

The importer's Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN The Government will not consent to a compromise in the way of a duty of 2d. on both butter and cheese. likely to. win, I would urge the honourable member for Wentworth to stick to his proposal ; in fact, I should be in favour of ^ knocking off the 3d. entirely. But, as",62,Geokge Turner W E Sent New Credit Is Never Given For That Federation
285,The Fact Was That: There Mr Thomas,"If the Opposition wereprobably we can win on the proposal to strike off I d ., I think it is worthwhile to do so. honourable member for Gippsland spoke a gjod deal about compromise. The proposal of the Treasurer now is to impose a duty of 2d. on butter and 3d. on cheese. that. stand that the right honourable gentleman Victorian duties; but I would point out that such rates' are no compromise as between the free-trade State of New South Wales, and the highly protected State of Victoria. It is not compromise to ask New South Wales to accept the Victorian duties. The Treasurer referred to the. acting leader of the Opposition as having spoken with earnestness on this question. It is only natural for those who come from New South Wales, and who have been accustomed to obtaining nearly all their goods free of duty, to be scornful when they find that butter and cheese, which are foods of the -people, are to be taxed to such an extent, and that these high duties are called compromises. I ask my Victorian friends to look at the facts from that point of view. Personally, I believe that the export of butter from Victoria would have grown up without any bonuses at all. I am willing to admit that the butter bonuses were the only bonuses in Victoria that did any good whatever. But, nevertheless, I believe that the industiy would have arisen without them, just as the frozen meat industry has done. I quite agree with the honourable member for Barrier-that if our farmers cannot by their industry and brains produce a food that can be so easily produced in Australia, without the aid of a protective duty, it is a shame to them. I speak as the representative of a large number of farmers. I have shares in two butter factories, and have two brothers engaged in the dairying industry. Therefore, I am entitled to speak on the question. I should prefer to see no duty at a l l ; but, if there is to be a duty oh butter, and cheese, I trust that the Minister will see his way to give way on the cheese as well as on tlie butter item, and let the duty on both be 2d. in iny hand some figures from the report of the Registrar-General on agricultural and pastoral industries for the State of Queensland for 1900. It is issued by the Queensland Government. This document shows that the export of butter from New South Wales for the year 1900 amounted to 10,692,000 lbs., whilst Victoria exported 36,237,469 lbs. The value in the former case was £447,982, and the value of the butter exported from Victoria was £1,404,179; or nearly £1,000,000 more. In Victoria the industry had been stimulated and encouraged by a system of bonuses. Butter consents to it . Those are the came into New South Wales free, whilst in Victoriai t had to pay a duty. In Queensland butter also had to pay a duty, and the result has been that Queensland in 1900 produced 8,682,389 lbs. of butter, and of that she exported only 1,389,250 lbs. Most honourable members know that a few years ago we had to pay a much higher price for butter of inferior quality than we now pay for an excellent article. We cannot doubt that the production of a good class of butter has been stimulated by the protective duties which have operated in the past. T find also that the consumption of cheese within the Commonwealth represents, per head of the population, only aboutone-fifthof the consumption in European countries. We consume a little over 4 lbs. per head, while in European countries the consumption is between 20 lbs. and 30 lbs. per head. I am convinced that it is to our interests to keep out foreign products in order that local production may be stimulated. I hope that the duties laid down in the schedule will be adhered to, because this is one of the most important industries in the Commonwealth, and one which, if properly encouraged, will assume very large dimensions indeed. ception to the remark of the honourable member for Gippsland that honourable members upon this side of the chamber are merely importers' agents. Because he and a fewothers have formed themselves into a countiy party, they apparently imagine that no one represents the farming industries of Australia except themselves. But I would point out that there are a good many honourable members here who represent farming constituencies in New South Wales. No one recognises more'' than I do that we must meet here with; a view to effecting a fair compromise in respect of our fiscal faiths.

If he would also agree to reduce the duty upon cheese to a similar amount, I think he would be making a fair compromise. one who knows anything at all about the dairying industry will contend that it has been established by protective duties. New South Wales it has been built up into a magnificent national industry without the aid of any duty whatever. time that duties were levied upon butter and cheese in that State, the industry got into such a very low state that the people of the south coast and Camden district, which was the only district in which butter was being produced, had to look to some other means in order to achieve prosperity. improved machinery was .imported from Denmark, notably the De Laval separator. Then Victoria sent some to ascertain what the people in New South Wales were doing to develop the industry, and upon their return to this State the Victorians began to copy their example. It is erroneously supposed that the butter bonus which was granted in Victoria in order to foster the industry, benefited As a matter of fact it found its way into the pockets of speculators. I know of three Sydney speculators who purchased Victorian butter, shipped it to England, and pocketed £1,500 profit as a result. was established by virtue of necessity. rejoice to know that we have in the dairying industry oneof the national industries of Australia, which is destined to be second to none upon this continent. ministration have remembered the dairy farmers only to tax them. proposal is put forward to gull them into the belief that the Government are helping the industry in which they are engaged. According to the honourable member for Echuca, the Commonwealth has imported 2,583,554 lbs. of butter within the past three years, principally from New Zealand. But we exported from the Commonwealth during the same period over 53,000,000 lbs. farmers, efficient instructors should be sent out amongst them to educate them in the most scientific methods of production, and proper agents or competent Mr Fuller. has proposed a sent to find the nature of the markets, and the best means of' capturing them.

Yet we are told that we are representatives of the importers in Sydney.

As being on this side, I may tell honourable members for their edification that I control a business connected with the produce and dairying industry of this country, and the export of primary products, which amounts to hundreds of thousands more per annum than my importing business.
