On Tuesday, 20 January the Prime Minister carried out a diversionary tactic, not surprisingly, which became not just a diversionary tactic but a divisive tactic by attacking public schools, teachers in those schools and, by implication, students and their families in those schools with his disgraceful attack on the so-called valueless systems in our state schools and the provision of antiseptic values. He charged that our schools are filled with politically correct teachers and that our curriculum is charged with political correctness. On 26 January on a Current Affair, Ray Martin asked the Prime Minister: Why did you begin this year with such divisive comments about public education? John Howard replied: Nothing divisive. I was just asked a question as to why I thought an increasing number of people were wanting to send their children to independent schools and I gave some of the reasons. I didn’t make a generalised attack on government schools. Ray Martin went on: What did you mean though ... in terms of ‘antiseptic’ and what are the values missing from government schools?

288,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (4.05 P.m.),"I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3)Well, you know, people come to me and say all sorts of things. AndI mentioned some of them. I don’t have time on this programme to go through all of them and I’ll develop some of the things during the week. Ray Martin asked: It looks like you’ve thrown a bit of a cracker and then stepped away. The Prime Minister replied: No, no. I never throw crackers and step away. I mean ... what I said I meant. Don’t think for a minute that I’m stepping away from what I said. Ray Martin then asked: What’s antiseptic mean? The Prime Minister said, ‘Well, you know’ and on it went. Ray Martin finally said: But don’t you seriously think that government schools don’t have values? The Prime Minister replied that he did not have time to go through it. SoI spent some of my own time to find out what the Prime Minister meant by valueless schools, by political correctness in the curriculum and by the provision of an antiseptic atmosphere in our schools. I looked for proof. One of the values that I think is very important is that you provide evidence in a reasoned debate for your argument. Has the Prime Minister said anything since? Not a single word. There has not been a single word to substantiate the disgraceful charges that he levels: ‘Some people talk to me and I have to report what they say.’ We can all bet what happened. He called the reporters in and said, ‘Listen, cop this. It might divert attention away from the fact university places are not available to students.’ So it is about diverting attention, making education divisive and using it as a diversionary tactic from the higher education agenda. Of course, on cue, came the Prime Minister’s willing acolytes, who are on the Right on anything dealing with so-called values in public education. Of course, the member for Gippsland popped in with some really edifying comments that education in public schools is valuefree, hostile or, at best, apathetic to Australian heritage and values-whatever that meant. At this stage, the member for Gippsland was the acting federal education minister. Then there was the member for Warringah-the boxing monk-but you would expect that. I am sad to say that the member for Herbert rushed in with his unsubstantiated comments and Senator Lightfoot rushed in, as he does, to protect the Prime Minister from anyone who might possibly be harassing his presence or his views. But it did cause division, not just in the community but also in his own party. That is not something the Prime Minister is used to, but we have seen examples of it more recently. It caused division because enlightened persons such as the members for Adelaide, Hindmarsh, Pearce and Macquarie came out and basically said, ‘This is arrant nonsense.’ To claim that public schools are valueless is the same as saying that private schools are valueless-arrant nonsense. They at least were prepared to stand up publicly and say so. So it was not just the superannuation meeting or the Clarke report on veteran entitlements that saw divisions in the Liberal Party caucus room coming to the fore; the same applied to this comment on public education by the Prime Minister. I acknowledge the comments by those members of the coalition who were prepared to stand up to the statements of arrant nonsense by the Prime Minister and those other members. I mentioned. MAIN COMMITTEE I thought it was best reflected by the cartoonists-as is their wont. In the Australian on 20 January 2004 there was a cartoon which I know I cannot show at the moment but I will try to describe it. It showed our Prime Minister with a sign behind him saying, ‘Howard’s way-a federal government nation-building project.’ In front of him is an earthquake fault line, and there is a little sign on the other side of the highway heading off in the distance saying, ‘Divided country’. That is exactly what those comments did. They were needlessly hurtful, silly comments not substantiated by evidence. It was not just me who was disgusted by those comments. Many people throughout Australia-even principals of private schools-thought what a worthless debate the Prime Minister had brought about. I attended a number of school excellence ceremonies and of course the Prime Minister’s comments featured at those ceremonies. People were disgusted and hurt by the comments. I would like to quote from an address at an evening of excellence at one of the schools in my electorate of Braddon-and a very good school at that. The principal said: I felt that tonight, of all nights, I couldn’t let their comments go unanswered or our students and parents think that the schools that have produced the wonderful young people we will see tonight are in any way sub-standard or without values. Fancy having to have this discussion in the first place. The principal went on to analyse why they believed the Prime Minister made those comments and said: If that is the casethat is, to bring about division and diversionI thought I would take the time tonight to explain the values that I think underlie the academic and personal relationships we have at (our school) and ask the question ‘if not these values, then which?’ The Prime Minister was asked several times: ‘What values are you talking about? What values don’t exist in our public schools that you believe should exist?’ Of course he did not answer. The principal went on: Our primary concerns ... are, I think, fivefold and they relate closely to Howard Gardner’s view of schools. We are concerned with the truth. Not the truth that gave us ‘children overboard’, ‘weapons of mass destruction’ and now ‘valueless schools’-but how we determine what is false or misleading and, importantly, what we do with that knowledge. Secondly, we are concerned with beauty and it is from this concern we model not just our arts curriculum but our deep concern and empathy for the environment and the planet, surely the most beautiful and fragile of things that we have in our care. Thirdly, we are concerned with morality-what is good and what is right. This is not the morality of politics but the morality of how people should be treated and treat others. He goes on to say, fourthly: We are concerned with educational excellence, not only of the academic elite but of all students. This comes from our deeply held views that teachers make a difference and all students can learn. Finally, we are concerned, in State schools with equality. We take everyone into our state school system. He says that at their school: … alongside the students you will meet tonightand it was a night of excellence, I would remind youwith TE scores as good as any in the country, you will find blind students, Downs Syndrome students, homeless students, students with mental illness and physical impairment. You will find students who are poor, students who are rich, students who are black and students who are white. In this melting pot, whose cultural values are the ones we must follow and explore and support? You and I know that we MAIN COMMITTEE cannot favour one set of cultural values over another but what we can do is support the universal values that make up a decent, just and humane society. We will not play the politicians values game where we somehow favour a set of values held by a small political sub-set. We are concerned with weightier things … with truth, beauty, morality, excellence and equality, and these threads have run through the education that every student here tonight has received. They own these values because they are also the values of their parents, their relatives, their churches, their friends and their employers. They are also the values of each and every one of their teachers. That was in part the address that was given that night in response to the Prime Minister’s arrant nonsense on 20 January 2004. But, when I think about the charge levelled by the Prime Minister and then by the member for Gippsland and his minions, I say to myself, ‘I have had the privilege of being involved in public education for 25 years of my working life.’ Were the institutions that I was involved in, the students, the curriculum and my colleagues valueless? Were we politically correct? Did we not teach what we believed was right and wrong and at least teach people to make their own decisions about what was right and wrong? Were we apathetic to the Australian heritage and values? The answer is no, definitely not. I did a bit of research, as you do on these matters, particularly when you are made anxious by them. Where better to go than to the government, because it preaches values and principles and traditions-on and on? Of course, our current education minister is very good at that. He just parted with $300,000-odd for values and principles and civics in education-good; so be it. There was a values education study published in November 2003. It had a top 10 hit parade of values. Tolerance and understanding, respect, responsibility, social justice, excellence, care, inclusion and trust, honesty, freedom and being ethical were the top 10 values. The night of excellence report by the principal of my local school, it was replete with that. In that school they do not need to read the values education study of November 2003 to find out what these values might be. I looked at the education website in my own state. I said to myself: ‘I have been out of the system for a while. What exactly is underpinning the curriculum? What is underpinning the important social values in our schools today? What does it mean to be publicly educated in Tasmania today?’ WhatI found on their web site is a really interesting program called Essential Learnings which was kicked off in December 2000-not November 2003 but December 2000-by our then state education minister, the Hon. Paula Wriedt. I looked to that to see what the purposes of the essential learnings were and what the values were that underpinned these essential learnings. AndI said to myself, ‘WillI find values there? WillI find principles that I can subscribe to and that I believe reflect the so-called Australian tradition and values?’ So what did I find? It says: We are guided by this core set of values. This core set of values that underline our essential learnings includes: Connectedness, which includes developing a sense of community through friendship, care, compassion, cooperation, acceptance, belonging and sharing. I have ticked it for pretty good values-Aussie values too. Another core value is: Resilience, which includes recognising strengths and maximising potential; developing selfmanagement, self-confidence and self-respect; and nurturing optimism, perseverance and well-being. Tick! Another is: MAIN COMMITTEE Achievement, which includes attaining personal success in a range of human endeavours, pursuing individual excellence and displaying pride and satisfaction in personal achievement. Tick! Another is: Creativity, which includes valuing original ideas, demonstrating enterprise and innovation, and engaging with and responding to the aesthetic qualities of the natural and constructed world. There is no economic bottom line there, but aesthetic values-tick! Another is integrity. Now, what does this mean? ... which includes acting honestly, ethically, and consistently. Tick! Another is: Responsibility, which includes accepting both individual and collective responsibility and contributing to sustainable community development. So values regarding others as well as values regarding the self. And the final value is: Equity, which includes developing tolerance and a commitment to social justiceIs this the problem area?acknowledging diversity, respecting difference and encouraging distinctiveness. Now, that is under threat. It is almost politically correct now not to be tolerant of others. But I gave that a tick, because I think equity is pretty fundamental in our character. So what were the purposes of all these essential learnings? I thought I found some values there, long before the values education study of November 2003. The purposes behind the essential learnings are: Learning to relate, participate and care ... … … … Learning to live full, healthy livesin every sense of the word. They continue: Learning to create purposeful futuresbeing part of the future, not just for yourself but with others and for others. They continue: Learning to act ethicallynot simply knowing what is right and wrong, but being able to justify it and able to justify moral practices. That is a skill. They continue: Learning to learn. That is absolutely essential to being a participating citizen. The final purpose is: Learning to think, know and understand. These are the purposes underpinning the curriculum of essential learnings in Tasmania, based on the values of connectedness, resilience, achievement, creativity, integrity, responsibility and equity. Is this the valueless, politically correct world in public education that the Prime Minister spoke of? Well, if this is valueless, then I am proud to be part of it, and I am proud for both of my sons to have gone through this system of public education. The arrant nonsense that was peddled by the Prime Minister is a disgrace and an embarrassment as is that of all those minions that joined him. We had in the House yesterday from the member for Sturt the feigned indignation which the government are renowned for-the wringing of hands and beating of breasts on anything MAIN COMMITTEE that is pursued by this side. And at this stage, the member for Sturt was attacking the member for Jagajaga. Listen to this hypocrisy! The member for Sturt said: The member for Jagajaga should come into this House and apologise for the fear campaign that she, hand in hand with the AEU, has waged, a campaign that has upset parents and children and created division in the community-and all for what? Grubby short-term political gain. And on it went. Fancy, they: ... upset parents and children and created division in the community-and all for what? Grubby shortterm political gain. The Prime Minister should come into the House and apologise to the people of Australia-to the students, parents, teachers and educators involved in public education and, indeed, in private education-because the implication was that private schools are value-full and public schools are not. He is a disgrace and he should apologise to the people of Australia. bills. But Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 are, I think, the last will and testament of the Howard government. What a dreary little set of documents they are! As I have observed previously while speaking about appropriation legislation, this government takes the prize for the dullest legislation program I think I have ever experienced in my time in this House. Since the government was re-elected in 2001, we have seen a combination of re-runs of legislation that various ministers failed to have passed in previous parliaments and some lacklustre minor legislation that really does not serve to achieve very much. If ever Australia needed a change of government and an injection of vitality and enthusiasm, it is certainly now. I have looked at what has been proposed in these bills to see if there was anything to grab the imagination-anything that would be worth debating and that was not just pandering to the dreariness of the government. Amazingly, I found an issue which did strike a chord with me. It is to do with the Australian Federal Police. The Australian Federal Police, as I am sure most of us are aware, comes under the Attorney-General’s portfolio. It has an important international role. While the $47 million equity projection proposed in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 is in relation to the deployment of the AFP in Papua New Guinea and operations in the Solomon Islands and people-trafficking issues, there is another role that the AFP is currently performing, and that is on the island of Cyprus. Since 1964 Australia has deployed police to Cyprus as part of a United Nations peacekeeping mission. Originally, it was a joint Commonwealth-state arrangement, but now it is just the AFP. Fifteen AFP personnel are currently in Cyprus contributing to the maintenance of law and order in the buffer zone between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. To give a bit more background: UNFICYP was established in March 1964 to prevent communal violence between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots after there had been a breakdown of law on the island resulting from an attempted coup by members of the national guard and a lot of fighting between the Turkish and Greek communities. The role of the organisation was later expanded to include supervision of a ceasefire between the Turkish army and the Greek Cypriot national guard. UNFICYP also includes a civil police component which is called UNCIVPOL. Australia’s commitment began in 1964 with 40 policemen of the Commonwealth Police. Police from all states were seconded to the Commonwealth Police, which became the Australian Federal Police in 1979 and had its own MAIN COMMITTEE",111,Appropriation Bill No 4 2003 2004 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 2 2003 2004
289,Mr Leo Mcleay (Watson) (4.25 P.m.),"Here we are again, with more appropriationpersonnel. The number of Australian police serving in Cyprus increased to 50 in 1967 before decreasing to 16 in 1975. In May 1988 the first policewoman began service in Cyprus, with many policewomen serving since then. As I mentioned earlier, Australia’s commitment is currently 15 AFP officers serving for a period of six months. Three Australians-Sergeant Ian Donald Ward, Sergeant Lew Thomas and Inspector Paul Hackett-have died on duty with the Australian Federal Police in Cyprus. I am sure that all members will join with me in paying tribute to these officers. There are always risks involved with this type of mission. I believe that Australia’s reputation as a peacekeeper is generally good. While three losses are three too many, I firmly believe that one could realistically have expected there to be a lot more loss of life over the almost 40 years that there has been an Australian police presence on the green line in Cyprus. That it has been contained to three is remarkable in the circumstances. These are dangerous jobs that are fulfilled by our police officers. They are not just overseas jaunts. I have had first-hand knowledge of their work, as I have visited the AFP contingent on the green line in Cyprus up at the airport and along the green line itself on three separate occasions. As I said earlier, their job is not an easy one. There have been persistent rumours in recent times that the government is considering withdrawing Australia’s AFP contingent from the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus. So strong were these rumours last year that the Cypriot community in Sydney, many of whom live in my electorate of Watson, asked me to try and discover if there was any truth behind the rumours. I wrote to the Minister for Justice and Customs in October last year seeking his advice. I pointed out how much our presence in Cyprus since 1964 has been appreciated by the people of Cyprus on both sides of the green line-which it certainly has been. I also pointed out that the overall cost to the Australian economy has been well worth it in terms of the goodwill created and the excellent reputation earned by our national peacekeepers in Cyprus. Furthermore, I told the minister that I share the concern of the Cypriot community about the future of the Australian Federal Police contingent in Cyprus and I sought his advice about the government’s intentions in that regard. For some time in the 1990s I was a member of an IPU committee looking at the Cyprus issue. As indicated earlier in my speech, I visited there a number of times, the two most recent occasions being in September 1996 as a member of a parliamentary delegation with my colleagues the member for Grayndler and the member for Adelaide and also in July 2001. While I was there then, I met the Chief of Mission of United Nations operations in Cyprus, the acting special representative of the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan. So for many years I have taken an active interest in Cyprus and in its future. ThusI was more than happy to take up the concerns of my constituents with the minister last year. The reply that I received from the minister in November 2003 confirmed the view that a review would be taking place but gave no indication of a likely time. However, the minister did say that the review would be of all options concerning the Australian contribution to UNIFCYP as well as East Timor, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. I do not want to read too much into the fact that additional funding is now being sought in these appropriation bills currently before us for the AFP deployment in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, but obviously a decision has been taken to commit additional AFP resources in those two areas. I hope this does not mean a diminution of our commitment in MAIN COMMITTEE Cyprus, particularly at the moment when for the first time after many years it seems there will soon be a resolution of the unsatisfactory situation of the divided island. A breakthrough in the United Nations in New York was reported in the Australian on 17 February this year. The article said that this breakthrough has: ... created a real chance of reuniting the island before it joins the European Union on May 1. For the first time, the two sides in Cyprus, divided since 1974, have agreed to a procedure that cannot collapse or grind to a halt. The article continued: Decisive negotiations begin this week in the capital, Nicosia, on a UN blueprint that would reunite the island in a loose federation of two largely autonomous areas with a central government. A deal would involve territory handovers and large population shifts. As members would be aware, when the island was divided in 1974 the Cypriot community of Greek descent moved to the south of the island and the people of Turkish descent moved to the north of the island into the Turkish zone that was invaded by the Turkish army. The article continued: The breakthrough came when the Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos and his Turkish Cypriot counterpart, Rauf Denktash, agreed that UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan can rule on any disputes they cannot settle before a final deal goes to separate referendums in April. Mr Annan said that there was now a real chance that before the first of May Cyprus will be reunited. US mediator Thomas Weston was even more emphatic: “It is almost certain now that there will be a settlement on the island of Cyprus.” I could not be more delighted at this news, and I certainly hope that the reports in the newspapers were not overly optimistic. There has been a long history of disputes on the island. There has been a long history of hopeful breakthroughs that do not result in anything. SoI hope that now people of goodwill on both sides-the Greek and the Turkish Cypriots-will show an equal generosity of spirit in having the matter settled, because the real hope of any solution lies with the people who live there. The ordinary people in Cyprus want a solution. The Turkish government have to come to the party and insist that they want a solution this time. If the Turkish community in the north have their way, they will reunite with their brothers and sisters in the south. We have seen very significant demonstrations in the Turkish ruled zone of Cyprus where Turkish Cypriots have said that they want to reunite the island. We have also seen a lot of Turkish Cypriots voting with their feet by leaving the island. That is not a good thing, and we need a solution. There will be a lot to forgive and a lot to try and forget, but there does need to be reconciliation. While the details might take some time to sort out, it now seems that 30 years after Turkey invaded the northern part of Cyprus there may be a resolution to the situation. It would be a tragedy for Cyprus if, on 1 May when Cyprus becomes part of the EU, only the southern part of the island, which is administered by the government of Cyprus at present, entered the union. The EU have made it quite clear that only the sovereign part of the island, governed by the Cypriot government, will become part of the EU. The people in the north of the island deserve the economic benefits that European Union membership will bring them. They have a lower standard of living than people in the southern part of the island and they have a greater need for the economic benefits which will come from Cyprus being part of the EU. The Greek Cypriot part of Cyprus-the southern part of the island-has very few natural resources. Its only major natural resource is its people and MAIN COMMITTEE their industry and they have shown that, even with the island divided, they have been able to develop a very strong economy in the south built on tourism, banking and services. They are able to hold their heads high, go into the EU and provide the economic stability and advancement that the north of the island requires. It will need a lot of pressure by the Turkish government to get the old Turkish Cypriot regime in northern Cyprus to agree to the amalgamation, but if the people who run the Turkish Cypriot regime in the north of Cyprus genuinely have the ideals and the best interests of the Cypriot people at heart, particularly the Turkish Cypriot people, they will ensure that we achieve a solution to this problem now. It would be absolutely stupid if the Australian government chose this time to withdraw Australia’s AFP contingent or even think of diminishing it. As previous experience has shown in other difficult international situations, once a solution has been found there is still a lot of work to be done to bed down the new arrangements. A harmonious and successful reunification will take time, patience and goodwill on both sides. The Australian AFP, with its well-earned reputation in Cyprus with both sides of the island over the years, will be in an excellent position to assist for however long it takes to bring peace and harmony to the island. While I am pleased to see that AFP personnel are continuing to be deployed overseas and that the government recognises our international responsibility to help preserve stability and security among our near neighbours, I hope that it is not at the expense of our long standing commitment in Cyprus. When the beginnings of a resolution to the problem in Cyprus seem to be so close-the closest it has been in memory-it would be premature of the Australian government to withdraw our police at this sensitive time. As I have said before, it would certainly not be a popular move from the Cypriot community’s point of view, and I know from personal experience that the people of Cyprus appreciate the presence of the AFP. We should hope that the minister will see sense, that the government will ensure that the AFP stay in Cyprus and that the AFP can celebrate the reunification of the island in a way which the Cypriot community here in Australia will be proud of and which the Cyprus government will be appreciative of. The people of Cyprus, who have come to know the Australian police there over that long period, would want them to be there to celebrate the reunification of the island. I hope that the minister will continue to maintain Australia’s presence in Cyprus. In the rest of this appropriation bill, as I said at the beginning, there is very little that the government is proposing that it has not proposed before. There is a lot of dross and very little gold.

291,Mr Leo Mcleay,"My colleague here has heard my airport speeches before, and hecommunity service issues which are very important to many people in my electorate of Oxley and, of course, to a whole range of Australians throughout our country. More specifically I want to outline a number of failures by the Howard government to address these real issues affecting real Australians. I remind people to cast their minds back to 1996 when that famous phrase ‘the Howard battlers’ was coined. Sadly, they have been forgotten by this government. I believe the Howard government has failed to provide adequate assistance for many Australians and their families, and I know that a Latham Labor government would redress these failings as a matter of urgency. Labor has a proven track record, particularly on the issues of health, education and housing, whereas the government has an ever-growing track record of being strong on the weak, weak on the strong, loose with the truth and-their greatest record of all-the highest taxing government in Australian history. In general terms, the Howard government is not committed to delivering real assistance for Australian families. Instead, the government’s approach is to avoid its mutual responsibilities-and we often hear that terminology used in this place by the government. It is a term that in fact does not belong to this government. It should be a term of respect-mutual responsibility is about what we can all do for each other for the betterment of this place. But the term has been hijacked by the government, and I am offended by that because it is a term that Labor has used, but used in a responsible manner. That is what mutual responsibility should be about. But the government has taken that and put it in the too-hard basket. It is no more evident than in what has been revealed recently by a leaked 130-page cabinet document which was presented to the federal government nearly 14 months ago. This document, which the government has sat on for far too long, presented a range of work and family policy options open to the government to redress some of its own failings. What did the government do with this document? It shelved it-it put it to one side and into the too-hard basket. When I asked in question time recently why no action was taken when the government was presented with these policy options, in his response the Prime Minister said that there were more pressing issues to deal with than an options paper about families. I cannot think of any more pressing issue or any issue that should be more prioritised than the well-being of families in this country. At the end of the day, no matter what we do as a parliament and no matter what any party does in government, we should first and foremost look after families. If you look after families, you look after all Australians. But the government failed in this area and put it into the too-hard basket. I also want to briefly outline a few key issues that presently face all Australians, particularly families. Many families struggle to balance the pressures of work and family life. There is no question about that-that is a known fact. Life has become more complicated and much more of a struggle. Families today are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain child-care places. With the requirement for people to go out to work for that double income to match the lifestyles that families are seeking and the expectations that families have, there is a need for more child-care places. Many of them particularly struggle to find after-school care places. Young families need assistance when it comes to that new addition to their family. We should be encouraging new families and more children, and we should be doing that through policy. Parental leave is an important issue, particularly for people re-entering the work force. I also want to take note of the structurally flawed family tax benefits scheme. All of these issues are MAIN COMMITTEE",119,Appropriation Bill No 4 2003 2004 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 2 2003 2004
292,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (4.53 P.m.),"TodayI would like to address a number of family andinterlinked-you cannot separate them. You cannot have a government that decides it is going to deal with one of these issues but not all of them. At the end of the day these issues affect everybody-not only the people in my electorate of Oxley, in Ipswich and western Brisbane, but also the millions of families right across Australia. What the government should be doing is presenting the policies by which they seek to address many of these issues and providing real assistance and real solutions. Government do have the power to make a difference-they can effect change. Where there is a will, there is a way. Where there is another incentive and when it is about saving their political hides, the government find no will to take care of family issues and family matters, but they certainly find the will in other areas-and I will come to that in a moment. So the Prime Minister was right about these issues-about how families balance the pressures of work and family life-when he said, some 19 months ago, that they were very important, but unfortunately he has just done nothing about them. In fact, the Prime Minister has called these things ‘barbecue stoppers’. He is right-they are barbecue stoppers, because they are very important issues. We have heard all the talk but we have seen no action. We have had all sizzle but no sausage; we have had all ham but no burger. Interestingly, when it comes to these very important issues about the government saving its own political hide it will sit on a report for a long time, but when it comes to other matters that affect the Prime Minister’s election hopes then we find a different Prime Minister. The Prime Minister and the government can fix the political problem of parliamentary superannuation-they can fix that in 48 hours-but when it comes to helping Australian families then 14 months go by and nothing happens. How does the government justify that? How does the government go out into the community and explain that? I am going to be asking that question in the lead-up to the election on every opportunity. For 30 years, throughout his career, the Prime Minister has come into this place and defended the parliamentary superannuation scheme, but he backflips on that in 48 hours when he knows that his political hide is on the line. That is the type of person I am talking about. People will and do ask questions about that. But when it comes to helping families and there is a report sitting in the party room, it takes 14 months. And if the report is not leaked and not discovered, nothing happens. This is the tragedy; this is the explanation; this is the definition of this government. This is what this government represents, and that makes me sick. It makes me sick to the bone knowing what this government is truly about. It is not about helping people and families; it is about saving its own political hide. I also want to speak about some specifics and highlight just how the government is failing Australian families. I mentioned before half-a-dozen or more of the issues that are prominent in the lives of many Australians. There are some figures and facts that I think are really important to this debate, particularly in relation to the government’s failed family tax benefit scheme. There have been 2.9 million incorrect payments-56 per cent of all payments, worth $2½ billion-made in error to families. The percentage of family payment debts remains extremely high. It is unacceptable. Families have an average debt of around $900. I find this unacceptable. It is totally unacceptable that the government does not act to fix up this problem. It will find ways to fix up its own problems but not the problems of the families that it should be helping. MAIN COMMITTEE It has underpaid families an average of $32.50 a fortnight. It underpays them and then thinks it is okay to say, ‘At the end of the year we’ll give you a top-up.’ Meanwhile families are suffering. That is why we have those large personal debts and credit card debts-because this government forces people into that position by not dealing with their family tax benefits in a proper way. It is a flawed system that this government should address as a matter of urgency but finds not important enough. It can find the time within 48 hours to do the greatest backflip of all time when it comes to superannuation entitlements for parliamentarians-when it affects them personally-but when it comes to families it cannot find the time. I find this very offensive. In relation to the debts it actually gets worse. The total number of family tax benefit overpayments from July 2000 to September 2003-a relatively short period of time-was 1,639,378. That is right-over 1.6 million mistakes. The dollar value of these overpayments in that period was over $1.4 billion. A growing number of families are being underpaid, and I find that totally unacceptable. The total number of family tax benefit underpayments in that same period of time was nearly 1.3 million, with a total value of over $1 billion. And you ask why families are suffering! Why are families hurting? They are hurting because the government is not dealing with their family tax benefits in the proper way. It is a flawed system. It is a system that hurts ordinary families. Some government members might giggle a bit and think that this may only affect a small percentage of unfortunate people who might not have a job. That is not the case. We are talking about ordinary middle-class Australian families in which one parent or both parents work. They are finding the system so complex, so difficult, that they come to my office to seek assistance not with the actual benefits but in comprehending the forms. These are people who are in middle management or management jobs and are very literate. I have looked at the forms and I find them very confusing. I do not know how ordinary people can fill out those forms. We see the result of that complication and bureaucracy in the millions of underpayments. We see the result in the hundreds of thousands of families that miss out on an entitlement-miss out on something they are due. It is not fair and it should be corrected. But, again, the government cannot find the time. It is not on their list of priorities. On their list of priorities are their political hides. That is the one and only issue on their list of priorities. We find that only 44 per cent of payments are correct, so we are talking about nearly 60 per cent that are not correct. Again, this is just not acceptable. The total dollar value of incorrect payments is $2½ billion. The reason why I highlight these figures is to draw some attention to the quantum-the size, to the actual dollar value, of just how bad this is. An on-point example of a real person in my electorate is that of a young woman who came to my office about a system flaw in her payments. She had identified the flaw and notified Centrelink, but the system would not allow the change because it is not built into the computer system. It is not built into the method by which it can be changed. It has to lie therethe documents are not right; this and that are not right. Every electorate office around this country has gone through this. Every Liberal member, every National Party member and every Labor member knows this is right, because we fix the problems. It is the members who end up sitting down, going through the details and fixing the problems in the bureaucracythe bits that the public servants who are looking after Centrelink cannot fix because they do not have the authority to fix them. MAIN COMMITTEE This is part of the problem with the system. The minister wants all power over what goes on in their own system but accepts no responsibility, so people suffer in a flawed system. We did finally fix this woman’s problem. It was a minor problem but it was a policy problem. We fixed it, but she had to put weeks of stress, pain and time into fixing this problem. That is completely inadequate and wrong. This government should go and fix its system first and let people get on with their lives. It should let people go out there and work for a living and look after their families and not have the stress and burden of this government which cannot do its job. It should not let that burden fall on to our electorate offices and on us, as members of parliament, or directly on to the families in our community. I cannot understand how the government continues to allow this to happen year after year and does not prioritise it. I cannot understand why it does not make it a top-level priority in its own party room to say. ‘This is an important issue we need to fix.’ I think that might change. I have got to tell you here and now, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, that this might change. It is going to change because the government is going to start to suffer in the electorates. That is the only thing that this government understands-electoral pain. If they feel enough electoral pain they will react. We saw that this week. They have ignored veterans; they have not come up with the sorts of packages and things that we need to provide to veterans as the proper entitlement that they are due for their service to this country. We saw Minister Vale come into the parliament-I have to say she has very little respect, if any, left from the veteran community-with the gall to come in under false pretences and not offer the sort of benefits these people are entitled to. I was ashamed that day for this government and the way it treats veterans. But what did it do this week? It suddenly realised: ‘Hang on, we’ve got a fair bit of money stashed away for a rainy electoral day: a $7½ billion surplus. We might have to spend some of that on the people we are hurting the most.’ It has twigged to that little problem it has in terms of the veteran community-the veterans just might do something about it if problems are not fixed. I am glad to see now that there is an almost $300 million package that will actually go to veterans. But, mind you, the government, as always, has been dragged kicking and screaming all the way to the table and the options-all the way to the payments. It does not want to do this. The veteran community should make a note of this: ‘The government does not want to give you that $300 million; it is forced to give it to you.’ It has been dragged there kicking and screaming because we, as the opposition, go into the parliament day after day and take the government to task. We want the government to be accountable for every single cent that it puts away like a miser in a little stash fund called an electoral fund-that $7½ billion surplus-so that it can have a get out of jail free card come the election. That is what is happening. This year may or may not be an election year, but you will see the changes. I think the community is smart enough to know that this year that is where that surplus will be spent. There is a lot of work to be done and a lot of things that need to be redressed, and this government has had way too much time to do it and has not acted on any of it. There were also some interesting statistics that came back to us through the Weekend Australian newspaper, acquired through freedom of information requests, which confirmed the damaging 1.3 million mistakes that affected 700,000 Centrelink customers over a four-month period-700,000 Centrelink customers were affected over four months by Centrelink’s mistakes. I want to make it very clear at this stage that I do not blame the workers of Centrelink. I MAIN COMMITTEE do not blame the people that work there at all, because I know the stresses, regulation and bureaucracy they have to deal with and the pressures that come to them directly from the top-from government in Canberra-about the way they have to apply the rules they have been given. It has become such a complex business now, and we see the government making it more and more difficult for public servants to do their job. And then what does the government do? I was absolutely shocked a couple of weeks ago when we had ministers come into this place and say that public servants cannot do the job well enough and we need to outsource and privatise it. Of course they cannot do the job well enough if you do not give them the tools and the resources. You can always make life difficult for someone if you want to and if you do not resource them properly. The government should make the system better. It should fix the flaws in the system and properly resource Centrelink. It should do all these things to make life for families easier. At the end of the day that is the goal. The priority of government should be to make life for families easier to the point where they do not have to worry about their Centrelink payments or that extra layer of bureaucracy, so that they can get on with their lives and their barbecue stoppers, as the Prime Minister is so keen to point out. The Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham, has talked about a ladder of opportunity. He has talked about the first rung on that ladder being opportunity for all our infant children. The Leader of the Opposition knows, like all of us, that our children are precious and the foundations of our future and that their development is not an issue to be avoided. Their development should be right up there-the No. 1 priority. It should be on the government’s list but it is not. As I have explained before, we know why it is not on that list-that list is crowded by one issue only: the government’s re-election. Throughout my electorate and many like it across the country, people are trying very hard to balance the pressures of family life and work and, more specifically, people are struggling to find adequate child-care places. People often tell me they struggle not only to find adequate beforeand after-school child-care places but also funded places so their kids can be looked after properly in a qualified child-care centre. People also tell me that child care is becoming one of those central issues that make it very difficult for them to continue in their employment. I think that is an issue the government should really pay more attention to. It ends up meaning that those families have to put more pressure on their friends, more pressure on their family and more pressure on the community in order to do the government’s job. The community, friends and family end up doing the government’s job, because the government refuses to accept its mutual responsibility to families in Australia. There is a crisis in child care that this government refuses to fix. The issue of affordability is certainly high on that agenda. In the couple of minutes that I have remaining, I want to mention a specific example of the government’s failure-that is, the Job Network system. The Job Network system is now well and truly stuffed. I do not know if I can find any other way to explain it. This system has failed glaringly. It is a revolving door of unemployment for those who remain unemployed. While I acknowledge that unemployment rates are low, not much has changed for those who are in long-term unemployment. This system that the government has put in place seems to me to be nothing more than a system which it took away from public servants-it took away its own responsibility as a government to provide a Commonwealth employment service-and gave it to private enterMAIN COMMITTEE prise. Private enterprise quickly worked out that, to make a profit-something that this government claims to understand very well-they needed customers. Their customers are the unemployed. Of course, as unemployment tends to fall or as there is no renewal of customers, the Job Network agencies fail. And as they fail, the government finds that it has to top them up. What is it doing? It is topping them up to the tune and $670 million per year. It is finding that, if it does not throw in $1 billion extra to keep them afloat, they and the system will collapse and it will be revealed just how flawed this system really is. In the few words that I have put on the record today, I have highlighted just a few of the many problems that families and communities face in Australia today. But I really want to draw people’s attention to the fact that this government does absolutely nothing about it. It does not prioritise. Labor will do that when it is elected. (Time expired) Ms HOARE (Charlton) (5.13 p.m.)-Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 20032004 constitute the additional estimates bills for 2004. They provide additional funding requirements since the 2003-04 budget and include total appropriations for the three bills of $14,307 million. This is a net increase of $957 million from the 2003-04 budget, which is two per cent of total annual appropriations. These bills also include savings due to changes in policy or parameter variations totalling $473.4 million. These are outlined in the finance document statement of savings expected in annual appropriations. The Appropriations Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004 deals primarily with measures since the last budget and, in addition to supply, two new clauses have also been added to this bill which will provide a mechanism for the finance minister upon request from portfolio minister to lapse amounts of departmental expense appropriations which are not required. While we have said that we will support these appropriation bills as we have done every year since 1975, we have moved a second reading amendment that the House condemns the government for its budget waste, mismanagement and wrong priorities which have resulted in a costly Medicare safety net that does not protect families from increasing health costs and declining levels of bulk-billing; inadequate funding and higher fees for students seeking access to higher education; a growing number of families who are financially squeezed in trying to balance work and family and half a million Australians who have been waiting for up to five years to get their teeth fixed. We need to restore doctors’ services in the Newcastle and Lake Macquarie area. Labor has a plan to save Medicare with a $1.9 billion package to reverse the collapse in bulk-billing and by lifting the patient rebate for bulk-billing for all Australians, no matter where they live or how much they earn. A Latham Labor government will immediately lift the Medicare patient rebate for all bulk-billed consultations to 95 per cent of the scheduled fee-an average increase of $3.35 per visit. Subsequently, it will lift the Medicare patient rebate for all bulkbilled consultations to 100 per cent of the scheduled fee-an average increase of $5 per visit. Doctors will be offered financial incentives to keep treating their patients, without additional cost, and to extend bulk-billing, especially in places like Lake Macquarie and Newcastle where the collapse in bulk-billing is really hurting families. Lifting the patient rebate and introducing financial incentives for bulk-billing will help to stem the dramatic decline in bulkbilling and act to make more bulk-billing available to more Australian families. MAIN COMMITTEE Labor will encourage doctors to bulk-bill. We will make access to health care much easier for families, particularly those families who are under financial pressure. Labor stands in stark contrast to the government’s proposals to destroy Medicare, to restrict bulk-billing to pensioners and concession card holders, and to see Australian families pay more every time they visit the doctor. Bit by bit, visit by visit, the cost for Australian families under John Howard will go up. Under Labor’s proposals, there are substantial financial incentives for GPs to continue bulk-billing or to improve their bulk-billing performances. We are very confident that our package, when implemented, will firstly stem the serious decline in bulk-billing and then see bulk-billing go back up towards our national objective of an 80 per cent bulk-billing rate. The Prime Minister knows his package will create conditions in which it will be easier for doctors to charge gap payments for patients and increase their fees for patients who are already paying private fees. There is the ability for doctors to claim the Medicare rebate directly and to charge a gap payment, and it is being held out as an incentive only for those doctors who agree to do John Howard’s bidding for pensioners and concession card holders. As the former President of the AMA, Kerryn Phelps, pointed out: What will need to happen is that for doctors to continue to bulk-bill their concession card holders they’re going to have to charge their non concession card holders more ... The government’s package will drive bulk-billing even lower because, while doctors will be given financial incentives to bulk-bill pensioners and concession card holders, they will be given the green light to charge higher fees for everybody else. Australian families who earn more than $32,300 a year are not eligible for a concession card. For them, bulk-billing will effectively end. When they visit their GP, bit by bit, visit by visit, they will be asked to pay more. We all know that being able to see a doctor when somebody in the family is sick can be pretty tough. Finding a doctor who is prepared to bulk-bill is almost impossible these days. Part of my job as a federal member of parliament is to help our community gain better access to services, including doctors and Medicare. Labor is the party that built Medicare. Labor believes in Medicare. Under Labor, Medicare was not in crisis; it worked. In 1996 more than 80 per cent of visits to doctors cost patients nothing because the doctor bulk-billed. John Howard, in contrast, has never believed in Medicare and his policies have put Medicare on the critical list. John Howard’s policies mean that there are now 21 per cent less bulk-billing consultations each year in West Lake Macquarie and South Newcastle than there were in 2000. This means that greater pressure is being placed on John Hunter Hospital, Belmont Hospital and Wyong Hospital emergency rooms. We all know that there are times when a family needs a doctor and that it is now harder to find one. I will relate a personal experience that happened to me during January. We woke up one morning at home and Reg, my husband, found that he could not swallow. We rang his local medical service and they said, ‘No, the doctor is on holidays. We couldn’t get a locum in and won’t be able to see you for about three or four days.’ I rang another medical service in the area, but the doctor had to go on leave as she had been working hard all year. They could not get a locum in to assist the practice, so the practice in the town had to close down over the break. The advice given to us was to wait at the emergency rooms at the John Hunter Hospital. I would like to think that we are a fairly intelligent family, but on this occasion we decided that we would self-medicate. We looked in the herbal books on the bookshelves, looking for MAIN COMMITTEE ways to try to alleviate the symptoms Reg had, without having to wait at the emergency room at the John Hunter Hospital. If we as a family have to make choices like that, I can just imagine what other people in the community do. In relation to shortages of doctors and bulk-billing, in July last year I expressed my disappointment in this place at the sudden closure of the Wyee Medical Practice in my electorate. I was extremely saddened that the last of the bulk-billing surgeries in the Morisset and Wyee area had closed its doors to the public. The doctors at the surgery were well respected and were the last to regularly bulk-bill patients in the Southlakes area. There are few doctors in the Morisset region who will take on new patients because their books are full. Costs of around $35.50 for a pensioner to visit the doctor are causing many people in our community to turn to our public hospitals for medical attention or they just miss out completely. The community of Wyee and Wyee Point have been left without their bulk-billing doctors. This means that many families will just not seek medical attention because the $35 or $44 to visit the doctor is just not there. There is a clear shortage of doctors in the Southlakes area and, with a significant growing population, the pressure placed on our hard working doctors is mounting. People living in the Southlakes area have been disadvantaged by the closure of the Wyee surgery, which will only add pressure to the existing doctors in Morisset, Cooranbong and Bonnells Bay. We need more doctors in our regions; we cannot afford to see them leave. And we need these doctors to bulk-bill us so all families can access medical attention when they need it. We need a solution to the bulk-billing crisis, and only Labor will deliver a better deal on Medicare for families in the Southlakes area. Following the closure of that doctor’s surgery in Wyee towards the end of last year, the Wyee community faced the possible closure of the Wyee pharmacy owing to the loss of the doctor. I am deeply concerned that because we are still yet to secure the services of a new doctor the pharmacy may have to close. I have been working closely with the community, including Ibraham and Lobna Gahzi, the local pharmacists to bring a doctor back to Wyee. Whilst our efforts continue, there is increasing pressure on the pharmacy to close. Much of the pharmacists’ work is generated by dispensing prescriptions and, without a doctor in town, fewer people are using the pharmacy. Ibraham and Lobna have been great supporters of the Wyee community and it is a tragedy that their business has suffered as a result of the closure of the Wyee Medical Practice. I again call on the government to bring about a solution that will encourage a doctor to come to Wyee. We were advised by the minister that Wyee is a location where an overseas trained doctor is able to access a Medicare provider number. This needs to happen soon before another vital service, the local pharmacy, is lost to the community of Wyee. Moving on to dental care, I have received many letters, emails and phone calls on this issue. As I have responded to them, I emphasise that Labor will invest $300 million over four years in a national dental care program to help those half a million Australians currently waiting up to five years to get treatment. Australian dental care will provide well over a million extra dental procedures for Australians-enough to clear the existing backlog and substantially reduce waiting lists. When the Howard government abolished the Commonwealth dental program in 1996, there were 380,000 Australians waiting an average of six months for public dental care. Now there are more than half a million people waiting as long as five years to get their teeth fixed, and many of the people on these lists are elderly. MAIN COMMITTEE Under Labor’s plan, concession card holders, such as pensioners, and health care card holders and their dependants will now get free check-ups when they need them and subsidised dental treatments, restorations and dentures. Labor will also provide dental health assessments and ongoing care for everyone admitted to nursing homes and will help Indigenous communities with special dental problems, including lack of water fluoridation and diabetes. Under Labor, the federal and state governments will join together in a great national effort because we know that affordable dental care is as essential as any other medical treatment. State and territory governments will spend $384 million on dental services this financial year for health care card holders and school children. Labor believes that dental care is a national responsibility and, unlike the Prime Minister who simply tries to fob it off to the states, a Latham Labor government will work with the states to fix the crisis in dental care. Towards the end of last year, we saw a change in leadership of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. Mark Latham was elected leader and the policies that I have outlined in relation to Medicare, bulk-billing and doctor shortages were released prior to that. So we have shown already that we are a party of positive policy announcements, of policy announcements which have been fully costed and which we know will work to address the ongoing crisis in parts of our community in relation to medical care. Throughout January in the lead-up to the Labor Party’s national conference which was held in Sydney at the end of January a lot of the media and political commentators and many of those in the coalition government were saying that the national conference was going to be a test of Mark Latham’s leadership of the Labor Party. I think a lot of those people would have been sitting back and waiting for Mark Latham to fall at the national conference of the Labor Party. But that did not happen. If that was a test of Mark Latham’s leadership of the Labor Party then he well and truly passed it. Following on from that, we had the media commentators as well as the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and leading government ministers and government backbenchers saying: ‘This is a honeymoon for Mark Latham. This is a honeymoon period for the new leader of the Labor Party.’ After three months of that leadership-three months today-that balloon, that honeymoon period, is nowhere near dissipating. I think the government members would be pleased to have a crisis which would maybe put a hole in that balloon. That is not going to happen. If you have seen the energy, the commitment and the dedication from the new Leader of the Opposition, you will know that that is not going to happen. In the last month or so, the government have gone into panic mode and we have seen their knee-jerk reactions. We saw that with the response from the Prime Minister in relation to parliamentarians’ superannuation. We saw it today in response to the veteran community and the policy announcements to try and shore up their support. I remind the government members and the Prime Minister that the community has a long memory and the community will remember the trail of deceit, the trail of non-core promises and they will ask: ‘Where are the weapons of mass destruction and the reasons we went to war?’ They will remember Tampa. They will remember the children overboard. They will remember Peter Hollingworth. They will remember the never, ever GST. They will remember the no $100,000 university fees. They will remember the reason we went to war was because of the so-called weapons of mass destruction, but now the Prime Minister tells us it was good to get the regime change. The MAIN COMMITTEE electorate will remember these things. No amount of back-pedalling or spending the budget surplus is going to make them feel any other way. The opposition’s amendment to this legislation also goes to the issue of government waste. It was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald by Alan Ramsey on 18 February following budget estimates in which our two experts-Labor Party Senators John Faulkner and Robert Ray-raised some questions about expenditure on the Lodge. The total expenditure came in at about $140,000 which included 10 armchairs at $23,000-odd, carpeting, painting and new timberwork, design fees, timber removal, curtains, two bathrooms and lighting. The article reports Senator Faulkner saying: Is that the full horror? And the official replied: There is still some carpeting. They then moved on to the ‘retirement lifestyle’ of Peter Hollingworth. You would remember that Peter Hollingworth was, as Ramsey reports: …[the] former archbishop and tainted governor-general who resigned, under pressure, a year ago after just 23 turbulent months and walked away with an annual pension of $184,000, a car and driver and first-class air travel for life, and an office and secretarythank you very much! Senator Ray, in budget estimates, as Ramsey reports: … wanted to know about Hollingworth’s 21st-floor office in Melbourne that taxpayers maintain. How big was it? Official: “145 square metres for him and his staff.” How many staff? “One.” Faulkner: “145 square metres for two people? That is bigger than a lot of houses in this country, isn’t it?” Official: “I do not know.” Faulkner: “Well, I do.” And we all do, too. Ramsey’s article said Senator Ray then asked: “Were any renovations required?” Official: “There was a fit-out, yes.” Ray: “How much?” Official: “The total cost?” Ray: “Yes.” The official said that the total cost of the fit out of this 21st floor office of 145 square metres for two people was $234,000. Those are just a couple of examples of government wastage in this area. I referred to the national conference and the various policy announcements which were made there. We also announced the policy of Read Aloud Australia, where parents are supported in reading aloud to their children from day one-because we know that learning begins at day one-and the BookStart program, where every new parent will be offered three new books to read to their children. We also had the announcement that Lindsay Tanner, the member for Melbourne, had been appointed the shadow minister for community relationships. We all know that people out there in the community do not sit around the pub talking about the state of the economy; they sit around the pub talking about the state of their families, the state of their community, their community security, how their kids are going and what is happening in their everyday lives. SoI applaud the Leader of the Opposition for making those announcements at our national conference. They were great announcements and there are many more where they came from. In conclusion, and because I have referred to the new Leader of the Opposition, I would just like to take this opportunity to salute Simon Crean, the member for Hotham. Simon always had my support. Simon is a good man; he was a good leader. Unfortunately, events conMAIN COMMITTEE spired against him. I wish him and Carole all the best, all the time. I consider them good friends. We did a lot under the leadership of Simon Crean and I applaud him for that. Weekend Australian Magazine of 21 and 22 February a reference-to a part of my electorate-which I consider to be full of judgment and prejudice. A number of people in this chamber might have read the article that I am talking about. It was an otherwise excellent piece of writing by a journalist named Stuart Rintoul. It was an article about a very well-known and prominent defence barrister named Colin Lovitt. I thought it was a good piece of writing about Colin Lovitt and it was interesting reading, but I must take issue with a reference that Stuart Rintoul made in his article to what he described as the ‘rural slum of Moe’. I am very proud to represent the town of Moe in my electoral district. It is a beautiful town and an absolutely fantastic place to live. It is surrounded by rolling hills to the south and an absolutely gorgeous mountain range to the north. It is a large and vibrant township of about 18,000 people, and it has a magnificent sense of community. I have been proud to have the support of so many people in Moe in my political life for quite a few years, and very proud to count so many people in Moe as my trusted and closest friends. I want to say this in the parliament: I think Stuart Rintoul did the wrong thing by making that reference to Moe. It is an uninformed comment and a comment that is full of prejudice and judgment. I say to Stuart Rintoul through this parliament that we really count on people like him in the media to be responsible in the comments they make about towns and districts, because what they say has a big effect on how people perceive the towns, districts and regions in which we live. I think it would be appropriate for Stuart Rintoul and the Weekend Australian to apologise to the people of Moe for that reference. It might have been an inadvertent reference, but the damage has still been done. People in Moe are hurt by that reference. It is a reference which is unfair. It is a comment on the people of Moe which is not deserved. We all know that when you refer to a slum in an Australian context the general usage of that word is associated with a place like Calcutta where there is desperate poverty and there are awful physical circumstances and people living in horrendous personal situations. We all know that that is what the word ‘slum’ refers to. We know that that reference is unsuitable when talking about a beautiful town and a vibrant community full of good people, all working hard to get ahead, which is what we have in the township of Moe. I want to use the time that I have available today to draw attention to the response that we have had from the public schools right across my electorate to the awful comments made by the Prime Minister in relation to the public school system. It might be worthwhile my reminding the House exactly what those comments were. The Prime Minister said: ... theytalking about the parentsfeel that government schools have become too politically correct and too values-neutral. And the acting education minister, Peter McGauran, said: ... there is a worrying trend within state schools, that there is a jettison of traditional values and heritage of Australia. He went on to say: MAIN COMMITTEE",120,Appropriation Bill No 4 2003 2004 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 2 2003 2004
293,Mr Zahra (Mcmillan) (5.33 P.m.),"I was appalled and disgusted when I saw in the... there is a growing trend that is discernable to parents that too many government schools are either value free or are hostile to, apathetic to, Australia’s heritage and values ... Those comments are appalling and very uninformed. They are an insult to all those hard working teachers and support staff who commit themselves so fully and energetically to providing quality education to our students in public schools. Quite a response has been created in my electorate not only from people in the public school system but also from people in the Catholic and independent school systems who were appalled at the Prime Minister’s comments and who think that these types of generalisations and stereotypes of schools or teachers are highly inappropriate. I have some letters here from schools across my electorate in response to what the Prime Minister has said. I want to read part of what they have said in their letters to me into the Hansard for the record. One letter is from a rural primary school in the beautiful Latrobe Valley. It says: Christian, you must have noticed even in your visits to our school how seriously we emphasise the values of respect and civility to visitors. This is even more so when we are out of the school. The students know very clearly what is expected. The principal goes on to say: This year at our school, we are launching the You Can Do It program. This actually teaches the indicators research has shown make a successful student and citizen. These indicators are: organisation, academic confidence, persistence and getting along with others. Underpinning these success indicators are a whole range of values: respect for others, respect for property, independence, giving of your best, expectations that tasks will be completed, putting in an effort, planning time, listening to others, tolerance, playing by the rules, thinking first-the list goes on. These aspects of successful citizenship are actually taught. There are specific lessons on these values. The principal concludes by saying: Christian, can you imagine what schools would be like if tolerance, respect and a conscientious approach to study were not inherent in the values of a school? It would be chaos, and my school is not that. I have been to that principal’s school on several occasions, and I can guarantee that his school, like so many other public schools in my electoral district, is an excellent school. It provides a fantastic education to all of its students. Another letter I have received in relation to this issue is from the principal of one of the large state primary schools in the west Gippsland area. He has written a letter to the Prime Minister which he has copied to me. As principal of his school, he writes to the Prime Minister: I am deeply offended by your comments regarding state government schools and their values. As the elected political leader of this country your effort should be constructive and inclusive, not divisive and politically point scoring. He goes on to say: ... it is a large primary school with a strong culture of producing high-quality, well educated students. We operate in a very competitive environment. The whole community sees our school as offering outstanding quality education. The values and heritage enunciated at this school truly reflect the parent community and are clearly stated. Your recent statements not only damage years of hard work and effort but also the image of my staff and their profession. MAIN COMMITTEE This was typical of the response I had from schools right across my electorate in relation to the Prime Minister’s comments about public education. I would like to read from another letter I have got, which is from a large public primary school in one of the towns in the Latrobe Valley. The principal wrote to me and said: Like you, I was appalled at the indiscriminate demeaning of schools. He goes on to say: It is unfortunate that the Prime Minister’s comments and those of many of his colleagues have in one broad, generalised sweep undermined the work and integrity of teachers and parents who are contributing so much to the growth and development of this nation. I am personally embarrassed because it has taken the focus away from the real issues facing schools today. I support that view and I think he has hit the nail on the head. The real issue facing the federal parliament in relation to schools is not some type of false debate that the Prime Minister might want to try and start which relates to his idea of values; it is about where the funding goes that the Commonwealth provides to schools. We have a situation now where the more money schools have the more money they get, which means that poorer districts-mostly in rural areas-miss out. All of the big increases go to the King’s School, Geelong Grammar, Wesley College and Trinity College-schools that charge $15,000 or $16,000 per year for just one student to study. Not one single person in my electorate can afford that. The real debate, which was alluded to in that letter I just read out, is about why it is that the Howard government sees fit to give those schools the most money and not adequately fund the public school system and low-fee Catholic and independent schools and recognise the needs of their students and the communities they serve. I had many other responses, from principals, school councils and students right across my electorate. I want to read out a response from a principal who leads one of the public secondary colleges in the south Gippsland region. He says that at his school: Our core values and expectations are: valuing people, valuing diversity, mutual respect, honesty, trust, resolving conflict positively, recognising and encouraging people’s strengths, respecting individuality, fostering a sense of community where we care about everyone. People are encouraged to make positive choices, taking responsibility for actions and achievements. His letter goes on: We teach these core values and expectations in the curriculum, with a subject known as people skills. This has commenced this year at years 7, 8 and 9. We are a project school for social competencies, which we have called people skills. He includes some three pages in his letter that set out in more detail all of the values and skills which his school is teaching its students as it prepares those young people for life. There are so many other responses that I have received, from some excellent schools right across my electoral district. I hope that the Prime Minister is listening to my contribution today and hearing first-hand what educators, people who are in the field servicing communities in country areas, actually think of the comments that he made about their schools and the school system, which he has, in one broad statement, demeaned in such a disgraceful way. I had the good fortune the other day to get a briefing from the Trafalgar district community association. The Trafalgar district community association are good people who have been working very hard on behalf of the residents and the citizens of Trafalgar and have really been a very powerful force within that community in setting a positive agenda for the town and MAIN COMMITTEE making sure that things happen when they are planned. I received a briefing from the Trafalgar district community association, from the people from the youth resource centre in the town, from the Trafalgar Chamber of Commerce and from a number of people who are involved directly with the Trafalgar district community association in terms of organising the strategic direction for the town. The group have steered the development of the Trafalgar strategic plan and its sister publication, the Trafalgar action plan. They are two excellent publications, which are the result of extensive work and public consultation that has been done by the people involved in the Trafalgar Community Development Association. I just want to use this public opportunity in the parliament to congratulate the people involved in the Trafalgar Community Development Association for the work which they have done. In particular, I want to congratulate Mick Bourke, who has been their president for quite some time, for the work which he has done and the leadership he has provided to that organisation. It is a wonderful town, Trafalgar, and I am absolutely convinced that it has a very positive future. It will continue to have a positive future so long as there are people in the community like Mick Bourke and all the other people involved in the Trafalgar Community Development Association who give so willingly of their time and effort and creativity to ensure that a future for Trafalgar is not something that people take for granted but something that people work towards and plan towards. Well done to Mick and his team and to all of the people who are involved in the Trafalgar Community Development Association. I had the opportunity last week to meet with the people involved with the Coal Creek Heritage Village, which is one of Victoria’s premier tourist attractions and is located in the southern part of my electorate, in Korumburra. It is an excellent place. I have been there several times and I am sure many other people in the House have been there before as well. You will be pleased to know, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, that it is celebrating its 30th birthday this month. The story of Coal Creek is quite amazing and an excellent example of the determination, resourcefulness and cooperation of rural Australian communities. Coal Creek was planned, developed and built by the Korumburra community. The village has benefited from ongoing financial assistance initially from the old Korumburra Shire Council and, more recently, from the South Gippsland Shire Council. However, the vast majority of the original construction was undertaken by volunteer labour, and most of the relics, artefacts and antiques that make up the collection were donated by local residents and families. The day-to-day operation of the village has across its 30-year history relied heavily on volunteers in staffing roles as tour guides and in maintaining the village. Korumburra is a relatively small town, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, yet the local community supplies around 30 volunteers per week to keep Coal Creek functioning. It really is a great achievement that the people of Korumburra have been able to keep Coal Creek functioning for so long and have made it such a success. TodayI want to briefly give some special recognition to a number of volunteers. One standout volunteer amongst a bigger group is Anne Hopwood, who recently retired as a volunteer at Coal Creek after 25 years of continuous services. Anne and her husband run a dairy farm in the Korumburra area and have raised a family of three children. However, she still found time to donate at least a day’s voluntary labour to Coal Creek almost every week across the past 25 years. Keith Dunstan is a relative newcomer compared to Anne. He first became MAIN COMMITTEE involved with Coal Creek around 15 years ago. Since then, he has adopted the village. He is often there seven days per week, feeding the farm animals and tackling all manner of maintenance projects. Keith is also an active member of many of the groups and subcommittees that form the basis of operation and support at Coal Creek. When Coal Creek was first suggested, Hugh Henry was a local councillor. He was a member of the original investigative committee and a prime mover in developing and progressing the project. He then took on the role of manager of the village, once it opened, and remained in that position for its first 15 years of operation. Since then, he has been a regular visitor, returning to offer his services across a broad range of areas, including building maintenance and general repairs. Hugh has a wealth of knowledge on the history and original development plans, and he remains only too happy to share that with the current management. There are many other examples of local people who have given so much to the Coal Creek Heritage Village over its 30 years of operation. Well done to Ken Joiner, the current manager of the Coal Creek Heritage Village, in making sure that we properly celebrate this 30th anniversary. I would like to place on record the great regard that I have for the many volunteers who have worked so hard over so many years to make sure that Coal Creek is the excellent tourist facility that it is and that the important history of coal mining in and around the south Gippsland district is preserved for future generations. 2003-2004 and cognate bills, I want to raise some particular issues with respect to two reports of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, of which I am a member. One report is entitled Money matters in the bush and the other report is entitled ATM fee structure. These two related reports went into a range of issues regarding access to, and availability and serviceability of, banking services in rural and regional Australia in particular-although the report on the ATM fee structure had a slightly wider remit with respect to that issue. The reports, on balance, are broadly endorsed by all members of the committee. However, Labor members disagreed with coalition members on a number of issues, and I would like to focus on those particular areas and recommendations. In the first report-Money matters in the bush-there was some difference of opinion on a number of recommendations. These recommendations covered issues such as notifications for closure of banks, older person and disability access, accounts, balances provided at EFTPOS, Indigenous communities and banking, and community obligations. I will just go through some of those recommendations and highlight some of the differences of opinion in order to make the Main Committee more aware of the concerns that were held. Recommendation 3 in that report related to the question of improved consultation and, in particular, a notice period of some six months to be provided if a branch was the only branch in a town that was left and that branch was to close. Labor certainly support that recommendation. It is actually in line with what our policy has generally been with respect to the issue of branch closures. Our belief, though, is that you should not just look at it from a rural and regional point of view in that respect. It is a very significant issue in those areas, but there are also metropolitan suburbs and communities where branch closures and their circumstances are also quite traumatic for local businesses and communities. Therefore, although we MAIN COMMITTEE",130,Appropriation Bill No 4 2003 2004 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 2 2003 2004
294,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (5.53 P.m.),"In rising today to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3)fully support this recommendation for rural and remote areas, we also believe it ought to be the case for the community in general and should cover branch closures, full stop. Recommendation 4 related to the question of the gathering of data by APRA and concerns about the question of how that was operating. I am going to quote extensively from the committee report in various ways, shapes and forms but, in respect to that matter, Labor members shared the community’s concern that there does need to be improved analysis and commentary on the information provided through the points of presence database. While the committee has requested that another government agency and not APRA be requested to do this, Labor members believe that APRA should have a role in analysing and commenting on the data but that this should be done by APRA in conjunction with the ACCC. Given the ACCC’s role in assessing levels of competition in the banking services industry, they would bring a good deal of expertise to any assessment of access to banking services. We think that more can and should be done there. Recommendation 12 relates to the question of older Australians. Labor supports the priority placed on introducing industry standards to support older Australians and those with disabilities to achieve full and equal access to services such as ATMs and EFTPOS. With respect to recommendation 22 on the issue of expansion of displays of account balances, Labor supports the expansion of EFTPOS facilities to allow for access to account balances. However, there should not be an additional fee for this service and the balance information request should not be considered as a transaction where consumers can only access a limited number of fee-free transactions. It gets back to the issue that we are now at a stage with banking services where, even if you blink at your ATM, you need to respond by paying some sort of fee. The nature of fee payments with respect to this industry has just grown like Topsy over the last few years. It is something that the banks have seen as an ever-growing area for increasing their revenue streams. It is certainly the way that they have been dealing with the benefits of competition that occurred around the Labor government’s reforms in that area regarding things like mortgage providers and interest rates. Another area where concerns were held related to some of the recommendations not going far enough, particularly with respect to the issue of Indigenous communities. Much evidence was taken by the committee on the difficulties confronting Indigenous Australians regarding access to banking services and financial literacy generally. It is apparent that many remote and regional Indigenous communities lack sufficient basic banking services. In some cases it is not an issue of services previously enjoyed being withdrawn but, rather, of services never having been provided at all. As important, the lack of such services is compounded by factors such as remoteness; socioeconomic disadvantage, which in some instances is extreme; poor levels of numeracy and literacy; and, accordingly, low levels of financial literacy, cultural difference and language barriers. Labor members consider that access to basic banking services and minimum levels of financial literacy are preconditions to addressing the disadvantage experienced by many Indigenous communities in remote and regional Australia. There is little point in governments encouraging Indigenous Australians to achieve greater economic independence if the basic building blocks of economic development are not in place. Accordingly, while Labor members were generally supportive of the committee’s recommendations with regard to Indigenous Australians, we also made the following additional MAIN COMMITTEE points. In relation to recommendations 24 and 26, Labor members see a need for a multifaceted strategy to improve the financial literacy of Indigenous Australians which is coordinated by the government and which involves Indigenous organisations, state and territory governments and financial institutions. Whilst we support recommendation 24, which calls for financial literacy to be included in core school curricula, we consider this to be only one of a number of strategies that are required. We also believe the involvement of Indigenous organisations, particularly those with demonstrated success in the area of financial literacy education, to be critical. Further, we consider that recommendation 26 fails to go far enough. It is insufficient to call on the ABA to simply examine the successful practices utilised in Canada in relation to Indigenous financial literacy. In our view, the ABA should develop, in partnership with relevant Indigenous organisations, a comprehensive strategy for improving the financial literacy of Indigenous users of banking services, drawing on the Canadian experience. Labor members are encouraged by some of the initiatives taken by some banks and also by the ABA’s indicated willingness to work with Reconciliation Australia on this issue. However, it is our view that, in the event these voluntary initiatives prove to be insufficient, these issues would properly be considered in the context of compulsory community service obligations. Recommendation 29 related to the issue of the Banking and Financial Services Ombudsman. In particular, Labor members believe that the jurisdiction of the BFSO should be widened further to encompass consumer complaints about the cost of banking services. This is part of that wider discussion. I think the Banking and Financial Services Ombudsman does a pretty good job in many respects; however, the fact of the matter is that he is dramatically limited by the extent of his charter. There are a range of issues which get raised with the BFSO on a regular basis that are not able to be investigated. Those are genuine complaints about the operation of the banking sector but they are complaints which the BFSO is unable to deal with. That is a fault in the system. It means that a range of issues that ought to be investigated are not able to be investigated by an appropriate body such as the BFSO. That is something that I think is incredibly unfortunate. In this particular case, the committee may not have realised the extent of the need but certainly the Labor members do realise that those issues need to be looked at. Going on from that, there is recommendation 30, which from Labor’s point of view related to the issue of supporting the introduction of community service obligations on ADIs. It is a point that we have made repeatedly in the past. We have said that once again we are prepared to look at reregulating the banks if they do not agree to meet appropriate voluntary community service obligations. Our view is that, until we get the banks to the table in a situation where they understand that the regulators and the government of the day are serious, we will not be able to get real movement on a range of issues. The experience with the sector in the past has been that, when they think things are about to happen, you tend to find that they are then prepared to look at what they might do. We believe more can be done in that area. We stress that as something that should be done in the future. I will go on now to the issue of ATM foreign fee structures, which was the subject of a follow-up report that effectively came out of the main report that I have just spoken about. ATMs are a very important part of what is now the banking sector in this country. Many of us hereand no doubt Deputy Speaker Causley would be amongst us-certainly found that initial peMAIN COMMITTEE riod of moving across to using an ATM to be of some difficulty. I know that I did. I do not think that is something to be worried about. In my early years it was a matter of going into a bank branch rather than dealing with the infamous hole in the wall. However, most of us have conquered this to a large degree in the last 20 years or so and now it is something that we have taken for granted as being a bread-and-butter part of the banking sector. However, there are many things that a hole in the wall cannot do. The experience right across Australia, particularly in rural and regional areas, is that bank branches are the sorts of services that go. We lose the bricks and mortar and the services which relate to that. We are seeing in a range of ways more innovative solutions now being used to deal with some of these issues. That is a good thing, but the bottom line-and this is something that the committee found in its inspections-is that there is still a general and genuine view pervading the community in many rural and regional areas that, although in many respects the new services were good and occasionally in some respects they were better, overall service delivery had dropped and that that was detrimental to the operation of the local community. When you take away those banking services, you end up in a situation where they are simply the first things to go. Then the stores start to leave. The next thing you know-and we saw them-some towns effectively almost turn into ghost towns, not quite overnight but certainly in the passing of merely several years. With ATMs the question is: what is happening with respect to the fee structures in those areas? A review is going on at the moment, looking at the question of ATM fees, and there is a working party of the industry, which has come forth with some recommendations about how to deal with those fees. In a nutshell, it involves the abolition of certain fees and a recommendation for more transparency in charges so that when you look at an ATM you would be able to see what you would be charged for undertaking a particular transaction. In the scope of that, there would effectively be a deregulation of what we call foreign ATM fees-that is, when you use an ATM of another institution. In my case, as a Commonwealth Bank customer, if I were using a Westpac, an ANZ Bank or a National Australia Bank ATM, it would be a question of what fee would be charged in those circumstances. By deregulating this area, the concern is that we would potentially find absolutely exorbitant fees being charged, particularly in rural and regional areas but also in some metropolitan areas, depending on the particular circumstances. The situation with respect to rural and regional Australia is that it is potentially very damaging. Certainly some of the evidence that was taken at the hearing into this matter highlighted that. The representative from the Country Women’s Association, Chris Connolly from the University of New South Wales and representatives from the Australian Consumers Association stressed the fact that many things could happen in this area and that the international experience suggested very clearly that rural and regional communities should be very concerned about what might happen. We are talking about a situation where, over the last decade or so, some 750 branches have closed, and those communities have been put into a situation where they need to use electronic banking. Forty per cent of Australian transactions were at foreign ATMs, and this proportion is likely to be higher in the bush where there is often only one bank in a town and therefore not the same level of choice that you would have in metropolitan areas. In my case MAIN COMMITTEE now, because of these sorts of fees, I look for Commonwealth Bank ATMs rather than using another institution’s ATM, because I know that I will be dealing with some additional cost. a new experienceyou can teach an old dog new tricks in some cases-but not always. The transaction rate even now, with respect to these fees, can range between $1.35 and $2. When you look at the movement in these foreign ATM fees as they currently stand, before we go to deregulation, you see that they have increased by something like 250 per cent since 1995. What we are saying is that there are several bottom lines which ought to be the basis of the implementation of these reforms and which we worry about, given the report as it currently stands and where the working party is up to with respect to recommendations. Firstly, we believe that any change should reduce the overall cost of banking to customers. This should be a logical conclusion of these changes, because the fact is that, when you do an examination of the actual cost to the institution for undertaking this service compared to the fees that are charged for electronic transactions, those fees are almost invariably at a significantly higher level of profit than is reasonable for the provision of the service. There should be-and, in our view, there must be-a reduction in the overall cost of banking to customers in this area. We also need to ensure that customers in regional areas are not slugged with higher fees than those charged in the major cities. I will come back to that in a minute. We need to prevent institutions with large ATM networks from using their market power to impose higher charges on customers of smaller institutions. One of the recommendations in the report which Labor has strong concerns about is recommendation 1. I will read out that recommendation. It mentions the creation of ‘safeguards that would ensure that people living in country towns and remote communities do not incur significantly higher fees or charges for using a foreign ATM and that an unreasonable or unwarranted differential in fees and charges between those in rural and remote areas and those in metropolitan areas does not develop’. The key point there is ‘an unreasonable or unwarranted differential in fees and charges’. Although the majority of the committee said that we should not be in a situation where there is an increase in charges for certain areas, that is actually conceding that there is scope for-and, in fact, it is effectively endorsing-differential fee charging. While it is saying that it should not be unreasonable or unwarranted, it is still saying there is not a problem with it actually occurring. The member for Wannon is present today and I am sure he would be concerned about what the results might be there. Going by this recommendation, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services has basically said that it is okay to have a differential rate for foreign ATM transactions between the city and the country. That is what it has basically said. It has said that the differential should not be unreasonable or unwarranted, but it is still saying it can be there. The fact of the matter-and the member for Wannon has some expertise in these matters, given that he is the chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration-is that, over time, we have MAIN COMMITTEE",134,Appropriation Bill No 4 2003 2004 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 2 2003 2004

298,Mr Griffin,"and out of character, as he says, but there you go. It just goes to show thatseen a lot of evidence on the way that banking institutions have operated with respect to the provision of services. I think that, if we asked many members of the public and certainly many members of parliament who deal with regional and rural areas in particular whether the actions of the banks with respect to branch closures over the years have been reasonable or warranted, we would find that, in many cases, there would be significant concerns. The fact is that being reasonable and not introducing unwarranted changes is not something that we have come to expect from banking in this country. We can be sure that, with this sort of change, when you open the door they will use every capacity to try to make sure they keep that door open and use it to great effect. That has been the experience in this area where you have had changes and scope for fee increases. Look at the increase we have seen in fees just in this case under the current system-some 250 per cent since 1995, just with this type of fee. When you look at the situation with fees overall, right across the board with banking, you know that they have a very different view of what is unreasonable or unwarranted. I am not convinced by the guarantees from the banks. I am not convinced from the wording of that particular recommendation from the committee that what we are going to see is a situation where rural and regional communities get a fair go. I think we are in real danger now of seeing a divide developing-a divide that will mean that it is more expensive than it should be for people in those sorts of communities. I want to make it very clear: the Labor Party will not stand by and let this occur. Other parties have to look at their positions on this, but they can be very clear that we will not stand by and let this happen.

I have had the opportunity to talk about this phenomenon in my local area, where we see a decline in the levels of bulk-billing and an increase in the number of people who are attending the accident and emergency centre of the Northern Hospital. Something in excess of 60 per cent of attendances there are categories 4 and 5, which could be dealt with by general practitioners if they were available. Part of the reason that people attend the hospital is the lack of after-hours services by GPs, the low level of GPs in the outer suburban area that I represent and the fact that there is a decline in the levels of bulk-billing. The second point in the second reading amendment was on inadequate funding and higher fees for students seeking access to higher education. This debate occurs at a time when one of the local universities servicing the northern suburbs of Melbourne, La Trobe University, has indicated that it will increase its HECS fees by 25 per cent. This is making it harder for people, at a crucial time in their lives, to make the decision to go forward and take the opportunity that tertiary education gives them. It is no use saying that because of the way the HECS system works they are able to defer the payment. These people know that at the end of their course they are going to have an increased level of indebtedness that they are going to have to work off during their lifetime, which is an impediment to their decision to go forward to tertiary education. The third item is the growing number of families who are financially squeezed in trying to balance work and family. In the outer suburbs of Melbourne this is clearly identified by the MAIN COMMITTEE",138,Appropriation Bill No 4 2003 2004 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 2 2003 2004
299,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (6.13 P.m.),"In rising to speak in this debate on Appropriationway in which people are feeling the squeeze of trying to establish their family home, juggle their responsibilities with family and, at the same time, stay in employment-often where they have to travel long distances, because a lack of local infrastructure to support them is getting to a crucial stage. The last item in the second reading amendment is the 500,000 Australians waiting up to five years to get their teeth fixed. I have had the opportunity to talk about the need for the Commonwealth’s involvement in a dental health scheme on a number of occasions. As each day goes by it is clear that there could be great advantage brought about if the Commonwealth were to decide to enter into a partnership with the state and territory governments and community organisations that are working in this field to ensure that we can get back to a negligible waiting list, as we saw when the Commonwealth Dental Health Scheme was in existence. Today, I want to use the opportunity provided by this wide-ranging debate on these appropriation bills to talk about the way we discuss public issues in the Australian parliament. I want to illustrate this by using four examples of current issues being discussed to indicate not only the ways in which the parliament could display its strengths but also the weaknesses in the way we deal with things. I want to try to suggest ways we can improve parliamentary discussion of important issues. The first item I want to mention is the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD: Intelligence on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. As an aside, I am pleased that the committee’s secretary is in the chamber at the moment and I congratulate her on her involvement in this report. This is an important example of the way in which this parliament can work at its finest. Subsequent to the report being released, I am yet to be convinced that it is being handled in a proper way. I was a little disappointed that only half an hour was available for discussion of this during Monday’s private members’ business. That is no reflection on those who allocate the time, but it illustrates my point. Especially in this case, when there are four members of the House of Representatives who are members of the committee, they should have been given a longer time than five or ten minutes to talk about it in the chamber. I hope that we get an opportunity as a parliament to discuss the contents of the report, because the items that this report covers are very important. They are not only important for the historical basis of the government’s decision to involve Australian troops in Iraq but also, as I have had the opportunity to say before, as an example of public policy decision making and the way in which a government portrays the information it has and uses as the basis for a decision, which then leads-if it is not done carefully-to a distrust of the way in which those decisions are made. It is really about the political scenario that the government used to, in a way, pick the items which were available to it that it wished to latch onto. The other elements go to more rigorous investigation and examination of the information available. But most importantly it goes to the way in which that information was used in justifying to the community decisions that the government made. If on this occasion, as I believe, this information was used to the extent that decisions were brought forward long before they really had to be made, there is a large part of the public that then, on that basis, asks, ‘Why would we in future believe any of the decisions that a government makes to commit troops overseas?’ I hope that as a parliament we get an opportunity to more fully discuss this report. The second item I wish to reflect upon is the US free trade agreement. It will not surprise members that I approach this with a great deal of caution, right down to the fact that I would MAIN COMMITTEE be much happier if we were actually talking about a fair trade agreement with the United States. That perhaps gives a hint about the angle that I come from. That is perhaps not the majority view of the Australian parliament. I am not sure that it is the majority view of the Australian Labor Party. But I will simply keep up the fight. I think it is an angle from which we have to approach these problems and from which we can improve our best interest in dealing with our trading partners and opponents. My beef about the United States free trade agreement is that, in the two to three weeks since the late Australian time that this was settled upon, (a) we have not seen the detail of the document and (b) there has not been a proper discussion by the parliament about the free trade agreement. Critics will say that I am being unfair because when this appears magically after being legally scrubbed-or whatever the technical terms are for the state that it is in at the moment-it will be going to the committee systems of the parliament, and that should suffice. But I believe this is a situation in which there should have been a ministerial statement and in which there should have been a debate. Since this agreement has been cobbled together into its final state there have been 17 questions without notice, including three today from the opposition. But before today there were 14, four of which came from the opposition and 10 from government members. At the end of the day, those 10 are dorothy dixers. Within the limitations of the standing orders-and again I do not wish to reflect upon decisions made by people about the legitimacy of questions under the standing orders-they are used to elicit an angle, to allow the Minister for Trade to get up and give the government’s spin and angle. Instead of that government spin and angle about this free trade agreement there should have been an announcement by way of a ministerial statement in the parliament about the government’s view on the agreement. That would have led to a response by the opposition and perhaps somewhere down the track a fuller discussion by members of both houses about the intent of the agreement. I am surprised that this has not occurred if we are to believe the government when they say that this is an important agreement. If it is so important, it should have been subject to a discussion and a debate. As I have said, the fact that these matters are not sufficiently discussed is a flaw in the way in which we deal with them. This is something that perhaps should have had fuller discussion during the negotiations. There were a lot of views about. I do not think it is an unhealthy prospect that in a parliamentary democracy like ours there should be a divergence of views. I note that the government seems to want to fit the opposition in its view about the free trade agreement by indicating that it is motivated by pure anti-Americanism and things like that. It has been clear from the outset that the Leader of the Opposition has said that he wants to look at this agreement with Australia’s best interests in view. It is pretty hard to do that when you do not have the detail of the agreement. Having said that, I think we have been fairly consistent in the view that we have about this agreement-that it should be viewed in that way. One of the shortcomings-because of the things that have been in and out, the things that are at the edges and the timetables that are used in some sectors-is whether it is a comprehensive trade agreement, which is a necessity if we are going to have a bilateral agreement. The third issue that I wish to raise-and I wish to express a great disappointment about the way in which the parliament has been treated in this case-is the Treasurer’s statement of last week about Australia’s demographic challenges. I honestly do not know where he delivered MAIN COMMITTEE his address-that is only because I have not done the proper research-but what I know is that it was not done in the parliament. And if this is such an important issue, as perhaps quite rightly the Treasurer has flagged, then this place is the venue where this should have been discussed. WhilstI note that a couple of the papers that were released at the address allow for public discussion, this address clearly could have been a ministerial statement. Again, there has been a missed opportunity to use the venue that the parliament provides for the proper discussion. If it was good enough for the Treasurer to release his Intergenerational Report at the time of the 2002-03 budget and if this is a work in progress that arises from that, it should have come in to the parliament. As I understand it, none of these documents that were released last week have become parliamentary papers. They actually have no status within the parliamentary procedures, and this is a great disappointment. I would love to have the opportunity directly, not through asides during this debate, to give my comments about the lack of direction that I think these documents show about Australia’s demographic challenges and to properly debate the meagre propositions that the Treasurer has put forward as solutions: the notion that we should work till we drop and things like that. This is an issue that should be debated. It should have been presented as a ministerial statement; the papers should be parliamentary papers that are open to discussion. Finally, the fourth thing I want to raise to illustrate my disappointment about the way in which the parliament is not being used properly is to touch upon Indigenous health. The week before last, the Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation held a conference about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. The Indigenous health rights campaign launch I think was on 18 February. Directly, my interest in this arises from my membership of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs when it produced its report, Health is life: a report on the inquiry into Indigenous health. At the time, we wanted to make sure that this was the last time that there was a need for such a report and that we set out the basis for the way in which Australia could go forward with its Indigenous people to improve the health of those Indigenous people. When this committee inquiry was launched there was some suspicion that it was an attempt in some way to be negative about what was going on with a clear inference that perhaps there had been excessive expenditure which had drawn little results in the improvement of Indigenous people’s health. Clearly, our inquiry showed that the additional amount of money that is spent on the health of Indigenous Australians is actually meagre when compared to nonIndigenous Australians. At the ANTaR launch two weeks ago, the AMA’s 2003 report card says that the level of health spending for Indigenous people is 22 per cent higher than for nonIndigenous people, but the need is 200 per cent greater. Really it is not surprising given the state of Indigenous Australian’s health that there would be an additional amount being placed at the disposal of those charged with improving the health of Indigenous people. But it is minor; that amount is minor compared to the need. We really have to face up to that. After the committee’s report Health is life in May 2000, it disappointed me to read the speeches and papers delivered at the Indigenous health launch on 18 February. There was a speech, for instance, by the AMA President Dr Bill Glasson that says things like, ‘We should ask ourselves why Indigenous Australians are admitted to hospital at twice the rate of nonIndigenous people?’ He said in his speech: MAIN COMMITTEE I believe all Australians should ask the question why one group of people in our community faces a health reality worse than people in many third world countries. In their report card, there is a graph, and it shows the relationship between the percentage of the Australian population as a whole expected to live to age 65 and the percentage of Aboriginal Australian males and Aboriginal Australian females expected to live to age 65. The figures for Aboriginal people are below the figures for people in countries such as Nigeria, Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Thailand and Vietnam. I seek leave to incorporate the graph in Hansard. Leave granted. The graph read as followsIndigenous health today-I owe it to a lot of people that helped the committee’s inquiry three or four years ago to return to these items-I make the point that my disappointment is that we do not discuss this issue enough in these venues, whether it be the Main Committee, the main chamber or the Senate. This is something which should always be in the eyes of the Australian parliament. The report of the committee in 2000 suggested that there be annual reporting to the parliament. The reason for this was deliberate: it was so that these facts would be in our faces as legislators so that we could not ignore them. MAIN COMMITTEE",139,Appropriation Bill No 4 2003 2004 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 2 2003 2004
300,Mr Jenkins,"I thank the honourable member for Wannon. In these brief remarks aboutWhen you look at the facts on the AMA report card, you see that diabetes is eight times higher, respiratory conditions are four times higher and circulatory conditions are three times higher for Aboriginal Australians than they are for the rest of the population. The life expectancy of Indigenous Australians is still 20 years less than it is for non-Indigenous Australians. When we compare that figure to the figure for comparable countries, such as the United States and New Zealand, we see that the gap is only five to seven years. And they believe that they have a problem. They understand that that is not good enough. But why is there such a disparity? Why is there a disparity of something like 15 years in the outcomes? We need to make sure we have discussions about how we can best improve the way in which Indigenous communities can best deal with these problems. This has to be a partnership. We cannot let the events of a couple of weeks back in Redfern cloud our judgment about the ability of Indigenous communities to deal with these issues. When they put forward their view about what is required, we need to listen to them and we need to act upon those suggestions. When people come forward, like at the launch of ANTaR, we should listen to them and work with people who are working in the area to make sure that we improve the things that deal directly not only with health but also proper housing, access to employment and, most importantly, their sense of belonging and their sense of grievance for past acts. That is one of the conditions that needs to be addressed. In other countries it has been addressed and there are indications that it has led to improved health outcomes. (Time expired) Ms O’BYRNE (Bass) (6.33 p.m.)-It is with a heavy heart that I rise today to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004 and associated legislation and to outline the past eight years of this government’s charter, which has included much wastage which has been covered up by even more fibbing. There are significant opportunities now to build a community that provides greater prospects for all its members. But the reality is that this government continues to augment the growing divide between the priorities on this side of the House and those on the other. In my electorate of Bass the constituents that I have are concerned about the issues that affect their daily lives-the issues that this government continues to sweep under the mat through its refusal to treat them as significant. These issues are appropriate access to health care, access to education, access to appropriate employment, access to a high standard of aged care, as well as looking after the environment, safety in the home and community and being able to properly care and provide for their own families. At the beginning of this year a Roy Morgan research poll of Australians showed that the divide between Australia’s richest and poorest was continuing to grow-a trend the Australian Council of Social Services believes is related to rising levels of crime and disparities in literacy and other basic life skills. When these results were published, ACOSS President Andrew McCallum said: The rich-poor divide should not be made worse by the major political parties using the budget surplus and a federal election to offer some voters a tax cut. This would mean the poorest people in this country-those who don’t have a job-will get no benefit from a cut. At the same time the capacity of our national government to address urgent problems in health, education and welfare would be reduced. He suggested that it would be of much greater benefit to turn around this divide in more practical ways, such as using the budget surplus to help lowand middle-income families by imMAIN COMMITTEE proving the family tax benefit system, to get help to those people who need it most; use it to improve the value of rent assistance for jobless people and reduce the impact of housing related poverty; to increase the opportunities for job training, whether through increased TAFE and university places or through greater real work opportunities; to enhance universal health care services such as bulk-billing for a doctor; or for equal access to education. These types of solutions are sensible solutions to problems that are significant to the people of Bass and the people of Australia. These are, in fact, the types of solutions that the government itself had identified previously in its work and family policy documents, which have recently been discovered in leaked cabinet documents-documents that the government is now seeking to cover up. They are solutions that were discarded by a government more interested in spending much-needed money for social services on increased defence capability and security measures-a decision that has only served to destroy the government’s credibility and highlight its disregard for the Australian people. However, these solutions included things like more flexible working arrangements for women returning to the work force from parental leave, and addressing the hardship created by inconsistencies in the family benefits system. But instead the government chose to allow families to continue to fend for themselves, while the Prime Minister played cowboys and Indians in the United States. While the Prime Minister has been off playing deputy sheriff, he has left his ministers home alone-and oh, dear, what a mess they have made while they have been left alone. The government’s ministers have succeeded in utter mismanagement and waste of funds in all essential services. They have succeeded in reprioritising what should be the government’s agenda-that is, the insurance of the well-being of all Australians. The Minister for Health and Ageing, when he speaks about health, has gone one step further towards completely destroying access to health care services, while the Minister for Education, Science and Training has managed to further alienate Australian students who have worked hard for a place in a university-not to mention the Minister for Ageing, who it appears has great difficulty finding anybody who will play nice with her. The latest bulk-billing figures were released recently and again show a drop in the percentage of people who are able to access a bulk-billing doctor. The national average has now dropped a further 3.1 per cent to 66.5 per cent, and in Bass it is sitting now at 43.6 per centthe lowest in Tasmania. If the government really believes that its MedicarePlus policy will have any benefit for providing appropriate health care services then it is even more out of touch than anyone could have previously thought. The MedicarePlus policy will do nothing to solve falling bulk-billing rates. Bulk-billing rates have been failing consistently under this government, and everything it does completely undermines getting access to a doctor. This policy further takes away the universality of the Medicare system and discriminates against those not in the lowest socioeconomic group. It will advance a two-tiered arrangement, where people will fall through the cracks, unable to access any type of health service. It is not good enough that the government continues on its path to create two-tiered systems in all our basic services-systems that only lead to further increases in the divisions between the richest and the poorest in our communities. Another developing two-tiered system is the education system, a system where wealthier families are able to buy places in universities while the number of HECS places for the not so wealthy families, whose children have MAIN COMMITTEE worked hard through their secondary school years to earn a place on merit but miss out because of decreases in funded places, has declined. However, the government has assured us all that there was a definite increase in the number of places, and in fact says it increased the number of places at the University of Tasmania by 1,003. It appears that it is a little confused here. If the government funded an extra 1,003 places at the University of Tasmania, how does that explain the fact that the number of students who missed out on a place this year was 1,606, compared to the 1,416 students who missed out on a place last year? By most calculations, this is actually an increase of 190 students-or 13.4 per cent-who missed out. It seems that the government has been tricking us and has not really created an extra 1,003 new places but has reallocated existing places that were previously funded on the cheap. The government has a dismal record in education policy. It has no commitment to ensuring talented students have access to affordable education. Its only education commitment is towards a user pays system-a system that destroys the opportunity unless you can pay for it. Of course access to a university education, while important, is not a priority for everyone, and in Bass there are many more people who are concerned because they cannot get access to TAFE courses and appropriate job training courses. Even in an environment where there are significant identified skill shortages, many younger people cannot get into skills based training because the government simply refuses to fund the appropriate training facilities. The government also continues to prop up the Job Network system despite it being a significantly flawed financial model that the minister and the government continue to throw even more money at in an attempt to bail it out. The Job Network continues to fail the long-term unemployed, and data collected through the Department of Family and Community Services shows that the number of people who have been unemployed for more than a year is up by almost 6,000 since November last year. In Bass the unemployment figures are currently sitting at nine per cent. How does the government expect to help people back into the work force when it continues to slash labour market programs by $1 billion a year? How can we be expected to trust the government to assist unemployed people if it continues to do a slash and burn program on all the programs that are in place to help them? The other area causing major concern in my electorate is that of aged care. We look forward to the elusive Hogan report into aged care services-the report commissioned by the government, the report that has so far cost $7.2 million, but the report that the minister refuses to release. Interestingly, today, Professor Hogan, the author of the report has started to talk about it himself, probably getting fed up with the government not doing it. In Bass, aged care services are in trouble. There are currently 11 aged care services in the north-east and the providers hold grave fears that if the government funding is not increased then many of these services will simply not be able to remain operational. These services are telling me that there is a real danger that many Tasmanian services will have to close their doors because they are not able to remain financial under the current subsidies. It is not just closing businesses; it is closing people’s homes. In Tasmania, service providers have identified issues like funding equalisation as significant because it essentially means that the funding for Tasmanian aged care services will continue to decrease in order to bring the national funding level into line. It is not a bad idea to have a national funding adjustment but it should be done so that states are not disadvantaged. It is not a viable option MAIN COMMITTEE when the subsidy rates in one state are decreased leading to a significant difficulty in maintaining the current standards. These reductions are really hurting aged care services in Tasmania. They are impacting on the ability of services to not only maintain the level of care they are renowned for but also to simply survive. This is a point that has been further compounded by the decisions by the Salvation Army to sell off 15 of its 19 aged care services across Australia and the Seventh Day Adventist Church to sell its two services in Tasmania. These are decisions that have caused great distress to organisations that have done excellent jobs in the provision of a high standard of aged care over the years but which now say that they can no longer viably and with good conscience provide such services. The Seventh Day Adventist Church has already sold its services to the Presbyterian Church, which continues to provide services to its residents. The Salvation Army is now in negotiations with prospective buyers for Tyler Village, which provides a home for 75 residents and employment for 85 staff in Launceston. With such organisations saying that the system is unmanageable, what hope is there for a robust future for the aged care industry under this government? The government also has to stop treating older people like second-class citizens. The services that the government is refusing to fund appropriately are people’s homes; they are part of their lives. The government must stop its dehumanisation of older people and release the report into aged care services so that it can start engaging in the debate about the best way to appropriately fund and manage aged care services, not about the best way to get out of it. Let us be frank: why stop at older the people? This government really has to stop its complete disinterest in anyone who cannot directly contribute to its election coffers. Take the treatment of essential services in regional Australia as a point in case. The government recently saw it as necessary to close the Launceston Bureau of Meteorology because it was apparently not cost-effective. However, an unexpected community outcry saw it making policy on the run again and it decided at the same time to suddenly open a shopfront experiment in order to pacify the locals and stop the community backlash about the loss of more regional services and more regional jobs. What is really interesting is that in estimates, only three days before, the bureau made no mention of any future plan to set up a shopfront. Yet, after severely underestimating the reaction that such a closure would have in Launceston, they have suddenly announced plans that were apparently on the agenda for a very long time. This decision has been made in order to satisfy the reported 15 per cent funding cut across the board, at least in Tasmania, that the government has enforced-cuts that are part of an ongoing budgetary squeeze by the government, which includes refusals to fund staff pay rises or even supplement pay rises cuts that have seen the bureau’s budget dwindling ever lower since they were forced to take action, in this case, to downsize services or, as Dr Love called it in estimates, ‘de-man.’ Based on this, the government must be asked how it can justify or clarify its $27 million fit-out for the bureau’s Melbourne head office as a cost-effective measure, while the salaries for three positions in a regional weather office are not. I am told that the bureau had no consultation with the Launceston office about its decision to centralise services in Hobart. It was a decision made at a management level for an economic reason and a decision that in turn significantly increases the workload in the Hobart office. Staff down there have not been consulted, so they do not know how they will provide the service either. MAIN COMMITTEE How will the government ensure that the local weather information accessed by the Launceston community, such as farmers or the local winemaker who calls the office each year to discuss the forward forecast at length, remains? The winemaker plans his grape picking schedule by this forecast. What about the marine industry, the professional fishers, the builders and the myriad outdoor occupations that rely on the quality daily contact they have with the Launceston office? How will these professionals have access to the same standard of service from an overworked, overloaded and unconsulted team based in Hobart with very limited local knowledge? Professional meteorologists are telling me that replacing people with automatic instruments is not the answer. Instruments cannot report visibility or the extent of mist or fog and they cannot identify cloud types or distinguish between sea state and swell height. This decision should not be based purely on economics; it should also be assessed as a significant safety issue, as well as an industrial issue. And while the government has said it will create two new positions at the shopfront service, it has said that the current staff who hold their jobs and have held them for some time will have to reapply for those jobs, because it refuses to transfer them over. It is unfortunate that, as an economic issue, the government is assessing the future of the Bureau of Meteorology, particularly because of the impact on regional areas. The Launceston office was first, but I understand that there are in fact plans to possibly shed up to another 140 jobs across all the regional weather bureaus. This type of action would be a terrible blight on regional areas not only in terms of the loss of employment in regions but also because of the loss of essential regional services-services that should not be centralised to the nearest capital city. Another example of how this government carries out its consultative processes is the National Airspace System. This is a system that has been one calamity after another, and I am sure members are aware that I have followed this quite closely. It is a completely inappropriate system for Australia’s airspace. It was introduced with no consideration of industry concerns. It is missing vital safety information and there has been no appropriate training or assessment for pilots. The National Airspace System has essentially turned Australia’s airspace into what has been described as an unprecedented unsafe operating environment culminating in what was a serious near miss in the airspace above Launceston on Christmas Eve last year. This incident lead to a review of the system by the government’s own Transport Safety Bureau, which found that the National Airspace System posed a safety risk and recommended a review. It has also led to the announcement yesterday that AirServices Australia is planning on moving a transportable radar unit to Launceston to assist Melbourne based air traffic controllers and to increase aircraft surveillance over Tasmania. This system is normally stored in Melbourne, but is to be kept operational in Launceston because under the current airspace system with the type and volume of commercial and general aviation traffic, the airspace in Tasmania has become unsafe. However, if someone else’s machine breaks down, the Launceston machine will be moved to go and fix up someone else’s airspace, which means we return the Launceston air space to being very dangerous once again. It is frightening that the minister and the government are prepared to put public safety ahead of their stubborn determination to implement such a system. It is a determination which saw the minister convene industry advisory groups consisting only of those people prepared to share his point of view. The Howard government’s cost-cutting agenda is dangerous and raises the question of how we can more effectively leverage regional development through the MAIN COMMITTEE deployment of more government agencies to regional Australia. It also raises the issue of how the government can use its capital assets spend of some $60 billion a year to benefit regional Australia. As a major purchaser of goods and services, the government currently promotes national competitive advantage and Australian and New Zealand industry development. I believe it is time for government procurement policies to be broadened to encompass regional Australia. The government notes that there is a ‘critical strategic role that government procurement plays within the Australian community.’ The rhetoric is not supported by specific procurement policies to assist regional communities. As we know, regional centres are well known for offering cost-effective accommodation options, innovative small business, stability in the work force-and I must say that $27 million will get you an awful lot of office accommodation in Launceston. The government publishes contracts and standing offers with a value of $2,000 or moreand I note that the Department of Finance and Administration publish some extremely highlevel statistics which are drawn from this data. I would like to suggest that the Department of Finance and Administration publish statistics on the amount of government purchasing which is actually sourced from suppliers based in regional Australia. Procurement is being seen as a strategic business tool within the private sector, but not by the Howard government. A more strategic focus on government procurement can result in significant benefits to the Australian community. In fact, every one per cent saving that can be made results in a $600 million benefit. Let us not forget the inefficiencies that exist and the benefits that can accrue from improved procurement practices. While industry is struggling with the cost of tendering in large procurement projects, we are still focused on simplistic initiatives such as putting tenders on the Internet. It seems the Howard government is still struggling with that. After multiple false starts, the National Office of the Information Economy is struggling to get agency support with the latest AusTender initiative. How can we deal with the big-ticket issues when the basics are so hard for this government? Surely we have to move towards establishing an office of strategic procurement to streamline processes and to look for opportunities to maximise the benefit being derived from government procurement. There is a general failing when it comes to the government spending taxpayers’ money. How many examples do we need? Here is another one. How about the Customs Integrated Cargo System, a $100 million blow-out? Even with grant funds, the Howard government just cannot get it right. The government plundered a significant amount of funds through its Networking the Nation program. Many projects are not sustainable and not delivering long-term benefits, through sheer poor management by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Let us be absolutely clear on the poor management of these programs. ANAO audit report No. 12 2003-04 stated that the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts failed to ‘translate the government’s program objectives into operational objectives that would have helped to establish an appropriate performance management framework to monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of program delivery’. ANAO found that the extent of the increase in telecommunications infrastructure development in regional areas would be difficult to demonstrate because no baseline data was collected at the start of the program and so no targets were set. MAIN COMMITTEE Let us highlight the failed Intelligent Island Program that the Howard government trotted out to ensure the passage of the Telstra first tranche. The Tasmanian ICT industry has been conned, jilted and spat out by this government. I have had a constant stream of constituents presenting case after case where the Intelligent Island management has led them up the proverbial garden path, wasting their time and money and with no intention of ever assisting them-just stringing them along. The $40 million allocated to this program would have been better augmented by Commonwealth investment in the Tasmanian Electronic Commerce Centre. We may then have had a sustainable program, a program which could have expanded nationally to provide assistance to other regions right around Australia. But of course the Howard government did not have the foresight, despite the efforts of many to convince them that the Intelligent Island Program was, frankly, not that intelligent. So we are now faced with an Intelligent Island basket case, which people are running around trying to salvage. At least the meagre amounts of funds provided to the Intellinc initiative appear to have been placed in competent hands. This government has had eight years of fibbing and eight years of wasting. Where there is waste, there is a nice little web of intrigue wrapped around it to cover it up. But it is the Australian people who have been the victims of this charade being masked as governance. The Australian people have been the victims of this government’s malady of a reverse Robin Hood syndrome, a syndrome that sees it uncontrollably take from the poor and give to the rich. It is time this government sought assistance for its condition and started to address the myriad problems it has created and the projects it has impaired rather than continue with its agenda of more wastage and more fibs. Ms GILLARD (Lalor) (6.53 p.m.)-I take this opportunity in the wide-ranging debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004, the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004 to firstly raise an issue of great concern to my electorate of Lalor. It is an issue that members of the House would have heard me raise on a number of occasions-some might suggest on so many that they are perhaps a bit bored with it. But it is an important issue. That issue is of course the future of the Point Cook RAAF base, which is within my electorate. A very important announcement was made on Sunday about the Point Cook RAAF base by the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, the member for McEwen, Ms Fran Bailey. After years of community campaigning, the Howard government has agreed that Point Cook will remain in Commonwealth ownership and that its day-to-day management will be put in the hands of a trust composed of aviation and heritage groups-including the Point Cook Action Group, Point Cook Operations Ltd, a not-for-profit company which was formed specifically with the intention of becoming a manager of the site, and the National Trust-so that this very special place can be managed in the long term, in keeping with its heritage values and its very great history. The announcement on Sunday has delighted the local community and those who have fought long and hard to see this sort of outcome for Point Cook. I think it is important to remind ourselves that Point Cook is a truly historic site, a site of national significance. As you may be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, Point Cook is the oldest airstrip in the world that is still functioning as an airstrip. It has many of its original features, including hangars and heritage listed buildings. It was established in 1913 as the Central Flying School, and the airstrip has been in continuous use ever since. It is therefore the birthplace of the RAAF and a MAIN COMMITTEE place of international significance, as the oldest airstrip in the world still being used as an airstrip. When we talk about the Central Flying School being started at Point Cook in 1913, it is important that we get some perspective about that, because we need to remember that in terms of aviation history the first ever flight with a person on board took place on 17 December 1903. So a mere 10 years after man’s first venture with flight, Point Cook was operating a flying school, and planes have been flying from there ever since. Apart from having history around the length of aviation service, it is the birthplace, as I have said, of the Australian Flying Corps and the Royal Australian Air Force. It was the departure point for the first north-south and east-west crossings of the continent by air and for the first aerial circumnavigation of the continent. Recognising its historic nature, Point Cook is home to both the RAAF museum and the RAAF chapel. With a site of this significance, which has continuously been in Commonwealth ownership, one would have thought that its future, that preserving its history, would always have been at the forefront of the Commonwealth’s mind, but unfortunately that has not been the case. It was determined in 1997, as part of the Defence Efficiency Review and the Defence Force Reform Program that Point Cook was to be sold, that it was to move from Commonwealth ownership. When I was elected to this parliament in 1998, being aware of the importance of the Point Cook site to the local community, I immediately sought a briefing from representatives of the then Defence Estates Organisation on what was proposed for the future of Point Cook. As we hunched over maps of the site, I was told that, from the point of view of the Defence Estates Organisation, whilst the RAAF museum would continue to operate from the site and whilst they would carve out a heritage precinct that had to be respected, as far as they were concerned, a freehold purchaser of the site would be able to do whatever they wanted to do with the remainder of the site. When I specifically asked them whether that would include closing the site so that it could no longer be used for aviation, they said that that would be all right. When I specifically asked them whether it would be possible for the site to be used for housing development, they said that that would be all right. When I specifically asked them whether it would be possible for the site to be used for industrial development, they said that that would be all right. So, from the point of view of the Howard government at that stage, they were contemplating a future where the oldest operational airstrip in the world would no longer be an airstrip, where the RAAF museum could end up marooned in a sea of housing or incompatible industrial development, and where thereafter the RAAF museum would have been limited to static displays of planes because it would not have been able to engage in heritage aviation and it would no longer have been situated at an operating airfield. Having received that brief, I was rightly appalled. I found that in my local community, in the heritage community across Australia and in the aviation community across Australia, people were as appalled as me and I found that there was already in train a community campaign to try to ensure that Point Cook stayed in the ownership of the Commonwealth, that it was managed in a way which was always compatible with its heritage values and that it operated as an airstrip. The depth of that community campaign can be shown by the fact that quite quickly more than 10,000 signatures were assembled on a petition which I was able to table in the House. In my capacity as local member I brought together the groups that were interested in the future of Point Cook and they were quite quickly able to agree on a vision whereby Point Cook was MAIN COMMITTEE managed by a not-for-profit company formed by aviation enthusiasts and former members of the RAAF. The vision of that not-for-profit company-Point Cook Operations Ltd-was to have Point Cook managed in the long term as an aviation heritage, tourist and educational precinct. This would build on its strengths, its heritage value, its aviation value, the fact that the RAAF Museum is located there and the fact that flight training was occurring from Point Cook then, and continues to occur there now through RMIT. That was the vision that people were prepared to very actively campaign for. I should note the following individuals as people who have put in huge service to this community campaign: Mark Pilkington, who has led the Point Cook Action Group, the preservation society that has always had at the forefront of its activities ensuring that Australia did not lose this historic asset for all time; Peter Scully; Gary Westley; and Brad Owens. Each of them contributed to Point Cook Operations Ltd and to bringing its vision of the site together. Each of them, particularly Peter Scully, contributed to very active lobbying of members of parliament to ensure that people understood the true significance of Point Cook. If members are ever passing through or are in the vicinity of my electorate of Lalor-they are welcome, as long as I know they are there and what they are doing!-one of the things they should do is visit the RAAF Museum. They should meet there my friend Dave Gardner, who is the director of the museum, and they should take the opportunity to experience the history that lives and breathes all around you when you are at Point Cook. I say congratulations to each of the people who has been in a leadership role in this community campaign. Their work saw fruit on Sunday when the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence agreed that this community campaign had had the right idea all along and that Point Cook should be kept in Commonwealth ownership and should be leased for the longer term to a trust. Active in that trust will be the stalwarts of this campaign: people from the Point Cook Action Group and people from Point Cook Operations Ltd, who will be able to manage the site over the longer term in a way that is compatible with its heritage and aviation values and builds on its strength as a tourist and educational precinct. That is a very important issue from the point of view of my electorate. I now turn from a local good news story to something that is in no way a good news story, but I think it would be remiss of me in my capacity as shadow minister for health not to take this opportunity to make some comments on the Medicare issue. I want to talk particularly on the sham safety net, which is at the forefront of the health policy debate, particularly in these two sitting weeks. I think we are all aware that our colleagues in another place are presented with making decisions about the sham safety net in the coming sitting days. I want to take members through what I think it is important to acknowledge in the debate about the sham safety net. From Labor’s point of view, we think our challenge in the coming few weeks is to save Medicare from opposition. Of course Labor will save Medicare from government. We are used to getting into government and saving universal health systems that have been destroyed by conservative governments, but in the next few weeks we have set ourselves the task of saving Medicare from opposition. If we are to save Medicare, it is vital that the Senate rejects the health minister’s political fix-the so-called safety net that is up for debate at the moment. The failure of the Howard government to attend to bulk-billing rates and ensure that specialist fees are fair and reasonable has meant that out-of-pocket costs are rising. MAIN COMMITTEE For the Howard government the sham safety net is the solution of choice. Why is that? Despite the fact that ‘safety net’ are pleasant sounding words, this is yet another policy from the Howard government which is infected with its values and is another policy stepping stone on the path to the dismantling of Medicare. I want to take people through the absurd policy that this sham safety net is if you look at it in detail. First, we need to debunk the Howard government’s spin about the benefits of the sham safety net. The truth is that, on the Howard government’s own figures, only 220,000 families or individuals will benefit from the sham safety net in a year. I note that the Minister for Health and Ageing is actually even revising those figures downwards. Professor John Deeble, one of the architects of Medicare, has said, ‘A generous estimate of the percentage of Australians who will benefit is three per cent and it could well be closer to two per cent.’ Professor Deeble also says that of those who could benefit half would be better off under current arrangements than under the sham safety net. Specifically, Professor Deeble has calculated that the safety net benefits under the Howard Government’s proposal would exceed those under the current system only for services billed at more than 25 per cent over the scheduled fee. On the basis of current GP, specialist and diagnostic fees, this means that well over half of the 220,000 people who reach the threshold would be better off under the current arrangements rather than under the proposed new sham safety net. Professor Deeble says that the proposal to cover 80 per cent of actual fees without limit is effectively uncapped gap insurance, and he is right. This is an admission that the Howard government is both unwilling to increase benefits and unwilling to do anything to ensure specialist fees are fair and reasonable. Who wins and who loses in this situation? We have 97 per cent of Australians getting nowhere near the sham safety net. Of the three per cent who notionally benefit, Professor Deeble says that 1.5 per cent are actually better off under current arrangements. An important point to note is that for the 97 per cent of Australians who do not get on the sham safety net, the situation does not remain neutral because it is those very Australians who will bear the impact of increased fees that occur because of the inflationary cycle started by the expectations of the sham safety net. All of the data from all around the world says that with these sham safety net arrangements there is a price inflation effect on doctors’ fees and specialists’ fees. The 97 per cent of Australians who do not get anywhere near the sham safety net are actually worse off because they end up being slugged for higher doctors’ fees and higher specialists’ fees. We have a sham safety net where 97 per cent of Australians lose and of the three per cent who are notionally better off, half are actually better off under current arrangements according to Professor Deeble, and it costs $266 million: A $266 million plan to make 97 per cent of Australians worse off and, at best, 1.5 per cent of Australians will benefit. Even talking about 1.5 per cent of Australians benefiting is misleading. You have to be $500 or $1,000 out of pocket before you can begin to benefit and who benefits is subject to all sorts of perverse and unfair outcomes. Use of medical services is skewed. While most people have five or fewer consultations a year, a small number of people account for the vast majority of services. Of 220 million Medicare services in 2001-02, 81 per cent were for people who had 10 or more services in that year. A quarter was for people with 40 or more services. These people are much more likely to be poorer than those who saw the doctor only five times a year. The two categories chosen to receive the lower threshold-concession card status or receipt of family tax benefit A-are a poor measure of health need. After all, the family tax benefit system was set up to MAIN COMMITTEE address another set of problems and issues entirely and there is considerable evidence that even health care cards are not an accurate measure of need. The selection of these two categories particularly discriminates against those without dependent children and low-income individuals, while providing significant benefits to many higher income families. For example, a self-funded retiree couple of pension age earning up to $80,000 per annum is eligible for a health care card and hence for the $500 safety net, but a working couple without children earning the same amount will only be eligible for the $1,000 threshold. An individual working full-time earning $35,000 per annum who has a chronic medical condition will enter the safety net only after spending $1,000 out of their pocket, but a self-funded retiree of pension age earning up to $50,000 will qualify for the lower threshold. The Howard government have managed to cook up a $266 million plan to at best benefit 1.5 per cent of Australians, and the tests that they have set up will not even pick the most disadvantaged 1.5 per cent. Then of course $72 million of the $266 million is wasted in administration costs. It is such a poor use of precious health dollars: $72 million gone in administration costs; 97 per cent of Australians lose out; 1.5 per cent who notionally gain would be better off under current arrangements; and 1.5 per cent notionally benefit-and they have picked the wrong 1.5 per cent. All of these practical objections should be enough to stop this latest political patch-up job going through the Senate. But there is also a bedrock principle objection to this sham safety net. This sham safety net is all about distorting from a universal health system to a welfare system. It is all about enabling the Howard government to justify henceforth its failure to invest in Medicare, its unwinding of the Medicare system and its allowing of Medicare to wither and die. And it will do all of that under the cover of saying, ‘Don’t worry. We have a sham safety net arrangement.’ Ultimately, as the universal health system dies, we will end up with a health system like America’s with private provision at the centre and sham safety net arrangements for people who are thought to be poor. And we know how badly those arrangements work in America. Anyone, including any senator, who professes a belief in Medicare cannot endorse this sham safety net arrangement. All it will do is assist the Howard government in destroying Medicare. In and of itself it benefits very few, has unfair outcomes and is a bureaucratic monster. is here. IfI had otherwise been able to do it, I would have had a word to her about the budget appropriations here of $14.3 million in relation to changes in the hearing services model, because I can trust that I would be able to get some sense out of the shadow minister for health where I cannot get anything out of the minister or the government. They have treated me and other parliamentarians and the people of Australia with utter contempt in terms of the bills that are before us now. I have constituents who can no longer get adequate hearing services directly in Bankstown. I can only guess that this $14.3 million may or may not do anything to affect their situationit may or may not improve it. We are given virtually no indication whatsoever. It is mentioned in passing in one line by the parliamentary secretary. If you go to the bill itself and its papers, there is no more information to elucidate what this is about. Since the government in particular brought in accrual accounting you can look at the bills and the background papers and weep at the prospect of finding any real or substantial information that you would be able to MAIN COMMITTEE",143,Appropriation Bill No 4 2003 2004 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 2 2003 2004
301,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (7.13 P.m.),"It is good to see that the shadow minister for healthhand on to any constituent not only in my electorate but Australia wide. It is extremely difficult to get the information. The government is asking for additional appropriations. There is the normal budget process. These extra appropriations are adjustments to those original expectations of the budget. We in this House are expected to blindly accept the few scraps of information that the government has given us and say, ‘They are budget measures; therefore they should simply be passed.’ The government has not taken the time or made the effort-it has not demonstrated enough concern to inform me or the community at large about the nuts and bolts of what it is doing, which has a deliberate effect and impact on constituents in my electorate. I will go in particular into the question of health services in Bankstown with regard to Australian Hearing and the experience of two of my constituents. I may then go to some other matters. There is an item of $21.4 million in assistance for the victims of the Bali terrorist attacks and their families and for meeting the costs of the investigations. We know what a wicked and cruel act it was for people to have their lives stripped away from them and for people who survived but had horrific injuries. All of us had the opportunity to be with their families at the anniversary commemorations in the Great Hall. This simple line says enough about why this sum of money is being set aside and provided. But in relation to most of the other measures there is very small and partial indication. Let us go to the $14.3 million for hearing services and to the practical problems that are being faced in Bankstown by not just two of my constituents but also many more. Australian Hearing took the time to write politely to Mr Charles Garwood, the constituent concerned. He and his wife had this experience recently. Australian Hearing wrote on 5 December informing him: ... Australian Hearing’s Centre in Chapel Road Bankstown suffered severe damage when a hot water service burst. As the damage was extensive we had to relocate to new premises. They said specifically: You may have received other correspondence suggesting that Australian Hearing was no longer able to offer services to you at Bankstown. That is not the case. Australian Hearing is able to provide hearing services to you in your local area at any of our three new locations listed below including Bankstown. They indicated that these were at Chester Hill, Revesby and a new site, the Town Square Medical Centre in Bankstown Square, opposite Medicare. They apologised for the inconvenience and confusion. What they did not tell my constituent in December 2003 but he found out, to his cost, in January 2004 is that the permanent facility that was damaged was replaced with a temporary facility. In 2003 the Bankstown centre was a permanent site for Australian Hearing, as was the Liverpool centre. When Mr Garwood had problems with his hearing aid he sought help from the Bankstown service. He had been told that those services would still be available but now he was told: ‘Things have changed. Now this is not a permanent centre; it is only here three days a week and we cannot fix the hearing aid on site. We can take the hearing aid from you and in eight to 10 days time, after it has been sent to Liverpool and back’-only seven kilometres or so away-‘we will be able to give you the hearing aid back; or you can choose to go to Liverpool yourself to get it fixed.’ MAIN COMMITTEE Mr Garwood, who I know extremely well, is a war veteran. That is the reason why he is eligible for this help. I will read to the House the experiences he and his wife had in trying to get the hearing aid fixed at Liverpool that day. His wife, Hilda, wrote: My husband aged 83 a War Veteran with a Hearing disability due to being blown up in a War Zone has their servicesthat is, those of Australian Hearing in BankstownHe received a letter dated 5th Dec.03 which I enclose herewith. However the statement of hearing service in the local area is a MISNOMER. My Husband’s hearing aid stopped functioning so we went on Friday the 23rd Jan.04 to Bankstown where we were told there is no such service here we are only a Medical Centre, however if you write your name and address and medical card Number and what is wrong with the hearing aid we will forward it to Liverpool and it will take 8-10 days, but if we were to go to Liverpool they would repair it straight away. That is completely different from the experience that they had. She further states: We decided to do that. It was a very hot day we went by train to Liverpool it was a long up hill walk to the Centre. They repaired his hearing aid in one and a half hours walk back to the station arriving in Bankstown it took from 10am to 4pm before we reached home totally exhausted am sure there are many more people in our age group needing this service in Bankstown. Surely it could be possible to have a repair service at least one day a week. I repeat that last sentence: ‘Surely it could be possible to have a repair service at least one day a week.’ That is a reasonable thing to expect for Mr Charles Garwood, an 83-year-old veteran, and a reasonable thing to expect for his wife, Mrs Hilda Garwood, who went with him in order to get this fixed. Hilda Garwood has visited Liverpool before. She has been to Liverpool hospital. Charlie Garwood, her husband, went to Liverpool hospital time and time again when Hilda was there with a significant heart problem. I visited her there some time last year when she was there for a long period. She had a very significant condition which took her a long time to recover from. To have people in their 80s put out in that way is just not good enough. When the permanent facility had been there for years, it is right and proper that not only the Garwoods but my other constituents could say, ‘If the old centre was destroyed, there should be a permanent centre for Bankstown.’ It is not Woop Woop; it is the centre of Sydney. There are 180,000 people in the City of Bankstown-my electorate has 82,000, Daryl Melham’s electorate has another 82,000, and there are more people as well. Bankstown is a central place in Sydney. It is easier for a lot of people to get to Bankstown than it is to get to Liverpool. They have had a situation where the permanent facility has been replaced with an inferior, temporary one. We have a high aged population in the electorate of Blaxland. Those people who have not had the experience of the Garwoods will no doubt find the same situation applies. I made representations to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs with regard to this matter, attaching the letter from Mrs Garwood. I said, in part: To replace the Chapel Road Centre, the Australian Hearing Service three days a week occupies a small, claustrophobic room within the Bankstown Square Medical Centre. They provide a limited service, but have to send hearing aids elsewhere for repairs, taking up to ten days. If the $14.3 million here for changes to the hearing service model do not encompass changing from temporary to permanent the Bankstown centre, I suggest to the parliamentary secretary and the minister that that should be undertaken. The significant numbers of people who are MAIN COMMITTEE disadvantaged by the current situation need to have that addressed. It is a big problem for older people. Both the Prime Minister and, more particularly, the Treasurer, recently seem to have discovered the question of an ageing Australia and the difficulties that that will incur for the government in a fiscal sense. But the real difficulties are faced by people day after daynot in 10 or 20 years time, but right now, day after day. If you do not have adequate and proper services it is very difficult for those people who are already, in this case, paying more than $30 a year for the maintenance of this equipment and who have the extra cost, not just monetary but also on their bodies-on their systems and their nerves-of having to go to that kind of trouble. It simply is not right. It is not right that those Australians in my electorate of Blaxland who cannot afford adequate dental care are forced by this government to wait for up to five years to get that care. You will not find any provision of moneys in either the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004 or the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 for that dental care. The reason for that is that this is a coalition set of appropriations. They wiped out any future moneys for dental care for the aged and people on pensions and beneficiaries when they concluded the four years of the Keating government program which put an extra $300 million or so into dental care for the aged. As an opposition we have pledged that we will put $300 million of new money towards addressing the very real health problems of Australians living in Blaxland and other electorates where they need the intervention of the Commonwealth government because they cannot get access to proper dental services. Hearing and dental problems are two key difficulties for the aged. Anyone here in this room and anyone listening throughout Australia who has aged relatives or friends would understand the trauma that is caused to them through the loss of appropriate and adequate hearing and the difficulty it entails in terms of dealing with their everyday problems. People would also realise how significant it is for people to have dramatic dental problems that simply are not addressed because they do not have the money. The health impact upon those people who suffer is enormous. The final cost to the community, of course, is extremely significant. If you let these problems build and do not either take preventative measures or have early intervention, dental problems can lead to dramatic problems which can, through abscesses that become extremely severe, occasion hospitalisation and the direct intervention of surgeons in order to fix those problems. I know that I have seen it happen. I have been the victim of dental abscesses. The same problem has happened to my wife. If they get bad enough, you can be one or two days off dying if there is no intervention. I was lucky. In my personal experience, we were able to go and get direct intervention and ensure that we got the treatment that we needed. But there are many people who do not have that recourse. That is why these appropriations should encompass moneys for more than 500,000 Australians who are on the waiting list and who can wait up to five years or more for appropriate intervention to fix their acute dental problems. These moneys are not here, because this government has not only contempt for us in terms of providing information but also utter contempt for all of those people on that waiting list, because it simply says to them, ‘It’s a state matter-you can sit there and wait.’ You can hope that you might get your problems fixed, but the federal government will take no direct approach to this. MAIN COMMITTEE The member for Werriwa, when addressing Labor’s national conference in Darling Harbour, quite rightly took a copy of the Australian Constitution out of his pocket and referred to the section which directly says that both health and dental services are a direct responsibility of the federal government. That was why the Keating government was able to take direct action by supporting a four-year program to fix the problem the states did not have the capacity to fix. That is why it is right, proper and just that Labor has pledged to do so. The only hope, because of the heartlessness of this government, is the election of a Labor government to directly intervene to fix those problems. Representing people in Bankstown, I know that we have had one service after another taken away from us. It does not really surprise me that the full and permanent service of Australian Hearing was converted to a temporary visiting service and that Liverpool has taken over. This government has a set against Bankstown, and it has a set against it primarily because the former Prime Minister was a boy from Bankstown, just like me. Our experience relates to not only the Australian Hearing Service but also the department of immigration, which was completely ripped out of Bankstown-one of the most multicultural areas in Australia. I know that we have a former shadow minister for immigration and also a former Minister for Veterans Affairs-someone who has visited the electorate of Blaxland, who knows how diverse that community is, and knows how crucial it is to have services where they are needed. You will not find those services in Bankstown now, because this government has ripped them out, just like they have taken away the permanent centre for Australian Hearing. You will not find the Australian Taxation Office in Bankstown now-that building is now inhabited by the state police because this government would not provide a full regional tax office, employing more than 650 people, in the City of Bankstown. SoI look forward to Labor coming back to government and I look forward to having services put back into Bankstown, into my electorate, and having appropriations-either budgetary or these extra appropriations-to directly service the people of Bankstown, who have been so badly dealt with by this government, which has treated them with utter contempt. It has done so for no reason other than the fact that the former member for Blaxland happened to be their representative and maybe, as a secondary issue, because I worked for him. WhatI can promise you is this: I trust that the representations that I have made on behalf of Mr and Mrs Garwood-which is just one example of the problems that people have faced with the rolling back of the permanent service of Australian Hearing in Bankstown to a temporary service-will be addressed by the appropriate minister and that it is put back into place, as it should be, so that all of those people in Bankstown who need that service can access it. I hold out no hope whatsoever that this government, which has been appealed to time and time again, will restore full dental service to those 500,000 Australians who need it. I trust that the next Labor government will stick to its pledge with regard to that. If you look at the rest of these appropriations, which have been so poorly dealt with in terms of information, a Labor government will not only give the services back but it will explain why it is being done.

302,Mr Sciacca (Bowman) (7.33 P.m.),"Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004, Appropriawould particularly like to use this opportunity to place on the public record my continuing concern about the impact that this government’s spending priorities-priorities that are dramatically out of kilter with those of the general community-is having on individuals and families living in my electorate of Bowman and, indeed, people around Australia. Almost two years ago, in his 2002 budget address, the Treasurer released the Intergenerational Report. He heralded the document as a landmark enabling the government to draft the budget, not simply with a view to achieving shortto medium-term policy goals but also in the context of the ‘challenges that lie ahead for our children, our society and our government’. It seems that when the government asked ‘What do we need to do now to prepare for generations ahead?’ unlike the rest of the community, this government did not look at the report’s prediction that aged care costs would rise from 0.7 per cent to 1.8 per cent of the GDP over the next 40 years, and that by 2031 the number of Australians aged 65 and over would increase from 12.7 per cent to 22.3 per cent of the population. They did not look at those staggering figures and think that health and aged care services are areas in need of immediate attention. As we saw with the Treasurer’s speech last week, they finally realised that it is high time to re-examine pensions and superannuation in the context of our ageing society, but aged care seems to have been left way down the list of priorities. The anecdotal evidence presented by my constituents, who continue to experience terrible difficulties trying to find a place for their elderly relatives in an appropriate aged care facility, is overwhelming. Their frustration is echoed by the service providers themselves. I recently met with Mr David Angell and Ms Anne Livingston of Aged Care Queensland, the peak industry body for aged and community care providers in Queensland. With members drawn from the residential, retirement living and community sectors, Aged Care Queensland has a comprehensive understanding of the issues confronting the aged care industry in Australia. Mr Angell and Ms Livingston identified three crucial areas that need urgent government attention if the quality Australians demand of their aged care sector is to be preserved and the pressing issue of accessibility is to be addressed. Firstly, the industry believes that the Commonwealth Own Purpose Outlays formula, as it currently stands, does not reflect the real staffing and associated costs of operating aged care services. For example, wage compensation is only increased by the amount of the safety net adjustment, bearing no real relationship to wage fluctuations in the aged care sector. Under the current formula, aged care providers are being forced to find a balance between cutting costs and providing quality care-a situation which is unsustainable. Aged Care Queensland stress that, as most aged and community care providers are run on a not-for-profit basis, they are simply unable to afford to subsidise the gap between income and costs on an ongoing basis. The standard of care will almost certainly begin to slip if this situation is not addressed, and we will see more providers follow the example of the Salvation Army and bow out of the sector, as they can no longer operate on a viable basis-at least in some of the states. What the aged care industry is asking for is not without precedent. The Howard government introduced a new indexation formula to rectify a similar disparity between costs and income for services provided by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. The opposition, on the other hand, realise that it is untenable for aged care facilities to continue to shed staff in an effort to cut costs, thereby blowing out the staff-to-resident ratio. A Latham Labor government would oversee the introduction of minimum staffing requirements in the aged care sector to MAIN COMMITTEE put an end to the current situation, in which the Health Services Union reports that one or two staff members can have responsibility for up to 70 residents at a time. We recognise that our seniors and our aged care workers deserve much better than that. We heard the minister recently claim that the Howard government has increased funding to aged care by 100 per cent, but such a claim is vastly different to the picture painted by the people on the ground in the aged care industry. In an interview on ABC’s AM program of Wednesday 11 February, Richard Gray of Catholic Health Australia said: There’s been inadequate increases in funding for number of years now, and the current funding regime is not adequate enough to meet quality care needs ... Aged Care Queensland estimates that residential care providers are currently around $406 million behind the level of funding needed to meet the real cost increases that the sector has faced since 1997. At the recent summit of the National Aged Care Alliance, industry insiders suggested that an immediate rise in funding of $10 per bed per day is required to bring residential services back to a level at which they can comfortably meet service standards, maintain and upgrade facilities and equipment and retain an adequate-sized and appropriately skilled staff. Of course, residential care is just part of the aged care industry. Many of the older members of the community would prefer to be able to remain in their own homes, living as independently as possible for as long as possible. This is where the third area at the centre of Aged Care Queensland’s concerns comes in-that is, the underfunding of community care. Having absorbed a $120 million gap between funding and costs, the community care sector urgently needs a 10 per cent funding increase to cover the real costs in providing care to the estimated 400,000 aged and disabled members of our community who rely on community care programs. Aged and Community Services Australia, on behalf of respected industry bodies including Alzheimer’s Australia, the Australian Council of Community Nursing Services, the Australian Medical Association, Carers Australia and COTA-the Council on the Ageing-published A vision for community care: a discussion paper in August 2002. The paper observed: There is increasing recognition that community care programs can no longer be considered separately from the myriad of intersecting service sectors, including residential aged care, disability services and primary and acute health services. Changes in any one of these systems inevitably affect the others, as has been the case with the reduction of length of stay in hospitals increasing the care needs of some community care clients after discharge home. If the level of service provided by the community care sector decreases as a result of funding shortfalls, the pressure on residential care and hospital systems will increase. In other words, failure to invest in one part of the system is going to make the whole system less effective. According to the independent report commissioned by the Myer Foundation-2020 Vision for Aged Care in Australia-it is community care in particular that requires a substantial funding boost. The report called for the expansion of community based care with a view to shifting the mix of health care options for older Australians towards a greater availability of community care, including a greater investment in preventative health care and housing features to allow seniors to live in their own homes as long as possible as they age. The report also advocated improved integration between aged and community care and other related services. Similarly, the aged care industry has called for prevention and health MAIN COMMITTEE promotion to be acknowledged as an integral component of community care services. They would like to see the funding system modified so that care is available not only to those with high care needs but also to seniors with less intensive or perhaps less immediate needs to prevent further functional decline. Greater investment in these areas would make a significant contribution to delaying and reducing the need for ongoing services in high-intensity community hospitals or residential care. My friend and colleague the member for Franklin and you, Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, are, like me, at the age where we may be needing those services some time in the nottoo-distant future! Investing in aged care is an investment in the future for all of us. Sadly, with this government we have heard a lot of lip-service but have seen a noticeable lack of action. an inquiry costing some $7.2 million. It was due in December last year. It is now March and we are still waiting for the report to be made public. While the government sits on its hands the aged care industry is left in limbo, with no certainty as to how their funding system will be altered and how that will impact on their capacity to ensure that, when they need it, all Australians can easily access high-quality care. This is a state of uncertainty that will continue once the Hogan report is finally released, while the government takes its time to respond. If the delays we have experienced waiting for the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs to issue a final response to the Clarke report are anything to go by-and, of course, the Prime Minister had to bail her out of that one and made certain announcements today-it looks like we are still at the beginning of a long, drawn out process. It is time for the government to take responsibility-to respond to the calls for action emanating from the industry and the growing numbers of seniors in our community and ensure that the imminent crisis in aged and community care is nipped in the bud. On behalf of Aged Care Queensland, the many dedicated workers in the aged care industry, and the seniors living in the Bayside and Redlands districts-and, indeed, in all of Queensland and Australia. I call on the government to look at these serious funding issues which are facing the aged care industry and act decisively to invest in this important sector and reverse the damage done before the situation deteriorates even further. Frankly, we are seeing the results of massive budget cuts after the 1996 election, when the public voted the Labor government out of power. Another important area in which the government is guilty of sitting on its hands is, of course, that of families and Centrelink benefits. Disappointingly, although fully aware of the problems in this area-as evidenced by the Prime Minister’s address to the National Press Club prior to the last election, which identified balancing work and family as a key priority for his third term, and the leaked cabinet documents that emerged recently setting out the deficiencies of the government’s family policies-the government has nonetheless chosen to do nothing. In the face of a damning report from the interdepartmental work and family task force, made up of representatives from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Family and Community Services, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, Finance and Treasury, which was before cabinet way back in December 2002, the MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Appropriation Bill No 4 2003 2004 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 2 2003 2004
303,Mr Quick,Where’s the Hogan report?,161,Appropriation Bill No 4 2003 2004 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 2 2003 2004
304,Mr Sciacca,"The Hogan report into aged care pricing, mentioned by my colleague, isgovernment has done nothing. Even though it is aware that second earners in single-income families in the $30,000 to $40,000 income range are paying, for each dollar earned, 60 per cent plus tax and net child-care costs, that to solve the problem of the flawed family benefit system significant changes are needed, that many families have found the precise forward income estimation difficult and that the issue of debts has detracted from community recognition and that features such as this can be perceived by families as having impacts-these are all words used in that report-it has done nothing. My colleague the shadow minister for family and community services hit the nail on the head when he reflected: ... frustrated at the cover up, government bureaucrats have taken matters into their own hands by leaking key cabinet-in-confidence documents. Rod Whyte, formerly a senior manager with Centrelink, has written a book on the long standing and appalling error rate within Centrelink and the agency’s failure to fully investigate the causes of errors which lead to incorrect payment. Imagine that: enough errors, debts unfairly raised against clients who have done nothing wrong and adventures in mismanagement and inefficiencies to fill a book. In an interview with the Australian this week, Mr Whyte said: Many customers over the course of the next 12 to 18 months will pay dearly for Centrelink’s mistakes, mainly through having to pay back sizeable debts that weren’t their fault. Mr Whyte’s criticisms have been backed by the Australian National Audit Office and by literally hundreds of constituents in my own electorate of Bowman who have suffered significant financial penalties due to Centrelink’s inadequate performance. They are people like Mrs Gail Lee of Alexandra Hills, whose dealings with Centrelink have been quite an ordeal. I have written to Minister Anthony about the situation and hope that I will receive his response in the not too distant future. I might mention that I have given up writing to the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Patterson, who, although reputedly the senior minister, has forwarded all my past correspondence regarding Centrelink to her junior minister for response. It seems that the government, embarrassed by her efforts in the health portfolio, thought it best to give her a title and pop her in a corner where she can do no harm. As I set out in my letter to Minister Anthony, my constituent’s problems began because of another area in which the government has failed to act to assist ordinary Australians-that is, the rising cost of housing and the difficulties first-time home buyers experience getting into the market. Mrs Lee’s daughter was having trouble getting a housing loan, and so in June 2003 they decided that the mother would transfer the title of her unit into her daughter’s name. This would allow the daughter to present herself at the bank with equity in property so that she could secure the loan she needed to purchase her own house. As a result of this transaction, Centrelink decided that Mrs Lee had gifted away $140,000 worth of assets. Accordingly, the agency deemed her to be earning an income of $90 a week, and on 6 June 2003 Centrelink cancelled Mrs Lee’s entitlement to widow allowance. This decision was taken even though, under the income test, my constituent should still have qualified for a partial widow allowance and, under the assets test, as a non home owner, she also continued to qualify for this allowance. The decision meant that she was left without any income. She was left destitute. She was forced to sell her furniture and rely on the generosity of family and friends in order to survive. Fortunately, Mrs Lee was able to secure temporary employment, but that position no longer exists and she is left again without any income. My constituent has advised me that, although MAIN COMMITTEE she contacted Centrelink by telephone and in person, on three separate occasions she was refused any recourse or right of appeal against the decision taken in her case. By giving out misinformation like this, Centrelink not only undermined my constituent’s basic right to seek a review but caused her undue stress and financial hardship. Unfortunately, it was not the only incorrect information given to Mrs Lee. She was also told that, in her circumstances, she would not qualify for a low income earners’ health care card, yet when eventually she decided, given that she had nothing to lose, to put in an application she received the health care card she had been entitled to all along. When my office contacted Centrelink about my constituent’s situation, they had another look at her case and discovered that, instead of treating Mrs Lee as a non home owner, her entitlement to widow’s allowance had mistakenly been calculated and declined on the basis of the home owners asset threshold. But, because my constituent was incorrectly advised of her review rights and tried to make her own way as best she could before, in desperation, she sought the assistance of my office, she is outside the three-month limitation period to obtain any compensation for the loss she has suffered as a result of Centrelink’s negligence. It is nothing short of disgusting that my constituent, through no fault of her own, has suffered months of stress, has been forced to sell off most of her assets simply in order to survive and is left with no course of redress, no back pay and no apology. Centrelink will not even reinstate her widow allowance because, having re-entered the work force, her circumstances have shifted and she would only be eligible for Newstart payments even though her position existed only briefly. As I mentioned earlier, I am hoping to receive a response to my representations soon and I hope that, in his response, the minister acknowledges the glaring inequity of the situation and acts to ensure a fair solution is found to Mrs Lee’s problems which have occurred as a result of Centrelink’s repeated errors in dealing with her situation. This is the story of just one of many of my constituents who contact my office every week who are suffering as a result of this government’s cutbacks, and it is just one of the many reasons why I support the second reading amendment moved by the member for Fraser which condemns this government for its budget waste, mismanagement and wrong priorities. As a former parliamentary secretary in the area of social security for something like four years, I know the dedication and work that is done by people that work at Centrelink, which used to be known as the Department of Social Security. In the vast majority of cases, they are good people. They do a good job and they help out as much as they can under very adverse circumstances. I must say that it must be absolutely trying for them with all these cutbacks and the amount of money that is taken away by the government from these sorts of services. We heard my friend the member for Blaxland talk about how many services had been taken away from his electorate. I think just about every Labor electorate in Australia can say that that is the case. Medicare offices have closed all over the place and people have been forced to use expensive transport just to go and get a few dollars back. The reality is that it is not the fault of the public servants. I want to make that very clear here today. It is not the fault of the public servants; it is the fault of the government that does not give them enough money and tries to cut back. Now we have Mr Howard repeating the scenes of 2001, starting again to see if he cannot flip-flop on issues and start to buy the next election. You can see it happening now the way it did in 2001. But I say to him: ‘Don’t just do it at election time. Pay the money out. Give it back to where it belongs. Don’t forget that governments are here to service the MAIN COMMITTEE electorates and the people in this country.’ It is about time that we started getting back to reality. It is about time we started spending money on the services that the Australian public needs. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004 by the member for Fraser, which amendment covers the following vital family areas: (1) a costly Medicare ‘safety net’ which does not protect families from increasing health costs and the declining level of bulk billing; (2) inadequate funding and higher fees for students seeking access to higher education; (3) a growing number of families who are financially squeezed and trying to balance work and family; and (4) 500,000 Australians waiting for up to five years to get their teeth fixed. The most important area of policy in Australia is the need to protect families. This is the direction that the Australian Labor Party is taking under the new Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham. BeforeI cover those points as I go through my speech, I point out that today, 2 March, marks the eighth anniversary of my election to parliament. My intention is to take stock of the issues in my electorate. I have revisited what I said in my first speech and in other earlier speeches to see what I considered important then, comparing them to the major issues of today and how these have been addressed over that eight-year period. One matter I mentioned in that very first speech was the massive residential development that was expected to take place in the northern part of the Greenway electorate around Parklea and Rouse Hill. I said on that occasion: The first stage of the Rouse Hill development centred on the Parklea release area is currently in the early stages of development and is eventually expected to house 50,000 people. This development has taken place as I predicted, and it is still taking place. Nearly 60,000 new residents have come to call Blacktown city home over the past 10 years. The local council has approved over 10,700 new dwellings in the past five years alone, the majority of which have been in the Greenway electorate. At 285,000 people-and growing by over 5,000 people each year-Blacktown city is the largest local government area in New South Wales and the third largest in Australia. Between the 1996 and 2001 census, Blacktown had the second largest growth of any LGA, and one in every 70 Australians now call Blacktown home. I have seen my electorate grow in its population but shrink in its geography. This massive residential growth, as you can appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, has placed a considerable strain on the infrastructure needs of the region and, while much has been achieved, there is still very much more to be done. Mr Deputy Speaker, you can appreciate again that that area of infrastructure covers the whole spectrum of health, education, transport and roadworks. Much of the infrastructure work that has been completed so far has been carried out by the state Labor government. Windsor Road, which anyone from Western Sydney would be aware of, has been upgraded, but this was a long-time source of irritation and frustration to local motorists. Marayong railway station, the centre of an expanding area, has also been upgraded, with a modern lift complex to cater for wheelchair access, and the rail track has been duplicated to Quakers Hill, improving the rail service to that station. I called for this in my first speech in this place. Local residents now look forward to the completion of the duplication of MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Appropriation Bill No 4 2003 2004 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 2 2003 2004
305,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (7.53 P.m.),"I rise to support the amendment moved to thethe rail line right through to Riverstone, which is the last station in my electorate. Another project that urgently needs attention is the upgrading of the Quakers Hill railway station. As I said, much more needs to be done. Blacktown Hospital has been completely rebuilt by the state government and is now considered state of the art. One other issue of infrastructure that I need to comment on is the Western Sydney orbital or, as it will become known when it is completed, Westlink M7. I have been a long-time strong advocate of this highway, even before I entered parliament. It is pleasing to see the speed at which it is now finally being constructed. I was also a member of the Greater Western Sydney Economic Development Board-a board of local businesspeople-which campaigned strongly for what we knew then as the Western Sydney orbital. I have supported the various arguments advanced by that organisation and various employer groups that the M7 would improve industrial road transport, which is vital, with many industries operating on a just-in-time principle, and its construction will lead to employment growth in the region. That will definitely be a good outcome once this road network is completed. Unfortunately, the Howard government has ignored its responsibility to the people of my electorate with regard to this highway. The previous government had made plans to finance a certain section of it and had commenced work on it. The M7 will form the last link in the national highway system that stretches over 18,500 kilometres around Australia. Yet the Howard government ducked its responsibility to build it and basically demanded that the New South Wales government build it with a toll. The Howard government has, in effect, privatised the national highway. In some of my earlier speeches I praised the work of the Quakers Hill family service, a joint program between Wesley Dalmar Child and Family Care and the Quakers Hill Uniting Church. This service was working with high-risk disadvantaged families and families in crisis. The 1998 annual report of this organisation indicated there had been increasing demand for counselling for families and children. Part of the stress on these families can be described by paragraph (3) of the amendment which simply says: (3) a growing number of families who are financially squeezed and trying to balance work and family ... This basically comes about because of the high mortgages families now have to contend with. There has also been an increase in the number of families with multiple problems in the area of direct family support. Reflecting on the slash and burn policies of the Howard government at the time, I said in one of my earlier speeches in this parliament: The reduction in department of community services funding as of July 1998 and less child care assistance to subsidise low income families being provided by the department of health and family services have brought changes to the service in the area of vocational care. As a result, fees have needed to be adjusted to accommodate the new system, which is confusing many families. That was clearly a problem that existed in the early period of my time in this parliament. I have here the report of the annual general meeting of 2002-03 for the Quakers Hill family service. The report shows the services the centre has continued to provide for needy families over the past 10 years. In particular, the report lists its future challenges, and I believe they really highlight what is required by low-income people in the area I represent. The future challenges for this organisation include the closing of Sundowner Village, which is a caravan park for low-income people, and the need to maintain a high level of support and advocacy with increased demands for affordable housing. Once again, I compliment the state Labor MAIN COMMITTEE government. I have noticed in the press recently that they have introduced legislation that will make people who occupy these caravan parks a little more secure in their accommodation arrangements, and this is good news. Other future challenges for this organisation include ensuring the sustainability of programs, developing opportunities for growth to reflect the increased population and their service provision needs and increased human services for the Rouse Hill strategic planning area. A challenge for Parklea Prison is a growth in beds from 600 to 1,200 in the women’s wing. Another challenge is the potential explosion in mortgage stresses with interest rate increases. Once again, that reflects the increase in residential development of the area. On a sad note, the report also refers to the passing of Glenys Judd, a previous centre coordinator who, unfortunately, lost her fight against a major illness in January 2003. Glenys and I developed a fairly good working relationship, and I was happy to work through her to assist this organisation. Glenys made a major contribution to the work of the centre and will be sorely missed. I return to the issue of child care, which is a major issue in my electorate. In 1996-97 there was an $820 million cut to child care which has led to increased fees and reduced child-care assistance, low-quality care and the closure of several services. At the time, child-care closures occurred in my electorate in Seven Hills, Marayong, Riverstone and Blacktown. If we move forward to the present day, we can see the results of this short-sighted policy of funding cuts. At a Senate estimates committee hearing in June last year, we learnt that there was a shortage of after school care in the Blacktown local government area of over 1,000 places. This was well in excess of any other area in New South Wales or Australia. The next highest shortfall was in the neighbouring area of Holroyd, which had almost half that number with a 590-place shortage. As I have said, there has been a huge residential development, with a lot of young families moving into the area, yet there has been a reduction in the availability of child-care places. This has come about because of the slash and burn policies of the Howard government in the 1997 and 1998 budgets. Of particular concern is the dramatic shortage of child care for the zero to two age group in Blacktown. The electorate of Greenway has the third highest number of children in this age group, behind the neighbouring Western Sydney electorates of Werriwa and Chifley. This highlights the needs of the child-care sector in our area of Western Sydney. For this reason it is encouraging to see the response of the new Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham, to this crisis. The member for Werriwa has called the rates of pay for child-care workers a national disgrace. He said: At $13 an hour it is impossible to attract the qualified teachers to run the education programs so it’s more than child minding and becomes child development. I think that is a very important statement. It is not simply a question of childminding; it is a question of educating the children and educating their development in these early age groups. The Leader of the Opposition has committed an incoming Labor government to increasing the salaries of child-care workers, increasing the number of child-care places, reducing waiting lists and improving the affordability of child care for parents. IfI could just once again refer to the residential development which seems to be a major theme in what I am saying tonight, a key to sustainable living in the Western Sydney, of course, is more local employment opportunities. I have indicated that I believe the M7 will MAIN COMMITTEE contribute greatly to this. Job growth in the region really has not kept pace with residential growth. In my first speech I said: It is important that we match the training that is available to young people in Greenway and surrounding areas with employment opportunities in local industries and the growth jobs of the future. In an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 6 June 2003, Bob Myer, of architects Cox and Richardson, who worked for 20 years on the implementation of the Sydney region outline plan-and he lists Parramatta and Campbelltown, but, quite clearly, this would go beyond those two suburbs-said: Job growth ... has been disappointing. Instead tertiary jobs have dispersed in an arc from West Ryde through the CBD to the airport to Botany Bay and people have resorted to private transport to reach their workplace. One of the important points on employment is, of course, the availability of local employment. Once again, the major problem in our area is that people have to travel outside the district to earn a living. One pleasing aspect is that, on information provided by the Blacktown Council, I find that, in 1996, 40.3 per cent of all jobs in the city were held by local residents. By 2001 this proportion had increased to 55.4 per cent. This highlights the increased ability of the city to provide jobs for its residents. Like any location, Blacktown city residential growth will create a demand and requirement for jobs, particularly in service industries such as retail, health, community service and business services. With that in mind, I am very pleased to be able to report that the residential shopping centre at Blacktown is now being redeveloped. I would probably say that this has certainly been long overdue. But it is now being redeveloped under the leadership of Alan Pendleton, the new mayor. Once it is fully developed, this will create additional employment in the area. The commercial development will bring about a total rejuvenation of Blacktown city’s heart and it will be one of Western Sydney’s most significant commercial retail centres. As I said, that will help to increase local employment and provide jobs for local people. With this need in Western Sydney for more employment opportunities, it was with somewhat mixed feelings that we received correspondence from ING Real Estate advising that, with the decision having being made to close Australia’s Wonderland amusement park, the site would now be purchased to create a business park. The problem here of course is that Wonderland will be a loss to the area. It was a major tourist attraction-and out in Western Sydney we do need tourist developments that will attract people into the area and provide employment and amusement for local residents. It was a great employer of local people. There were some 130 permanent and 270 casual workers employed there. The closing of the amusement park will create more pressure on the labour market, particularly in the area of part-time work and young people wanting to get into the work force. So it is a double-edged sword: that is happening and there is going to be pressure there, but on the other hand is the fact that the site will be developed by one of Australia’s largest organisations in this field, with a prediction that there will be some 9,000 jobs created close to where people live. That is definitely good news. I am advised that, under the proposed plan, the industrial business park will be developed using best practice and environmentally sustainable development practices so that trees will be maintained and the natural environment protected. The potential for employment growth is well supported by the education facilities in the electorate of Greenway, which I have spoken about on many occasions previously. MAIN COMMITTEE They are the developments that have taken place over the eight years that I have been the member for the electorate of Greenway. I have seen massive changes. I have seen the state government making a gallant effort to provide the infrastructure that the new residents of Western Sydney need. However, I have seen the federal government cutting back funds, which has reduced medical services in the area. We have seen inadequate funding and the residents in the area that I live in having to pay higher fees for higher education. As I have been speaking about, a growing number of families are financially squeezed. On the one hand we have got the state Labor government providing infrastructure that is needed for the area, and on the other hand we have got the federal government cutting back on the funds that are so vital for the services that we need in Western Sydney. For that reason I am very happy to support the amendment moved by the member for Fraser. priation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004 I want to specifically draw on the second reading amendment standing in the name of the member for Fraser, Bob McMullan. In doing so I want to touch on my shadow ministerial responsibilities for transport and regional services and issues raised in the second reading amendment going to the opposition’s condemnation of the government for its budget waste and mismanagement. I draw the House’s attention this evening to the fact that 12 months ago the Secretary of the Department of Transport and Regional Services told his department that they were in a very difficult financial position. I contend that that arose from financial mismanagement and waste by the Department of Transport and Regional Services. The secretary informed the staff of the department that they would run out of money without major changes in the way they operated. The department posted an operating loss of $4.5 million in 2002-03, yet the figure did not tell the whole and honest story. Losses in 2002-03 were in fact more than $4.5 million. With the rollover funds from 2001-02 and forward into 2003-04 taken into account, the operating loss is more like $8.1 million. And this figure does not include the $13 million drawn down from the reserves since 1999. Since then we have discovered that the response of the department and the government to the financial crisis has been to slash staff numbers and freeze expenditure on IT infrastructure, something fundamental to the operation of the department. Across the department the five administrative groups were forced to cut their operating expenses by 10.7 per cent to enable the department to turn around their financial crisis. Two weeks ago during the Senate estimates process we learnt that this whopping productivity increase has fallen squarely onto the staff of the department. The department’s definition of operating expenses appears to be limited to staff costs. We have learnt that staffing levels within the department have fallen by 13.8 per cent in just nine months. In addition, the tools that enable the department to perform its functions-its information technology systems-have had an expenditure freeze imposed on them. This is in spite of the fact that the secretary of the department clearly indicated on 14 May 2003: ... to make ends meet over recent years wethe departmenthave under-invested in infrastructure such as IT desktops.

306,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (8.12 P.m.),"In my remarks tonight on the ApproSo not only have staff numbers been slashed by almost 130 but the remaining staff are required to put up with failing IT infrastructure. I think this is fairly important, because the Department of Transport and Regional Services is a very significant department. The staff within the department have been made the scapegoat for maladministration by the Howard government. It did not have to be and should not have been the case. A department properly resourced by government could have continued to provide sound administrative functions. The treatment of staff in the Department of Transport and Regional Services is yet another example of the wrong priorities of this government, its waste and its mismanagement-something that is seen generally across the Howard government. For that reason I very much support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for finance, the member for Fraser that condemns the government for its budget waste and mismanagement and wrong priorities. These have clearly resulted in difficulties with respect to our costly Medicare safety net system; inadequate funding and higher fees for students in higher education; a growing number of financially squeezed families trying to balance work and family; and 500,000 Australians waiting for up to five years to get their teeth fixed, something which is a major problem in my electorate of Batman in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. As a result of penny pinching and the 1980s style corporate management adopted by the government, officers of the Department of Transport and Regional Services are required to perform miracles to achieve government objectives. It is little wonder that the department is falling apart and there are serious problems with respect to the performance of the department, going to such fundamental issues as aviation safety in Australia at the moment. It is little wonder that the department-and, in essence, the Howard government-has not been able to respond to the regional business development analysis report delivered to the government in July of last year. It is little wonder that the introduction of a new IT program management system for the Regional Partnerships program is beset with problems that are leading to increased frustration for program applicants all around Australia. It is little wonder that the Regional Partnerships program has been unable to generate the activity or applications envisaged when it was started in July 2003. As at the end of December this program has only been able to spend less than one quarter of the funds allocated, even though it brought forward more than $30 million expenditure from the previous financial year. The litany goes on across a whole range of activities in the Department of Transport and Regional Services. It is little wonder, for example, that the much publicised AusLink white paper has yet to see the light of day. And it is little wonder that it has taken so long to get even close to the ARTC agreement with the New South Wales state government being nailed down by the federal government going to the upgrade of the national track on the east coast from Brisbane through to Melbourne. And, most importantly, the government’s 20th-century response to departmental administration appears to be designed to silence criticism of the new National Airspace System. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is the organisation that conducts professional investigations into aviation accidents and incidents. It was the ATSB that first recommended a review of the flawed National Airspace System as a result of an investigation of a near miss incident over Launceston. The recent Senate estimates process confirmed the extent of the MAIN COMMITTEE damage being perpetrated on the ATSB budget and the effect it is having on the preparedness to improve aviation safety for the travelling public. It was confirmed at Senate estimates that the ATSB is investigating only 60 out of 60,000 aviation incidents each year-and this is the organisation that is supposed to assist in maintaining air safety in Australia. This is a very serious issue when you think about the importance of the aviation industry to Australia at large. In 2000-01, the ATSB was funded to conduct 118 new accident investigations, but this has now dropped to just 60. This is at a time when the government is introducing a whole new approach to aviation in Australia. The flawed National Airspace System is slated for fundamental review-and we are cutting back on investigations of aviation safety and near misses in Australia. This is the same airspace system that the ATSB acknowledges is responsible for 27 National Airspace System related incidents since its implementation in November 2003-a very short period. It is the same airspace system that is based on the American model that is clearly unsuitable for Australian conditions, as the near miss over Launceston proved beyond any doubt. I note that, in a recent review of midair collisions in the US, it was found that the most common causal factor identified by the US National Transportation Safety Board was failure to-guess what?-see and avoid. It is interesting to note, as the member for Franklin is well aware because of the near miss in Tasmania just before Christmas, that the National Airspace System being pursued by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services is based on see and avoid and that is the system that we are expected to adopt in Australia. It concluded that see and avoid has inherent limitations as a tactical strategy for avoiding midair collisions. It also found that most midair collisions occur near airports, especially non-towered airports, which is pretty important when you think about regional Australia and the importance of aviation. The use of see and avoid, especially around non-towered airports, is one of the most fundamental changes to our new National Airspace System in stage 2B of the implementation of the NAS system. It is also interesting that during the Senate estimate hearings a fortnight ago the Chief Executive Officer of Airservices Australia dropped his bombshell about the botched implementation of the NAS system-the system that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services continued to tell us in the House only a matter of a week and half ago is safer than the previous operating system. In his statement to the Senate committee on 17 February, the Chief Executive Officer of Airservices Australia said: Airservices recently formed the view that its process for considering the changes on 27 November 2003 may not have properly discharged all its responsibilities under the act. The nature of the gap in our processes relates, firstly, to the extent to which Airservices may have relied on the work of other parties-the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the Aviation Reform Group, the National Air Space Implementation Group as examples-rather than its own comprehensive research and analysis. And secondly, to the way in which we chose to manage an identified risk related to the implementation of class E airspace. I simply say to the House this evening that that was a bombshell and it fell not only on me as the shadow minister but also on the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and his department. The Chief Executive Officer of Airservices effectively stated that the fundamental process for implementing NAS was flawed and hence there were serious questions about air safety in Australia. He stated that, despite the Minister for Transport and Regional Services MAIN COMMITTEE responding in the House on the same day to a question from me by stating that the system was, in essence, the safest in the world. Let us talk about how flawed it is-and that is not my view alone; it is now the view of Airservices and many other professionals in the industry who have long said to the minister, including prior to 27 November, that this system is a risk. I have come to the conclusion that, so flawed is this system as a result of these procedural oversights, Airservices has now undertaken a design safety case for the system’s full implementation last year and it will also undertake a more extensive risk analysis of the changes that were implemented last year. The ATSB has identified that the National Airspace System contributed to a serious incident near Launceston airport in December last year. It appropriately recommended that the National Airspace System procedures and communication requirements be reviewed and, where necessary, there be revision and updating of education, training and sharp frequency material. Then Airservices Australia acknowledged that it had not properly discharged its responsibilities under the act-in effect, it had acted illegally-and it will therefore initiate a design safety case of the full program for reform and also undertake a more extensive risk analysis of the changes. But what have we heard from the person who should be shouldering responsibility for the introduction of the NAS system; what have we heard from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services? I am sorry to report this evening that he has been silent. He has continued to give the House an undertaking that this is the safest system we as a nation could have. The same day that he last answered a question without notice in the House, Airservices Australia-an independent regulatory authority that had belled the cat-owned up to the fact that it had not done the job it was required to do under the act and that the air safety system in Australia, which we depend on, was flawed and had to be completely overhauled. I would have thought that the minister would have made a statement to the travelling public about where this review is up to and why Airservices have had to take it on. I think the minister stands condemned for not accepting those responsibilities and, in essence, not coming clean. But, as far as I am concerned, it is worse than that. The minister has failed to reassure the Australian public that serious incidents like the one in Launceston will not happen again. I think we are entitled to know that that is the view of the minister: that serious incidents such as the one that occurred at Launceston will not happen again-because do you know what that is about? That is about duty of care, from a government point of view. It is time for the minister to fulfil his responsibility by acknowledging the concerns that have been raised time and time again by highly informed members of the aviation industry and by the opposition in parliament and outside. This evening I call upon the minister to accept his responsibility and release a full statement of what really happened with the introduction of the National Airspace System. He must explain why he let Dick Smith, an enthusiastic amateur-his good mate and an even better mate of the Prime Minister-and a known advocate of the US air space model, lead the charge in the design of Australia’s new airspace regime. The minister must come clean on the exact role of the Airspace Reform Group and whether it will start to have another go at trying to fix its botched NAS system. I contend that we need to get rid of the enthusiastic amateurs and hand the review of the National Airspace System over entirely to the experts-the profesMAIN COMMITTEE sionals-and let them do the job, just as they should have been allowed to do it in the first place. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services must also fess up, swallow his pride and let the travelling public know his plans for the future management of Australia’s airspace system. The minister has deliberately hidden from public scrutiny in relation to the changes that he is responsible for and has left the taxpayers to take the blame. This must end. He can no longer hide from his responsibilities. The Chief Executive Officer of Airservices should not have been the fall guy because the minister will not accept his responsibilities. The ATSB should not be forced to accept massive resource reductions in an attempt by the minister to silence the investigator-and this is a very serious accusation. Therefore, on behalf of the opposition this evening, I call on the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to come into the House-if anything I demand that he do so-and explain how and why the National Airspace System has been implemented in the botched way that it has been. The parliament deserves that explanation from the minister and, more importantly, so does the travelling public-and I will tell you why. This is not just about budget waste and mismanagement; it is about the fundamental responsibilities of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. The Commonwealth Minister for Transport and Regional Services has a variety of responsibilities, but a number of them go to the safety of the travelling public, be it a responsibility in the investigation of road and rail accidents or, alternatively, the development and implementation of a safe air system in Australia. This is about duty of care as a minister of the Crown. NAS has put the travelling public at risk. Our air system is not safe, as has been acknowledged by Airservices Australia during Senate estimates just over a week and a half ago. Minister, accept your responsibilities, come clean and help clean up your mess because, if you do not and a serious accident occurs, you will be at fault not only morally but also legally because of a failure to accept your duty of care to protect the travelling public with respect to the implementation and operation of the National Airspace System. I have given the minister sufficient warning and a chance to do what is right by the travelling public. Front up to your responsibilities, Minister: accept your duty of care and do the right thing by the travelling public. Debate interrupted. Main Committee adjourned at 8.33 p.m. MAIN COMMITTEE The following answers to questions were circulated: Immigration: Protection Visas (Question No. 1711) Mr Andren asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 20 March 2003: How many applications for temporary protection visas has his Department received from followers of Falun Gong or Falun Dafa and how many of these applications have been approved to date. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: Under Australian migration legislation persons apply for a protection visa and the decision as to whether a permanent or temporary protection visa is granted is made on the facts of each individual case and depends on whether particular regulatory criteria are met. From July 1999 until 30 June 2003 the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) received 4,385 applications for a protection visa from PRC nationals. Of these 4126 have been refused by DIMIA as at 30 June 2003 and a number of applications are awaiting a decision. A substantial number of refused applications have sought independent merits review by the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) of the DIMIA decision. Taking account of cases where a DIMIA protection visa refusal decision was set aside by the RRT, as at 30 June 2003 there have been a total of 125 protection visas granted to this group. tion. Immigration: Protection Visas (Question No. 2000) Mr Kerr asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 4 June 2003: (1) How many detainees at the Curtin Detention Centre have had their applications to the Refugee Review Tribunal refused in the last 24 months. (2) For each instance, can he say (a) what was the date of the determination, (b) what was the date the determination was conveyed to the detainee, and (c) whether the detainee was able to access legal advice by (i) phone, (ii) post, and (iii) in person. (3) Is it the case that when detainees have filled in forms to initiate Federal Court Appeals (without access to legal advice) and posted them in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs box on site within days of being notified of such decisions, that these documents were not forwarded in time to comply with the mandatory 28 day appeal period so that the detainee was denied legitimate access to the appeal process. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) From1 June 2001 until the centre’s closure on 22 September 2002, a total of 155 immigration detainees had the refusal of their Protection Visa application affirmed by the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) whilst the detainees were in Curtin Immigration Reception And Processing Centre (IRPC).",168,Appropriation Bill No 4 2003 2004 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 2 2003 2004

308,Mr Hardgrave,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs(2) (a)-(b) In only exceptional circumstances, eg detainees in hospital, were detainees advised of the RRT’s determination on a day later than the Department. (c) Detainees have the choice of how they access legal advice. The initial contact is generally by phone and follow-up contact by post. (3) Standard procedure at the Curtin IRPC was that detainees placed their applications for appeal to the Federal Court in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) box within the mandatory 28 day appeal period. DIMIA checked the box each working day at approximately 8.30 am to ensure that all documents in the box were processed the same day the box was checked. Detainees were continually reminded that they were required to submit their applications with DIMIA prior to the 28 day cut off to ensure that the court would receive the application within the mandatory 28 day appeal period. There were a number of occasions where the court did not receive applications within the mandatory 28 day appeal period. Generally this was a result of detainees placing their applications in the DIMIA box without allowing sufficient time for the applications to be forwarded to the court. However, on a small number of occasions DIMIA’s actions delayed applications, which led to them being received by the court after the 28 day appeal period had elapsed. Where this occurred the Department liaised with the court to seek acceptance of the late applications. On each occasion the court acceded to DIMIA’s request. Immigration: Asylum Seekers (Question No. 2365) Ms Plibersek asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 10 September 2003: (1) Can he confirm that Aladdin Sisalem is being detained at the Manus Island detention centre. (2) Did Aladdin Sisalem request asylum on Thursday Island; if so, what was the legal basis for sending him to Papua New Guinea. (3) What is causing the delay in processing Aladdin Sisalem’s application for asylum. (4) Why is Aladdin Sisalem being kept in isolation on Manus Island when he could be detained on the Australian mainland at less expense. (5) What does the Government intend to do with Aladdin Sisalem when the Manus Island detention centre is closed in October. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Mr Sisalem is the responsibility of the Papua New Guinea (PNG) authorities and presently is accommodated at a facility on Manus Island. (2) He was detected in the Torres Strait in December 2002 attempting to enter Australia unlawfully and was interviewed by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) officials. He did not make an application for a protection visa and was returned to PNG. Australia and PNG have agreed to accept the return of people who illegally cross the Torres Strait without prior written approval from the receiving country. (3) This is a matter for PNG authorities. (4) I understand Mr Sisalem is cared for by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on behalf of the PNG authorities. (5) Decisions in relation to Mr Sisalem are matters for PNG authorities.",173,Questions On Notice

(2) What proportion of people (a) in Australia, and (b) in detention centres, has attempted suicide over the last five years. (3) In respect of the water supplied to each detention centre, (a) what is its calcium content, and (b) does it meet the Australian standard for potable water. (4) Can he provide examples of the daily menus at the detention centres. (5) Are different nutritional needs, such as those of children and pregnant women, catered for. (6) Do nutritionists monitor the diets of detainees; if so, are the nutritionists on site or do they review the menus only. (7) Are checks carried out to ensure that prescribed meals correspond with the actual food served by Australasian Correctional Management Pty Ltd (A.C.M). has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Incidents of attempted or actual self-harm are recorded according to the nature of the harm involved, rather than whether or not they may be directed towards suicide. TableA below provides the number of incidents of attempted or actual self-harm over the last 3 financial years. Data prior to this time is not readily available. (2) (a) This information is not held within the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA). (b) Please refer to the answer to part (1). (3) (a) Detailed information on the content of the water is not held within DIMIA and should be directed to the appropriate State Government. (b) The water supplied to each immigration detention facility is provided by the relevant State Government as potable water. (4) An example of the menus at immigration detention facilities is included at TableB below. (5) Special needs diets are catered for, such as for vegetarians, food allergies, children and pregnant women. All children have access to extra fresh milk and other items deemed necessary by the centre doctor; canned baby foods, milk formula and Farex dry baby foods are available for infants; and pregnant women are covered by a pre natal medical care plan which provides a structured nutritional diet. (6) Menus for detainees in immigration detention facilities are reviewed by a qualified nutritionist. Nutritionists are generally not employed onsite, but provide assistance and advice to ensure the appropriate nutritional content is met.

The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs requires law firms engaged to provide legal services to comply with these Directions when engaging Counsel. The Australian Government Solicitor has developed a database called the ‘Counsel Engagement System’. When briefing Counsel this Department uses Barristers who are included on this system. In addition, in 2001 the panel firms undertaking litigation on behalf of the Department were instructed to advise us immediately they became aware of any counsel briefed in our litigation becoming bankrupt. To date we have not been so advised. The law firms with which the Department and portfolio agencies have contracts are all major national law firms of high standing. Such firms would not knowingly engage or retain any barrister known to be acting in disregard of their obligations under taxation law. In a number of matters relating to native title, counsel has been briefed directly. Section 203FB of the Native Title Act 1993 requires that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission appoint a reviewer of Native Title Review Board decisions. In some instances a barrister has been appointed as a reviewer. These barristers are appointed as they have the necessary skills and knowledge in relation to the Native Title Act. Immigration: Stowaways (Question No. 2643) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 16 October 2003: (1) For each of the last two financial years, (a) how many people have arrived by ship as stowaways and, of these stowaways, (i) how many applied for protection in Australia, (ii) what was the citizenship of each applicant, and (iii) how many were successful. (2) For each of the last two financial years, (a) what was the cost of processing the stowaways in detention, including the cost of processing protection visa applications, and (b) was any of the cost of handling such unauthorised sea arrivals recovered from the shipping company involved; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (a) The number of people who arrived by ship as stowaways in the financial years 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 are 29 and 15 respectively. This number of stowaways who came to notice in 20012002 differs from the number previously given in response to Question 2331.

312,Mr Hardgrave,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous AffairsImmigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA’s) systems. (i) Of the 29 stowaways who arrived in 2001-2002, 10 applied for Protection Visas (PVs) in Australia. Of the 15 stowaways who arrived in 2002-2003, 3 applied for PVs in Australia. (ii) Of the 10 PV applicants in 20012002, 5 are from Iraq, 2 are from the Democratic Republic of Congo, 2 are from Burundi and 1 is from Somalia. Of the 3 PV applicants in 2002-2003, 1 is from Burundi, 1 is from Iraq and 1 is from the Democratic Republic of Congo. (iii) Of the 10 PV applications in 2001-2002, 8 have been successful and 2 have been refused. Of the 3 PV applications in 2002-2003, 1 has been refused and 2 have not yet been finally determined. (2) (a) The Department does not keep separate costs associated with the processing of stowaways in detention, including the cost of processing PV applications. Costs vary considerably depending on the time taken to process an application. The average cost of keeping an unlawful non-citizen in a detention centre in 2001-2002 and in 2002-2003 was $160 and $273 per day respectively. Based on volume, the average cost of processing a PV applicant in onshore detention in 2001-2002 was around $3,500. The average cost of processing a PV applicant in onshore detention in 2002-2003 was around $6,000. (b) While the Department infringes shipping companies for bringing stowaways without reporting them on arrival, it does not recover the cost of detention and processing of stowaways who seek protection and make PV applications on arrival. This policy is applied to ensure that there is an incentive to notify the presence of the stowaway. Shipping companies are, however, liable for the costs of removing stowaways whose PV applications have been unsuccessful. Immigration: Special Purpose Visas (Question No. 2726) Ms Jann McFarlane asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 5 November 2003: (1) How many Special Purpose Visas (SPV) have been granted to date in 2003. (2) How many people breached the conditions of their SPVs in (a) 1996, (b) 1997, (c) 1998, (d) 1999, (e) 2000, (f) 2001, (g) 2002, and (h) 2003 to date. (3) What action is taken to apprehend a crewmember not holding a SPV who jumps ship. (4) What steps are taken to confine a crewmember not holding a SPV to the ship the crewmember arrived on. (5) Who is responsible for notifying Australian authorities if a crewmember denied a SPV jumps ship. (6) What penalties apply for failing to notify Australian Authorities if a crewmember denied a SPV jumps ship. (7) Does legislation require ships to provide information on their crews prior to their departure from Australia; if not, does the Government seek to obtain this information voluntarily and, if it does, how. (8) Further to the answer to question No. 274, (Hansard, 14 May 2002, page 2139) what action is the Minister taking to secure the passage of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 2002. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Special Purpose Visas (SPV) come into effect through operation of law by virtue of persons holding a prescribed status. No applications are required and no grants are recorded. (2) SPV holders are subject to specific legislative visa limitations. In the case of crew of ships, the limitations are that they must depart Australia within 30 days if they sign off a ship and that while here they are not to perform any type of work other than that normally performed in the course of their crewing duties. As such, if an SPV holder overstays this will be included in other statistical data, as a number may apply for other visa classes. However, some statistics we do hold such as",182,Questions On Notice
313,Mr Hardgrave,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous AffairsSPV holders who do not return to the ship come under deserter statistics that we have provided previously. (3) Members of the crew of ships hold a SPV on arrival at an Australian port. If the SPV of a crewmember is ceased the crewmember is normally restricted on board their vessel. If they then leave that vessel, the crewmember is considered to have escaped from immigration detention and normal compliance action is taken. (4) As advised above, crew of ships will normally hold a SPV on arrival at an Australian port. If the SPV has been ceased under subsection 33(9) of the Migration Act, a notice under s.249 of the Migration Act may be issued to the Master of the vessel requiring that they prevent the crewmember from leaving the vessel. (5) Under s.228 of the Migration Act, the Master of the vessel is responsible for reporting any unauthorised absences of members of the crew whether or not the SPV of the crewmember has been ceased. (6) Under s.228 of the Migration Act, failure to report the absence of a crewmember may incur a penalty of up to $4,000. (7) Regulation 3.17 of the Migration Regulations provides that a master of a vessel may be required to provide information on the crew at any time at any port of call in Australia. Australia facilitates the movements of crewmembers into and from Australia through special immigration processing measures. Masters of vessels provide details of any crew joining the vessel while in Australia in order for those crewmembers to access Australia’s special measures. The details of all crewmembers who sign on and sign off ships while in Australian ports are copied to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) for monitoring the crewmembers’ movements. (8) The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 2002 is currently before the Senate. Telstra: BigPond (Question No. 2730) Ms O’Byrne asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 5 November 2003: In respect of the admission by Telstra that 1.2 million Bigpond customers and 270,000 broadband customers were directly affected by the recent collapse of Telstra email systems, is he able to say (a) how many Bigpond customers in the electoral division of Bass were directly affected, (b) how many broadband customers there are in the electoral division of Bass; and (c) how many of the broadband customers in the electoral division of Bass were directly affected. Telstra, is as follows: (a) and (c) Telstra has advised that during the recent problems with its BigPond service, e-mail delays were not confined to any particular service or region and not all customers experienced delays in retrieving and receiving e-mails. The exact number of customers affected in the electorate of Bass is not known. (b) Telstra has advised that there are some 2,890 broadband customers in the electorate of Bass. Immigration: Partner Visa Categories (Question No. 2784) Mr Price asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 24 November 2003: (1) What action has been taken to reduce or eliminate serial sponsorships of brides or partners.",183,Questions On Notice
314,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question, based on advice from(2) To what extent can the Minister say they have been effective. (3) Is there any scrutiny of Visitors Visas to detect the potential for serial sponsorship. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) On coming into office in 1996, this Government, in response to growing concerns about abuse of the partner visa categories as an avenue for people to gain permanent residence in Australia, introduced a package of measures limiting the number of sponsorships that may be lodged by people sponsoring a spouse, prospective spouse or interdependent partner. This package provides that: the number of approved spouse, prospective spouse or interdependency sponsorships are limited to two per person, a minimum of five years apart (approved sponsorships are those which resulted in the grant of any spouse, prospective spouse or interdependency visa, irrespective of when the visa was applied for); people who have been sponsored as a spouse, prospective spouse or interdependent partner will be restricted from sponsoring a partner under one of these visa classes for five years, counted from the date their application was lodged; a woman granted a Woman at Risk (Subclass 204) visa will not be able to sponsor a former spouse from whom she declared she was divorced or permanently separated prior to the grant of the visa, or who was not declared in her visa application, for a period of five years; and the total number of people that may ever be sponsored by one person in any of these subclasses is two. In support of this package, my Department has also introduced a range of measures to minimise possible misuse of the partner visa process, including: The introduction of a Best Practice Model for processing partner visa applications. The Model was introduced in Australian offices in 1999 and subsequently at overseas offices in November 2001. It aims to reduce partner visa processing times and enhance integrity of the program. The establishment of specialist Bona Fides Units (BFUs) in all Australian offices at the beginning of 2002, to undertake more intensive checking in cases where possible fraud has been identified. Benefits flowing directly from the establishment of the BFUs are already apparent. They include: better reporting on emerging fraud trends; greater cooperation between Australian and overseas offices in the identification and prevention of immigration fraud; and checks of onshore sponsors on behalf of overseas offices, leading to the discovery of non-bona fide applications where the sponsor was found to be living with another partner. A requirement that at least 85% of Spouse visa applicants, and all applicants for a Partner visa on the basis of a de facto or interdependent relationship, are interviewed. My Department is also working towards progressively improving departmental IT systems to facilitate better monitoring of people who sponsor visa applicants. (2) While the legislation does not allow a person to sponsor more than two partner visa applicants in their lifetime, there remains the possibility that a sponsor may seek to avoid identification as a previous sponsor by provision of misleading information. My Department closely monitors the partner visa caseload and decision-makers have the facility to cross-check departmental records for information concerning any previous sponsorships by a particular sponsor. My Department is also continually refining its processes to ensure that the risk of sponsors breaching the limitation on sponsorship is minimised.",184,Questions On Notice
315,Mr Hardgrave,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous AffairsInformation available to my Department indicates that the implementation of the sponsorship limitation provisions has been very successful in preventing sponsorship beyond the limit provided in the legislation. (3) Where an applicant for a Visitor visa declares an intention to be visiting an Australian citizen or permanent resident who has previously sponsored at least two persons on Partner visas, this is a matter that would be closely scrutinised in terms of whether a genuine visit was intended. However, not all Visitor visa applicants would necessarily declare the names of all the persons they were intending to visit while in Australia. At a more generic level, it should be noted that: The non-return rate for visitors coming to Australia has fallen very significantly over recent years while at the same time the approval rate has increased; and The rate at which visitors are applying for Partner visas after entering as visitors has also declined. Immigration: Freedom of Information (Question No. 2790) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 25 November 2003: (1) Can the Minister say whether requests under Freedom of Information (FOI) legislation are used routinely as an essential part of migration agency practice in affording migration assistance and making migration representations on behalf of visa applicants. (2) Can the Minister say whether there have been staff cutbacks in the Department’s Public Access Unit at any time during the financial years ending (a) 30 June 2002, and (b) 30 June 2003; if so, (i) when did these staff cutbacks occur, and (ii) why. (3) What were the staffing levels in the Public Access Unit immediately prior to any cutbacks during the financial years ended 30 June 2002 and 2003 and what is the staffing level of the Public Access Unit now. (4) What was the total number of requests to the Department under the FOI Act for the financial year ended 30 June (a) 2001, (b) 2002, and (c) 2003. (5) What was the average processing time for FOI requests during the financial year ended 30 June (a) 2001, (b) 2002, and (c) 2003. (6) What is the current average processing time of FOI requests. (7) Is the Minister able to say whether a failure to respond to an FOI request within 30 days is a breach of the FOI Act. (8) What steps is the Minister taking in respect of staffing levels to ensure that FOI requests are processed within the statutory time period of 30 days. (9) In respect of the recent amendments to the Migration Act proposed in the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Integrity Measures) Bill 2003, will a failure of a visa application by conduct of an agent who is unable to obtain information under the FOI legislation within the prescribed 30 day period, nonetheless, count towards a visa refusal; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Requests for access to documents under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (the FOI Act) are used to varying degrees by visa applicants and their agents. The Department is unable to comment",185,Questions On Notice
316,Mr Hardgrave,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairson whether migration agents consider such requests to be an essential part of migration agency practice. (2) There were no staff cutbacks in the Department’s Public Access Units throughout Australia at any time during the financial years ending (a) 30 June 2002, and (b) 30 June 2003. (3) The staffing level in the Department’s Public Access Units was: (a) 26.85 full-time equivalent employees as at 30 June 2002; (b) 35.20 full-time equivalent employees as at 30 June 2003. The current staffing level is estimated as 41 full-time equivalent employees. (4) The total number of requests to the Department under the FOI Act for the three financial years to 30 June 2003 was: (a) 2001 10,741 (b) 2002 10,567 (c) 2003 12,513. (5) Average processing times for FOI requests in the years ended 30 June 2001, 2002 and 2003 are set out below. Year Type of Request Average Processing Days 2000-2001 Access 31 Amendment 154 Annotation 6 All 34.8 2001-2002 Access 34 Amendment 179 Annotation 459 All 42.1 2002-2003 Access 40 Amendment 85 Annotation 0 All 41.8 (6) Average processing times for FOI requests in the 2004 financial year to date are set out below. Year Type of Request Average Processing Days 2003-2004 Access 33 Amendment 99 Annotation 0 All 36.3 (7) Section 15 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 sets out statutory time frames for a response by the Minister or an agency to an FOI request which has been made in the proper form. Subsection 15(5) provides that the Minister or agency must: within 14 days (if not earlier) take all reasonable steps to notify the requestor that the request has been received; and as soon as practicable, but in any case by the end of 30 days from when the request is received, take all reasonable steps to notify the applicant of a decision on the request (including a decision under s21 of the Act to defer provision of the document). Section 15(6) provides that the Minister or agency may extend the period for a decision by a further 30 days when the requested documents are likely to affect Commonwealth-State relations, relate to business affairs or contain personal information of a third party. The applicant must be advised of any such extension as soon as practicable. Section 31 of the Act provides that certain periods are to be disregarded for the purposes of processing requests. The fact that an FOI request has not been decided within 30 days of receipt does not necessarily mean that the legislative requirements have not been met. (8) As part of its ongoing commitment to client service and process improvement, the Department is developing a centralised FOI processing unit. The centralised unit is expected to facilitate the development of staff expertise in FOI processing and provide greater responsiveness in caseload management. To date, the Department’s central office has taken over processing FOI requests that previously would have been done in the ACT, NT, Tasmania and SA offices. Transfer of the FOI function from Qld and WA offices will take place over the next few months. In all cases, the state/territory offices remain responsible for finalising their existing FOI cases. New South Wales and Victoria offices will continue processing FOI requests due to the high volume of FOI applications received in these states and the costs that would be involved in transferring the files to central office. This will be re-evaluated in the future, following trial of a system for scanning files to CD-ROM. (9) The purpose of the proposed Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents Integrity Measures) Bill 2004 is to strengthen and improve the regulation of migration agents. These amendments are necessary to ensure that the Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA) has adequate powers to protect consumers and that migration agents operate ethically, professionally and competently when assisting people to come to or stay in Australia. It will provide the MARA with new powers to sanction migration agents, particularly those agents who lodge a high number of vexatious, unfounded or incomplete applications. The Senate inquiry into the Bill was finalised in December 2003, with the Committee suggesting some further amendments to the proposed Bill. The Bill will now be reintroduced into the Senate in February 2004 for enactment. The Department understands the honourable member’s question as being whether a migration agent could be disciplined under the proposed powers if: the agent has multiple failures of visa applications due to incomplete applications; and those applications were incomplete due to the Department not meeting the processing times set out in the FOI Act. Decisions under the Migration Act 1958 and the Freedom of Information Act 1982 are separate and independent. However, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs’ (DIMIA’s) policy is that if an FOI applicant has a substantive visa application under consideration, the Department will endeavour to process the FOI before finalising the substantive visa application. Nevertheless, as detailed in the Department’s FOI Handbook, there are circumstances where request, such as when: access to all the documents requested through FOI has already been given; the decision maker is required by law to finalise the substantive application within a statutory time limit; the applicant is in immigration detention, and processing the FOI request alone either protracts the period a person spends in detention or puts greater pressure on the decision maker to release the detainee against their better judgement; the FOI applicant has agreed that the substantive application should be decided first and a speedy decision is possible. Immigration: Migration Related Decisions (Question No. 2820) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 1 December 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2186 (Hansard, 13 October 2003, page 21279) in respect of the application of section 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (ADJR) to decisions of an administrative character under the Migration Act 1958 that are not privative clause decisions within the meaning of subsection 474(2) of the Migration Act, is the Minister aware of the judgment of the High Court of Australia in R v Hickman; Ex parte Fox and Clinton (1945) 70 CLR 598. (2) Notwithstanding the privative clause provision in section 474 of the Migration Act, does section 5 still permit judicial review of decisions in which it can be established that there exists (a) Jurisdictional error, (b) Mala Fides, and (c) Constitutional Grounds. (3) Are there any other grounds known to the Minister in which the provisions of section 5 of the ADJR Act apply notwithstanding the provision of section 474 Migration Act; if so, what are they. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) I am aware of the decision of the High Court of Australia in R v Hickman; Ex parte Fox and Clinton (1945) 70 CLR 598. (2) and (3) Paragraph (da) of Schedule1 to the ADJR Act excludes a privative clause decision within the meaning of subsection 474(2) of the Migration Act from those decisions to which the ADJR Act applies. This has the effect of restricting the jurisdiction of the Federal Court and the Federal Magistrates Court under the ADJR Act in respect of migration decisions to those decisions set out in subsection 474(4) of the Migration Act and any decisions specified in regulation made under subsection 474(5). Whether a particular decision made under the Migration Act would be excluded from judicial review would be a matter for the Court to determine. Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 2867) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 4 December 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2190 (Hansard, 2 December 2003, page 23139), to which previous questions does he specifically refer. (2) Is he aware of Section 13 of the Preliminary Draft Master Plan (PDMP) for Sydney Airport 03/04 submitted by Sydney Airport Corporation Limited (SACL) in which it states, inter alia, at paragraph 13.1 that (a) “Land use and planning within the airport site is regulated under the Airports Act 1996 and not under the EP+A Act”, (b) “Particular language is used in the Master Plan",186,Questions On Notice
317,Mr Hardgrave,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairsto comply with Airports Act 1996 requirements only, and is not intended to import or apply any state land use planning or zoning requirements or obligations on either SACL or Sydney Airport” and (c) “where the concept of ‘development’ is used in this Master Plan, it describes a ‘building activity’ as set out in the Airports Act 1996 (rather than the definition of ‘development’ in the EP+A Act)”. (3) Is the position taken by SACL on the application of NSW planning and environmental law as described in Chapter 13 of the PDMP different from his previous responses to the earlier questions on notice to which he refers; if so, how; if not, why not. (1) Questions 1724, 2056, 2058 and 2188 part 1. (2) Yes. (3) No. The preliminary draft master plan is Sydney Airport Corporation’s strategic plan for the development of the airport. This is not a Commonwealth document. Previous responses have referred to the requirements specified in section 71 of the Airports Act. Veterans: Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service (Question No. 2872) Mr Katter asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 4 December 2003: (1) Is he aware of an initiative by a group of Vietnam veterans who have established on Kalpower Station a respite area known as Pandanus Park for the use of all returned war veterans. (2) Is he aware of reports that, in contrast to many government counselling services, this project is producing beneficial outcomes for the physiological well-being and mental health of veterans. (3) Would the Government consider purchasing Kalpower Station from the Queensland Government, which intends to embark on a course that would preclude such a handover, and arranging for it to be held in trust for Vietnam veterans and returned servicemen from other wars. (1) I have not received any formal representations on this specific initiative. I am advised that the initiative has been brought to the attention of the office of the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, the Hon Danna Vale MP. (2) I am not aware of any reports regarding the mental health outcomes of the Pandanus Project. However the government’s many counselling services for veterans are in fact of great benefit. For example the Vietnam Veteran Counselling Service (VVCS) is a specialised, free, confidential service for all veterans and serving Australian Defence Force personnel. The VVCS has recently expanded and its success is evidenced by the year on year increasing numbers of veterans participating in the counselling, and recent surveys indicating high satisfaction levels amongst veterans. (3) I am advised that the Queensland Government purchased the land in 1995. I further understand that the Queensland Government has offered alternative sites to the veterans, all of which have been turned down. It is inappropriate for the Australian Government to comment on the future use of the land as current control lies with the State of Queensland. Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers (Question No. 2875) Mr Brereton asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 4 December 2003: (1) What has been the total cost of the preparation, publication and distribution of “Resolving Deadlocks: a discussion paper on section 57 of the Australian Constitution”.",189,Questions On Notice
