The greater portion of the freights is determined by the British Government, which now controls all shipping that leaves Australian ports.

That is oneof the many evidences to be found that information which is of importance to us and of great value to our opponents is finding its way through what we consider illegitimate channels into the information bureau of the enemy.

8,Mr Palmer,"I am prepared tohas secured for the company very considerable patronage from the public. Many particularly loyal persons would prefer to trade w it h the company because of the name it bears. large number of so-called companies, some thirteen or fourteen in number, having community of interest,' and all working together under the same directorate; and the name of one man who figures in all of the companies as manager or director is H . W . A . Detterding, This gentleman is variously said to be a Dane, a Dutchman, or a German. I am not pre1 pared to prove his German nationality, but I assert on the very highest authority that he has very large German interests; and it is averred that he is employed by the German Secret Intelligence Department. proximity to the borders of Germany, and he holds the thread of all these interlocking companies to which I have referred. of association of the British. Imperial Oil Company, which have been lodged in Melbourne, in order to prove that he is the sole director of that company. Article 57 of these articles of association reads as follows: There shall be no board of directors of the company,, but the business of the company shall be carried on and the functions and duties of directors discharged by a manager or managers. The first manager shall be H. W. A. Detterding, who shall remain in office until he resigas or ceases to occupy the position of managing director of the Asiatic Petroleum Company Limited, whichever event takes place first. This is one of the interlocking and the colossus over all is H. W. A. Detterding. directors, he governs and controls British Imperial Oil Company; absolute control over the local manager.

I do not know what reason they have to carry such great losses. £20,000 ? been, increased, but it was £20,000 at that time. Preceding the British. I m perial Oil Company was another concern of which H . W . A . Detterding was the presiding genius. This was the Shell Transport and Trading Company, for which the firm of Gollin and Company He lives in Hollandi n close acted as agents. As they had failed to file a balance-sheet the Registrar of Titles had occasion to write to them for it , and on the 21st January, 1906, the BritishI shall quote from the articles Imperial Oil' Company wrote to the Registrar of Titles as follows: We now enclose copy of the Shell Transport and Trading Company's balance-sheet for the year 1904. We have applied to the company for the balance-sheets for the years 1902 and 1903. The balance-sheet for 1905, owing to the wide ramifications of the company, will not be available until the end of December this year, when we will be glad to furnish you with a copy. We might perhaps explain that the Shell Company do not now trade in Australia, their business having been transferred to the British Imperial Oil Company, and their tanks and instalments leased to that company for trade purposes. On 31st January, 1916, Gollin and Company wrote to the Registrar as follows:companies, We have carefully perused the balance-sheets, and to the best of our knowledge and belief the reserve fund is used in the ordinary course As there is no board qf of business, unless one can state that it ' is the invested in shares of other companies.

The fact is that the companies are one and the same. The odium of being a German company, or a twin brother to those so considered, must rest on the British Imperial Company. Great damage is done to the Australian trade by the importation by this company of oil in tank steamers. When-this method of importation was inaugurated it was regarded as a commercial triumph, but it has proved to our disadvantage. ports about one-fifth of the motor spirit used in Australia, the importation of oil from the East Indies during the year 1915-1916 being 11,890,000 gallons, or over 42,000 tons.

Were the German submarines to enter the Indian Ocean, their success would largely depend on their ability to obtain oil supplies, and they would be greatly assisted by an enemy company trading here with oil. That fact in itself -is enough to justify the Government in inquiring into this matter very carefully.

There are one or two phases of the subject, however, that tation of his case the honourable member offered an argument which, in itself, is rather vicious, viz., that we ought to prohibit the use of a certain company's products, not only on the broad grounds stated by him, and with which -I agree, but on the further ground that the company employs tank steamers, which lead to a decrease of the Australian labour required for handling its product. If the honourable member will consider for a moment he will realize that the sameargument might be applied against th& bulk handling of. wheat, and against every up-to-date method for the handling of goods in any country in the world. If his contention were applied all round, Australiawould become another China a back-water in tlie world's progress. The honourable member interjects now that his objection is not to the bulk handling, but is founded on the fact that these tank steamers cannot carry away any other goods. There is a yast amount, of reason in what the Prime Minister said upon that point. The right honourable gentleman pointed to the fast that American shipping coming to Australia with American goods does not carry our exports to England, where we wish them to go. The honourable member for Echuca has made out a primd facie case, and the Government is bound now to take action-whic h must, however, follow upon a very close investigation. I do not think the honourable member would claim that on the casehe presented to the House to-day the Government is necessarily bound to at once prohibit this company from selling its products in AusI wish tralia, but the Government should certainly do something more than order the ordinary departmental scrutiny of the company's operations. It should institute at once a close investigation, and, if that investigation proves the honourable",14,Adjournment Formal Importation Of Benzine And Kindred Power To Convey To The Enemy Information Products

I disagree from the honourable member when be said that to suddenly cut off one-fifth of Australia's supplies of oil would not detrimentally affect our community. We could not do Australia's industries a greater injury than to take that step, unless it be absolutely essential. Petrol is a power very widely used throughout the cities of Australia and for lighting and motor purposes in the country, and we as a community could not be helped by the further rising of the price of the comnow been given has the English name of modity, which has already been increased from about ls. l d . to 2s. 6d. per gallon, unless we see very grave grounds, such as the honourable member has suggested, for taking that step. I rose mainly for the purpose of urging upon the Prime Minister that he should order a particular and special inquiry into this matter. It is of no use to have a loose general control by the Attorney-General's Department. We have had such control in other matters, and it has been unsatisfactory. "" In the early stages of the war I urged upon the Government the total prohibition of the use of enemy trade marks and descriptions. A considerable time after the mater was first ventilated the then Hughes Government accepted the proposition, and everybody thought that it was to be put into operation. As a matter of fact, that policy has been put in universal operation, except in regard to the two trade names of "" aspirin "" and "" lysol."" draw attention to the fact that there is not formed.] will recollect that the argument which led the Government to accept the proposition to prohibit the use of enemy trade marks ,and descriptions in Australia was that unless some such step were taken we should be protecting, during a state of war, German ownership in the goodwill /( 'of those articles, and after the war the original German owners would step in and again derive the benefit. spect of every trade mark and description, with the exception of the two I have mentioned, this embargo has since rested, but it seems to be impossible to move the Government in regard to the names "" aspirin "" and "" lysol."" In the first place a licence was granted for the local manufacture of aspirin, tlie ingredients of which are well known to every doctor; the drug itself is manufactured by dozens of firms throughout the world under different names. It was the name "" aspirin "" that was of value to the German producer. Instead of preventing the use of the name in Australia the Government has seen fit to grant a licence for the local production of the drug under the name "" Nicholas-aspirin."" Originally the l i cence was granted to four persons, three of whom had German Christian or surnames. The man to whom the licence has Nicholas, but his Christian names are "" H a r ry Wolff."". When visiting Sydney ai few days agoT noticed that the whole window of a German chemist's shop contained nothing but Nicholas-aspirin. That fact may be merely coincidental, but I am confident that every patriotic German will do his utmost to keep alive a trade name like "" aspirin,"" because of the value of it to German manufacturers. We must wipe out this sort of thing, and I ask the Minister for the Navy to look into the question, and see whether he cannot stop the special exemption that has been extended to the holders of aspirin and lysol patent rights. present. [Quorum formed.] has informed me that the Department has made a search of the birth certificate and place *of origin of the gentleman who is licensed to manufacture aspirin, and although his name is Harry Wolff Nicholas, and although his three associates in rea quorum present.

Bnti f the Minister will look into the window of the chemist in Sydney to whom I have referred, be -will see of what value the continuance of this, licence is to German industry. I dare say that German chemists throughout Australia do not hesitate to make a special line of this particular product. It is probably a veryexcellent product, as good as any other In reproduct of this well-known drug that is manufactured; but do not forget that the keeping alive of the name of the German article cannot fail to be of service to the",15,Adjournment Formal Importation Of Benzine And Kindred Power To Convey To The Enemy Information Products

53,Mr Kelly,"The Solicitor-GeneralGerman holders of the patent rights after the war. In regard to the matter raised hy the honorahle member for Echuca, I think the time has come for the Government of this country to prevent fraud upon the patriotic feelings of the community by the use by enemy agencies of English titles for their companies. It should be made Illegal for other than Australians to us© Australian frontispieces for any ventures they undertake, and a company's title should be a guarantee of its composition. I think the Government should step in and see that all these concerns bear the right names and general descriptions, that no Germans are permitted to start a company and call it , for example, the Australian Continental Tyre Company, and that no German influence can call it self-if the honourable member proves his assertion-the British Imperial Oil Company. If these concerns are to have colours under which to sell their commodities, let them trade under their own colours, and let them not defraud Australian patriotism. [ 4 . 9 ] a deputation to the Prime Minister prior to his departure to England on the question of the use of German names in connection w i th chemicals and drugs, and the manufacturing and chemists of Australia then pointed out how easily the particular commodities to which the honourable member for Wentworth has referred, namely, aspirin and lysol, could be manufactured in Australia. It is very evident that the Germans do not care what steps we take so long as we keep their trade names alive. Many people are under the im pression that aspirin and lysor* are chemicals, whereas they are merely combinations of well-known trade commodities. When we talk about fighting"" the enemy trade, surely we ought to have sense enough to wipe out the names that the Germans have patented and apolied to these particular combinations. If the British authorities do not care to coin names for these products, let us do it ourselves, so that people may know that these articles are not chemicals, but are merely combinations of well-known lines under special names. When the honourable member for Melbourne was speaking, he was placing on record certain names of importance in British communities which appear among the directorates of many companies, and though I may be charged with wasting time and material in continuing that list, and in having it recorded in Hansard, I propose to doso, because the list will be easy of access in the columns of Hansard.

We have next, Dr. ArnoldJ . Cohen Stuart, of The Hague.

When the records of Australia come to be written, the present session will be looked back upon as remarkable in its relation to the history of democratic government.

This is being done deliberately because I am speaking, but it is my intention not to spare any one of them because of their absence. The Prime Minister is a gentleman who during many years has worked his way upwards from the lowest rung of the ladder to the highest position in the public life of this country. the Labour party when there was nothing to be gained by belonging to it , and when membership of it entailed great sacrifice. The honourable member for Brisbane, on the other hand, who moved to depose .him from the leadership of the Labour party, joined the Labour movement merely to live on it , like many members on the opposite side of the chamber, who, when they cannot live on it any longer, w ill leave it . Althoughi n bhe opinion of most the Prime Minister is the ablest man in the public life of Australia, and has the Australian public behind him, as was proved by the"" marvellous reception given to him in all the capital cities of Australia on his return from London last year, a number of members of the Labour party were determined to drive him out of the Labour movement. Why? Because the members of the party had ceased to be independent, and were being controlled by outside influence. Even before the Prime Minister had gone to England to represent Australia there, his ought to have a overthrow was plotted, and during his [Quorum formed.'] absence his enemies worked with remarkable skill and ability. They were ready I have not taken to .launch, their bolt at the first opportunity. I myself received instructions from Adelaide to vote to put the Prime Minister out of office, bub I treated the order, as I should treat any order of the . kind, with contempt. The members who sit opposite have forfeited the right to represent their constituents here, because they are not free men, being bound hand and foot to outside organizations. But the drama began earlier. A f t e r the last Fisher Administration had been formed, outside organizations became dissatisfied with"" the conduct of some of its Ministers, and on Mr Fisher's appointment to the High Commissionership they decreed that I and the honourable member for Darling should leave office. The honourable member for Darling had said that when act[Quorum formed.] ing as Minister of the Crown he would A l t h o u g h attennot be dictated to by outside organizations; and I had stated that, as a M i nister, I was the servant of bhe public, and responsible to the public, and -that I would not accept the dictation of any section of the community. ShouldI again become a Minister, I would make the same statement. No man ought to take the oath of office unless prepared to be independent in the people's interests. Honourable members opposite are the mere lackeys He joined of the Political Labour League, and ought to be so branded. They are, moreover, the representatives of the Industrial Workers of the World, though they declare that they do not belong to that association. They have ceased to believe in the Labour platform, and have adopted the platform of the Industrial Workers of the World. The Labour. platform is well. known to every honourable member.

Guizot said that the British Government is always more advanced than the British Parliament. always been true. The Parliament cannot keep pace with the Government, because the people will not let it do so. That the Parliament should march with the people is the glory and the strength of the British political system. But the principles of honourable. members opposite are very different from' those of the Labour platform, and from -those on which honourable members generally, on this side have based their conduct. We on this side are in favour of arbitration and the peaceful settlement of disputes; the renegade Labour members opposite, who have bet-rayed their principles, 'are, like the Industrial Workers of the World, all for direct action and strikes. It was direct action that was taken so far .as I was concerned, and it was. proposed to take direct action in regard to the Prime Minister. When the honourable member for Darwin was Minister fbr Home Affairs, he encouraged sabotage, and it reached its high-water mark in the Department during his term of office. ' I know the working people. I sprang from their ranks. I have lived among them, both in this country and on the other side of the world; and I say that most of them are opposed to sabotage, which has arisen like a film or scum on the Labour movement. Honourable members opposite, however, have never dared to make, a stand' against it . If you wish to know how low. a Labour' party can fall; you have only to remember theappointment of the honourable member for Darwin to a portfolio which gave him control of one of the largest employing Departments of the Commonwealth. Labour members opposite have sold their principles, and are: bound hand and foot to an outside gang. In an evil' moment they gave away their freedom as members of Parliament..

That has there anything in common ' between the men who took part in the strike of 1890the men of the nineties-and the men who are at the top of the Australian Labour party to-day ? That party to-day is run by the very excrement of labour. The Melbourne Trades Hall is to-day the storm centre, the head-quarters of the In dustrial Workers of the World system in all its glory. It is trying to poison thet minds qf the workers in my own State and in every part of Australia. When we were building up the La'bour party years ago, what part did it-play in the movement $ Why, Victoria bred scabs to take the-place of the men who went out during the 1890* strike. To-day,, these men are breeding assassins; they are breeding the Industrial' Workers of the World. They never had any principle, and they have none today. These are the men who tell me that They, too, support sabotage. the workers made me what I am. They certainly did, and I venture to say they will keep me where I am; but I am not referring to the so-called workers to whom honourable members opposite ijare crawling. I blame honorable members opposite for their failure to take up a firm stand when they were approached by these men, and for their failure to point out that the lines, they were asked to follow were undesirable. Had they done so, they would not have been enslaved as they are' to-day. That, then, is. the position. We may set aside theconsideration of what the Conservatives or the-Liberals have done.

If has been said over and over again that the Prime Minister was expelled from the Labour party because of his advocacy of conscription. That is mere humbug. Conscription was a mere stalking horse used by honourable members opposite to give effect to their in famous policy. Those who want proof of my statement will find it in the Worker.

But when we appealed to the Australian Labour party to' join in forming a Government, with that object in view, they took up a most insulting and impertinent attitude. Our invitation was superciliously treated by them, and they allowed three weeks to elapse before they proceeded to consider it . Has any one ever heard before of such contemptible and petty little men. The Empire is engaged in the greatest war in history. All that we enjoy, and hope to enjoy, depends upon the British Navy which guards our coast, and every intelligent man in Australia, unless his judgment is warped by reason of his bitter hatred of the Prime Minister, will say that that right honourable gentleman should already be in London to attend the Conference. I do not know what the people of AustraUa think of the party that is responsible for the delay, nor do I know what subjects are to be discussed at the Conference; but I think I could make a pretty shrewd guess. Isi t of no concern"" to the people that Australia should be represented at the Imperial Conference?

Isi t not also essential that Australia should.have a voice in the determination of what shall be the economic basis of the government of the Empire? other questions no doubt w i ll be considered by the Conference, and it is absolutely essential that the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth should be there, but he is unable to get away because honourable members opposite are holding up this motion and blocking it at every stage. Their endeavour is to delay it , not only by every legitimate means, but also by every illegitimate means. The position is 'serious, but the people of Australia will acquit the present Government and its supporters of any responsibility.

My objection to an election is that at a time when we are engaged in war we should not indulge in the strife of an election, which even in times of peace rouses the worse passions of human nature. A Government or Parliament which sought to bring about such turmoil amongst the people at a time of crisis. would be signally neglecting its duty. I think the House of Commons is in its tenth session. Its seven years' term expired long ago, and although there has been talk in the press and amongst the people from time to time about the necessity for an election, such clamours have died down, and every member of the House of Commons has agreed that, no matter what else happened, there should be no election in Englandu n t i l after the war. The same course has been followed in France and in Italy, and anybody but a^ody of bigoted fanatics would say that such unanimity of action among the warring nations proves the wisdom of not engaging in elections while the country is at war. It is for that reason I am opposed to the people of the Commonwealth being precipitated into the turmoil of an election unti l the war is over, or, at any rate, Does not the happiness of for a reasonable time-say , eighteen months, by which time we hope the war w i ll have been brought to a successful conclusion. that. There were some who thought that Germany would be beaten in six months, but the great Field-Marshal who has done his work and passed away fixed the duration of hostilities at three years.

Why are members of the Opposition so anxious to have an election ? want an election? w ill tell the honourable member the reason.

It is the duty of public men to take risks and responsibilities on their shoulders. That is the type of man the English-speaking peoples believe in. They know that their public men make mistakes, but they ask that their leaders shall be strong men, willing to take a risk in doing what they believe to be in the interests of the country, and not .to be easily shifted from their positions by changing circumstances from time to time..

The honourable member for Bendigo is merely throwing out a hint. He is not manly enough to speak straight out. He is not built that way. He does not say, "" The delegates should press the position that we are prepared to throw France over,"" but he asks, "" What will they do?""

When I asked the Prime Minister if he were willing to allow himself to be elected by this House, he would not say that he'was. The honourable member for Flinders, with one or two Ministers and the representative of the King, did things in' this' country such as are without precedent. But I do not think that he would enter into a transaction like the shipping deal without informing Parliament regarding it. I have been his political foe ever since. With the support of the A ge newspaper and the largest majority in the Victorian Assembly that any Premier ever had, he was going to reform the Legislative Council, and I discovered thab he had .fooled us. I had been his loyal follower until then; but when I found that he had turned down the reform, notwithstanding his promises, I became his political opponent. Still, I do not think that,he would do anything personally dishonest, and have never imputed to-him dishonesty in personal dealings. But I again accuse him of reducing the sum paid in pensions to the old men and women of Victoria from £216,000 to £150,000.

His coffin will be the West Sydney electorate. He will not dare to show his nose there again as a candidate. The honourable member for Hume doubted my statement about the action of the honourable member for Flinders regarding the reduction of the Victorian old-age pensions vote. But in the Black and White List compiled and published by ' Mr Prendergast, under the auspices of the Political Labour Council of-Victoria, containing the important division lists of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for the i sessions of 1902 and 1903, on page 47, will be found a list of those who voted on the second reading of the Old-age Pension Amendment Bill, and among the names of those there reported as voting for the reduction of concessions to old age pensioners is that of the honourable member for Flinders. His name is also recorded in the division for the reduction ef the vote for old-age pensions to £150,000, the sum that had been paid during the previous financial year being £216,000. The amount available for the payment of old-age pensions was thus reduced by £66,000. existing pensions were not reduced. reduced.

If the decency he would not have gone to Ballarat, in the absence of its representative, to form a branch of his organization.

Two burning questions await the determination of the people. The first of these is the protection of our industries. Everything that we want and that we can make in Australia ought to be manufactured 'here. The people in their desire to support Protection are straining at the leash. The second question, to be decided, by the people is whether they ought not to have the right to recall this Parliament when it will not do its work. Is it reasonable to expect the people to be satisfied with a Parliament which in three years sits for only 137 days ? Hundreds of people call at my office daily, .and by putting a question in this HouseI can have attention given to a Defence Department matter which would not be dealt with for weeks if we were not in session. I am reminded that the honourable member for Ballarat, who is now fighting for his country, stated in this House on 27th August, 1913, as reported in Hansard, volume LXX., page 577The present Attorney-General, as Premier of Victoria, when it was found necessary to wipe out a deficit, proposed a reduction in the old age pensions .payable in this State. On Thursday, 24th November, 1903, the motion for the second reading of a Bill for the reduction of old-age pensions was moved by Premier Irvine in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, and -was carried by forty-five votes to twenty-six. When the honourable member for Flinders faces his Creator he will be ashamed of The Prime Minister is that Act, and sorry that he ever introduced it.

Here is a resolution that was passed at the last meeting of the North Melbourne branch of the Political Labour CouncilThat this branch of the Political Labour Council protests against the action of the Hughes Government in sending three conscriptionist delegates to Great Britain at the present time\ . Because they do not represent public opinion in the Commonwealth. 2. They represent a party which holds power By the treachery of a portion of the Labour party. 3. The .delegation is composed of two Liberals from a party which is in a minority of both Houses of the Federal Parliament, and was defeated at the last Federal elections. The third delegate is a Labour rat, whose whole party numbers only 13 in the Representatives of 75 members, and 17 in the Senate of 36 members. An honourable member is not entitled to apply such an expression to another honourable member, nor is he in order in making a quotation in which an honourable member is so described. ing this resolution, which -continues4. That the defection of the Labour members who followed the Prime Minister was due to their opposition to a decision of the Labour party to oppose conscription, the voters subsequently in a heavy poll deciding against conscription by a majority of 72,000 votes. 5. That, such expenditure at the present juncture is a criminal waste of public money. 6. That Mr Andrew Fisher, representative of the Commonwealth, now in London, is quite as capable and carries more public approval than any of the proposed delegation, and is a better representative of that Labour party which would be in power if it were not for treachery. I recognise that Australia must be represented at the Imperial Conference, and I think that Mr Andrew Fisher, whose honesty and loyalty to Australia and the Empire no one can question, should be immediately appointed to attend it . That is what the Government would do if they were not afraid to go to the country at once. We could then have a general elec° tion, and the people could be asked also to say who should represent them at the Conference.

I am grateful to the great American Republicf or the way in which it came to Britain's rescue in her hour of need. When the poor Russian soldiers were being sent out with only one rifle to every three men, so that when one man fell the second seized his rifle, and was followed in t u r n by the t h i r d , Japan came to Russia's assistance and, by supplying her with munitions, saved her forces. In the same way America came to Britain's aid in the supply of munitions of war. I endorse every word that the honourable member for Hindmarsh uttered in regard to that great and noble nation, France. A t first we were holding only a little b it of' the line on the Western front , and could not have held the larger bit, as we have since done, but for the munitions with which the United States of.America supplied us. I am also gratef u l to Americaf o r the way in which she has held the scales of neutrality. She said, in effect, to the world,' "" An y one can buy in this market,"" but she knew f u l l well that the British Navy had swept the German flag from the seas of the 0 world. / In these circumstances I resent what the honourable member for HentyI was merely readsaid. I could, if need be, supply the honourable member with some pertinent quo-tations from speeches by Mr Roosevelt, than whom there is no more bitter opponent of the Huns.

The Australia could not protect a sea line stretching from Brisbane to Perth, and the other ships of the Australian Fleet were not able to defeat that strong German squadron, as was proved by its destruction of a powerful British Fleet off the coast of South America.

Of what does the Government I remind him consist to-day?-the wreckage of many parties, including that section which tried to wreck the Labour party.

W h a t right has a man to demand that he should stop in a house without paying rent? Some questions have been asked in the House recently with regard to soldiers' wives and rent. soldier's wife has not enough with which to pay the rent of her house, it is the duty of the War Council to pay her rent, but no person has the right to take any other person's house and stay in it as long as he likes, and knock it about as much as he likes, and say that he will not pay rent for it . What people will put up houses when such a pernicious doctrine is put into practice ?

I submit that I am absolutely in order. orable member is not in order, and I ask him to obey the ruling of the chair. MrJ . H . CATTS I shall deal with these questions in their order1. Extension of the life of Parliament. -Australi a has recently witnessed three I called intrigues for the extension of the life of Parliaments. An election was proceeding when war was declared. Mr Hughes, I apologize. If there is who was "" out,"" and Mr Cook, who was '' in , "" considered the people would not change a Government while the war was in progress. Mr Hughes donned the garb of the patriot, and demanded that the elections should not be proceeded w it h . On the other hand, Mr Cook and Sir William Irvine refused to stop the elections, and quoted history to show that elections had been proceeded w it h , during war, universally. Then came a fine piece of manoeuvring. Sir William Irvine said that the elections could not be constitutionally stopped. orable member must refer to members by I withdraw the statethe names of their constituencies. Mr J. H . CATTS Mr Hughes mentioned invoking the Imperial Parliament to alter the Constitution, as one alternative amongst others. Sir William Irvine ask the honourable member to refer to members by the names of their constituencies. . , MrJ . H . CATTS I am referring now to what appeared in the press at a time when Sir William Irvine was not a member of the House, but an ordinary citizen. Sir William Irvine cried, "" A h , Mr Hughes wishes to invoke the I m perial Parliament to interfere with our affairs."" Mr Hughes immediately repudiated this by saying, "" I said it could be done, not that it should be done."" able member reading? MrJ . H . CATTS -From my own I do not think, notes, just as the Prime Minister read from his notes when he submitted this motion. Mr Hughes and Sir William Irvine, Mr Cook and MrW a t t , on behalf of their respective parties, each repudiated the idea that Britain should alter our Australian Constitution. The language employed by Mr Cook, and reported in the Sydney Daily Telegraph on the 17th August, 1914, is especially pertinent to the present occasion.

245,Mr Botd,"From what is the honorAnd, further, in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, of 2nd September, 1914, he saidTo invoke the Imperial Parliament was, pergoverning rights to .the Commonwealth of haps, the last thing to be thought of in Australia. An appeal to the Imperial Parliament to interfere with Australia's Constitution was, to the minds of these men a little over two years ago, the last thing to be thought of, an unpardonable offence, notwithstanding that war and panic were raging. The next example of the extension of the life of Parliament scheme appeared in New South Wales, when Messrs. afraid to face the electors, arranged to postpone the elections for twelve months. Again, a Coalition and so-called National Government was formed behind the backs of the people. Again, the war was the excuse. A Government which could have nothing i o do with ithe conduct of the war pleaded a "" win-the-war "" justification for depriving the people of New South Wales of their constitutional right of electing their Legislature at the proper time. Having postponed the appeal to the country by trickery and fraud, this Government have now sprung elections on New Soutli Wales by surprise, giving the electors one week in which to enrol, hoping that by reason of bhe disfranchisement of 'tens of thousands of the citizens of New South Wales, and by jerrymandering the elections, to impose their despotic rule upon the people. Nowi n the Pederal Parliament we have the third bad example-anothe r Coalition formed behind the of the people, another so-called "" National Government,"" another so-called "" winthe-war "" policy, another base betrayal of the people, another attempt at disfranchisement of the electors. The"" war "" and the "" f l a g "" are being prostituted to cover the most loathsome devices in order to divert the attention of the people while their constitutional freedom and liberty are being filched from them. Thisi n stance amply justifies the famous remark of D r . Johnson, when patriotism was being abused, that "" Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel."" 2. Invoking Britain to Disrupt our Australian Constitution. The six States of Australia agreed to federate in one in Federal Constitution. dissoluble Commonwealth. . This agreement was ratified by the Imperial Parliament by the passage of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act. By this Act Great Britain not only conceded f u l l selfAustralia, but gave up its own right to interfere in our affairs. It virtually, created us an independent nation. Section 128 of the Constitution sets for th the procedure to be followed to alter the Constitution by a referendum of the people, and says emphatically that ""The Constitution may not be altered except in that manner.'' This section is the pivotal point of Australia's freedom and self-government-the charter of our liberties. Holman and Wade, both It is a public scandal that there should exist in an Australian Parliament men so recreant to their trust, so disloyal to the people of Australia, and so lost to a sense of their duty, as to attempt to invoke the aid of Great Bribain unconstitutionally ito disrupt our Constitution and interfere with our self-government. Such men should b'e impeached for their disloyalty to Australia, for, if it becomes established by precedent, inspired by Australia itself, that section 128 of the Constitution may be overcome and lightly regarded, our freedom and self-government will be in perpetual jeopardy from any accidental and immoral coalition of politicians, recreant to bheir election pledges, petitioning the Imperial Parliament for an amendment of the Constitution. It is nothing short of a calamity, both in the Empire sense and in its Australian significance, that this fresh apple of discord backs has been thrown amongst us, for the people of Australia are not only threatened wibh violence from without, but are menaced by the threat that our freedom shall be exchanged for slavery, our independence for the status of a subject race. If a Legislature 16,000 miles away may alter our constitutional and individual status in defiance of the Constitution it self, -this self-governing Dominion of Australia will be relegated to the position of India. To thwart this foul conspiracy the passion and strength of every true Australian should be aroused in defence of Australia's most sacred and cherished possession-ou r 3. Purpose of and Representation at the proposed Imperial Conference. Coincident with this effort to establish new methods of altering the Australian Constitution is the announcement of the creation of an Empire Federation with an Empire Constitution. Speakingi n Parliament on the 22nd February, the Prime Minister saidThis war . . . . has created many and vitally important problems-economic , political, national, and Imperial, which compel our earnest and immediate attention. The solution of many of tliese does not lie in our hands; they are Imperial in their nature. Sir, tlie Dominions-that league of free, self-governing nations, which 'form part of what is called . the British Empire-ar e now summoned to a Conference at the heart of the Empire to consider great problems. This Conference marks a new epoch in Imperial development. The scope of its deliberations is so wide as to cover all matters directly relating to the war or arising out of it. The Conference will, for example, consider the conduct of the war; peace, and the terms upon which the Empire will agree to it ; Imperial trade, including preference; and the constitution of the Empire. The following cable in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, of the 24th February, is significant : New York, Friday -The Washington correspondent of tlie New York Tribune has learned in diplomatic quarters that the subjects of discussion at the Imperial Conference will include the establishment of an Imperial Parliament, with representatives of Britain and self-governing Dominions, and India; the joint control of the Empire's foreign and Imperialg olicies; the consolidation of certain outlying British Possessions; greater self-government fpr India; the participation of the colonies and India at the Peace Conference, and the Dominions' demand for a larger share in the determination of foreign policy. Several days previous to this, the Prime Minister announced that Sir William Irvine's presence was required at the Conference because of his special constitutional knowledge. Additional light is thrown on the subject by Douglas Sladen, who published in London, about the middle of last year, an autobiographical sketch of the Prime Minister with the latter's knowledge"", concurrence, and assistance. Is the honourable member in order in reading every line of his speech? Standing Orders provide that an honourable member may not read his speech.

I must ask the honourable member to observe the rules of the House, and not read his speech. orable member for Cook be in order in adopting the American system and handing in his speech ? orable member would be in order in doing that. An honourable member must address his remarks to the Chamber without the assistance of a written speech. Mr J. H .

I rose to address my remarks to the Chamber, in, I hope, the most respectful manner. I have made no personal reference to anybody, and yet, on the other side, there is the utmost bad feeling. Honourable members know that the Prime Minister read every word of his speech, and no exception was taken. Minister! MrJ . H . CATTS I have prepared my notes, but I am not rea""ding the speech.

The honourable member for Henty is absolutely incorrect in the statement he made, and he made it because he thinks it w ill go into the Hansard record and prejudice my speech when it is read outside.

252,Mr Websteb,"He made a mistake i nthe Daily Telegraph of the 26th February, 1917: Sir Joseph Ward is talking a good deal in England about unity of the Empire and trade hostility against Germany after the war. He would not let .a German ship coal in a British port, nor use the Suez Canal, nor much besides. He would carry on the war after it was over. Here is another suggestion of his in the Empire ReviewWith regard to the provision of the necessary funds for founding and maintaining an Empire Navy, I would make a suggestion. The population of the United Kingdom and oversea countries, without counting India or the Crown colonies, may roughly be said to be 60,000,000 persons; if, then, we agree upon a contribution of 10s. per head it would provide an annual income of £30,000,000, which, at 6 per cent, would provide in normal times the payment of interest-and make provision for a sinking fund of £500,000,000. With this money at our disposal, we could build docks, as well as provide coaling and oil stations in every part of the Empire. We could also have a Navy so powerful and so complete that no combination of enemies would dare to try conclusions with its Fleet. Again, the plan I.propose would lessen the expense to the British taxpayer and also reasonably and equitably increase the contribution from overseas Dominions. I venture to commend it to the consideration of the Home and Dominion Governments. There is a comment on that by the financial editor of the Daily TelegraphNow, to build another Navy and coaling stations at a cost of £500,000,000 would require 20 per cent, per annum, or £ 100,000,000, for upkeep and depreciation. Where would that come from? The interest is only a small part of the charge that would be incurred. The time l i m it does not permit of the consideration in detail of the f u l l meaning and effect of this scheme of Imperial Federation, but such a scheme will certainly cover the following1. It will superimpose upon Australia an eighth Parliament. >2. Heavy additional taxation will be required to pay Australia's share in this huge undertaking. 3. Tiie .Australian Constitution w ill have to be recast and restricted. There cannot be a new additional Empire Constitution governing Australia without taking away some of the powers of our present Commonwealth Constitution.

Conscription on every frontier of the Empire-Indian, Egyptian, SouthA f r i c a n, Canadian, or any other of the wide-flung frontiers of the Empire. am allowing the honourable member, as I allow every other honourable member, considerable latitude, but he is now discussing something that is problematical, which may take place as the result of the calling together of a body that is not yet in existence, namely, the Imperial War Conference. The motion before the House does not cover any executive act on their part at all. It deals only with' the question of extending the life of this Parliament in order that members of it may attend the Conference to discuss, and not to determine, certain matters. .The honourable member for Cook is now dealing w it h something which he says is going to be determined. I ask him not to continue on those lines. MrJ . H . CATTS -What I am pointing out is that the motion before the House asks that our Australian Constitution should -be abrogated whilst certain gentlemen go to an Imperial Conference to represent Australia. I have quoted the remarks of the Prime Minister, who has said that the question of Imperial Federation and the purpose of Imperial Federation will be discussed. I have referred also to a statement made by the PrimeM in ister in a speech delivered in England, and I have shown that the matter has been discussed by Sir Joseph Ward and the Sydney Daily Telegraph. These things cannot come into operation unless such a Constitution is superimposed upon us. And what I say is that these gentlemen are going to England purporting to represent Australia, and it is therefore desirable to discuss the trend of I m perial Federation. If there is to be I m perial Federation for Imperial defence, and Mr Hughes says that is one of the problems to be taken into account, we cannot have Imperial defence without our separate Australian defence being merged in the Empire military scheme. If that be so, our Australian military scheme must go overboard. If we are to be a part of the Empire responsible for defending the whole of . the Empire, that .means conscription over the whole of the Empire and that Australians may be compelled to Defence Imperial defence fight on any frontier of the Empire, Empire. whether it be in India, Egypt, Great",45,Speaker The Written With The Prime Minister S Know

I do not agree w it h him, and I enter my most emphatic protest against men who are believers in conscription going to Great Britain probably to prejudice this country by the acceptance of a scheme which will involve the conscription of the men of this country after the proposal has been turned down at tlie polls in Australia. The White Australia policy would be prejudiced under such a scheme. There are 60,000,000 of white people in these are in Australia. But the Empire includes some 400,000,000 of coloured people. should have representation on behalf of 5,000,000 out of 60,000,000 of white people, and if the coloured races are to. be represented-au d it has been said that India sliould be included in the scheme-w e should have representation on behalf of 5,000,000 out of about 500,000,000 people. It cannot be expected that a Parliament of that kind would permit us to retain our White Australia policy. policy has been juggled about badly in connection with the poor Maltese. treatment of them is not much to the credit of White Australia. MrJ . H . CATTS -The honourable member should not be following a leader who is bringing Maltese into this country to take the places of our men going to light at the front.

Now they are back, and the attempt is being made to sneak them into Australia. This shows the hypocrisy of the whole thing. It shows that if honourable gentlemen opposite had their own If he believes that there should way, and the Democracy of Australia was not very vigilant, all sorts of labour would be smuggled in here to take the place of Australians who go away .to the war. How would this proposal for Imperial Federation affect our protected industries ? We should have Free Trade within the Empire. Australian industries would be swamped with the cheap labour goods of Great Britain and India.

The position in which Australia is placed is a solid reason why this country should be represented at the Conference, and surely the proper representative Minister, the man who, before the r if t in the lute occurred, we acclaimed on all sides as being the one man who should be the representative of all classes. A t the time of which I speak, it was said that Mr Hughes, more than any other man in Australia, represented the patriotic feelings of Labour as well as those other loyal people of this Commonwealth who, whilst opposed to Labour, were insistent upon putting the question .of winning the war before all other questions. Unfortu nately sometliing has happened to dethrone him from the high place he occupied; at least it is alleged something has happened which has made him utterly unworthy and untrustworthy, if we are really to believe what has been said during the course of this debate. We have been told he now represents nobody, or, at all events, only a small section of the people, and that has allied himself to another party which represents certainly a very large section of the people of Australia. As an anti-conscriptionist, and one who has held that view ever since I had any thought on the subject at all, I think the Prime Minister has as truly a right to represent Labour and the Labour platform as ever he had, and I will be able to show As honourable members that, notwithstanding the fact that I opposed the PrimeM in ister both within the party and throughout my huge constituency during the conscription campaign, I am bound now to follow him, since the Official Labour party can no longer allow me, or men like myself who believe in freedom of conscience, and freewithdraw it, Mr dom of opinion, to shelter under their banner. Immediately after the . disrupI f this Governtion of our party, and when I lef t the room with Mr Hughes, I said that if the proclamation were withdrawn, and so long as the new Government respected the will of the people, they could be assured of my vote, and that never again u n t i l freedom is established there would I go back to the Caucus room where, notwithstanding many of my friends still remain, and where principles that I believe in witli regard to other matters less vital than this issue are perhaps more readily recognised than amongst the gentlemen with whom I find myself now. Notwithstanding that an attempt has been made to associate the Government with conscription, I am is the Prime convinced that the will of the people will be respected. The moment it is not respected the Government w i ll receive no vote of mine. The honourable member for Cook said I became an anti-conscriptionist after my first meeting, and when I found my constituents were against me. He knows perfectly well that, in the party roomI need not go into details I took a view diametrically opposed to the view expressed by the conscriptionists. I held the view that, in the vast mass of loyal Labourites of Australia, every man in the movement had a perfect righ t to hold an opinion either for or against conscription, but that when the people had decided the question they should loyally abide by that decision. ThusI saw no reason for the disruption of our party.

273,Mr Lynch ' (Werriwa) [9.29],"Isection which knew not what the sweet term of liberty means. member for Cook said that, at my first meeting, I became convinced that I was on the wrong side of the fence. Now, I will quote from the Sydney Morning Herald of the 29th July, 19161 tliink that was before the Prime Minister returned from England-wha t I said at a public gathering at which members of the Pederal and State Parliaments made speeches. The report of my speech statedMr Lynch, M.P. for Werriwa, said that if a system of universal service was introduced it must be one under which absolutely equal sacrifices would be demanded from all. Because the farmer, or any other man in comfortable circumstances, was not of an age to go to the front, he should not say that the man with four or five children-and perhaps financial obligations as well-mus t go, while he would merely be required to pay a paltry income tax. When all were ready to do their share, then the voice of opposition would be stilled. Unless they who stayed behind were willing to sacrifice their all, they would not give anything commensurate with what the man gave who sacrificed his life. "" U n t il such a system is evolved,"" said the speaker, "" I will decline to support conscription. We must give up our selfish ideals, and not ask men to go any further than we are prepared to go ourselves."" Those are not the remarks of a violent conscriptionist. now, and as I have already stated in this House, that conscription for home service is in strict accordance with the law of right. When a burglar enters premises to steal property and to threaten the lives of dear ones, it is the householder's moral right to slay him if necessary, and the State, in its corporate capacity, has the right to treat invaders of the country in the same way. compulsory service for home defence to the length of conscripting every man capable of bearing arms, should that be necessary. But, at my first meeting, on the fith October, I told a large gathering that, even though it were for winning what we all know to be a war of aggression, I would not surrender the precious principle of freedom, and hand over the lives of Australians to an authority that we could not control. I pointed out the in herent difference between conscription for home defence and conscription for service abroad. I said that if the States of Germany had had the power which we in Australia possess of controlling the destinies of their manhood, it would have been impossible for a tyrant to concentrate the [388] powers of the German Empire to threaten The honourable the liberties of the world. But I added that even for the purpose of winning the war, I would not surrender a principle whose surrender, as the history of the world shows, would more often strengthen the hands of tyranny than the hands of justice. I am the representative of a constituency that voted against conscription by a majority of 11.000 electors, and I myself have declared against conscription for foreign service upon the high principles that I have announced. Why, then, it may be asked, should I separate myself from cherished friends and join with those from some of whose political opinions I differ, perhaps, as widely as the poles are asunder? 1 did it because I believed that the Prime Minister and his small party are really the repository of the truths for which the great Australian Labour party stands, and that the Official Labour party is not. The members of the Official Labour party have allowed outside officials who wish to turn the Parliaments of the country into glorified trade and labour councils, to prevent them from asserting themselves. They have done so, either from conviction or under threat of dislodgment. I am sorry that they have done so. I hoped that all the members of the Labour party and the I held then, as I hold mass of the Labour voters would assert and maintain the independence of parliamentary representatives. T do not wish to lose my seat in Parliament, but when the first shot was fired, and I was ordered to recognise that I was the creature of a State executive, I refused to do so. I man's statement of the manner in which the Labour Conference was packed, and Therefore, I advocate how the executive was controlled by an inner junta of six or seven persons, whom the popular vote would not entrust with a seat on a hen roost. When I received the communication of the State executive I asked myself, "" A m I to acknowledge myself the creature of the executive, or shall I be loyal to the principles for which the Labour movement stands? Are my principles so elastic that I can accept dictation from this body and remain in the Official Labour party?

No. I feel that he would have admitted that we were so broken up on this particular question that he was unable to formulate a war policy, and resigned, like a man, on the floor of the House. I am sure that those honourable gentlemen who were anxious that he should take direct action would have had the courage to do the thing which they expected him to do. And the very men outside who aimed at be ing our ""bosses,"" would have helped to do the very thing they feared in consequence of the breach of the party's platform, and their interference with the liberty of men inside.

311,Mr Lynch,"T h a t is dated 8th Sepcompel us to do whatsoever they choose. That is the position, and it cuts straight across the principles of the Labour party, of which we were so justly proud. When the great mass of Labour voters realize that fact, they will t u r n upon those men who in their desire to give pre-eminence to industrial matters-and an honest desire from their point of view-hav e determined to get hold of the Parliaments of the country and to use them just as the builder would use bricks. As to the Prime Minister, I hold the view that he is to-day as truly representative of the Labour people who sent him into Parliament as he was when he was elected in September, 1914. What do we mean by representative government ? Do we not mean that we expect every man and woman who is a thinking, sentient being to take an intelligent part in the government of the country ? Do we not expect them to do what the moral law enforces upon them as individuals-to take the responsibility for their material existence, in a corporate capacity, in governing themselves ? Since it is impossible for every man and woman in the country to sit in Parliament we hit upon the expedient of dividing the Commonwealth into constituencies with' the proportion of voters in each as nearly equal as possible, and without any regard to differential standards of intelligence. We know perfectly well that it does not necessarily follow that the larger the vote the more intellectual it is. On the contrary, the larger the vote the more ignorant it will be. That is why the system of truly representative government is in strict accordance with moral law, and answers truly the question of whether I am my brother's keeper. It is the law, and a right law, that justly makes a man who has, perhaps, just sufficient intelligence to remain unbranded as a lunatic, by the law of his country, to be as strong, in a numerical sense and as' a voting factor, as the "" wisest and most in tellectual. It therefore compels the wise and intellectual to become their brother's keeper, to educate him in higher standards, and meantime to live under laws far beneath those which their intelligence fits them to enjoy. We have thus the true system of representative government. We fix upon three years as the life of the Parliament, and when the end of that term is drawing near, we say that Parliament is becoming moribund. But if we accept this new doctrine, what is the use of having such a system or superstructure? [Quorum formed]. If we accept this new doctrine: that at each, recruiting conference members may be directed by an outside body, then there is an end to all our, perhaps, cumbrous procedure, and these is an end to all responsibility in connection with our duly constituted Parliaments, and we might as well abolish them for ever. member arguing for the prolongation of the life of the Parliament? responsibility of a representative to his constituents. member w ill vote for this motion ? at this juncture there is no other alternative for honourable members who have any regard for their responsibility and for the welfare of the country. Honourable members opposite having surrendered their rights, I may lose my seat because of my action in standing up for the old Labour party's platform while the majority went for something which I am afraid will bring them no pleasure even if it eventuates. What is the position of myself and others like me? I represent a huge constituency where the country and farming vote is in the ascendant. AmI to be made a sort of political boundaryrider, to round up votes for a small section sitting in a back room in Sydney, who are to decide what I am to do with those votes? That is how the position appeals to me. I am too new to politics to be capable of the political contortions of some honourable members opposite. But I say that the great majority of the people recognise that we have to do the best that we can with the material that is at our disposal. For this reason, although I am opposed to conscription for service overseas, I intend to support the present Government. [10.6] I am amazed when I reflect upon how wild some of our most temperate men can become under the influence of a little excitement.

In a fight between political parties all sorts of measures are resorted to, but every honourable member knows f u l l well that the party on the Government benches do not represent the opinions of the people of Australia, as is proved by the fact that at the last election the Labour party came back with an enormous majority in both Houses, and at the' recent referendum a large majority was cast against the side advocated by the Government. The F'rime Minister, being the only man who has the ear of the Governor General, the representative of the Sovereign, took advantage of tlie position. man had walked out of the party no. more would have been heard of it , but he carried in his own person the whole of the political power of the Commonwealth, and used it for his own ends, telling us that what he did was in ithe interests of the Empire. manhood in him he would have handed back the position to the party that placed him in power; but to-day he stands before us leading a union of the shreds and tatters of all parties, who claim to represent the people. They know f u l l well that they do not, as is proved by the fact that they are shirking an election. election the few of them that will be left will be over here. If they are not afraid of the result, why do they not avail themselves of the opportunity of having an election of both Housesi n A p r i l or May? Mr Holman, the Premier of New South Wales, took good care to get to the electors before they did. Like the honourable member for Balaclava, the ex-Premier of Victoria, he knows'a thing or two. He said, "" I am not going down with the motley crowd on the Government benches in the Federal Parliament, and will chance it first."" He had the pluck, and is going to fight it out. There are men on the other side of the House who would like to fight it out, too; but the writing is on the wall in New South Wales. Only about three of them will come back, and They know it . cannot send to the Old Country three men from among them who will properly represent the people. A t the last election, and in theconscription referendum campaign, they were declared not to represent the opinions of the people. I have often told Let me go through the careers of -the three selected delegates. The Right Honourable William Morris Hughes came into this Parliament as a representative of Labour. able member returns to Hindmarsh he will not get many Labour vote's. The Prime Minister entered this Parliament as a representative of Labour. But he has thrown over all his old associates and the aspirations of the Labour party, and now leads the multi-crowd on the Government side, and still says he can represent the thoughts and aspirations of tlie people of Australia. He knows he cannot, but If any other he is brazening the matter out. He w ill go to England to represent us, because he has made up his mind to do so. I hppe he never returns, and I have an idea that he will not. The second representative will be the honourable member for Flinders. No man or woman in If he had had a shred of Australia ever conceived the idea that that honourable member should or could represent .a Democracy. His name is anathema to every Democrati n Victoria, and naturally is known unfavorably throughout Australia. Y e t he is to go to England to represent the Australian people who sent a Labour majority to this Parliament and rejected conscripThey know that after an tion quite recently. The third delegate is to be our old friend the right honorable member for Swan. Of the three he is the only man who has any Australian sentiment. I look upon the honourable member as the embodiment of Conservatism, but he has the redeeming feature of possessing some Australian sentiment. The other two have not the least warmth in their bodies for Australia. They can see before them only one light, and that is glaring red, and they talk of Empire and wave their jingo flags. I am told that the remarks I made at Ballarat on the subject of the Imperial Conference are likely to recoil on my innocent head. I stated there that these three gentlemen cannot represent us, and I object to them going to London, because I believe the gathering is to be something more than an ordiThe Government party nary conference. It is admitted on every side that the questions to be considered are of the greatest importance. The whole of the well-being of this great Empire is to be dealt with.

This cable reprinted a statement from the London Times that Mr Massey, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, had said that there could be no truth in the statement that the Conference would legislate to interfere in any way with the domestic legislation of New Zealand. That cable proves that I ar not the only person who thinks there is a danger in that direction; somebody else has been talking to the same effect. As a matter of fact, suspicion was aroused by the remarks of Mr Massey and Sir Joseph Ward five weeks ago. Those two gentlemen became quite jealous of our little Willie.

But they have managed to arrange that, in stead of one man representing New Zealand at the Conference, there shall be two delegates, and now Australia is to send three. A cable was published some weeks ago that Mr Massey and Sir Joseph Ward had expressed the hope that the business transacted at the Conference would be of such a character that the politics of the Empire would be brought more into unison. We know all about the political ideals of the people of Australia, as represented in this Parliament, being in unison with the ideals of the men who misrepresent the British people in the Imperial Parliament. The men who comprise the British Parliament which rules the Empire were not chosen by any form of adult suffrage.

If there are men opposite who will "" stand up to it , "" they have more pluck than I thought any of them had-and they are not the men, or gentlemen, they are supposed to be. However, this is only by way of warning. The Prime Minister is one of those men who will not be beaten if he can help it . He is strong-minded enough to pursue a course with hopes of victory, and if he has the power he will bring about that victory. I say that this resignation in another place to-night is a forerunner of the efforts on behalf of the Government to prevent us from, going to the couatry. What does it mean? It means that if the Government has a raajprity in the Senate, there is no need to adopt the distasteful' method of asking 'the Imperial Parliament to extend the lifo of this Parliament. If the Government can get a majority in the Senate they may extend Parliament at their .own sweet will: and they will do it, and defy the people of Australia to take any objection.

I reply that the honourable member is the worse case that I have ever Been of parvum in multo. He .spoke for a great length of time, and yet gave us very little. whether as earnest and. serious men we were prepared to do what the Government propose in the motion, and he finished up by confessing quite involuntarily that the whole purpose of his diatribe is to save him from a selection attack by some more extreme person in bis constituency. Good God, Mr Speaker, if they have anything more extreme in Melbourne Forts than the honourable member who has been agitating himself and ue for the last half-hour, I devoutly hope that the .honourable member will again secure the selection. ""What, are the considerations which Bhould appeal to honourable members in addressing themselves to a motion of this kind? consideration is whether or not' this Parliament should postpone or adjourn the elections. question has been answered very clearly and well by the honourable member for Bourke, who said last night that the only reason at such a juncture that could justify this Parliament refusing to postpone its elections would be that the Government administering the country did not possess the confidence of the people, 1 or was doing something contrary to the £ urpose for which the. Parliament has een elected. I take up those -Words at once; and ask myself-in all sincerity, as I ask bonorable members on both sides, whether, putting personalities and bitterness on one side, it is not a fact that the present Government is addressing itself to the supreme issue at the last election. Is itnot a fact thati before the war came upon us, each party p it its programme .before the -electors? I r . it snot ,-a fact that, as -soon as war was declared, these parly programmes were [389]2 buried beneath the patriotic zeal and determination of the people to see this thing through? I s : it not a fact that both parI shall not ties vied in their protestations of their personal fitness to conduct the war to -a successful finish? I pledged myself to my -constituents that, if the Government to which I belonged was defeated, I would give our successors a loyal support in order to carry thc war through to a successful conclusion, and I must say that I have given in the life of this .Parliament more loyal support to my political opponents ia their conduct of the war than I have ever been called upon to give to He commenced by asking us my friends during the fourteen years that I have sat in the chamber-mor e loyal support than was given by some of the supporters of -that Government. My position is not altered. I am still in this Parliament for the purpose of helping the Government to conduct the war with due efficiency and the f u l l exercise of the resources of Australia. If I bave changed my place, I have not changed m y attitude ; and I have changed my place solely for one reason-that , for the first time in the history of this House, I believe a new party has arisen wbich is foreign to the issue confronting the electors at the last elections, and foreign to the policies that were put forward at those electionsa party that is mot so keen to face Obviously the first the waras it is to crucify the man with whom it. has recently disagreed. Therefore, in these few words I answer the I think that first query. I say, in the words of the honorablo member for Bourke, that nothing should stand between this Parliament and the postponement of the elections on any ground that tbe present Government do not represent tbe promises made to the people of Australia some three years ago. NowI take my friends for a few minutes a stage further. I ask myself is it right that Australia should be represented at this Conference? Con any one deny Australia's right to that representation ? We have heard much tonight about Boston tea, and about crimes meditated by Britain against Australia's freedom. I do not believe that a single honourable member who utters these statements believes a word of the bogy he has created. I know that many a good life has been shed for Australia's freedom, and that",60,Smith Th E Honourable Round The Question
384,Mr Kelly (Wentworth) [10.52],"Imuch treasure has been lavished. If ever a country bas earned the right to be at a table at which the final settlement in regard to the war takes place, this country has earned it , and who better can represent it than the man who happens to be representing constitutional Australian government! For that reason I say that Australia must be represented at tbe Conference; and if my friends, who talk so glibly about Boston tea, seek my f u r ther opinion about this business, I say it is absolutely essential that we, for tbe safety of Australia after this war is over, should be able to take a little wider view than the mere view of throwing dust in tbe eyes of war is over, what is going to protect the Australian people if it is not tbe Fleet of the Anglo-Saxon race throughout the world? What danger confronts Australia after the war in any sense commensurate witb tbe danger that the people of the Mother Country, having borne a load of taxation to see the present war through, such as no one before the war commenced could possibly have prophesied, will grow weary of that taxation, and Bay, "" There is no fleet left to' menace the security of the British Isles,"" and so retrench the maritime strength of Great Britain? If that movement for retrenchment get a head of steam on, and the naval supremacy of Great Britain should be allowed-in five or ten years-to decline through want of representation on the part of Australian communities as to our peculiar necessities in these seas, then .by that means, and by that means only, can we utterly destroy the British fabric that we have built up in this land. Onlyi n that way can we perish, and it is for that reason, largely, that I do not wish Australia's voice to be dumb in' the councils that are shortly to ensue. In conclusion, I ask honourable members whether it is possiblefor Australia to be usefully represented at tbe Imperial Conference while elections are proceeding here for the CommonweaUh Parliament? I do not ask whether it is fair to the Prime Minister. I have been an opponent of his all my life.

It is due to us in this House to prove ourselves worthy of some of the sacrifices that have been made for us, not only by our own flesh and blood overseas, but by the great race to which we belong; and. the meanest way to prove our worthiness is to pretend that the man who is prepared to do his duty is only afraid of facing the electors.
