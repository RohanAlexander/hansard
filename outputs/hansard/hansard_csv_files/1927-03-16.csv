Sir ELLIOT ask the Prime Minister a question based upon the following paragraph which has appeared in thc press :ANTABCTIC WEALTH. Wellington, New Zealand, Monday -Si r Douglas Mawson, who is on his way to Australia, to-day accused the Commonwealth Government of a-pathy in neglecting to take any action to secure control of the Antarctic Ocean. There was grca.t danger, be said, of thc whale fisheries being depleted, while the possibilities have expressed their willingness to estabof Adele Land wure enormous. Although asked by the Dominions Office lo express their views on tihe jriatter, Australia's leaders had done nothing. Air Douglas said he was prepared to lead another expedition to the Antarctic if funds were available. Isi t a fact that the Dominions Office made a request to the Commonwealth Government as stated? If so, was the matter considered by the Government? Isi t proposed to take any steps in the direction of averting the threatened danger of depletion of the whale fisheries in the Antarctic ? requests from the Dominions Ofiice to the Commonwealth Government to which a reply has not been made. The rights of various countries in the Antarctic were f u l l y considered at the Imperial Conference, and the steps believed by the conference to be most effective to protect British interests generally, and those of Australia, were determined, and are now being taken. NAVY ister inquired into the very serious allegations made yesterday that attempts had been made to induce the Navy Department to exercise its authority over Commander Cresswell in order to prevent against the Comhim from giving certain evidence before the Wireless Commission? of any attempt to interfere wit h Commander Cresswell; but very unfortunately them by the papers which came into Commander Cresswell's hands in the course of his duties in the Department, and were of a most secret character, dealing with a subject of great importance to Australia, were produced at the inquiry. That, I think, was most undesirable. ported in the South Australian newspapers that the Government proposes to establish an aerial mail service between Perth and Adelaide, and I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence to say what stage the proposal has reached ? ceived offers from several companies who. lish an aerial mail service between Perth and Adelaide. Upon consideration it was decided that the fairest way in which to deal with the matter was to call for tenders for the service. I believe that the advertisement calling for tenders will appear in this week's Gazette. Mr. BOWDEN W ill the Minister representing the Ministerf o r Defence say whether the Government proposes to subsidize the mail servioe referred to? to the Government no subsidy was asked for. It is being l e f t to tenderers to state the terms upon which they will be willing to accept a contract for the service. When the tenders are received, the Government wil l be in a position to state the exact terms of the contract, if one is let. BEAM WIRELESS. MrE .

11,Mr Bruce,"I have seen the pressDUMPING OP FOREIGN GOODS. the serious situation which has been created by the unfair competition of oversea manufacturers with Australian industry, does the Government propose to afford an opportunity during this session for the discussion of the tariff schedule? Will the Minister for Trade and Customs promptly investigate the alleged dumping of foreign goods? Complaint has been made to me that storage batteries, the manufacture of which was specifically protected in the last tariff schedule, and which prior to the commencement of manufacture in Australia were being sold at £11 10s., are now, through the competition of six local manufacturers, being sold by importers at £5 5s. and £6 6s., wth a 40 per cent, discount to garages in lieu of the 25 per cent, discount previously given; whereas Australian manufacturers are unable to reduce their prices below £6 15s. The situation is serious and manufacturers who have invested large amounts of capital are facing the possibility of bankruptcy. part of the honourable member's question, 1 remind him that it is not customary for announcements of government policy to be made in the form of replies to questions. for motor cars, no communication has been received by me from the Australian manufacturers. If a communication is received by the department I will have inquiries made immediately. Apparently the figures which the honourable member quoted, and which show a considerable reduction in the prices charged to the consumers, are a triumph for the protective policy of encouraging local production. A few days ago the honourable member asked some questions regarding the unfairness of American motor car manufacturers in prohibiting the use of Australian-made parts. I have instituted inquiries, as I promised to do, and received this morning some information which indicates that the inquiries may be worth pursuing. I propose to have the fullest investigation made. ister's statement that the reduction of prices brought about by the competition with local manufacturers is a. triumph for the protective policy, does he consider it desirable that he should take steps to prevent that policy coming to full fruition ? grasp the purport of the honourable member's question, I ask him to put it on the notice-paper. morning published the following paragraph relating to a deputation of Canberra shopkeepers:Eastlake shopkeepers have made a strong protest against the activities ot Sydney traders who have arranged a display of goods at the Hotel Kurrajong. The business men told Mr Butters that this competition was unfair. The goods shown were not confined to high-class women's wear, but included hundreds of pounds' worth of men's wear, and the representatives of the firms were canvassing the suburbs for orders. Mr Butters expressed surprise, and said that the firms had undertaken to confine their activities to the sale of women's wear not obtainable in Canberra. Will the Prime Minister see that the very efficient protection which is being granted to the rest of Australia is extended to the storekeepers of Canberra, so that they may be spared the competition of SydneyI n regard to storage batteries traders ? paragraph quoted by the honourable member, and as I am in a mental fog as to what his question really is, I ask him to give notice of it.

The existing staff, which consists of trained teachers, who have had experience in New South Wales High Schools, is quite capable of taking pupils up to the leaving certificate or matriculation standard. It is proposed to extend the school to provide for an additional 500 children, and it Treasurer, is anticipated that the school organization w ill enable 200 students to be instructed in the higher subjects when the additional accommodation is provided.

34,Mr Marr,"The replies to the honor3. Thc committee recommended that steps be taken to build up an efficient university at Canberra. It thought that for a net annual cost of £13,700 and a capital expenditure of £12,000 on buildings and furniture, the following instruction could be given:(i) Full university facilities of high quality in arts, law. and economic studies (granting degrees in those courses). ( i i ) Preliminary scientific training required for such technical courses as medicine, engineering, and forestry (roughly the first year's course of instruction in science). The committee, also considered that, for successful first year students in science, scholarships would have to be provided to enable them to proceed to another university and complete their courses in science, engineering, medicine, or dentistry. The report was carefully considered by the Government, which affirmed the principle that tliere should be a university at Canberra, but decided tliat it could not proceed with tlie project until conditions at the Federal Capital had reached a stage when a fairly definite idea could be formed of the demands likely to be made upon such an institution in the near future. AIT OINTME NT OF AUSTRALIAN ister and Minister for External Affairs) [2.54] -(B y leave.)-It will be within, the memory of honourable members that the position of Australia's representative on the Nauru and Ocean Islands Phosphate Commission became vacant in September of last year. Pending consider a,tion of the constitution of the Commission by the representatives of the partner governments-Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand-a t the Imperial Conference no permanent ment was made, but the Secretary to Deane, was appointed Acting Commissioner. The work of the Commission in controlling the phosphate deposits at Nauru and Ocean Islands was fully considered in London. The Australian Government has from time to time suggested certain alterations regarding the management generally, but the other partner governments were not prepared to fall in with our views, and consequently the system of control by three commissioners, which has existed in the past, will be continued, and it was necessary for Australia to appoint a new commissioner. The late commissioner held a full-time appointment, at a salary of £2,000 a year; but the Government does not think it necessary or desirable that the commissioner should be called upon to give all bia time to the work, or receive that salary. It believes that the work would be as efficiently done if a part-time commissioner were appointed, because the functions to be performed are similar to those of directors of large companies, the executive work being carried out by the chief executive officer and his staff. Accordingly, the Government has invited Mr Clive McPherson. the Government representative on the Dairv Produce Control Board, to accept the position, and he has done so. The salary which he will receive is £600 a year.

EARLE There has been a large amount of PAOEThat, towards making good tlie Supply granted to His Majesty for the service of the year 1027-28, there be granted out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund a sum not exceeding £5,851,495. surprises me that the Government's request for Supplyf o r three months after ihe end of the financial year has not met with a demand for more information than has been given up to the present. This is a rather extraordinary request, made, of course, under extraordinary conditions; but I think that before Parliament grants Supply to enable the Government to go into recess for six months, honourable members should know what legislation is proposed to be put before this House, and the reason for adjourning for such a long period. As far as the removal to Canberra is concerned, the whole arrangement, to my mind, bas been discreditable. Eor many years certain honourable members demanded fin immediate removal to Canberra; in fact, a strong attempt was made to remove the Seat of Government there last year. It must be apparent to any one who has examined the matter that under ordinary circumstances it is iraimssible to effect this change quickly. A great deal of expense would have been saved, and many difficulties overcome if we had delayed our departure to Canberraf o r another year. It is possible to open the Parliament, as Parliament House has been erected; but there w ill be so much difficulty in transferrin g the personnel of tbe departments that the move could well be delayed for another year. tion asked by me a short while ago, the Prime Minister spoke of the ""mental f o g "" he or I was in . To that remark I can retaliate by pointing out that many of the present difficulties are due to the mental fog of himself, his Ministers, and the departments in regard to the reports presented from time to time by the Public Works Committee, requesting that examinations should be made into the facts connected with the transfer of the Parliament to Canberra. Had the Prime Minister made those inquiries in an intelligent manner, there would have been a different story to tell to-day. departmental carelessness. I remember the Chairman of the Public Service Board being called before the committee and saying that he knew nothing about the number of officers who would be sent there. About twelve months later we again desired to interrogate him, and he reiterated the statement that he was ignorant of the facts required by the committee. Surelyi t was the duty of the Government to instruct the Public Service Commissioner to make the necessary inquiries. The Government is uot justified in asking for an adjournment of Parliament to September or October next. If the Supply asked for is granted, the Parliament w ill be able to adjourn for six or seven months. There is no reason why we should not have been called together for the present session a fortnight earlier, for there was plenty of important work waiting for us. A f t e r the promises made by the Government at the last election to introduce legislation dealing with industrial reform, honourable members expected to be given an outline of what it was intended to do to ensure industrial peace. Although the Attorney-General( Mr. Latham) has given us to understand that the difficulties surrounding the question of copyright are enormous, the fact remains that extraordinary demands for copyright fees are being made on the people of Australia. Parliament would be well occupied in giving consideration to that matter. We could pass legislation providing that when any organization makes a demand upon the people it must give an assurance that it has author i ty for its action. To appeal to the In reply to a quescourts of this country is not a satisfactory remedy for the aggrieved parties.' We have not progressed f a r in giving effect to the Government's migration policy. When I heard that the Government intended to appoint a Development and Migration Commission, I thought it would do all it could to induce migrants to come here and settle on the land; but when the appointment of the commission was announced, I developed grave misgivings, which have since been accentuated. Apparently there is a greater",15,Cotton Industry Makitfactitre Of Cotton Yarn

51,Dr. Nott,"The sugar industry is promoderate protection. SinceI did not intend to begin a general tariff discussion, I shall now resume my remarks concerning the value of Australia's exports. Implements and machinery were exported to the total value of £314,811 three years ago, £307,146 a year later, and £177,708 last year. exports are valued at nearly three-fourths of a million; but none of the other items is worth mentioning. The total of all exports in 1923-24 amounted to £119,487,164, of which the products of manufacture accounted for £4,264,057. In 1924-25, primary products were exported to the value of £162,030,159, while the value of the secondary products sent out of Australia was £4,109,478. In 1925-26 the value of the primary products exported totalled £148,562,209, and the products of secondary industries £4,164,498. secondary products amounted to about 2-J per cent, of the total exports of the Commonwealth. had over £140,000,000 worth of primary products restrictive legislation that Parliament is continually imposing, the tion of the primary producer is becoming increasingly difficult. It was discreditable that, at the end of last session, a new tariff schedule was laid on the table, and no opportunity was afforded for its discussion. If similar action is taken at the end of the present session, Parliament ought to be ashamed of it self. I do not complain so long as a matter is decided by Parliament; but should we allow the Government to im pose special penalties by way of taxation without the voice of the people being heard? from the Government that at the end of this short session a new tariff schedule will not be placed on the table and left there without an opportunity for discussion being given. ment should have control over that matter. honourable member not complain of the Government's proposal to go into recess almost immediately? position spoke for the Labour party on that matter. member's time has expired. I now make my individual protest about the proposed early adjournment, in case the honourable member for Swan( Mr. Gregory) may say on the public platform fchat the Labour party mildly assented Our leather to it . There is no excuse for the lengthy adjournments made from time to time. In the absence of the Prime Minister, and even of a second member, of the Ministry, there should be no necessity for Parliament to remain in recess. I do not agree with press comments to the effect that, when the Parliament adjourns, honourable members have nothing to do. The writers of such paragraphs know perfectly well that honourable members are sometimes much busier during recess than when the Parliament is sitting. They have much to do in In fact, the exports of attending to correspondence, departmental work, and the requirements of their constituents. Most of us have Last year Australia families numbering some hundreds of thousands, and, speaking as an old to export; but under .the journalist, I resent the press criticism. W it h all the momentous matters awaitposiing consideration, it is highly regrettable fchat long adjournments are periodically permitted. The day will soon come when the people will demand a change in that respect. We shall close one financial year and begin another before we meet again. I am putting forward a plea on behalf of a very large number of respectable citizens who have families to support, and who in the winter time find themselves out of employment.

As a consequence of this practice work is cut down, contracts are not let, plants are dismantled, and men are thrown out of employment. By the adoption of a reform securing continuity in expenditure by public departments, a great deal of distress would be avoided. 1 remind honourable members that the hardship thus imposed upon persons thrown out of employment is not confined to them, but is suffered also by the business communities in which they live. A district in which all the men and women are busily engaged is bound to be a prosperous district. It should be regarded as a duty by governments having large sums of money to expend to see that people are continued in employment, especially during the winter months.

I regard the honourable member as a traducer of the producer. It is not because I am on a different side in politics that I make this attack. The honourable member has already been attacked by men who feel that they have been seriously injured by his remarks, and those of the Attorney General. They have protested particularly against the remarks of the honourable member for Macquarie, because they were repeated at nearly every port of call in Australia. It is time that members of parliament took exception to the practice of men whose expenses are paid to visit the other side of the world, taking advantage of the first opportunity on their return to Australia to disclose to competitors of our producers in other parts of the world little defects in our export trade. order. The honourable member has made an absolute misstatement. He has said that my fares were paid to and from the other side of the world. I ask that he be called upon to withdraw what is an absolute misstatement. ment that the honourable member's fares were paid, but I still say that some of his expenses while he was abroad were paid by the Commonwealth. I do not speak on this subject without knowledge.

Over twenty years ago I took part in meetings of dairymen held in' this State for the purpose of bringing into operation the compulsory grading of cream. That is now the law in Victoria, and as a result the W h o gave me the in butter produced has been much improved in quality. For seven years or more I laboured amongst the dairymen of this State, New South Wales, and Tasmania, in efforts to bring about improvements in the industry, in connection with the remarks which were made by the honourable member for Macquarie, I make the following quotations from the Launceston Daily Telegraph: So that buyers may be able to distinguish the choice article irrespective of the brand, the national brand was introduced and covered by letters patent, and is now the property of the Commonwealth. This brand is placed only on butter which the Commonwealth's officers have found to be of such quality as can be sold as a choice grade article in competition with other countries. The foregoing remarks were made by Mr H. E.

Latham, Federal Attorney-General, and Mr Manning, M.H.B., upon their return from tlio United Kingdom. Mr Fowell said that, taking into consideration the reports furnished to the Dairy Produce Control Board, both directly and through the London agency, he was quite convinced that altliough Mr Latham and Mr Manning had intended to assist Australia by insisting that only choice-quality goods should be sold in London, they had been quite mistaken as to the methods of marketing employed. Bothf r u it and butter had to undergo a rigid inspection by Commonwealth ofiicers when packed for export. This applied especially to butter. So that buyers might bo able to distinguish the choice article, irrespective of the brands, the national brand was introduced and covered by letters patent, and it was now the property of the Commonwealth.

Mr Manning, M.H.R., is one of these detractors. He has just returned from a t r ip abroad, and claims to have made "" a thorough investigation."" Surely in the course of his inquiries he must have heard something in praise of Australian produce, because it is passing strange that in the whole of his report he does not say one word of appreciation concerning the large percentage of superior-quality butter ex* ported to tlie TJnited Kingdom. He also refrains from mentioning the fact that pTior to his departure abroad effective measures had been taken to remedy the defects complained of by him.

Eveni f the butter were much worse that' the honourable member for Macquarie said it was, he would have no right to make statements so damaging to our producers. defending the progressive and conscientious man who produces the best of which he is capable. I do not say that the honourable member's leg bas been pulled, but I am authoritatively informed that an Australian H i g h Commissioner was so duped on one occasion that he sent to Australia a drastic report regarding certain exports from this country. Later his statements were refuted, and he had to aooloeize. If a H i gh Commissioner can be so deceived, I do not wonder that a mere visitor should have been misled by a sample of butter shown to him in the United Kingdom. I have always protested against newspaper defamation of the products of Australia, and I think there is an even greater obligation upon public men to set a good example of loyalty to local industries. Mr Smith, M.L.C., of Victoria, after his return from London last year, spoke scathingly of the marketing of Australian apples. Yesterday he met the fruit-growers at a combined meeting; and Mr Bailey, who is regarded authorities in this State on the growing and marketing of f r u it , f a i r l y "" wiped the floor "" with him. What justification have Australian public men for defaming our products ? Would a man who called himself my friend proclaim my vices from the housetop? Would he not rather come to me privately and advise me as a brother and a comrade regarding my defects? That should be our attitude towards onr producers. Wo should endeavour p r i vately to direct them as we think they should go. Denmark's great export trade was built up, not by proclaiming to the world that bad dairy produce was being sent to Great Britain, but by internal organization and co-operation between producers and sellers. The result is that to-day Denmark is the foremost country of the world in the production of high class butter, bacon, cheese, and eggs. Australia produces some of the finest butter, f r u it , meat, and wheat, and I , as a good Australian, prefer to proclaim that the bulk of our produce is the best in the world to drawing attention to the small proportion that is defective. A l ready some of our public men who have travelled abroad have earned for themselves peculiar names, and, if we have many of these defamatory statements, the I am public w ill ask to be protected against pestilential peregrinating politicians. The journal from which I have just quoted saysIn markud contrast to the statements made by Mr Manning are reports received by exporters from their London distributors. A Victorian company was informed that ''your brands never stood higher in the estimation of buyers than they do to-day."" Another expert reported upon a consignment of Australian butter for Germany by describing it ""Perfect; for all selling purposes the line could be graded anywhere from 05 to 100."" We stand liigher in the estimation of English buyers than we ever did. A considerable amount of propaganda w ill be required to counteract the injurious effects of the statements by the two parliamentarians I have mentioned. Do honourable members think that our competitors in the overseas markets w ill f a i l to use this material to our detriment? I shall not be surprised if the statements made by those gentlemen are printed in large type and circulated in the markets in which our products sbould be supreme. as one of the foremost I shall quote only one more statement from the Primary Producers' News, and that relates to the opinion of Mr. Nathan, who is largely interested in dairying in New Zealand and AustraliaConvincing evidence of the reputation of Australian butter comes from New Zealand. A leading producers' journal in the dominion recently published an interview with Mr F. J. Nathan of the firm of Jos. Nathan and Company, and mayor of Palmerston North, who had returned from a visit to Australia. I may explain that Palmerston No r t h is second only to Taranaki among the dairying districts of New ZealandThe writer said:Mr Nathan was enthusiastic concerning the improvement which he had noticed in the quality of Australian butter. He had no hesitation in saying that the best Australian butter was equally as good as the best in New Zealand. "" I can only attribute the improvement to the splendid system of inspection and instruction which the State Governments have instituted in Australia,"" continued Mr Nathan. In thiB respect he thought that Australian producers were more alive to and seemed more keenly interested in agricultural education and research. The honourable member for Macquarie said that I should not condemn h i m u n t i l I had heard him. I have afforded h i m a fine opportunity to make a crushing reply, and I hope that I shall be pre-sent when he speaks. I assure h i m that all my guns have not been fired to-day. As a loyal son of Australia, I shall barrack always for Australian goods, primary or secondary. I shall do my level best to ensure that only the best is sent from this country. But I hope that never again will a public man be so cruel as to speak as the honourable member for Macquarie did of an industry which, after having spent hundreds of thousands of pounds in organizing an export trade, is still in a critical condition. All the help of which I am capable w ill be given to our producers. tremely careful in the statements they make after their return from trips abroad. Three of them have done to the primary producers a great dis-service. I hope their example w ill not be copied, but that all loyal Australians w ill cooperate with the Ministerf o r Markets and Migration in endeavouring to raise the standard of export produce so that it may rank second to none in the markets of the world. [3.55] -About twelve months ago tbe Tariff Board was directed by the Minister to investigate and report upon tbe tobacco-growing industry. The inquiry was completed in July, 1925. The board heard the evidence growers in northern New South ""Wales and Victoria, and finally took evidence in Melbourne from representatives of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company. Its report should have been available before the House adjourned in August last. Doubtless, the death of Mr Hudson, the chairman, interrupted the board'3 work, but the inquiry into the tobacco industry had been practically completed a considerable time before that sad occurrence. In any case, there remained a period of five or six months after the appointment of tbe new chairman in which the board could have completed its report. But, apparently, that document is not to be presented to Parliament this session, and we shall have no opportunity to consider it u n t i l towards the end of this year. The tobacco industry, like many others in Australia, needs protection. Those who control the industry have a tendency to underrate the importance of tobacco culture in this country. Certainly, the industry is not yet very great, but, with encouragement, Australian growers could produce the whole of the tobacco smoked in the Commonwealth. In the last five years an average of 12,000,000 lbs, of tobacco leaf has been imported into Australia annually, 90 per cent, of which came from the TJnited States of America. The average duty collected annually on that tobacco was £3,000,000. The average quantity of tobacco manufactured in Australia for each of the last four years has Public men should be exbeen 12,000,000 lbs., the excise duty on which each year was £1,400,000. It. will be seen that the industry yields to the Commonwealth Treasury each year about £4,400,000. Few Australian industries can boast a similar record. The tobacco-growers of America have a monopoly of the supply of leaf to Australia, largely through the instrumentality of the Tobacco Trust, which, for the last twenty years, has had its heel on Australian manufacture. Good results may accrue even from a monopoly, and it can be admitted to the credit of the Tobacco Trust that it has made the manufacture of tobacco for our own people a wholly Australian industry. A duty of 5s. 4d. for Trade and Customs a l b . is collected on foreign tobacco leaf imported in the raw state. A t one time most of the tobacco consumed in Australia was imported in the manufactured of the state; but to-day about 90 per cent, of the tobacco smoked in this country is manufactured locally, and a large industry is controlled by the British-Australian Tobacco Company, which is an offshoot of the American Trust. Although control by a combine possesses advantages in the concentration of effort, and the elimination of waste and competition, there are certain disadvantages in this policy, and one is that some of the producers are penalized. I conducted the case for the tobacco-growers before the Tariff Board, and I was bitterly disappointed by that body's incapacity to deal with a primary industry. It is essentially a manufacturers' board. I have always been a pro-",21,Supplybill N O 1 1927 28
75,Mr Thompson (New England),"tectionist, and I recognize that a Tariff Board is essential to a protective policy. But the present board needs reconstituting if effective protection is to be given to primary industries. We have one representative on the board, but he is dominated by the representatives of the manufacturing interests. I do not say that the members of the board do not do their best to try to understand the primary industries, but their mentality is incapable of comprehending the nature of the difficulties of primary producers. What do we find? When the Tariff Board conducts an inquiry into the tobacco industry, the representatives of the great tobacco trust follow it all over Australia. Wherever an inquiry is held we find a battalion of presidents, ex-presisome Australian leaf tbe growers are really dents, and directors of this company sitting in solemn array, resembling the Venetian Council of Ten, met to decide the fate of some proscribed wretch. The growers attend before the board almost in a condition of nervous prostration, as an employee might approach a tribunal to ask for an increase in wages with his "" boss "" sitting close by to hear what he has to say about him. The representatives of the tobacco trust, with sphinxlike countenances, attend the board to hear what the growers have to say. The tobacco-growers have one bossthe British Australasian Tobaeco Company. This practice has a demoralizing effect upon the growers, who are typical primary producers. It is exceedingly difficult for them to explain their case before these high-and-mighty gentlemen sitting in judgment upon them. The average farmer does not keep books, although he knows all about his industry and how much it costs; but when he goes before the board, and is questioned, very often impatiently, by men used to hearing the evidence of secretaries and accountants of large companies who supply it with properly-audited statements, his nerve fails, and the board assumes that he does not know his business. have a representative? could easily provide against that. allowed to have an advocate before the Tariff Board. The witnesses have to state their own case. This greatly handicaps the tobacco-growers, who are certainly not used to doing that sort of thing. I myself appeared for the growers, and gave evidence before the board. I am quite sure that it had the opinion that the growers had a very poor case. The representatives of the British Australasian Tobacco Company afterwards gave evidence before the board, with no one present representing the growers to test the value of their evidence. They usually hand in carefully-writt.en statements, which are accepted as evidence by the board. These statements "" put it all over "" the growers. The Tobacco Company says that because it buys under a great obligation to it. First of all, the company libels tbe growers by saying that, so far, they have not been able to grow a tobacco leaf that can be smoked by our own people. Before the Tobacco Company was formed, as far back as 1904, a number of Australian companies were producing 100 per cent. Australian-made tobaccos, which were smoked by our own people mostly as plug tobacco. To-day, all those brands are things of the past. The Tobacco Company says that the Australian smoker uses only the American leaf, that the Australian leaf is rank-whic h is another untruthand that in the manufacture of tobacco it uses only 10 per cent, of Australian leaf. Before the trust was formed Australian tobacco companies were using in manufacture 20, 30, and 40 per cent., and, in some cases, 100 per cent, of Australian tobacco. that the trust has largely killed the Australian tobacco industry. This company is not a poor concern. It has been able to crush out all other buyers. The representatives of companies formed in Queensland used to visit northern New South Wales and offer the growers, say, 3s. a lb. for tobacco leaf. The representatives of the British Australian Tobacco Company would come along and offer 3s. 6d. a lb., but only for that year. The next year the other companies would not be buying, and the trust would give the growers only Is. 6d. or 2s. 3d. a lb. That is only",23,Supplybill N O 1 1927 28

It maintains that it is medium dark, and light qualities, only. There are also different classes of soil, ancl the quality of the tobacco depends a great deal upon the soil. The growers have expended a large amount of money on this enterprise, and although only two years have passed since the flues were erected, they now find that at present prices it is absolutely impossible for them to continue the industry. The company has an agreement with the Tbe Australian growgrowers to buy about 1,400 tons of fluecured leaf a year for three years. The They growers are not able to supply this quantity. In three years they have produced only 2,770 tons of leaf, of which about 900 tons, or about 16 per cent, were flue-cured. Including flue-cured and air-dried leaf they were still about 2,600 tons, or roughly 50 per cent, short of the agreed quantity.

To that question the Assistant Minister gave an evasive reply. I use the term "" evasive"" advisedly, because he merely denied the existence of graft, but did not deal with the question at issue. I wish to place on record the fact that I have received information from sources that I have no reason to regard as unreliable, implying that inquiries have recently been held at Canberra into irregularities on the part of at least one sub-departmental oflicer. oharges were allegations of irregularities, which, in my opinion, were approaching graft.

I direct the attention of the Treasurer to a complaint made on behalf of ths Commonwealth waited on him on the 21st July last year, to obtain an assurance from him about their positions in the event cf the Commonwealth evacuating certain fields of taxation. It was expected that such action by the Government would result in the retrenchment of the officers concerned. Surely the period from the 21st July last year to the 16th March this year was sufficient to enable the Treasurer to make a pronouncement, of policy on the question submitted to him, so as to relieve the anxieties of the officers likely to be affected. A fortnight ago the matter was brought under the notice of the Treasurer by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks), but still no information has been given to the officers. I submit that the Government has been most unfair. The officers have no security of tenure or guarantee cf adequate compensation in the event of certain fields of taxation being evacuated, and they have waited for nearly a year to obtain the necessary information.

This industry is going to the wall because of dumping. According to the Age the value of the importations of artificial flowers for 1926-27 will be about £200,000, or about double the imports for the previous year. This shows that the tariff, owing to the dislocation of exchanges abroad, and the organization of great cartels, trusts, and rings to exploit overseas markets, is inadequate, and the Goeven to the extent of introducing embargoes, if certain industries are to survive.

But an alteration was made, and the scheme applies only to men retired since 1920. It is contended tliat if the change had not been made, a number of the veterans would have obtained superannuation benefits. practice of giving a month's pay for each year's service was in vogue in New South Wales prior to federation; but if the Commonwealth Government could not recognize that payment as something to which the men were legally entitled, at all events it should have regarded them as having a moral right to it. When a deputation from the New South Wales Military Forces Veterans Association presented a petition to the Minister for Defence( Sir Neville Howse), he said that they had done magnificent war work, and that without their services efficiency at the front could not have been maintained. That was a very significant statement, coming from such a high authority. I know well that the old sergeants and corporals and the other men who were responsible for the training of the troops that went to the front had a life of monotonous drudgery. have been made on behalf of those who served at the front; but, in my opinion, the veterans to whom I refer arc as much, if not more entitled to consideration. While the young men who served abroad experienced hardships and dangers, they also had periods of recreation, and very good 'ones in cities such as Cairo, Paris, feel that we are asking more than what is arid Lcnlon. I am not speaking disparagingly of them; I am merely comparing their life of excitement with the monotonous service of the veterans. The soldiers at the front were stimulated by the spirit of adventure, and they took the rough times with the smooth; but the old men on whose behalf I am pleading had the rough all the time. For them there was no relief. in the way of assisting them? Sir trouble is that a number of them received the benefit of the regulation providing for ment, tbey would receive one month's pay for a month's pay for each year's service, and were provided for under the retrenchment act of 1922, but certain others I believe did not. The regulation provided that a month's pay should be given for each year's service unless the applicant was near the age of retirement, and the superannuation provisions applied. I do not know why the Government has refrained from taking action in their interests. I understand that, in New South Wales, only 25 of them are left. The There were 28 when they presented their petition; but several have since died. Their grievance is not an imaginary one, having regard to the fact that merely through the incidence of dates they are prevented from participating in advantages enjoyed by their comrades. The petition presented by them on the 30th April, 1925, was couched in most moderate language. It read as follows:To Major-General Sir Neville Howse, V.C., Minister of State for Defence, Commonwealth of Australia. From the Permanent Military Forces Veterans' Association of New South Wales. We, the undersigned, do respectfully and earnestly suhmit this our petition to yon as .Minister of State for Defence.

That there seemed no reason for any doubt was borne out by the application of this provision in the cases of officers and others who were retired from the Permanent Military Forces of New South Wales prior to and shortly after the advent of federation, and they were paid a sum of money equivalent to one month's pay for each year of service. We do not wish to include further detail matter in this petition, but rather to place before you tlie broad principles upon which we act, and in so doing trust that our claim will receive that measure of consideration which long and faithful service entitles us to expect. That petition was signed by 28 members of .the Old Veterans' Association, and the rank and length of service of each is set out. these veterans? Sii are only about 25 left now in New South Wales. There would probably be some in the other States, but they would not number very many altogether. The secretary of the association wrote letters to each member of this Parliament in connection with the claims of the association, and sympathetic and favorable, replies were received from Senators Pearce, Newlands, Crawford, Glasgow, and Grant, and Messrs. Hughes, Charlton, Bowden, Gregory, Lazzarini, Marr, Groom, R.' Green, West, W a t t , Francis, Ley, Parsons, Mackay, Coleman, Maloney, A . Green, Matthews, and Page. This shows that there is a great deal of sympathy for the claims of these veterans in both Houses of this Parliament. Surely those who sent favorable replies to the secretary of the association were sincere in doing so, and did not intend to fool tbese old men. Government to do something in this matter. of the country, and the least we can do is to show that we are grateful for the services they have rendered. I shall leave the matter at that in the hope that the Cabinet will give it consideration. In view of the sympathy with the claim which members of this Parliament have shown, I do not know what result might follow if other steps had to be taken to secure for these old men what is due to them. There is one other subject to which I wish to refer briefly. It is one in regard to which I have not received sympathetic treatment from the Government. The subject has occupied my attention for a good many years now, and although in connection with it I have sought redress from various Commonwealth Governments, my every application has failed. I failed to secure the appointment of a select committee to make inquiries into the subject, which, as honourable member^ are probably aware, is the removal of the Quarantine Station from Manjy. I do not expect the Government to tell me that the Quarantine Station will be removed straight away, but I do look for some little sympathy in my endeavours to have the matter inquired into. I have in my constituency the magnificent summer resort of Manly. I think it is the most popular summer reQuarantine Station, situated practically in the midst of a populous place like Manly, is an absolute danger to the whole community. Tourists and pleasure seekers from all parts of Australia visit Manlyi n the summer season. Thousands of them crowd its beaches. The Quarantine Station has a ridiculous .area of something like 640 acres, when half that area would be ample for the purposes of both the Health and Military Departments. The Government insists upon continuing to occupy this immense area. I have positive knowledge th.at when there were small-pox cases in tbe Quarantine Station, contacts climbed the fence and took part in dances in Manly. That indicates the danger to the whole of the people of Australia in having the Quarantine Station at North Head, because, as I have said, visitors come to It is the duty of the Manly from practically every part of every State, and if an epidemic These men gave the best occurred at Manlyi t would protheir lives to the service of bably spread throughout the country. Of course, I am always met with the question, "" Can you suggest another suitable site for the' Quarantine Station?"" I admit that at present I am not prepared to suggest another suitable and accessible site; but surely some ' arrangement might be made to remove the existing menace. There is no quarantine station in London. Wouldi t not be possible to have a quarantine ship ? The Government might show a little willingness to comply with my request. I understand that the matter comes within the purview of the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten). .",31,Granville Ryrie Th E We Submit That All Members Of The

Sir GRANVILLERYRIE think there is a suitable site there. think perhaps a good site might be found at Coogee. I ask the Government to send to Manly two responsible officers, one from the Department of Health, andanother from the Defence Department. They could give notice to the Mayor, and otherimportant people at Manly, to be ready to meet them with all the evidence they can bring forward inorderthat the matter may be discussed and some solution of the difficulty arrivedat. I take it that the quarantine station will not be permitted to remain for ever in close proximity to Manly, a place which is rapidly growing. We shall shortly have a crowded area right up to the very boundary fence of the quarantine station. The officers of the Defence Department say that if bigguns were placed there all the windows in the neighbourhood would be broken when they were firing, and it is therefore necessary to prevent houses being built in the immediate neighbourhood. There are big guns at South Head, ancl although there have been instances in which the firing of those guns has resulted in the breaking of windows, I do not think that the objection urged in this connection is a valid reason for retaining the whole area of 640 acres for a quarantine station. I know that it is of no use to endeavour to persuade D r . Cumpston. If he has the say, and apparently hp has had it up to the present, no reasonable steps will be taken to meet the request I have been making for years. I ask the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), to take a note of this matter and see whether it is not possible for the Government to treat my request in a sympathetic manner. I continually receive the reply that, nothing can be done, and no endeavour is made to discover whether an alternative site for the quarantine station cannot be found. I submitted a motion in the last Parliament for a select commitW h e n it tee to inquire into this matter, but the Government opposed it . I tell the Government that loyalty can be stretched too far, and remind it that recently we had a good many defections from the party on this side.

I do not Sir GRANVILLERYRIE I think I that there was only one other member who, I believe, was a Labour man, who voted with me for the motion. The rest of the House voted against it . I was very much hurt by the way in which my motion was received, and my grievance has rankled ever since. I again ask the: Government to send a couple of ofiicers to confer with the people of Manly and seewhether any reasonable suggestion can be made for a solution, of the difficulty. I should like to' say awordor two on the lines followed by other honourable members in this debate-. I do so especially because the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) is present. It seems to me that there are some patent defects in the CustomsT a r if f Act which should be remedied. Attention has been called to a certain number of these, and I shall bring under notice one or two more without going into details as to the names of firms or manufacturers concerned. Addressing a public meeting not long since in Sydney, I called attention publicly to the question, and the Minister for Trade and Customs was good enough to advert to the same subject and to attempt to rebut my arguments. I assure the honourable gentleman that there were brought under m y notice quite a number of industries, not large, but struggling and capable of reaching some dimensions, that have been practically forced to the wall because of price-cutting tactics from continental competitors. In some cases the chief competition is w it h goods imported from Germany.

108,Mr Theodore,"The Minister should note the statement that the triflin g adjustments have been of little value to the industryNo increase was granted on cotton hose. Every effort has been made to urge the Customs administration to refer the needs of tliis industry to the Tariff Board for consideration, but so far the matter does not appear on the latest list of ministerial references to the Tariif Board. That appears to me like negligence on the part of the MinisterCheap, shoddy importations have retarded the expansions of this industry, and were the cause a few years back of forcing many mills in Australia to close down and others to reduce output with resultant unemployment. That accurately expresses the tendency of the present tariff policy. If the Minister cannot keep an eye on the working of the tariff schedule, or if the existing legislative machinery prevents the expeditious handling of problems as they arise, of what use is the tariff? Surely when the Minister finds himself hampered by legislative obstacles, he should move heaven and earth to have them removed. Consider the serious economic position that is arising from the present unfavorable trade balance. The following figures illustrate how imports are beating exports :12 months 30th June, 1926. £ Merchandise Gold Silver Bronze Specie 44 £151,638,178 £76,701,395 £83,996,163 Total Importations EXPO KTS FROM ATJSTEALIA.

Some will say that it cannot be rectified increased only in such a way as to augment the Customs revenue without reducAfr. Theodore. ing the volume of importations. I recognize the impossibility of imposing prohibitive duties before the country is able to produce its own requirements, but the settled policy of Australia for a long time has been high protection. Notwithstanding the misgivings of a small section, 98 per cent, of the Australian people are convinced that a high tariff policy w ill be eventually beneficial to all interests-primar y producers as well <ts secondary producers, country dwellers ns well as city dwellers. That is certainly my own belief, and support for it can be found in the experience of many other countries. No doubt other opportunities will present themselves for dealing in greater detail with those industries that are languishing at the present time through the ineffectiveness of the tariff. I am convinced that they are many. The Minister may put the telescope to his blind eye when examining these matters. I do not say that he does, but I thought he was rather ready in Sydney to deny the existence of any defects in the present tariff. The fact is that it is fault y in many respects, and steps should be taken at once to make it more effective. If the Minister requires support to do that, surely he can rely upon the votes of many honourable members who claim to be good protectionists.

I wonder if honourable members recollect the things which the right honourable gentleman said were essential to be dealt w i th during the currency of this Parliament. I refer them to a manifesto that was broadcast in the newspapers and by post throughout Australia, and purported to be an epitome of the Government's constructive policy. It was couched in the terms of a personal appeal by the Prime Minister, and was headed""Reasons why you must vote Nationalist.""

Their whole heart is in the u p l if t i ng of the aborigines. They are helping us in this Parliament to do our duty towards the original inhabitants of this conntry, the remnants of a dying race. They have a great love for the work, and they are prepared to make, and have made, sacrifices. They want the Government to assist them to a small extent, so that they will be able to continue the good work they have been engaged in for many years. appeal to the Government in better words than those used in a letter I received recently from Pastor Riedel, of Sedan, South Australia, chairman of the Finke River missionDear Mr Parsons, I enclose copy of a letter I am sending by same mail to the Hon. the Minister for Home and Territories. See -whether you can do anything in personally urging our claim. We are staggering along under a tremendous financial burden, and Uie Government expects to show Home and Territories, Senator splendid results in different directions (school, industries), and I believe they do not do half The as much for our blacks as they do for the camp-blacks around Alice Springs. You know the adage about the last straw that breaks the camel's back. When I think of our dear old Finke MissionI sometimes feel-as if it only needs the last straw to break it down. TfI were not so sure that it is God's work, I would be inclined to despair. It would be a disgrace, nay,' a crime, if the work came to grief 'by the apathy of our Government. Hoping that our common endeavours will :be crowned with success, I remain, yours truly, It is no't suggested that the mission should receive bhe sum I have mentioned. It has made a .strenuous effort to clear itself of debt. Last year it received in free .gifts from the members of the church, in response to an appeal, a sum of money exceeding £1,500, and it also received £ 8 00 loaned free of interest; but, notwithstanding all efforts, it is going to the bad each year to the extent of from £900 to £1,000. Assistance is needed to cover the annual loss incurred in accepting obligations that would have to be It is, indeed, unjust that this discharged by the Commonwealth, at a cost of thousands of pounds, if the mission did not exist. The mission is not only looking after the bodily needs of the aborigines, but is also attending to their moral and spiritual welfare. All Thosei n charge are not authorities recognize that no one can look after the aborigines better than a Christian mission imbued with a love of the work of uplifting humanity. I make an urgent appeal that the mission should not be asked to wait longer to be relieved of its financial burden. In addition to a grant, the Government could help by giving free carriage over the railways for all food supplies used -by the mission. That is the least we can do for it . I have received from the secretary .of the Angaston District Hospital a letter I cannot make this about the Customs duty on Coolidge tubes, which are used in X-ray apparatus. It appears from the letter that when the tubes are imported into Australia a duty of 20 per cent, is paid on them; but often before they are used; or immediately they are put into use, defects are discovered which makes it necessary for them to be sent away to be repaired. When they come here again they are classed as new tubes, and pay a second duty of 20 per cent. That appears to me like charging the duty twice; like smacking a man on one side of the face, and then on the other, in an attempt, possibly, to compel him to carry out the Christian injunction to turn the other cheek. This double duty is charged on an article which is providing relief for human suffering, ancl is assisting in the saving of many lives. I can speak feelingly on this matter, because my wife recently underwent an X-ray examination for a serious illness. The Government should not collect the last penny possible from unfortunate persons who are ill . late Judge Mitchell, in a case in which a man was prosecuted by a doctor for not paying the doctor's fees, said it would be much cheaper to die than to consult that particular doctor. Similarly it may be cheaper for patients to die than to pay the high Customs duties now imposed on the necessaries of sick persons. This matter needs prompt investigation.

DRIDAN, As we are locking the Murray at great expense, and making its waters available for irrigation and navigation, it is equivalent to "" spoiling the ship for a ha'p'oth o' tar "" to allow the river to lose itself in tbe sand-bars at its mouth. There should be an outlet to tbe ocean. Everything brought down by the river steamers has to be transhipped and railed to a port. made so that deep-sea boats could take direct from the river boats the produce loaded at the river ports. Murray and its tributaries are, without doubt, one of the greatest assets Australia has, and there are untold possibilities in their development. When the Empire Parliamentary Delegation and the delegates of the Empire Press Association travelled through the M u r r ay river districts of South Australia they were immensely impressed with the wonderful possibilities; and it was pleasing to note the enthusiasm with which they reviewed those possibilities. Each went back to his country satisfied that we had a great asset, that we were producing the right goods, and that we needed only advertisement and cheap freights to enable us to compete satisfactorily in the markets of the world. I have the request to make that the postal growing outer suburb should asked the Department to provide better postal facilities of about 100 houses within 5 miles of the Adelaide General Post Office, who I am given to understand that Mrs. now have to walk 2 miles to the nearest McDonnell is a most estimable lady, and post office to collect their letters. The thoroughly qualified to discharge the department stated that it was unable to responsible duty for which she has been provide a daily postal delivery. I ask the nominated. Postmaster-General to look into this case sonally, and is not a member of any again. If he should still find it impossible political body with which I am assoto grant the request that has been made, ciated. It would be wise, in m y opinion, I hope that he will consider accepting the to appoint a representative from the offer of a lady storekeeper who lives various Statesi n turn if a suitable one nearby to open an allowance post ofiice. is available, instead of always appointing If this were done tbe people would have from one or other of the more populous to go only 200 or 300 yards for their mail States. Mrs. McDonnell has very high matter instead of two miles. Speaking recommendations, and would, I am sure, generally, I have no complaint to make against cue administration of the Postmaster-General) and I always receive courteous treatment from the officers of the department when I approach them ' w i th requests from the people in my very Clerk. large constituency. I admit gladly that a number of new continuous telephone exchanges have been opened-notabl y at Balhannah, Two Wells, Elooroonda, Williamstown, and Wasleys-and that many new post offices have been established in the Mallee areas. The department does not always look at these requests merely from a pounds, shillings and pence standpoint, and that Provision sbould be is as it should be. But unfortunately sometimes a deserving claim that is made for a particular locality is rejected. I The river trust that the Government will do its best to meet the wishes of the people at Broadview. I have been requested by the Women's Non-Party Association of South Australia, of which Miss Blanche Stephens is the secretary, to urge the Government, when it is appointing a woman delegate to attend the next Assembly of the League of Nations, to give consideration to the claims of Mrs. J . C. McDonnell, who has been nominated, not only by this association, but by a number of other women's organizations in South Australia and in some of the other States. In advancing the claims of Mrs. McDonnell, Miss Stephens writesHitherto this State had had no representation whatever, either man or woman, on a League of Nations delegation from Australia, though we would not wish this point stressed were it not that such a suitable facilities in . Broadview, a South Australian woman ( Mrs. J. C. of Adelaide, McDonnell) is available this year, for above be improved. RecentlyI all Ave realize that the suitable person should be chosen; and therefore in the past we have for the occupants supported tlic claims of women in New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania. She is unknown to me perworthily represent the Oommonwealth. I trust that the Government will seriously consider her claim. The last matter with which I wish to deal is the wine bounty. The old Jewish custom was to keep the bad wine until the last, but I have kept my best wine until the last. The wine industry is just as important to South Australia as the sugar industry is to Queensland, and I hope that honourable members who believe in protecting local industries will support my request for a continuation of this bounty. (ie rsmall growers engaged in the industry in South Australia if the bounty should be discontinued, though I am aware that a few of the big wine-makers would be just as pleased to see it discontinued as to see it renewed. I shall endeavour to prove to the honourable member. Some big wine-makers in South Australia do not export a single gallon of wine; they dispose of all their wine locally. wine bounty to them has been tliat they have had to pay more for thengrapes and fortifying spirit than would otherwise have been the case. To the small grape-growers, however, the bounty has made all the difference between profit and loss. It has been a perfect godsend to them, and has actually kept them out of the insolvency court. The suggestion has been made that the amount of bounty payable should be reduced, but that would be a most serious step for the Government to take, and I feel sure that it will not embarrass the industry in this way. I was glad to have the assurance of the Minister on Tuesday afternoon that an announcement on the matter would be made before the end of the session. The most ridiculous proposition that has been made in connection with this subject is that it would be less costly for invited tenders for the installation of a Australia to buy out tlie vignerons than to pay the bounty. On a. conservative estimate, the amount of money invested in the industry in South Australia alone is £13,500,000. From 1918 to 1926 the Government collected from this industry the sum of £2,022,000 in excise duties on fortifying spirits. The amount of bounty that has been paid is £428,000. May I remind honourable members that this is the only industiy which provides its own bounties, so that the payments should not be described aa bounties at all, but as refunds. Notwithstanding the reply that the Minister made to me last week, fortifying spirit of an excise value of Is. 6d. is contained in every gallon of our vineyard products that goes overseas. The TEMPORAEY CHAIEMAN The honourable member's time has expired. I wish to bring under the notice of the Attorney-General( MT . Latham) the unsatisfactory position in which the Cockatoo Dockyard was placed while he was abroad. As honourable members know, the dockyard was taken over by tbe last Federal Labour Government from the New South Wales Government, and am amount of more than £1,000,000 was involved in the deal. Since this Government has been in power legislation has been passed under which the control -of The only result of the the dockyard has been given to a board. There is little need for me at this juncture to describe the valuable work that the dockyard was able to accomplish for the nation during the war years, when ift saved the general taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds by effecting repairs to troopships and in other ways. laide were built there. and destroyers have been constructed, and other big national works done there, of which we have every right to be proud. The object of the Government in placing the dockyard under the control of a board was, so we were told, to make it pay. It was understood that the measure gave the management power to compete witli ordinary engineering firms for general engineering business. After the passage of the bill the municipality of Sydney large electricity plant, and the dockyard management, in competition with outside engineering firms, secured the contract, which, in one item alone, involved an expenditure of more than £500,000. When the private firms found that the contract had been secured by the dockyard they combined and tested the validity of the measure under whicli the board",37,Impokts Into Australia

It would be regrettable te allow the expensive plant installed at Cockatoo Island to remain idle. hundreds of men engaged on engineering work there have been discharged. I hope the Attorney-General will see if it is possible to amend the act to enable the dockyard to compete with outside firms. I have received a number' of letters from returned soldiers, who have lost both limbs. The public of New South Wales generously provided these men w i th cheap homes, and a complete settlement has. been established at Mattraville; but the. conveyances made available are useless tc the men, who now ask that the Government should supply them with motor cars. That might be considered a ridiculous request; but, in view of the promises made to the men before they left for the war, we cannot do too much forthem. The sight of some who have lost both legs is deplorable, and any comforts we can give them should be willingly supplied. motor cars would not cost more than a paltry few thousand pounds, the application should not be refused. I hope that the Government will at least render some assistance in this direction. I wish to direct the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) to ' the serious disabilities of several industries established in my electorate. sire to refer to large glass works which have produced crystal glass equal to the best imported goods. .1 have long advocated that men who are prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on works of this nature should receive every encouragement from Parliament, and be adequately protected. 'Jhe position to-day is that cheap crystal gl iss is being imported from Belgium -ind other countries, and is sold at prices which have almost led to the destruction I do not blame the preof the local industry. Some time ago the Minister promised that the Tariif Board would inquire into this matter. Unfortunately, however, too long a time elapses before effective action is taken. The The board may be a very capable body of men, but it cannot cope with the great amount of work awaiting it . A second board should be created. One could deal with the manufacture of machinery, & c , while the other could inquire into questions regarding soft goods. Only Dy means of the tariff can our industries be placed on a sound footing, and if the Work of the Tariff Board is not done exAs a result of the judgmeut peditiously, the growth of our secondary industries will be retarded. I have received complaints from persons engaged in the saw-milling trade about importers of timber competing with local mills. While reports are being obtained from the Tariff Board, Australian industries are suffering. 1 hope that the Minister will see what can be done to relieve the saw-millers. When mention was made last session of the need to encourage the manufacture in Australia of artificial flowers, a general smile was occasioned; but when a number of honourable members inspected the factory in Sydney that is engaged in this work, it was realized that the local product was better than the imported article. European manufacturers are now getting r i d of their surplus stocks, and some of the Australian factories are suffering severely. fashions have changed, and ladies are now wearing felt hats without flowers ? MrE , RILEY I think not. These goods are in demand throughout the Commonwealth.

Anything from 50 to 150 acres is a sufficient area for a rice-grower, whereas But the market is to get a decent living a grazier on that country would require from 1,500 to 2,000 acres. In view of the fact that there is so much rice produced on the area, and because ifc is admitted to be of superior quality to imported rice, it is surely unfair that the rice-growers are given no protection.

125,Mr Killen (Eiverina) [8.0],"Ther eSouth line. I visited the Territory prepared to support the construction of the line, feeling sure that the quality of the country would justify me in doing so. I had to completely change my mind when I saw the country. A t Oodnadatta there is poor, light carrying country, with an annual rainfall of about 4J inches. For about 200 miles north of Oodnadatta the rainfall is about the same, but further north there is an increased rainfall, though not more than 7 inches at most, until oue comes close to the Macdonnell Ranges, at Alice Springs, where the annual rainfall is from 10 to 11 inches. The fact that there is a fair rainfall there, and some middling to fair country, though none better than second class pastoral country, appears to some honourable members to j u s t if y the construction of the railway. I remind the committee that in this so-called Eldorado, there is but a comparatively small patch of second class country; nearly the whole of the rest of the country along the line between Oodnadatta to Alice Springs is very poor, light-carrying country. For the first half of the distance, the country would not carry more than three cattle to the square mile. It could not be profitably used for of the improvements that would be necessary to make it fit for that purpose, and it would not carry more than one sheep to 20 or 25 acres. The worse of the country along the line is very much worse than that which I have referred to. worthless spinifex country. covered with one kind of spinifex is not worthless, but the country covered with the spinifex seen on the route of this line is practically worthless. There are barren hills, and nearly all the country is poor, though there are some small patches of good country to be met with. I contend that thc quality of the country does not justify the construction of the railway, which w ill be an absolute waste of money. Further north than Alice Springs, the country on the route of the proposed railway is no better, on the average, than that which I have described, u n t i l one reaches the Barkly Tableland. The line touches the western end of tbe Barkly Tableland, but the greater part of that area of very much better country w ill not be served by the railway. On the first 700 miles travelled from Oodnadatta I saw not more than 50 miles of decent country, and nearly all of that was only second class country. We have had a railway constructed to Oodnadatta for the last 36 years, but it has not brought about settlement. I am informed that there were more people in the district before the railway was constructed to Oodnadatta than there are there now. In spite of this, the Government proposes to build an expensive railway through country that is no better than that traversed by the line to Oodnadatta. Territory Commission going to do with that country. Northern Territory Commission, one of whose members has had practical experience, and knows good from bad country, and I hope that the Government w ill call for a report from the commission before it proceeds to waste money on the construction of this railway.

I was a young man my father sent me up to develop 250,000. acres in the north-west of New South ""Wales, and 250 miles from the nearest railway. The area to which I was sent comprised country similar to the best country in the Northern Territory, but .it had about double the rainfall. I spent seven years as a young man on that country to no purpose, because all the pioneers of that country failed. In the circumstances I do not know how it is: possible for people to succeed in the Northern Territory country to which I have referred. There are a few people settled there, and I am very sorry for them. They have pluck and endurance and the true pioneering spirit, or they would never have gone there. I used to think that there was something of the pioneering spirit iu me, and I love the life; but, if I were again 25 years of age, I would not attempt pioneering in the district along the route of the line from Oodnadatta to. Alice Springs, because I knoiw it would be a hopeless task. Tlie railway to Oftdnadatta, as I have said, has brought about no settlement. The country through which it runs is held in immense, areas,, and, so far as I can learn, those who. are holding them are not doing any good. A man who hasmade a success of pastoral settlement in other parts of Australia, learning that I had gone through the. Northern Territory, met me and offered to sell me a good run up there. I may say that I had not the slightest intention of acquiring: country., even, if I and Flinders grasses and' is well found it to be good country, when I visited the Territory. The object of my visit was: to seewhether the construction of this railway was justified -The man to whom I have referred said to me, "" I can. sell you 8,000 square miles of country on the route of i«e line between Oodnadatta and Alice Springs for £5,000. I told him that I was not a buyer. I did not. ask permission to mention this man's name, but I believe that if I had done so he would have raised no objection.. South Australia? thought of buying any country, and he replied, "" I wish I had never seen it I r have never made a penny out of it."" When such a man cannot do any good with an immense area, what hope of success has a I may say that when small settler ? Moreover, from a point 500 or 600 miles north of the border, tbe climate is not fit for white men. June, the thermometer reading was regu,larly up to 100 in the shade, and the flies were swarming. We had to cover our faces with gauze, and at meals a battle of wits raged between ourselves and the flies to decide whoshould get the food. If those conditions obtained in winter, imagine what the climate would be like in summer. The country is so poor that at least 150*000 acres would berequired to provide a, family with a bare subsistence. Upon a worthless tract oi this character, millions of' pounds of public money is to be wasted. The irony of the situation is that no> railway is proposed for the immense area of first class land! on. the Barkly Tableland and! on the Victoria Biver. On theTableland,, there aTe 30,000,000 acres capable of supporting from 8,000,000 to 10,000,000 sheep-. ber see that country? larly interested in it, because for some years I was a part-owner of a very similar piece of country in Queensland. orable member in the Territory? about five weeks.

149,Dr. Maloney,"W h i l e I agree withing the Ministry to a bunch of grapes, I consider the Ministerf or Trade and Customs to be the best grape of the bunch. The honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) made a fine speech on the tobacco industry, but I should like to point out to h i m that tobacco growing and manufacture is very badly protected in this country. Having investigated some of the world's tarilf figures, I say emphatically that our tariff, improved as it has been of late years under the guidance of the present Minister, does not compare with that of either Japan or the United States of America. The duty on tobacco for the manufacture of cigars is 2s. 6d. a pound, and if stemmed 3s. a lb. The duty on manufactured tobacco is 5s. 4d. a lb. Tn Japan the duty is 355 per cent. Japan is a splendid example of how its workers and products can be sufficiently protected. In the United States of America the duty on cigars, cigarettes, and cheroots is ISs. a lb. plus 25 per cent. In the Philippines the duty is 19s. 9d. a lb. plus 25 per cent. In Australia the duty on cigarettes is l is . 6d. a lb. against the Home Land, and 12s. a lb. against other countries; and for cigars, l is . a lb. against the Home Land and 13s. a lb. against other countries. The excise on hand-made cigars is 2s. 8d. a lb., and on machine-made cigars 3s. 8d. a lb. The duty on the tobacco is 2s. 6d. a lb. in each case. That gives a protection to the Australian cigar maker of 5s. lOd. a lb. against the Home Land and 7s. lOd. a lb. against other countries. stance cigars at 6d. each f.o.b. European ports, costing £2 10s. for l i lb. The protection for Australian cigar makers would be 7s. 3d. a lb. against the Home Land and 9s. 3^d. a lb. against other countries. Tn Japan the protection would be actually £8 17s. fid. Japan is the only country in tlic world that has successfully fought the great tobacco combine. Senator Eindley and I visited that great country. We arrived there during the turmoil of the tobacco fight. The Japanese Government required money during the Russo-Japanese war, and it knew that the European money-lenders recognized the great value of the tobacco monopoly. It approached the American tobacco combine to purchase its monopoly. The combine turned aside the suggestion. months later a second offer was made. The representatives of the combine in Japan said, "" We do not care to sell. You know that competition is the lif e of trade."" Japan thereupon realized that she would have to engage in tbe trade. A duty of 20 per cent, was placed upon tobacco which entered that country. The combine laughed. The duty was raised to 50 per cent., and in the following year to 100 per cent. A t the time that I interviewed the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairsi n Tokio the duty was 250 per cent. A line of cigars that could be shipped at Hamburgf o r £10 a 1,000, free on board, cost, landed in Japan, an additional £ 2 5 plus landing charges and freight. The cost to the Japanese Government amounted to only £10 plus landing charges and freight. The combine approached the Japanese Government, to enter into arrangements to buy them out. The Government said: "" No ; we made you two f a i r offers, but you refused them, and told us that competition was the life of trade. We wish you to remain in Japan and compete with us."" I am not proud that a wdiite race should go under to a race whose skin is perhaps not so white as mine, but never w ill my lips say one word against any human being because his skin is darker than mine. It is only chance of birth that has made my skin white; if God had wished me to be born elsewhere my skin might have been of a different colour. The power of that mighty trust is shown by the fact that Take, for in in her hour of trouble France was offered £80,000,000 in gold for the monopoly in that country. Two and a half years later the offer was increased to £120,000,000. On the last day of the last session of this Parliament the Government wisely brought down proposals for the protection of our iron and steel industry, and A t one time thus saved the great basic industry from unjust dumping by the European Steel Trust, which, unless restricted, would have destroyed our great steel works near Newcastle. The Australian worker in the cigar-making industry is protected to the extent of 7s. 3-Jd. on British cigars, and 9s. 3$d. on foreign cigars; and as compared with that the Japanese levy a duty of £ 8 17s. 6d. _ That is the way we Some ought to be assisting the great steel industry to fight the mighty power of the European Steel Trust.

162,,"I realize as clearly Mr PRATTEN A f t e r the lamentedtions to the Government. The honourable inember for New England referred to the attendance of representatives of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company at the meetings at which the T a r i ff Board took evidence on the tobacco industry. I point out to the honourable member that the board is obliged to make all its inquiries in public, and to take all its evidence on oath. It is quite customary a.nd, in fact, proper for the parties interested in the proceedings of the board to be present at its inquiries. that representatives of the trust interviewed the board privately. of this, or of the request made by the growers, or of what they consider necessary for the development of their industry, and I can assure the honourable member that the evidence given in support of his application, and of extraneous matters bearing on it , w ill have my earnest consideration, and also the attention of the Government. I am amplifyin g my remarks so that they may be read by the tobacco-growers themselves. The import duty on unstemmed tobacco-practicall y all the tobacco imported is unstemmed-is 2s. a lb., and the excise duty on both local and imported leaf, when manufactured, is also 2s. a lb. There appears, therefore, to be a margin of practically 2s. a lb. in favour of the Australian grower. After the leaf is gathered, it has to go to a tax on education. through a certain process. gin is cut down by the waste that occurs books coming into this country are free in the process of manufacture.

The matmember that the economic position of the ter will receive my keen attention, with, I hope, practical results, because it seems to me that one of several things is the cause of the present position of the growers -eithe r they are not being fairly treated by the buyers; they are growing the wrong sort of tobacco; or they are demanding too high a price for it . I am informed by the buyers that the chief defects are coarseness of texture, bad colour, and in different burning aroma. In regard to texture and colour, the factors operating to bring about those defects are, unsuitable soil, indifferent climatic conditions, in adequate methods of cultivation, lack of experience in cultivation, inexperience in I was not aware curing methods, and the effect of blue mould. I am f u l l y aware of the value of the industry, and I promise the committee that it w ill have the attention that it well deserves. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) raised one or two exceedingly difficult matters in connection with the tariff, and was kind enough to make complimentary reference to myself, for which I thank him. He referred to the printing industry. As he well knows, this is one of the most prosperous industries in the Commonwealth, and it is amply protected in most directions. In reply to his suggestion that a duty be imposed on im ported books, I point out that Parliament, in previous years, would not consider such a proposal; and I hazard the opinion that it would be difficult to obH o w can that be so? tain a majority of this committee to agree I exhonorable member's predecessor ( Mr. opinion as to whether Mahony) introduced a deputationto me I agree entirely with the honourable",51,Honourable Members Hear Hear

I might add that a large amount of money is due every year overseas in interest upon tlie public debt. My honourable friend is a good protectionist, just as, I hqpe, I ain. I believe that the economic position should be carefully examined, because ipso taction canno t accomplish everything that we desire. the facts responsible for the excess of imports over exports is overseas borrowing. Credits can only be transferred from one country ito another in one of three -ways-in goods, gold, or securitiesand since Australia does not receive gold or securities it must take goods. travagant abroad pal causes of the excess of imports. We must cultivate the Australian sentiment ancl give preference to our own goods. We must also have adequate tariff protection in order to maintain our standards of living. It must not be assumed that the great volume of imports is any argument against our policy of protection. I find that trade statistics are not given in such a detailed way as to enable honourable members to analyse the position closely. I have recently taken the trouble to go into the subject of woollens and some lines of textiles, and my reply yesterday to the honourable member -for Corio( Mr Lister) shows that where manufacturers are efficient, and are sufficiently protected, imports diminish. The imports of woollen piece goods have fallen off to the extent of 33 per cent., and the quantity of imported woollen yarns has been halved, since the last tariff was imposed. During the recess I shall endeavour to have the statistics prepared in a manner that w ill enable us to analyse them from the protectionist stand-point. This afternoon the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) addressed a question without notice to the Prime Minister in these termsHas the Prime Minister inquired into the very serious allegations made yesterday that attempts had been made to induce the Navy Department to exercise its authority 'over .Comknown mander Cresswell in order to prevent him from giving certain evidence before the Wireless Commission'? He To that question the Prime Minister -repliedI have no knowledge of any attempt to 'interfere with Commander Cresswell,; but wary unfortunately papers which came into Commander Cresswell's hands in the -course of bis duties in the department, and were 'of a most secret character, dealing with a subject of great importance to -Australia, were produced at the inquiry. That, I think, was most undesirable. 1 need hardly say that I am .sufficiently One of well acquainted w i th my rights in this Parliament, and with my duty to it and the public, not to contemplate for a moment entering upon a discussion of matter's which have been referred by the Governor General to a .royal commission for inquiry and report. That, I think, Exwould be highly improper. But I thirik and reckless borrowing it is an impropriety into which the right is one of the princi honourable gentleman himself 'has 'fallen, and I propose to criticize him for that reason. The honourable member for Yarra, if I may say so, as one would expect, raised a question which he was perfectly entitled 'to raise. It -was not one which dealt with the merits or --demerits of the issues which are being discussed before the Wireless Commission. It was directed to ascertain whether or not it was 'true that improper influences were being exercised 'to prevent a witness from giving evidence before ""the Commission. That, I submit, is a vital matter. 1 have little more than .one comment to make upon this aspect of th"", case. Tbe question asked whether ithe Prime Minister knew anything about this alleged attempt to influence Commander Cresswell in his evidence. The answer of the Prime Minister was that he knew nothing about it . It is a little surprising, seeing that the matter has been given great publicity in the press, and that it was recorded in the press that Commander Cresswell himself had made the complaint in the most definite way before the commission, that the right honourable gentleman did not up to that time know anything a'bout it . I eveu think that he should have known something about it . B i it that is hardly the point. The point is 'that while the Prime Minister declared that he ""knew nothing at -all about the allegation of intimidation or interference with Commander Cresswell, he seems to have quite a lot a'bout other evidence that came before 1;he commission on the same day. So far as",52,Honourable Members Hear Hear
169,Mr Brennan (Batman) Fj9.28],"tihe first part of this question is concerned, the matter may be disposed of by quoting the observations of Commander Cresswell, andthose of the chairman of the commission. giwing his evidence, Commander Cresswell saidI wish to make a statement that yesterday afternoon Mr Fisk managing director of the Amalgamated Wireless Company cal ed upon Admiral Napier and asked him whether I represented the views of the Naval Board, or represented the Naval Board in my evidence.

Tliis matter aroseyesterday before the commission in connection wit h a letter, daffed 21st December, 1926, from Amalgamated Secretary of the Department of Defence. Commander Cresswell, in giving evidence, quoted the letter up to a certain point, and then said', referring to the latter part of it I cannot disclose what that provision IB. Mr Lewis, who is junior counsel to Mr. Speaking on oath, in Owen Dixon, K . C , counsel for the Amalgamated Wireless Company, then saidWith regard to the passage whicli the witness has omitted from that letter, we have here a copy of the original letter, and it would appear to those instructing me, and also to myself, that the matter is so obviously contrary to what thc witness says, that I shall ask thc commissionto look at those particularwords to see whether they should be admitted.

That arises, out oi the existing order of things, and that is one ofi thematters into which we are inquiring'.

That is. not a. letter received by Commander Cresswell, b u t a letter written, we may say. by him as. the representative of his branch of the Defence Department.

Then Mr Lewis, seeing, an opening from , the lawyer's point of view, promptly rejoinedThat is why we are astonished at it being brought up at all. With reference to what you said, Mr Chairman, I should like to make the company's position clear on the point. It IK a matter of great astonishment to us that any of these confidential documents have been brought forward. They are, as has been said, marked "" confidential'"" to the company, and the company w ill be no party to bringing these confidential documents forward.

I should like the company to give their attention. Your file must be prepared by typists and clerks, and must be seen by directors and possibly by shareholders, and yet it may contain information of the most secret and confidential nature. care of the managing director. Tlie CHAIRMAN -Yes; but the managing director is not an officer of the Defence Force, and he is not a public servant. Do not think for one moment tliat we are giving a decision, or that we have made up our minds. These are matters which we have to investigate, and 1 think I am speaking for the whole of the' commission in saying that they are weighing heavily with us. I think that is the whole of the relevant matter that I need quote in dealing with this question. This is the position disclosed by these quotations: Commander Cresswell, so far as the commission is concerned, is the representative of the Navy. He is a witness subpoenaed to give evidence before it . before it , and being there to give all the information he can, which in his opinion does not conflict with the public interests, having regard to his position in the Navy. I know very little about Commander Cresswell, and have seen him only casually in connection with this in quiry. It has been very evident even to the most casual observer that, to use his own words, Commander Cresswell has been "" over cautious"" to say nothing which would in the slightest degree prejudice the public interest, and, on the other hand, to discharge his duty as a witness before the commission, to let the commission and the public know all he knows about this matter and all ho is able to divulge. I say that the Prime Minister has been guilty of a grave i m propriety, in the first place, in plunging into this matter to express any opinion about any of the evidence submitted to the commission, and is guilty of much graver impropriety in endeavouring to intimidate a witness. something of which he has not been guilty. blaming him for something for which clearly he has not been guilty in the slightest degree. Commander Cresswell thought than an attempt had been made to influence his department, so as to prevent h i m giving evidence before the commission. That statement, taken witli the statement of the Prime Minister today, immensely strengthens the suspicion wbich has to be investigated that the managing director of Amalgamated Wireless Limited is busily rushing from one department to another in order to prevent the inquiry proceeding in a way that would be unpleasant to himself. He first went to the Navy Office, and then, apparently, to the Prime Minister, with the fallacious information that Commander Cresswell has acted with impropriety i u giving evidence before the commission. The whole thing is most anomalous. It is a most amazing and, from many points of view, a most regrettable thing to find a representative of the Navy, or the Navy as a whole, making serious comljlaints before the Wireless Commission of the way in which its operations are being hampered by the fact that wireless He is bound to come is complicated by its commercial association with that very commercial company, Australian Wireless Limited. Thati n itself lends point to a great deal that has been said in this chamber by honourable members of the Labour party and others. I do not wish to pursue this matter further at this stage beyond saying that the reason for the interposition of the Navyi n this inquiry is perfectly easy to understand. It was inevitable that sooner or later the Navy should in tervene for a reason I have stated here 1 and elsewhere, namely, the danger to the public weal in this great public service of wireless which should, where necessary, be secret and which should at all events be conducted as a national concern for the benefit of the people as a whole, being associated with a commercial company. But these matters are not open for discussion. I would not think of saying anything at this stage about the Wireless Commission, the matters into which it is inquiring, its possible or probable findings, the merits of the agreement beA n d blaming h i m for tween the Commonwealth and Amalgamated Wireless, or the success or failure of the beam system.

And if there was one witness more than another who should be encouraged to testify, and who should be unimpeded, uninterrupted and free of intimidation, it was the representative of the Navy Department. He, perhaps, more than any other witness, had a right to be I Prime Minister justifies the interference with the operations of the commission, and why he ventures to invade the rights of the commission, which alone has authority to determine what evidence is admissable, and what is not. It is intolerable that in connection with a matter of this kind tbe Prime Minister should fire objections and criticism at a witness. In my experience, and probably in the experience of the oldest member in this chamber, such a thing has never happened before. Let the Prime Ministerj u s t if y it , if he can. He was guilty of attempting to intimidate a fearless witness who, we must assume if we did not actually know it , is a witness to the truth , and a Ocean.

He has not produced one scintilla of evidence that the Government has in any way attempted to interfere with or intimidate Commander Cresswell. The only definite statement that he has made is that tlie maaging director of Amalgamated Wireless, Mr Fisk, had paid a visit to Admiral Napier, and that Commander Cresswell had told the commission that that visit was for the purpose of intimidating him. The honourable member for Batman, who is a lawyer, will hardly suggest that a mere statement of that nature is evidence of intimidation by anybody. ment called for inquiry by the royal commission, and that I need not pursue it any f u r t h e r ; then I proceeded to make my charge against the Prime Minister. be investigated, but it provides no justification for charging the Government with having attempted to influence any witness. Therefore, there is no reason to heard without interruption. waste further time on the honourable memshould like to know how the ber's first charge. His second allegation related to an answer which I gave in this chamber this afternoon, and he suggested that that, also, was an attempt fco intimidate or influence a witness. I can explain my statement very briefly. That Commander Cresswell had made certain disclosures before the commission I had read in the public press, but I had no official knowledge on the subject. Some little time ago the British Government forwarded to the Commonwealth Government certain suggestions as to what wireless provision should bs made for the defence of Australia, and particularly for the purpose of reporting the movements of the fleets in the Pacific posal that certain coastal stations, which under the agreement with the Commonwealth, have been taken over by Amalgamated Wireless Limited, should be made much more powerful. That v/ould involve a very considerable expenditure. Under the agreement the only obligation on the company was to provide a service at least equivalent to that which had been provided by those coastal stations when they had been controlled by the Postal Department. When the suggestion was made that the power of certain stations should be greatly increased, at considerable cost, the apportionment of the extra burden had to be considered. Not unreasonably, the honourable member for Batman will agree, the company said that the increased expenditure was not part of its obligation under the contract. The Government appointed a committee to investigate this matter, and made available to it all the information furnished by the British Government as to what would be adequate wireless provision for the defence of the country. The committee consisted of Senator Millen, Mr. Brown, Mr Malone, of the Postal Department, and Commander Cresswell, of",55,Witness Tli E Letter Whichwas Forwarded 1

A u inquiry of a very different nature is now being conducted by a royal commission into wireless generally, and Commander Cresswell was appointed by the Navy Department to watch the proceedings and to give evidence, if necessary, in regard to the present state of wireless in this country. He had no authority to give any information of secret proposals that were under the .consideration of the Government. never authorized by the Government to disclose that information, and honourable members will agree that the Government would not authorize a junior officer to produce, secret and confidential files belonging to the department of wihich he was a servant. Commander Cresswell did that, and,, in reply to a direct question,, I stated, in the House to-day that his action was most undesirable. I could say nothing less. As this matter is more or less suB judice,. I , , like the honourable member for Batman, am debarred, from pursuing it further. The. only opinion which I expressed this afternoon related to the production of secret aud confidential files by a departmental officer withoutauthority and. without any pressure having been p u t upon himby thecommission. have referred was appointedto determine what extra wirelessprovvisioa should be made for defence purposes, and whether the. cost should be. boma by the Government or by the. company. If . the royal commission desired to get confidential information it could have taken the necessary action,, and then, if , in the opinion of the Government, it was undesirable in the public interest that certain facts should, be disclosed, the Government could, in accordance w i th a well recognized practice, in which all sober and sensible citizens, will acquiesce, delegate a senior and responsible officer to so inform the commission. Mr BH-ENNAN -The been very strict in that regard. of defence which could be only a very small part of any inquiry by the royal commission, a junior officer produced confidential files without f u l l consideration by those who are responsible for the The investigadefence policy of the country, and Avithout proper authority. That, I repeat, was a most undesirable action-. Any information that the royal commission requires and which can, without detriment to the public interest, be disclosed, w ill be furnished by the Defence Department, and any information that it would be improper to disclose can be withheld by the Government, and the reasons explained to the commission. H is unreasonable to suggest that the reply I gave to a question in the Housethis afternoon warrants the allegation that Certainly he was this Government is attempting to in -timid'ate a witness. reply of the Prime Minister to the speech of the honourable member for' Batman is similar to that which he gave to my question this afternoon. He has evaded the issue. First, he said that the honourable member for Batman had given no evidence of any attemptby the Government to intimidate Commander Cresswell, other than the statement by that officer that Mr Eisk had called on Admiral Napier and suggested that, certainrestraint be put upon Commander Cresswell. The. only, evidence that the honorahle member for Batman brought f brw/aa-d, saidthePrime; Minister, related to tlie action of Mr Eisk. Then he conThe. committee to which I cluded his speechby saying that the only evidence that the honorable member f b r Batman put forward was his reoly in the House this afternoon. How can both these be the only thing put forward ? The honourable member for Batman did not put forward Mr Fisk's visit to the Navy as evidence of intimidation by this Government. He relied upon another action to prove his charge against the Government that it was trying to restrain Commander Cresswell from proceeding with his evidence before the royal commission. The proof w ill appear in Mansard to-morrow.. It is on record in this House to-day. Tbe Prime Minister's own statement was an admissionthat the Government does not commission has want Commander Cresswell to give the fullest evidence before the inquiry.

The junior counsel for the company, which is not a department of the Government, and has nothing to do with the Navy, calmly told the commission that he had a copy of the secret document in f r o n t of him . Instead of the Prime Minister using his position, as head of the Government to make remarks calculated to intimidate a witness before the commission, he might have turned his batteries upon Mr Lewis, the junior counsel, and asked hi m how he became possessed of confidential documents of the department.

Therefore there is a provision in the law which makes it an offence for anyone to make unjustifiable threats of proceedings against persons who are supposed to be about to perform a work in infringement of the right of the owner. Some other questions which have been raised-one of them, I understand, by the man)-also require an immediate reply. I was not in the chamber when the honourable member was speaking, but I understand that in referring to the Public Service Arbitration Act, and to the powers of this House in relation to the determinations made by the Public Service Arbitrator, he suggested that Parliament had no power to deal with a determination of the Arbitrator, even if it disagreed with it. I remind the honourable member of section 22 of the Arbitration Service Act of 1920, which provides that the Arbitrator may make a determination which is not in accordance with an award or order of the court, but, except as provided in the section, may not make a determination "" which is not in accord with the laws of the Commonwealth and the regulations made thereunder."" The section goes on to provide that the Arbitrator may make a determination inconsistent with a law or regulation of the Commonwealth, and when he does so it is incumbent upon him to send a statement to the Prime Minister and to the Attorney-General stating the laws or regulations with which the determination is inconsistent. It is then open to the AtAfr. Latham. there are any laws or regulations with If, in the case of a determination accomthe statement or opinion has been laid before come into operation. It appears to be perfectly clear that if either House, within 30 days after the placing of the determination, statement, or opinion upon the table, passes a resolution disapproving of the determination, that determination does not come into operation. The powers of Parliament, in other words, have been very carefully conserved in this legislation. but should it be applied to an arbitration award ? properly be applied to all the determinations of the Public Service Arbitrator, as distinct from the awards of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. This is a matter depending entirely upon the statute. It was the deliberate judgment of Parliament that the awards of the Public Service ArbiPublic trator should be subject to this supervision. Parliament has the power of veto, but not the power to make another award. As the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley), who spoke about the operations of the Commonwealth Shipping Board, and other honourable members are aware, the question of the powers of the Commonwealth Shipping Board was brought before the High Court in an action, and the High Court interpreted certain sections, particularly sections 10 and 14, of the Commonwealth Shipping Act 1923.

Four judges out of the five went on to say that if the act had gone further it would have been unconstitutional and invalid. Accordingly, the position which faces not only the Government, but also the House, is this: It has been determined that the act does not, on its true interpretation, authorize the board to engage in general ns distinct from marine engineering business. Four judges however, proceeded, although it did not appear to be absolutely necessary for the decision of the case, to express the opinion that if the act had authorized the carrying on of a general engineering business, sueh an aot would have been beyond the powers of this Parliament. In the light of that opinion it is obvious that it would be useless to amend the act io confer upon tbe board the power to carry on a general engineering business. The view of the High Court substantially was that there are no powers in the Constitution which enable the Commonwealth Parliament by statute to authorize a corporation created by it to carry on business of a general kind unconnected with the specific legislative powers of the Commonwealth.
