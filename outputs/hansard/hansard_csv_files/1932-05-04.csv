In view of the proof thatcertain funds contributed by public servants aud placed to the credit of the Superannuation Board have been attached by the Commonwealth, when will the Prime Minister release them ao that superannuation payments may be resumed ? in possession of any information that the moneys attached by it include funds belonging to the New South Wales Superannuation Board. If funds that 1 were lying in the banks to the credit of the Superannuation Fund cannot be released at the present time, the fact is that .various trust funds were included in the £1,000,000 which Mr Lang withdrew from the hanks in order to forestall action by the Commonwealth Government. It is the duty of the Premier of New South Wales to meul the superannuation obligations of his Government from that amount.

The honourable member is amplifying his preliminary remarks to too great, an extent. He must ask his question. paragraph in the Sydney Sun of the 3rd instant statesThe general secretary of the Public Service sion of tlie New South Wales Taxation Association ( Mr O'SuHivan) referring to-day to the Prime Ministers suggestion that money belonging to the Superannuation Fund was included in the amount withdrawn from the bank by the State Government, said that he understood tliiit the Superannuation Board had a separate account. The bourd's bank account had been attached by the Commonweal th Government, and it could not now pay pensions facilities. How can the Prime Minister reconcile his statement with that which I have read which shows that it was impossible for the State Government to have withdrawn the money? This Government, has not attached any separate sum standing to the credit of the Superannuation Board; the amounts that, have been attached stand in the name of the Government of Now South Wales. Consequently Mr O'Sullivan's statement in no way contradicts niy own. amount whicli it is claimed stands to the credit of the New South Wales Public Service Superannuation Pund is very much greater than the whole amount attached by the Commonwealth Government? by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) that is definitely so. meatless bone handed out to the Federal missioner for New South Wales, concerns only moneys that are owing by a number of large taxpayers from whom the Crown Law Oflice of that State has vainly endeavoured to obtain payment. If so, what action does the Prime Minister propose to take to recover these debts? Does not the honourable gentleman think that the recovery of these moneys would make such a substantial contribution towards meeting the amount owing by the Government of New South Wales that there would be no necessity to attach revenues that are needed to pay motherhood endowment, widows and other pensions, and compensations ? ber's question suggests that be has a much greater knowledge than the Commonwealth Government regarding what should be confidential information in the possesDepartment. * Herald of yesterday, there appears an article purporting to report an interview with the Prime Minister which reads: Mr Lyons added that a perusal of the official press organ of Mr Lang revealed an almost through lack of blinking daily incitement to disorder and violence. This incitement to violence, combined with bringing widows and others to a state of desperation, was significantly similar to the policy adopted by disvuptionists in other parts of the world. Is this a prelude to the Commonwealth Government declaring the Labor Daily an illegal publication under the amended Crimes Act that, was recently introduced in another place? the honourable member are without foundation, but I am glad that he has emphasized a point that I recently made in this Parliament with regard to the Labor Daily. for Trade and Customs read the report in tlie Melbourne Argus of the sworn evidence before the Tariff Board regarding the huge importation of galvanized iron by Lysaghts prior to an embargo on importations being imposed by the Scullin Government?

TO MOUNTMORGAN . Jer and Treasurer) [2.54] -by leaveYesterday the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) asked me a question relating to a proposed visit of Mr Gepp to No r t h Queensland. I am now able to advise the lionorinembor that at the request of the Government of Queensland, the services of Mr Gepp, Consultant to the Commonwealth Government, have been made available to advise the Queensland Government upon the desirability of nllocating a portion of the unemployment grant to Mount Morgan. Mr Gepp will leave Melbourne for Queensland on the €t h May, and expects to be absent for about a fortnight. During this-period he will investigate the processes developed at Mount Morgan during the past twelve months for the treatment of ore. In making Mr Gopp's services available, the Commonwealth Government was actuated by a desire to stimulate the development of profitable mining. It is realized that this class of work is directly reproductive, and, from the point of view of absorption, the man-power element is a big factor. In the case of Mount Morgan, it is claimed that, if successful development can be accomplished, work will be found for from 200 to 300 men. PKOI'OSKD NATIONAL ORCHESTRA.

If he was absent from the Territory, what urgent reasons necessitated their making during his absence? orable member's questions are as follow:1, 2 and 3. All ordinances for the territory are made by the Governor General pursuant to section 1=1 of the New Guinea Act 1920-11)20. Regulations under au ordinance are made hy the Governor General or by the Administrator according to whether the ordinance so provides. Regulations made by the Administrator pursuant to the power conferred upon him by any ordinance take effect from the date if their publication iu the New Guinea, Gazette, unless some other date is specified in the regulations, but they are subject to disallowance by General may, pursuant, to section 9 of the New Guinea Act 1920-1920, appoint a person to iict in the oflice of Administrator and to administer the government of the territory during any vacancy in the oflice of Administrator or when the Administrator is absent from the territory ov unable, by reasons of ill llth August, I 92G, the board recommended that ni'HB or incapacity, to perforin his duties; and such person who so administers shall have aud may exercise and perform all the powers and functions of the Administrator.

The Governorhonorable member's questions are as follow:1.

In a report dated vessels n.e.i., not exceeding 1,000 tons gross register, trading intra-state or interstate, or otherwise employed in Australian waters for any continuous period of three mouths, should be made dutiable at ad valorem 50 per cent.

From the official organ of the United Australia Party we get an intimation of the classes of revenue proposed to be attached. According to that journal, the whole of the railway and tramway revenue of New South Wales, over and above working expenses, is to be taken by the Commonwealth Government; but evidently Commonwealth Ministers wish to have the comfort of train and tram travelling when visiting Sydney. interest payable on the money belonging to the railways commissioners w ill also be attached. This action by the Commonwealth Government inflicts further hardship upon the people of New South Wales. These people are not being considered at all by this Government, yet surely they have'somo rights. If the Government has a quarrel with Mr Lang, why does not the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) challenge him to go to the Stadium. We should certainly have a packed house if a bout were arranged between them. That would be a simple method of getting money by which the New South Wales Government could pay some of its debts. The action of the Commonwealth Government is directed against one man, for the purpose of bringing about an election in New South Wales, irrespective of the suffering thereby inflicted upon the people. This Government is determined to pursue such a policy, and it cares not who suffers.

We are not seeking to recover one penny that belongs to the State of New Soutli Wales, but merely that amount which the Commonwealth Government has paid on behalf of that State, and which is due and payable by that State. The Comway. monwealth will continue to pursue that course so long as the State Government continues to default. Tho State of New South Wale3 has on several occasions defaulted in regard to the payment of interest due on its external debts, but that State-o r rather its Government, for we must draw a distinction between the State and tbe Government-is now defaulting in respect of interest payment on internal debts as well. Honourable members know that the default, on external interest payments is not clue to the inability of the Government of New South Wales to meet those payments, but is part of a policy enunciated last year by Mr ments for services rendered are designed Lang, and first put into operation in April of that year. In July last, Mr ment of running expenses, but also a Lang abandoned his overseas default policy, and, at the Premiers Conference in Melbourne, attended by the representatives of all the States aud the Commonwealth, he solemnly agreed to meet his future interest obligations on external debts. At about the same time, Mr Lang was n party to the huge internal debt conversion operation, by which the interest rates in Australia were substantially reduced. By his acceptance of the scheme, Mr Lang committed himself to pay, at any rate, the new rate of interest. But now, in addition to defaulting on external interest payments, the rate of which remains the same, Mr Lang is defaulting in respect of interest payments due on internal debts which, as a result of the conversion scheme, have been considerably reduced. Moreover, despite the fact that the Commonwealth has for some time past been paying the interest due by New South Wales, both on external and bring in new internal debts, Mr Lang has now defaulted on superannuation allowances, family endowment payments, and bursaries to school children. In fact, his whole policy is one of default in regard to practically everything except, perhaps, salaries and wages. For all the.se failures Mr Lang seeks to blame tlie Commonwealth, but the superannuation and family endowment moneys have nol been received by the Commonwealth, and Mr Lang is far better able to pay them to-day than he would have been if he had been paying his interest in the ordinary The main object of the present bill is to enable the Commonwealth to secure a portion of a class of revenue in cases in which it docs not desire to attach the whole of that class of revenue. An important principle lies behind this amendment. In the case of the railways, the revenues are really payment for services rendered. These revenues are, to a large extent, expended in payment of the cost of rendering the service, and particularly in the payment of the wages of the railway employees. Very large sums of borrowed money have been expended on the construction of railways, and the payto produce, not only sufficient for the paysurplus to meet interest on the capital indebtedness. the New South Wales railway finances show a huge deficit. true; but it is not in respect to working costs. The receipts are not sufficient to pay working costs and the whole of the interest on capital indebtedness, but they are more than sufficient; to pay merely working costs. other States, also. in no other State has the same position arisen as obtains in New South Wales. In the other States the surplus over working costs on the railways goes towards the payment of interest, even though it may not be enough to meet the interest charges in full.",16,Second Reading

As the State Government is not paying interest on the capital indebtedness of the New South Wales railways, and as that is being paid by the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth now proposes to attach a portion of the railway revenue of the State. No one can deny that the Commonwealth is justified in taking this action. The portion of railway revenue to be attached will be that amount which should properly be made available for the payment of interest. It is not intended to attach that portion of the revenue which should be used for running expenses, including wages. determined? ourselves. We are in a position to decide just what portion of the railway revenue is necessary to meet the working costs, and what portion is required to meet the interest due on the capital expended on the railways. It is the definite intention of the Government to proceed on the lines that I have indicated. The details of the bill will be disclosed at the committee stage. tude of the Federal Government if the Government of New South Wales ceases the running of the State railways? for the Government of New South Wales to cease running the railways. Minister think that the producers of perishable products are entitled to know what will be the attitude of the Federal Government in the event of the State railways ceasing to run? whole of the railway revenue, or anything more than the actual surplus over working expenditure, then some case might be made out in opposition to our action. In the event of the Lang Government ceasing to operate the railways, it would have to accept responsibility for its action. We are ensuring that the State Government will have revenue sufficient to enable it to continue the running of the railways. It should be clearly understood that we are asking the consent of honourable members to the only honest and decent course in the circumstances. The Government of New South Wales receives from the railways revenue which enables it to meet running costs, maintenance, repairs, wages, salaries, purchase of supplies, and so on, leaving a substantial surplus which any decent government would use in meeting the interest due on money borrowed to establish the railways. Under the authority of legislation which has already been enacted and declared valid, we are determined to collect the surplus over and above the cost of operating the railways, and to apply it, not to any Commonwealth commitments, but to the payment of a debt that is due by the Government of New South Wales itself. The case that that to be I have made out is unanswerable, though it may be unacceptable to some, because of party considerations. Another important provision in the bill gives the Commonwealth Treasurer power to require any person to answer questions and to produce documents relevant to any matter arising under the act. Other provisions in the bill deal with the .prosecution of offences and provides further penalties for refusal or failure to comply with the provisions of the act. We propose to increase the penalties for such offences as attempting to contravene or to prevent the operation of legislation which has been declared to be the paramount law of the land. In the present circumstances, it is serious indeed for any j>erson to commit such an offence, whether he be a Minister of the Crown, a government official, or the Prime a member of a corporation. gaol Mr Lang? in keeping with the offence. Therefore, it is proposed to increase the penalties in respect of all offences under the act. It is also proposed to amend sub-section 5 of section 15. This sub-section deals with the refund, in certain circumstances, of deposits paid to the Treasurer. The amendment is necessary in view of the recent judgment of the High Court.

Its supporters sneered at the methods of my Government, stating that they were too slow and cumbersome, but the present Government is learning that the process of recovering moneys from a defaulting State is not so simple as they imagined. The State Government of New South Wales also is learning that the Lang plan is not a success. Both plans have failed, and the people, particularly the citizens of New South Wales, are suffering. One cannot escape the belief that both the resistance by the State Government, and the enforcement measures of the Commonwealth Government, are inspired by political motives.

The Commonwealth Government made a fundamental blunder in consulting with the Loader of the Opposition ( Mr Stevens). Conferences are held mainly State leaders of oppositions are called into consultations they should not be cousulted apart from the State governments. When, in an inter-government dispute, the Ministry in one sphere confers with the Leader of the Opposition of the same political complexion in another sphere, the conference is tainted with a suspicion of party politics. Mr making but little progress if it has Stevens went hurriedly to Melbourne and later to Canberra to confer with the Commonwealth Ministers.

We can all sympathize with the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), who finds himself in the difficult position of attempting to make a good case out of an exceedingly bad one. He has not given the House a statement such as he could have made if his heart had really been in the attack that he has endeavoured to launch against the Government. Iu no State in the Commonwealth are railways obtaining sufficient revenue to pay both their working expenses and the whole of their interest. Consequently, the Commonwealth, which is paying this interest in full on behalf of the State of New South Wales, and proposes to leave untouched sufficient funds to meet the working expenses of the transport systems, can obtain, at the most, from the railway revenues of that State, a sum considerably less than what is necessary to pay interest on the railway undertakings of New South Wales. We are told that the action of this Government is provocative, and that these methods should be avoided. When we look back over the past two or three months and examine the history of these defaults, we recall that the Premier of New South Wales attended the Premiers Conference in Melbourne at the end of January of this year, and said that he had available for the payment of interest commitments overseas the sum of £424,000, and that he required a further £500,000 from the Loan Council to enable him to pay the £924,000 that was then due. That, amount was not made available. Instead of handing over the £424,000 as a contribution to the interest commitments then owing by his State, he retained it and left the Commonwealth Government to pay the whole' amount. Yet we are told that we should negotiate with a gentlemau of that sort, and refrain from taking provocative action! It was stated by the Treasurer that, by the end of this financial year, the defaults of New ister ( Mr Lyons) show clearly that there South Wales will amount in round figures to £6,000,000, including internal interest.

Paterson. tions. There are some who say, when, defending the action of the Lang Government, that interest rates have been brought down in Australia, by legislation ; why should not the same action be taken in connection with overseas interest rates? Iiractual practice we find that, although the rates in Australia have been lowered, the Government of New South .Wales has not discriminated between debts that are due internally, and those due externally. It has defaulted with regard to both. That indicates how hypocritical are many of the arguments advanced in defence of the action of the Lang"" Government. We must ask ourselves what figure the New South Wales defaults would have attained during the next twelve months if the Commonwealth Government had notintroduced this special enforcement legislation to recover some moneys from that State, and had been content to rely on the slow processes of the law. I cannot understand how the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition can face with equanimity the prospect which would be before us if we had not this salutary legislation to aid us. Although the right honourable gentleman condemns this bill, he offers no alternative to it except perhaps negotiation with the Premier of New South' Wales. He must surely forget that such negotiations have already occurred at various meetings of the Loan Couucil, and that the results have shown the utter futility of depending upon either the word or bond of that gentleman. I cannot understand how the Leader of the Opposition can think for a moment that the ordinary processes of the law are adequate to meet the situation which is facing us, seeing that it would probably be eighteen months or two years before we could recover the money owing. slower than this method? method we have £440,000 more than wewould otherwise have had, but the figures quoted this afternoon by the Prime Minis stili a very large balance in favour of ment has defaulted to the extent of £3,200,000, and we have recovered only",22,Second Reading

The right, honourable gentleman himself took the first step in the policy which this Government is now pursuing when he introduced the Financial Emergency Bill. Under that measure unjustifiable reductions were made in old age and invalid pensions and in the pensions of incapacitated soldiers, and of the dependants of the 60,000 soldiers who died on active service, who were told before they left, this country that if they fought for Australia, Australia would be theirs.

If the Scullin Government had been willing to agree to the appointment of a committee to inquire into the charge that certain unemployment relief moneys had been used in the electorate of a member of the Cabinet, there need not have been an election. that the Leader of the Opposition realized when he was Prime Minister that the application of the Premiers plan would bring us to our present impossible position, and that, therefore, he preferred to go to the people. When he did so he got what he deserved. But the remnant of his party which now sits in this House is not justified, on that ground, in adopting the course which it is at present following. However, I shall not pursue this subject. Ef the right honourable member had not attacked the party which I represent, I should not have said even so much as I have said. This Government, has found that the only result of its policy of attaching the revenues of New South Wales has been to get hold of a meatless bone. I understand that many of the taxation documents made available to the Commonwealth by the State Taxation Commiswith taxpayers who are heavily in arrears in their taxation payments. able member that? tion from the official organ of the United Australia party. If these people would pay their arrears of taxation they would place the Commonwealth in possession of an amount which would perhaps equal the takings if a boxing bout were arranged in some suitable place between the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) and Mr Lang. The Minister for Health( Mr Marr) promised during the last Federal election that he would eat his hat if Mr Lang remained in power for fourteen days after this Parliament was returned. The Minister could assist to raise considerable revenue by giving an exhibition of hat-eating as a preliminary to the main bout. I can well imagine how thrilled the spectators would be when the stadium manager exclaimed: ""On my right I have the right honourable member for Flinders ber must not .proceed on those lines. ager would say: "" And on my left'we have J.

The people of Australia recognize that it is wrong to send money overseas for the payment of interest when it is required iu Australia to enahle the hungry to keep hody and soul together. Everybody wishes to honour his debts, but I claim that honour should begin at home, and we should first look after our own people. What does the right honourable member for Flinders care if men, women, and children are hungry in Australia? If he has not seen starvation in this country, he need only go to New South Wales. Bulgaria and other Balkan nations refuse to pay the interest on their war loans, and claim that the money is required to meet the needs of their own people. When householders find it impossible to pay their domestic bills they ask for a moratorium ; but the butcher and the baker do not put bailiffs into their homes. The Commonwealth Government, however, declares that irrespective of the suffering that is entailed, the interest on our overseas debts must be paid. The right honourable member for Flinders mentioned that there were 500,000 bondholders to whom this money was owing, and that their average holdings were small. interest amounts to £50 a year. pensioners are called upon to live on a pensiou of £45 a year, and many of them on less than that. less. seas bondholders have other investments besides Commonwealth stock, and their position cannot be compared with that of the suffering and hungry iu Australia. Many Australians are homeless to-day, and they plead with mo to induce the callous Commonwealth Government to issue blankets to them; but they arc told by t^ie Government to make application to the charitable institutions. Many persons in my electorate have approached the Salvation Army authorities, but they have not received even a boot lace. If the Government had a proper regard for the interests of the people they would distribute all available military stores of clo'thing, instead of hoarding it up and allowing it to be destroyed by silver fish and other vermin. Large numbers of people are called upon to face the rigors of winter improperly clad, aud without sufficient nourishment. The Government should honour the promise given by it at the last election that, if it was returned to power, everybody would have a job at good wages. Shortly, the Government is sending an aiimy of Ministers aud officials to Ottawa, and the right honourable. member for Flinders will not be in Australia to face the turmoil that is likely to occur over this legislation. I may say that I am totally opposed to civil conflict of any description, and J have no wish to see anything in the form of insurrection ; but when people are hungry they know no law, and the danger is that they may take the law into their own hands. If .they do, God knows what will happen. 1 urge the Government not to pursue further their present vindictive jjolicy, which is purely of a political character, and aimed at the Premier of New South Wales. ducing this bill, the Government is continuing its spectacular duel with the Government of New South Wales. The measure will serve to intensify the severity of the conflict between them, irrespective of and careless of the interests of those who may bo injured in the struggle. Three months ago the members of the Labour party stressed the fact that there was already legislation on the statute-book by which the New South Wales Government could be made to meet its obligations. We urged that that Government should be dealt with on the lines laid down by the last Commonwealth Government; but the present Government would not accept advice from the Opposition. During the last election, members of the party opposite boasted that Mr Lang would bo out of power within a fortnight. The present legislation has been accompanied by the lack of success which was prophesied by the Opposition. The sum owing by New South Wales to the Commonwealth when this legislation was first brought down was in the vicinity of £1,000,000, and the debt now amounts to over £2,750,000.",25,Second Reading

It is almost five months since the election, and more thau two -months since the first so-called Financial out that Mr Lang might stop the trains Agreements Enforcement Act was passed; yet we find ourselves slipping further and further into arrears in our accounts with New South Wales. The Prime Minister said to-day that, but for party consideranot help Un Commonwealth very much. tions, the case for the Commonwealth Government was unanswerable. I believe that the Government is pursuing its present policy largely for party reasons, hoping to gain some political advantage. Strength is lent to this, suggestion by the of meeting, if the Constitution permits, action of tbe Government in inviting the Leader of the New South Wales Opposition to Canberrai n order to consult with it. however, is defeating its own purpose, because everything it is doing is merely enhancing the prestige of the Premier of New South Wales. As we on this side of the House pointed out some time ago, the Commonwealth Government has now placed Mr Langi n a position in which he can pose before the people of New South Wales as an object of persecution. As a result, he is exciting much sympathy, and is able to hold monster meetings of his supporters in Sydney. The Pederal Labour party does not support Mr Lang or his policy, but we do not favour making a martyr of him, which is all the Commonwealth Govern-, ment has succeeded in doing up to date. That, and the further unpaid bill of £1,750,000 due by New South Wales, is the net result of this clumsy policy. The Government's latest proposal is to attach the railway revenue of New South Wales. The Prime Minister said that the Government's intention was not to take the revenue required for discharging working expenses, but only that portion which represents a surplus over working expenses, and which should be 'Clause9 of the bill provides that if a devoted towards the payment of interest Minister of a State, or a member of a charges.

Moreover, some means of transport must befound for bringing to Canberra foodstuffs and other necessary commodities. The Government displays a childlike f a it h in Mr Langi f it believes that he must necessarily keep the railways in operation, if it leaves him just sufficient revenue to pay working expenses. Though this bill now before us, the third of its kind, consists of nine clauses, the Government's main reason in introducing it , I believe, is to have enacted the provisions contained in clause 9. This clause amends section 21 of the principal act, sub-section 3 of which is as follows:The punishment for an offence against this act shall be as follows:(a) If the offence is prosecuted summarilya fine not exceeding One hundred pounds or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both; or (6) If the offence is prosecuted upon indictmenta fine not exceeding Five hundred pounds or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both.",26,Second Reading

If the offence is prosecuted upon indictment, the punishment is to be, in the case of a Minister of a State, or a member of a proclaimed public authority, a fine not exceeding £1,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, or both; or, in the case of a corporation, a fine not exceeding £2,000. This amendment is simply a gesture by the Government, inteuded to frighten members of the Government of New South Wales. Under the amendment, persons may become liable to these drastic punishments, not necessarily for any offensive measure against the law, but, merely for disobeying in any particular, however slight, instructions issued under the act. Of course, except in unusual circumstances, no court would impose the maximum penalty, so that the amendment is not really of much value, and is merely another instance of the Government's bluffing. An honourable member asked by way of interjection what course I would suggest should he followed. I have already said that this Government should follow the policy of the last Government. It is not yet too late to draw back; it, is often a bigger thing to retrace our steps when we have gone off the right track, than uot to have strayed at all. If the Government is big enough to realize into what, a morass it is leading the Commonwealth there is yet time to retrace its steps. Thomas Paine has said that "" Time makes more converts than reason."" Time will bring to the same way of thinking as ourselves many honourable members opposite whom we have failed to convince by our arguments. Needless to say I am opposed to this bill, as I have been to all previous instalments of this legislation. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), when introducing the measure, said that it was designed to strengthen the hands of the Government. If I remember rightly, a similar measure was introduced lust week, for the purpose of strengthening the hands of the Government. I suggest that, before very long, the Government may need something to strengthen its tottering knees, because it is obviously meeting with very little success in its endeavours to enforce this legislation. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) also opposed the bill, but. he did so, i think, merely because ho was Leader of the Opposition. He had no other reason that 1 could discover from the remarks he has made. The fact is that, had he been. Leader of the Government, he would probably have been forced into much the same position as the Government is in now, or he would have had to take his stand behind the Premier of New South Wales in support of what, is the only policy that will get Australia out of its difficulties. I , and those honourable members associated with me, make no apologies for our opposition to the bill. We support the policy of the Government of New South Wales, and it is interesting to observe that, while the official Opposition in this Parliament verbally opposes this enforcement legislation, it is generally found supporting the Government when it comes to a real show-down on economic issues. As a matter of fact, there is very little difference between the financial policy of the Scullin party and that of the Government. Much was made by the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) of the failure of the Government of New South Wales lo pay interest ou its internal debts. I remind honourable members, however, that there was no default in respect of such payments until the Commonwealth sought to put into effect, its enforcement legislation. It was because the Commonwealth Government realized just what was the financial position of the Government of New Soutli Wales that this legislation was introduced in the first place. The Loan Council had refused loan moneys to the Government of New South Wales. The Federal Government had ceased its monthly payments to that State, and the Lang Government was entirely dependent upon its local taxation resources. This Government has caused the State Government considerable embarrassment in the collection of taxes, so there is nothing remarkable in the fact that it has been forced to default to local bondholders. Under previous legislation",27,Second Reading

It is worth mentioning that the taxation papers handed over related mainly to wealthy tax-dodgers who usually support the United Australia party, and if the Commonwealth Government wishes to use those documents and recover it will have to sue some of its own supporters. said that he is not responsible for the non-payment of mother endowment and pensions in New South Wales, but surely he knows that those payments are made through the banks. through the banks. because neither the banks nor the business Conference there should be a large surplus men of New South Wales w ill cash available for meeting interest payments. mother endowment cheques.

Mi'. ROSEVEAR,I understand tliat last Saturday night the honourable member met some members of the local underworld. It has been said that the Premier of New South Wales was a party to the conversion loan. That is true, and he has met his interest payments in respect of that loan. He was prepared to take even more drastic action in respect to interest rates than that proposed by the other State Premiers. It cannot be denied that only since the introduction of this legislation has Mr Lang failed to meet local interest commitments. When New South Wales originally defaulted to the extent of £900,000, Mr Lang made it known to the Loan Council that he had £400,000 in hand. At that time the Loan Council and the Commonwealth Bank said that they could not provide the other £500,000, but strangely enough, when Mr less enthusiasm than -there was when the Lang defaulted, those institutions were able to provide the full amount outstanding. I say deliberately that the Loan. Council and the Commonwealth Bank Board were used for political purposes for no otlier reason than that, the Government, criticize the policy of Mr Lang. of New South Wales had set out on a policy of interest reduction. Their combined action has been responsible for the degrading position in which we find ourselves to-day. The Government, of New South Wales had to withstand attacks, not. only by this Government, but also by the so-called Labour governments of South Australia and Victoria. The supporters of the Government may blame Mr Lang as much as they like for the present position, but the fact remains that sooner or later every and the ability of the State Government to otlier State will be in a position similar to that of New South Wales.' Wales is pushing the other States to that position. excuse. If the supporters of the Government could not blame Jack Lang they would blame Billy Blackfellow. At one time an -undertaker's delegate at a conference put forward certain views which did not suit his fellow delegates, and when met with opposition he said, "" I do not care how you talk or vote, you will have to come my way at the finish"". I am confident that no matter how the supporters of the Government talk or vote, they will have to go Mr Lang's.way at the finish. The day will come when honourable members will be forced to admit that the Premier of New South Wales has taken up the correct attitude, and when that day does arrive the only thing which I fear is that some of them will be killed in the scramble to'get to the front to proclaim that they themselves were the originators of the Lang plan. To-day they are prepared to follow slavishly the policy of this Government.

[5.4] I rise to make a suggestion which may prove helpful. No decent Australian citizen can feel pride or satisfaction in regard to the existing conflict between the Commonwealth and New South Wales. This internecine warfare is a .tragedy over which none can gloat and which every decent citizen must regret. The people outside expect their representatives in Parliament to seek a solution of the problem by a frank exchange of views. My experience of many large industrial troubles during the last twenty years has laught me that while the parties are endeavouring to beat each other to the ground, the community, as a whole, is suffering losses whicli soon amount to millions of pounds. In the present dispute, both parties have burned their boats, and while they continue the fight, each in the hope of achieving a definite victory, hundreds of thousands of innocent people are suffering hardship and travail, and Australia is losing vast revenues. Last year the financial difficulties of the Commonwealth and the States led to the adoption of a rehabilitation plan which imposed sacrifices on all sections of the people. Prior to the adoption of the plan, experts whose assistance the various governments had sought, reported, after much investigation and deliberation that, the balancing of budget's was an esseutial preliminary to economic rehabilitation. I suppose that 75 per cent, or SO per cent, of the plan has been loyally implemented by both Commonwealth and State Governments, but their financial difficulties have continued; budgets have not been balanced. Again the experts were called together only a few weeks ago, and they made a significant report which, in part, contradicted their previous recommendation. Apparently, even experts can learn from experience, for they have now come to the conclusion that whilst the balancing of budgets is essential, and an ultimate objective to be kept constantly in view, it can be achieved only after a revival of industry. Budgets cannot be balanced this year or next year. The aggregate deficit, of the Commonwealth and States this year is likely to be upwards of £20,000,000, and even if the people continue to make sacrifices, that amount cannot be reduced below about £12,000,000 next, year. Whilst practising economy with a view to the ultimate balancing of budgets, we must resort to the measures adopted in the United Kingdom, and suggested in this Parliament many months ago to encourage a revival of industry. Obviously, while the present conflict between the Commonwealth and the largest State continues, the prospect of balancing budgets becomes more and more remote; every day the treasuries are losing hundreds of thousands of pounds as a direct consequence of this quarrel. When the fight, is over, what will be our position ? Even though the Commonwealth should succeed in reducing the Government of New South Wales to submission, we shall be hopelessly in the financial mire. How will it be possible for governments to make up their leeway ? I do not attempt to apportion the blame for the present trouble; a disastrous conflict is in progress, and instead of indulging in personalities, and being influenced by bigoted objections to individuals and parties, we should co-operate to effect, a settlement, I have been engaged in many big industrial disputes, and, with the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Bruce), have sat at the council table seeking a solution. We knew that every day the dispute lasted scores of innocent people suffered and many thousands of pounds were lost to the community.

160,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"say that I would never yield this or that. I always tried to leave a middle course open, so that when at the psychological moment a compromise was possible I could accept it. Nine times out of ten a solution was found, not by the jungle method of beating each other to the dust, but through the temperate exchange of views, evolving a formula acceptable to both parties. The dispute between the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales is of much greater magnitude than any industrial strike or lockout; but, nevertheless, the principle of arbitration is applicable to it. It is foolish of either government to believe that in the end its opponent will be beaten to the ground; that sort of restilt cannot be achieved. Compromise is inevitable. Sooner or later the wise counsellors of both Governments will ask a group of independent, experienced, and expert men, who enjoy the confidence of the majority of the people, to devise a formula for the repayment of the obligations of New South Wales to the Commonwealth over a period of years. Some arrangement for time-payment will have to be made; the Commonwealth cannot expect to recover the whole of the' arrears settlement, of the dispute between the at once. Every round of this fight means a loss to both contestants, and, indeed, to New South Wales than that which is the whole of the Australian people, and when the struggle ends how will the governments concerned be able to balance their budgets? Whence will New South Wales obtain the funds to repay the interest which the State Government says it cannot now pay, and which the Commonwealth is paying on its behalf? Because of our experience in connection with the Premiers plan, and of our futile efforts to balance our budget, we should abandon this conflict, and hand over the problem to persons dissociated from the contesting parties.

The heated exchanges that have taken place in this House indicate that the political bias of those concerned, makes reconciliation between those honourable members impracticable. This conflict is so far reaching in its effect, and! imposes so much unnecessary travail upon the people of Australia, that this Government and the Government of New South Wales should be big enough to endeavour to evolve some sane, modern system of arbitration to settle the dispute. In my opinion, it cannot be settled satisfactorily in any other .way. If the conflict continues in the hope that one side will beat the other to the dust, there can be no hope of balancing our budgets for many years to come. I repeat, the time has arrived when we should try to find some unbiased tribunal that willendeavour to settle this dispute through the medium of some sane basis of arbitration. ing the course of this debate, we have heard three most striking speeches from honourable members opposite, all urging that there should be some other ultimate Commonwealth and the Government of being sought by means of the Enforcement Act, an amendment of which is now under our consideration.

The fact remains that the best opinion that this Government was able to obtain, and that those members of the legal profession who are advising it were able to give, was that the procedure of the High Court presents many difficulties. The possibilities of delay are great, and there is no certainty of arriving, within a reasonable time, at the sane conclusions so much desired by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway). It was therefore decided by this Government, with the full support of honourable members on this side and of the Country party, to propose a more rapid method of procedure. Avowedly, when the Financial Agreements Enforcement Bill was introduced, it in no way altered the rights of either party; it merely substituted one method of enforcing those rights for another. If honourable members opposite wish now to convince tlie House that that measure has been a failure, it is for them to show that it is not leading speedily and satisfactorily to a vindication due to the Commonwealth, and nothing of the rights which the Commonwealth Government unquestionably possesses, and which the Leader of the Opposition admits. member claim that the measure is operating speedily and satisfactorily? honourable gentleman ordinary course of litigation and, after the lapse of several months, thought it desirable 'to effect a settlement. pended to enable the Premiers to meet an independent tribunal. include Commonwealth taxation?

The two amending bills which have been introduced are the fruits of such experience, and close certain gaps in the net which were, of course, not foreseen, and have been discovered only by trial and error. Nothing will be lost of the income tax finally will be lost of the income tax actually due to the . State of New South Wales, which has not been collected, because of the disthe honourable honest attempt of the Government of that State to defraud the Commonwealth of that to which it is legally entitled.

Considering those difficulties and the experimental nature of this legislation, it is amazing that iu the first six weeks of the operalid u of the act the Commonwealth Government has succeeded in getting into its coffers almost half a million pounds that have been wrongfully withheld by the State of New South Wales. Nothing like that was achieved by the Government which the present Leader of the Opposition had the honour to lead. To the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Sdullin) the Premier of New South Wales( Mr Lang), in Micawber-like fashion, gave in effect an I 0 U, which drew the remark, "" Thank God, that's settled "". Government do more than issue the equivalent of a promissory note to meet its obligations? difference between a State which undertakes to meet its obligations and one which repudiates its commitments, and there is a very great difference between getting a valueless I 0 TJ and getting £440,000 of real money. I beg the Leader of the Opposition not to imagine for a moment that I am in any way directing my remarks to an attack upon him, because I fully appreciate his attitude; I am for the moment engaged in endeavouring to cheer him and to inspire him with confidence that, in our endeavours to solve this problem, we are really following a better track than any hitherto discovered. With the object of imparting more animation to the thoughts of those who are disposed to pessimism, I shall refer to a difference between the Leader of the Opposition and myself on the floor of time ago. The right honourable gentleman said when the original enforcement, bill was before the House that it would be possible by legal chicanery and attacks in the High Court on the validity of the bill to delay to an almost indefinite degree the date when a conclusive judgment would be delivered by the High Court in relation to this neiVj und, as we thought, more expeditious procedure. I was bold enough as one who, although a new member of the House, had some acquaintance with the habits of the High Court, to say th»+ . JLid not think T that any attacks that could be made upon the validity of the measure would involve a delay of more than three weeks. I took the trouble the other day to read my reported observations on that subject. WhatI said was that it was possible that a week's argument and a fortnight's consideration of that argument by the justices of the High Court would be ample to permit the court to give a decision as to whether the legislation was or was not within the authority of section 105 A of the Constitution. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear), who, in view of the story he told us, will not be surprised when I describe his group as the party of undertakers, also doubted whether my prediction would be borne out by results. What is the situation now? The utmost efforts were made in the High Court to obtain a declaration that the Enforcement Act was invalid. One of the very ablest members of the New South Wales bar was retained by the State Government, and he had ample assistance and support. I am assured by legal gentlemen who were present at the hearing of the case that the most able and exhaustive arguments were submitted to the court with the object of proving that the act was invalid. The matter was considered for only a few days, and well within the limit of throe weeks the court had given a decision that the act was entirely within the authority which the people gave to this Parliament in the new grant of power under section 105 A.. I beg honourable members-on both sides of the House to realize that we are not spinning this legislation, out of our own bowels. It is not our own the House some little creation, it is the legislative interpretation of a grant of power given by referendum of the entire Commonwealth.

I had no desire to break that silence-. I felt that I can help the Government much more, in this time of stress, by being ready to give a loyal and silent vote than by constant speaking on the floor of the House; but, in the circumstances to-day, I have spoken for a few minutes only. I beg to assure the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear), that my sentiments are quite unaltered, and that my opinions are unchanged since I took part in the first debate in this chamber on this legislation. There is no remedy for the present evils until the stumbling block has been removed, and until the powers of the law have been asserted.

Although those practices may put off the evil day for a few weeks, or even a month, they will not, serve that Government indefinitely, because this Parliament, acting on behalf of the great majority of the electors of Australia, is determined ,to restore honesty, in government, and to sweep from its path all obstacles to the attainment of that purpose. test against the passage of this bill, and it will be impossible to foresee the end of E agree with that portion of the remarks the trouble.

Even the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), before he was placed in his present position, declared, ""This incubus must be removed.""

In order to keep such promises as those, members of the party opposite are prepared to pass this measure, irrespective of the suffering that it will undoubtedly inflict on the people of New South Wales. A certain member of the last Federal Ministry promised that he would open the coal mines in New South Wales within a fortnight if Labour were returned to power. When the last Government saw that that promise could not be fulfilled, it did not persevere in the matter; but the present Ministry, having promised to get rid of the Lang Government, is determined to see the matter through. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Stewart) remarked, by way of interjection, that, if trouble occurred among the railway men in New South Wales, the Commonwealth Government knew what it would do. Nobody, I suppose, is desirous of We must witnessing such trouble; but I well know that, in any conflict between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales Governments, the railway employees' would support the State Government. From the very outset this legislation has been prompted by political prejudices. On the day when this Parliament was opened, and when the presentleader of the United Australia party in New South Wales walked up the front steps of Parliament House with Mr Weaver, who is known in New South Wales as the rajah of Rothbury, I realized that they were expecting the Commonwealth Government to fulfil its promise to bring about the downfall of the Lang Government.

Tbat. statement is true of the introduction and operation of all the financial agreements The Government was compelled to embark on this course through the deliberate default of Mr Lang, and out of his obstruction of our' first measures has come the necessity for this further'bill for the attachment of New South Wales revenue. Certainly this measure contemplates an extensive widening of our powers, and it is calculated, we believe, gradually to improve the prospect of the Commonwealth Government recovering from the New South Wales Government theinterest which is now being paid on its behalf by the taxpayers of Australia. The extraordinary attitude of the Leader of the Opposition to the Laug Government was completely inconsistent and indefensible. As rhe Minister who brought the Premiers plan into operation, it is remarkable that he should say to-day that the present Government would not have embarked upon this course of legislation had it anticipated the troubles that it has encountered. He suggested further that this Government was going on with these proposals merely to save its face. He made a still move remarkable statement in suggesting that we should have year. Had we done that, we should haw heen following Mr Lang for ever, and he would have been showing us a clean pair of heels. His total default during the term of office of the last Government amounted to about £5,000,000, but what sum did the Scullin Government recover? It merely accepted from the Premier of New South Wales a number of I.O.U.'s, upon whicli he has now ceased to pay interest. That was the achievement of the Leader of the Opposition, who now criticizes what the present Government is doing. It may be suggested that we have not yet been successful with our legislation to deal with Mr Lang; but whereas the Government led by the right honourable gentleman collected not one penny of the debt of £5:000,000, this government has to date put its hands on about £440,000 of the total default of £2,700,000 which has submit that in view of the extraordinary obstacles we have met, and the novel enforcement legislation. class of legislation that has had to be passed, as well as the amazing person with whom we are dealing, that is a very good beginning. We anticipate quite confidently that, with the widening of our powers under this measure, our success from this time forward will be greater still. The Leader of the Opposition, despite his conflict with Mr Lang last year, still says that the Government should seek to solve this problem by going into conference with Mr Lang. The Government has had all the conferences it is prepared to hold with Mr Lang so long as he continues to tread his present path. We consider that he has dishonoured and disgraced everything that is decent in public life in Australia.

It is quite clear, therefore, where these trust moneys ber cares to come to me for specific went. If they have vanished, as they appear to have done, it is clear by whose act they have vanished. If these unfortuhas, within the last eighteen months or two nate people have been robbed, there can be no doubt who it is who has deliberately South Wales of several million pounds, robbed them. Beyond all doubt, they have been robbed by this boastful friend of the a great stimulus to the industrial and women and children and pensioners of New South Wales. They have, in short, been robbed by Mr Lang. I trust that, in this House at least, we shall have no more of these gross misrepresentations. Throughout this debate we have heard a great deal of Mr Lang as the friend of the workers in New South Wales, and the upholder of the wage standard. Today, the Government of New South Wales, led by Mr Lang, is, by his deliberate act in a state of bankruptcy. It is with a State as with au individual. When an individual becomes bankrupt, when his credit is gone and he cannot meet his obligations, he ceases to be of any use as an employer to any sort of worker. So it is with the State of New South Wales. The deadliest blow that could have been struck against the workers of New South Wales was delivered hy Mr Lang when he smashed the credit of that State, when he failed to meet his obligations, and rendered his Government bankrupt. In that chain of events we have the reason why New South Wales, the greatest, and incomparably the richest of all the States of the Commonwealth in normal times, is to-day the poorest; and why in New South Wales, at the present time, there is the greatest percentage of unemployment, not even excepting the relatively poor State of South Australia. Moreover, unemployment is increasing in New South Wales more rapidly than in any other State. This is due solely to the policy of the present Premier of New South Wales, the alleged friend of the workers. As Minister for Customs, I am in a position to learn certain things about industry which are, perhaps, unknown to most other persons.

Question so resolved in tlie affirmative. Clause agreed to. Clause5 (Payments during currency -of proclamation). 'This clause seeks to make the New South Wales public servants pawns in the dispute between the Commonwealth and the State Government. Some of them have :had many years of service, and are .approaching the retiring age, when they will be entitled to superannuation, and they are to be offered the alternative of -carrying out the instructions of the Government which employs them, and has power to dismiss them, or taking orders from the Commonwealth Treasurer, to whom they owe no allegiance. If governments choose to fight, they should be allowed to settle their differences in the courts or elsewhere, but they have no right to draw innocent public servants into the dispute under threats of penalties. Our opposition to the, clause may be unavailing, but we shall register our protest against it, and, by dividing the committee, compel other honourable members to show where they stand. purpose of the clause is to enable the Commonwealth Government, when it cannot, recover from the head of a State department moneys belonging to the State, to apply compulsion to any lesser officer or group of officers who may be handling such moneys. group of a dozen officers there may be one sympathizer with the present Commonwealth Government-a n Eric Campbell or a "" de Goat"" who would readily obey the instructions of the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce). A man may be merely a clerical assistant; but, if moneys belonging to the State Government pass through his hands, he will be required by this clause to hand them over to the Commonwealth. That is going too far. Apparently an officer is not to hand the money to his superior who directs him, and to whom he is responsible. I am astonished at the audacity of the Riordan, D. proposal.; it is bound to create a good Rosevear, J. S. deal of discontent in the New South Watkins, D. Wales Public Service. The Commonwealth Government has nbt been able to Gander, J. H. missioner, to do its bidding; but it hopes Riley, E. C. that it may find one of his officers more complacent. If the Commonwealth should be unable to get the revenue of the New South Wales railways from Mr Goode, it may be able to acquire it through one of his officers under threat of prosecution. member indicate how these moneys can be collected without putting this method into operation?

I submit that the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) is guilty of deliberate obstruction. there is any obstruction, it comes rather from honourable members who are interjecting so freely. merely tightens up the principal act. This is something like a game of chess. The Federal Government makes a move to attach the revenues of the State Government of New South Wales,, and, when Mr Lang makes an effective counter move, members of the Government come back to Parliament worried and gnashing their teeth, angry to think that this man has once more thwarted their endeavours. The Government will be back again next week with another amending bill, until it is finally checkmated by Mr Lang. I have suggested a way in which the Possibly in a struggle could be shortened, by the two . principals fighting out the matter in the stadium. That would be preferable to inflicting hardship upon the unfortunate people of New South Wales. We are wasting time in discussing a bill ""that will prove futile. Instead, we should proceed with legislation to relieve unemployment, a problem that this Government was specifically elected to solve. and Treasurer) [8.33] -Honorabl e members opposite have no real grounds on",39,Second Reading

Provision already exists that State officers may be asked to act on behalf of the Commonwealth Government to collect revenue from State sources. This merely tightens up the act. If there is anything in the argument that has been advanced by honourable members opposite, it is that some public servants may be compelled to hand over revenue, under the direction of the Commonwealth, while others will be free to do what they like. Actually, there is no intention on the part of the Commonwealth Government to use these officers as pawns in the game, as has been claimed by .the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear). The Government merely asks that they shall obey the law of the country, the validity of which has been proved in the High Court, despite the 'fact that the Government of New South Wales directed the strongest force of constitutional argument against it.

The Commonwealth claimed that the State had no right to any set-off or that any cross action could be brought in regard to the declaration of the High Court as to the amount due by the State. The State Government claimed that it had a set-off. The High Court unanimously decided that the Commonwealth had the right to enforce its claim to the last penny; as a matter of fact, to an extent which exceeded by a couple of hundred pounds the amount specified by the Commonwealth Government. This Government merely asks now that the officers of the State Government of New South Wales, as well as corporations and Ministers of the Crown, shall be required to obey the law, and to carry out the regulations made in pursuance of it. am greatly pleased that it is not the pared to do so there is plenty of room Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) that the on the dole list. honourable member for Hunter( Mr .Tames) seeks to match with Mr Lang in a boxing contest, because he is the finest that was stated in the circular. side-stepper that I know.

The State finds the money to pay its servants, and it has a right to expect, loyal co-operation from them.

In my opinion the Government is side-stepping the issue. Would there be any justice in dealing with a railway porter because he failed to hand to the Commonwealth Treasurer any money that he might collect, seeing that he is working under regulations which make it necessary for him to pay all moneys which he receives to the State Government? Why should \\r drag the lower-paid public servants in 10 the fight which is being waged between two political parties? would honourable members opposite say if the position was reversed somewhat, and Mr Lang caused the messengers in this House to be arrested, because they would net hand over to him the O.S. stamps in their possession ? This Government boasted that it would do certain things, and now that it finds that it cannot do tbi-m as easily as it thought it could, it is seeking to penalize the most poorlypaid class of public servants. The provisions of this clause are vindictive. It appears to me that the Government is engaging in a sham fight. When the Financial Agreements Enforcement Bill was first introduced I asked the Prime Minister how he proposed to collect the State revenue which he intended to attach, and he said that it could be done . easily. I was held up to ridicule for my remarks, but the Government is finding out that there was some justification for what T said. It is deplorable that 30 per c**nt. of the people of Now South Wales should be allowed to starve while this Government proposes that a railway porter should be summoned for the recovery of revenue. It has been said that if Mr Lang would pay his debts the depression in New South Wales would betrin to lift; but there is very little jusvernment is protected under this legislation tification for the remark so far as we can gee. Apparently the Government intends to begin with such public servants as, say, a woman railway gatekeeper at a country 5s. or 10s. a month. Mr Riordan. is passed, and such a woman refused to pay the money she collected to the Commonwealth, she would be guilty of an offence against the law. But if, on the other hand, she paid it to the Commonwealth, and so did not pay it to the State, she would be equally guilty cf an offence against the law,, and would also lose her job. The Minister for Customs, in his speech this afternoon, suggested that the Leader of the Opposition would be pleased if the State railway service were dislocated. That was a miserable statement to make. orable member may not refer in that way to the debate that occurred in the House What this afternoon. In any case, the statement to which he has directed attention was withdrawn. has found'such great difficulty in collecting State inconie taxation, I think it will find very much greater difficulty in collecting State railway revenue. Totalizator revenue was attached, but the totalizator ceased to function, and that revenue was lost to the State. Then the revenue of the State Taxation Department was attached, and immediately that revenue was lost to the New South Wales and to the Commonwealth Governments. As soon as a particular class of revenue is attached, the State Government forestalls the Commonwealth Government by re-fraining from collecting it, or by refusing to allow its servants to act on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. A man cannot serve two masters, and, therefore, 0 the State servants, together with the taxpayers of New South Wales, should not be left in doubt as to their position.

If the Government is so anxious to observe the law, why is it taking this action to indemnify itself against the consequences of illegally seizing the money of depositors? The Commonwealth should be content to attach moneys covered by the resolutions passed through Parliament. I have no doubt that this clause w i ll be agreed to, because the supporters of the Government w ill vote for it as slavishly as they have voted for all the other provisions .of the enforcement legislation. afternoon, during question time, I referred to this matter of trust funds, and .to the communications which have passed between Mr O'Sullivan, general secretary of tbe Public Service Association of New South Wales, and the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons). According to a press report, Mr O'Sullivan forwarded the following telegram to the Prime Minister on the 15th A p r i l : Under Enforcement Act. bank accounts of State Superannuation Board have been attached. effect on pensioners dependent on superannuation payments, and urges that these funds be exempted immediately.

It is probable that the New South Wales Government will not make any payments into the banks in respect of widows' pensions, child endowment, & c , for fear that the money will be attached by the Commonwealth. Much has been said regarding the alleged failure of Mr Lang to pay pensions and child endowment.

If the deposits happen to belong to a trade union, is it. likely that the Treasurer would release them? I do not think so.

The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) is afraid that discrimination w ill be shown between the claims ofone individual and another.

Once more the Prime Minister has adroitly sidestepped the L ue. The fact 3 remains that the moneys! wi.ich form the subject of this amending clause were never specified in the proclamation as being liable to attachment. When the first' enforcement bill was before the House, the fear Avas expressed that moneys member makes a bad politician. might be seized which belonged, not to the State Government, but to individual depositors. The Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) pointed out that moneys were from time to time deposited by contractors with government departments as a guarantee of good faith. These moneys, he said, might be seized if the Commonwealth attached bank deposits standing to the name of the State Government. The Prime Minister assured him that such a thing could not occur. We now find that it has occurred, and moneys have been seized which never were the property of the State Government, and were not covered by the resolutions passed through Parliament. The proposed amendment provides a loophole for the Commonwealth Government to escape legal-liability for seizing moneys to which it had no claim. No object is served by honourable members opposite talking about superannuation and other funds. The moneys with which we are now concerned are those deposited hy persons as a guarantee for the supply of goods, the performance of services, or the carrying out of works. Why should there be any need to allow discretion in this matter to the Commonwealth Treasurer? The Prime Minister now states that these moneys will be returned when it is ascertained that the Government is not entitled to retain them. have forfeited his deposit. with supposition. deposits lodged by contractors with the State Government in New South Wales as a guarantee of good faith were seized by the Commonwealth, and up to date the Pederal Treasurer has not ascertained whether those deposits belong to the State Government. Probably some months will elapse before that information is obtained. In the meantime, the contractor is faced with a temporary loss of deposits that should have been returned to him immediately his contract with the State Government was completed. It is doubtful whether the Commonwealth is legally entitled to hold such deposits. would make a good lawyer. The Prime Minister is not dealing fairly with contractors who have lodged deposits with the State Government. The supporters of the Government have referred a good deal to our solemn obligation to carry out certain contracts. There is a solemn obligation on the part of the State Government to refund deposits lodged with it by contractors, but it is not able to carry out that obligation because the Commonwealth Government has seized those deposits, and they will not be recoverable until such time as the Federal Treasurer ascertains whether the contractor is entitled to them, and even then only at the discretion of the Treasurer. When the previous legislation was being discussed, Government supporters were lulled into a sense of false security by the assurance of the Prime Minister that such things as the wrongful seizure of deposits lodged by contractors with the State Government would not happen. These things have happened, and it is for the Government supporters to ensure that they will not happen in the future. Prime Minister prepared to accept an amendment to omit from the clause the words "" if he thinks f it "" ? That tlie words "" if he thinks fit"" be am itted. contractor may I have already stated that the clause as it stands places too much discrimination in the hands of the Commonwealth TreaSome weeks ago surer, and if my amendment is accepted he will be specifically instructed to deal with moneys held by banks on behalf of the State in the prescribed manner.

This provision is more tyrannical than previous clauses in its effect upon a State employee, because while they may have forced him to act disloyally to his employer, and, as a result, receive his dismissal this provision empowers the Treasurer or an authorized person to require a State employee under a threat of ment to answer questions or to produce documents. Treasurer or an authorized person is to be empowered to submit a State employee to the "" third degree."" No police officer in New South Wales has the right to cross examine even the worse criminal in respect of his actions. Every civilized community has disapproved of the third degree, yet it is to be permitted under this legislation so that the Com-, rnonwealth Government may more .. .. .. 40 readily undertake the seizure of the .. .. 15 revenues of New South Wales.
