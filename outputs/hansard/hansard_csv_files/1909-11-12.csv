0,"Ftjouse Of 'Ftrprrsentatibcs.dealing Friday, 12 November, A.m., Ancl Read Prayers. Prime Minister Noticed The Statement In This Morning's Age That The Representatives Of The Trusts, Rings, And Coal Combines Have Refused To Meet The Men In Open Conference To Settle The Strike? In View Ot :He Fact That The Railways Are Owned By The States, And That, By Virtue Of The Interlocking Of The Directorates Of The States And The Com","monwealth, we are now one people; that the strike may cause a universal strike throughout Australia, interfering with industry, trade, and commerce; that already the various corporations and companies that have been carrying our mails have demanded a reduction in the service, and that it will be found necessary to reduce the train seivice, too, which will cause general interference with the business of the people and stagnation ber is going beyond the limits of a question. Prime Minister whether, under the law of eminent domain to which President Roosevelt referred when he threatened to operate the Pennsylvania mines, the Commonwealth has power to operate the coal mines of New South Walesi f those who hold them refuse to settle the strike? domain is discussed in a number of volumes of intricate legal argument. It is certain that the position of this Government is not that of the President and Government of the United States of America; but I will not follow the honourable member further into the remote recesses of this exthe last three weeks, but at present the tremely erudite subject. Prime Minister is somewhat light, but I am sure that honourable members generally regard the question as a very important one, because the position is becoming extremely serious. only about fifty or sixty men at the bottom of the trouble, I think that the Prime Minister might devise some method for with it. I ask him if he will not take the matter into consideration? igog. Will he not attempt to make some arrangement with the colliery proprietors himself? Let us take a hand in the matter, acquiring some of these mines, and working them with the labour which is available. COAL MINERS' give a light answer to the question of the honourable member for Darwin, put without notice. It seemed sufficient to remind him that the law of eminent domain in the United Slates, Hmutrh a cardinal principle of legislation there, Joes not appiy here to the same extent. In the first place, jurisdiction over land and mines rests, not with the Commonwealth, but with the States, and in the second place, all land vests in the Crown. Into intricate issues one cannot enter by way of reply. Every man and woman in the community views with the greatest apprehension and concern the present condition of industrial affairs, but, in such circumstances, and at certain stages, the less said the better. Prime Minister think that he should ask the country to give him the power which he says we have not got? industrial organization of the Commonwealth is one of the gravest tasks before us. We are proposing a step which, although comparatively short, should ensure harmony betwen the different local jurisdictions. the Prime Minister refers the passing of the Inter-State Commission Bill, which is at present in another place? If so, I ask whether it is not a fact that that Bill has not been proceeded with during the last three weeks, and that the Senate did not devote more than fen hours to Government business last week? mission Bill is in another place, and has, I think, been under consideration within Defence Bill is the chief measure. Minister aware that the law of eminent domain which applies in the United States is taken from the law of England; that the King of England never gives up his rights Seeing that there are in the land; that all property in land rests in the Crown; and that the people can always resume it?",14,Setup

The Minister has agreed to this temporarily. The Oonah makes two trips weekly between Melbourne and Burnie, and the Union Company hns asked for leave to reduce these to one.

(FINANCE) BILL. That this B ill be now read a third time. Mr W. H . IRVINE (Flinders) [10.40]. I think it is necessary, after what has taken place, to make a statement as to my position in regard to the third reading of the Bill. At a very early stage, when the matter first came up, I felt, as I think many others on this side did, that a position of great difficulty had been created for us, as members of a newly-formed party, which we were desirous of supporting and continuing in power, by the making of an agreement with the Premiers which we were unable to accept. I am not going to say anything now to vindicate or justify my action. I shall merely state what it was. T conveyed to the other members of the party the The statement that if , after full consideration -thi s was a promise voluntarily given by me, and was not sought voluntary. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Yes. It was an indication that if we were afforded an opportunity in Committee to take the sense of honourable members on the agreement, I , for one-and I spoke for myself onlywould, if the vote went against us, not take advantage of the statutory provision requiring an absolute majority, and would vote for the third reading of the measure. yesterday that he doubted whether the",14,Newcastle Strike Inter Stat E Commission Bill

May I be permitted to take this opportunity to say a word or two to my friends on this side of the Chamber? It is inevitable that in debates like those of the last week or two expressions will be used which would not otherwise be heard. I bear no feeling for what has been said. I do not regard outside criticism a jot, but I care very strongly about criticism upon myself and my friends uttered in this Chamber by members of the party to which we belong. them to consider that, after all, a majority is not always right, although a large majority of one party thinking one thing:, and finding a small minority of the same party opposed to them, are very apt to consider that that small minority are actuated by obstinacv, and that sometimes in the heat of conflict, they may be actuated by motives of an unworthy character. would ask those honourable members to consider that if it had been mv intention to create anv difficulty in this party nothing would have been easier for me than to vote against the third reading. hope that there mav be found some way before the next general election of preventing this difference of opinion in the newlv-formed Fusion party from continuing. than the agreement 1 Mr W.

At present it seems to me inevitable that, unless between this time and the time of the election some modus vhiendi is found-unles s there is some alteration of the present position-eithe r we who are opposed to this agreement must absolutely sink our own views, which I , for one, would not think of doing so long as I remain in public life, or else we shall find ourselves on the platform taking up aposition which in the public mind would be with great difhcultv distinguished from one of actual opposition to the existing Government. In theory, of course, the whole purpose of a referendum, as I understand I would ask it, is to dissociate the determination by the people of any particular question from such party issues as may be involved. There may be many cases in which that may be done-case s in which a referendum that will have that effect mav be taken.

While I am not prepared to do that, I am certainly not prepared to mitigate or recede from my position of open antagonism to this agreement as it stands. I think I might appeal not only to the Government and my colleagues on this side of the House, but even to the State authorities, whose influence in the matter has been -so great, to consider, not my position alone, but the position of all those Who have the same feelings as myself about the matter, and not to press it too far at the present stage-no t to force us individually ' into what, to any man who thinks as I do about the question, is an intolerable .position. .member suggest? Mr W. H . IRVINE and what I hope will be brought about, is 'that the Premiers, who are rigidly holding the Prime Minister to a position which he has, I think, too chivalrously given in to, and who are insisting upon the rigour of their bond, should to some extent mitigate that attitude, so as to prevent the position of some of us from becorning in the circumstances politically intolerable.. This coming struggle is not a kind of game. We are not engaged in walking a minuet, but we shall be engaged, if we engage in it at all, in the most serious of conflicts upon the most serious issue that can possiblv come before us. I am sure the House has listened with careful attention to the statement of the honourable member for Flinders regarding his own position. I have also listened with some apprehension regarding his view of the main issue. I was glad to hear him say that he considered the referendum on this financial question as transcending in importance any individual difficulty that might arise regarding himself and his party. ""We are all happy to admit that the question is mire important than party. With regard to the honourable member's statement that he did not desire to be allied with the party which I have the honour to lead,I would say in all friendliness that he I am sorry that that conflict knows that no proposal for alliance of any kind has been made. Mr W. H . IRVINE I did not wish to I desire say anything that could be considered in the slightest degree offensive to that party. the honourable member spoke as though there was a proposal for alliance with this party on this question. We are often glad to co-operate on big questions with honourable members who are on general questions the most bitter antagonists of the party. And here let me say, in the presence of my colleagues, that this question is not a. party one, and that no member of this party has beeu persuaded to vote against the Government proposal.. Further, in case honourable members should be apprehensive on the matter, let me point out that no party, influence can be exercised in this case over the .members of this party, because the question is not a party one. It 'is not a platform question, and so it is not a question upon which the party can control its members. The honourable member for iFlinders settled t'he principle of this W h a t I suggest, proposal in two minutes, and spent the rest of his time in observations regarding his own party. That, of course, has nothing to do with the question. It is a matter between himself and his party, and I shall leave it at that, casting no reflection upon either, or on the manner in which they conduct their own affairs. The proposal now before the House has not been carried by an absolute majority of the House, although it is on .the notice-paper, and before the House now for its third reading. An absolute majority of the House is against it , and would vote against it were they able to be present. It is true that the Government were in a minority of one on one division in 'Committee, and in a majority of one on another division, and the honourable member for Flinders is pleased to call that a victory for the Government. If that is the view he takes of it, it is his affair and not mine. The point which we have to consider, and which I believe the electors will consider, if the question reaches them, is that this is a proposal on behalf of the Fusion Government, associated with the Governments of the States, for the Federation to surrender to the States powers that it possesses at the present time. The Prime Minister is the first man in his position who has declared to the electors that this Parliament is not competent to carry out",16,Third Reading

29,Mr Fisher,"I recognise that, but the functions' that have been delegated to it in the Constitution. That is what this proposal clearly and distinctly means. The honourable gentleman has used all his powers of persuasion, and all the power of the Government, to enable him to do this thing, and to do it at the request if not at the dictation, of people outside who should mind their own affairs. The hon otable member for Flinders expressed what a great number, of members, even on his own side, are thinking: that the Premiersof the States,, having got the Prime Minister into their Conference,, after he had safeguarded himself against entering intoan agreement of this, kind, were able to. persuade him that, by entering into such an arrangement, he would obtain, advantages that would more than compensate, him for the surrender of the opinions that he had previously expressed outside the Conference, both in writing and verbally. He went in, as he says himself, as a Federalist according to the present Constitution, and he came out having entirely surrendered the Federal position. He smiles, but he has admitted it. He saysnow that he had not fully made up his mind when he went into the Conference, but his letters to the Premier of New South VVales can be read only in one way. I do not propose to quote them again, because they have been quoted so often, but in them he pointed out that there was no necessity to incorporate any arrangement in the Constitution. ciated with him for all the years that Fedenot deny that he has altered his opinion ration has been in existence know that he poses as a great Federalist and a great supporter of the Constitution. surely ? orable member for New England tliat it will' be absolutely impossible after this event to look upon the Prime Minister as the protector and guardian' of the Constitution. tered into this agreement is an admission by him of the impotence or incompetence of. this Parliament to fully carry out the powers that it now possesses. It is a reflection on diis Parliament, and it is worse, render any Federal power in order to sebecause it is an admission on the part of the Government, and those who are going to vote for the measure, that this Parliament would be guilty of bad faith if the Constitutional powers that it now possesses were to continue. says that if we send, this question to the [208]2 country, a majority of the people and a majority of the States voting for it will determine whether it is to be adopted. The same thing would apply to a general election of members of this House. Members are elected to the House of Eepresentatives on the same franchise, and in every State now, except Tasmania, they practically represent an equal number of voters. The people could determine from election to election the basis_ on which they desired that the financial relations of the Commonwealth and States should be placed just as effectively as they could by providing for it in the Constitution in the way now proposed. Let us look for a moment at the other side. The Prime Minister has associated with him the whole of the State Treasurers, and, I believe, the State Governments. He expects their help, not only to carry the referendum in favour of this proposal, but to return all his candidates at the next general elections. view that they should not take an active part in the Federal election. wish. him harm if they did. would not, it is undoubtedly that influence which has caused the Prime Minister to Those who have been assoalter his opinion on this question. He canwithin the last three months. His written expressions are definite and distinct, and cannot be set aside. When he entered the Conference he had no intention of leaving it pledged to an alteration of the Constitution in the direction now proposed. Thatbeing so, those who object to the placing of this agreement in the Constitution know exactly what their position is. A party sitting as the Labour party are,in Opposition, might readily have said, "" This is not The very fact that he has enour business ; we shall let the Government do what they propose, and avail ourselves of the opportunity of being able, when before the electors, to scoff and jeer at the Government as men who would surcure a political advantage.""

The Commonwealth will still have the power to use the 25s. per head for the payment of*the interest on the debts; but the limitation in the new proposal, if the debts are taken over, will place the Commonwealth in the position of a mere agent, to credit and debit each particular State according to the money subscribed for each loan. I should be glad if the Government thought it worthwhile to further enlighten the House and the country on the question ; but I have no hope that they will any further consider the matter, and, therefore, we ought to take this opportunity to place our views on record. My idea was that there should be a National Council, if so desired, or that the Government for the time being, should have the administration of the whole of the debts, crediting each State with the revenue to which it was entitled. I was much impressed when the honourable member for Mernda unfolded his scheme for the nationalization of the debts. to-day, I think he would prove to be absolutely correct in saying that, although the large States would suffer for the time being, if the smaller States, with the exception of Tasmania, were to increase in population at a greater ratio, it would only be a matter of the twenty or twenty-five years when the -contributions towards the payment of the interest would be in equal proportion. which, I am sorry to say, was set aside by the Premiers, although some of them admitted that it ought to have been adopted. The Prime Minister knows my views, because, when the Labour party were supporting his Administration, I expressed to him and the honourable member for Hume my entire concurrencein the scheme; and he promised from time .to time to afford the House opportunities to discuss it. These opportunities did"" not arise, and we now have the result. Parliament has been gliding along, and permitting this great and important question to bs pushed aside by smaller matters, until we find ourselves not only in a political crisis, but in a finanin private, publishing nothing beyond the cial crisis, complicated with political issues -a most deplorable and unfortunate position for a National Parliament.

I brush aside everything of that kind, and simply ask, "" I s he not a man; and does he not. recognise the danger of his attitude in a situation like this ? "" Had he been a man of stern political thought and action, he would have said to the Premiers, "" Gentle; men, what do you want? Do you ask me, without time for full consideration, just after the formation of a new Government, representative of all parties, and when we have not had an opportunity to discuss the matter, to enter into an agreement that has never been seriously thought of or even suggested before ?'' He would have further asked, "" What is the meaning of this manoeuvre? Do you think that, for a little temporary advantage, I would sacrifice the best inIf the matter were investigated terests of the National Parliament?"" We can only surmise what the Premiers would have said had he taken up that attitude. They might have said to him, "" Well, Mr Deakin, if we cannot make an agreement with you, we shall not support y o u "" ; but if the Prime Minister had been anxious to protect the Commonwealth., he could easily have said to them, "" Notwithstanding what you say, I cannot accept That was a, great scheme, the proposal."" Andi f they had threatened him -with the withdrawal of their support, to whom could they have given it? Not to the Labour party, because we have laid down a scheme which declared absolutely that it was not to be incorporated in the Constitution. Therefore, the Prime Minister would have been at no political disadvantage had he espoused the National cause instead of what I call the parochial cause. But the thing has been, done; and', although I have previously referred to the matter, I should like to say a word as to the secrecy of the Conference. The Labour party is criticised because they hold their meetings resolutions arrived at. But that is a perfectly proper party attitude, which, I presume, the Fusion party will also adopt, discussing and endeavouring to adjust differences amongst themselves, so that, if possible, they may present a united, front",20,Third Reading

47,Mr Fisher,"I brush aside the maton questions of moment. But the Premiers' 'Conference was in a different position, composed as it was of representative men of the States and the Commonwealth. They were not gathered together, I understand, for political party purposes; if they were, they should have announced on the door, "" This is a new party caucus."" lic body or as a political party? puts the matter in a nutshell, and I take it that they were there as representatives of the Executives of the Commonwealth and the States, to discuss a matter of grave public concern. Every argument and reason advanced at that Conference would have assisted the electors in coming to a proper conclusion; but we have had none of that advice and guidance. Why? I do not suggest that the Prime Minister could have expressed his views any better in Conference than he can on the floor of the House; but what of the other members of the Conference? Should we not have expected from them reasons, so that we might know, for instance, whether they were apprehensive of the bad faith of this Parliament-whethe r they thought that, unless they had this agreement secured to them in the Constitution, this Parliament might determine to give them no revenue in the future? This may be the last opportunity we shall have of dealing with the Bill, and we ought to examine every phase of its history from its initiation to the present stage. What were the reasons of the Premiers for urging this agreement on the Prime Minister? The Prime Minister has told us that a little inducement to himself was that this Parliament would be entitled to ^600,000, six months prior to the expiration of the Braddon section. I do not think, however, that the Prime Minister exhas been studiously conversing with the -pected that reason to be very seriously entertained, because the temporary env barrassment of the Government is not, in for the proposal now before us. refuse to believe that the Prime Minister and Treasurer were seriously influenced by that convenience. If the Prime Minister was influenced by it, he is eminently unfitted for his position. To say that Ministers were influenced in accepting the -agreement by the possibility of obtaining a -temporary political advantage would be to make a most serious charge against them. I do not make that charge. I do not think that the advantage referred to was sufficient to weigh greatly with them. But as the honourable member for Gippsland has pointed out, it is one of those little baits which might tempt men to go further than they intended to go. tage. able member for Parkes referred to it in that way, saying that the Government were selling their rights for a mess of pottage, a temporary financial convenience. It would be contemptible to say that the Prime Minister and his colleagues were greatly influenced by that. I do not believe that they were. But I fear that they were influenced by other reasons. What they were the Prime Minister has .not told us. He says that the agreement will give the Commonwealth Parliament freedom to do as it pleases after the end of July, rgio. The honourable member for Mernda and I hold a different opinion. Will not the payment of 25s. per capita to the States prove embarrassing to the Commonwealth as population increase""? I think that it will. It will embarrass the Commonwealth finances and retard the national progress. But the agreement has more than a financial bearing. In my opinion, it will tend to dissipate the National sentiment. Yesterday the Prime Minister gravely misquoted mc in this matter.

But, supposing that later ithe Premiers came to the conclusion that in the interests of the people the possession of the power to pass industrial legislation should be taken from the Commonwealth Parliament, and we had a Prime Minister and Government as amenable to pressure as those who now occupy the Treasury bench, the result might be disastrous.

The alternative proposed by the Brisbane Labour Conference was much better than this, and I think the proposal made by the honourable member for Mernda was much better also, because both those proposals avoid fettering future majorities. objection to the Government's proposal cannot be got over. If the Bill is carried at the referendum, the fettering of future majorities is not a speculative, but a real, result, and that ought to be taken into account. I trust that the people ot the future will be allowed by the Prime Minister and the Premiers to have the same freedom as we have at the present time. It is presumptuous for us to think that we are wiser to-day than the people will be ten or fifteen years hence. people at the referendum may put this agreement into the Constitution by a majority, but do not forget that the majority of the people will not be able to take it out again.

I feel rather sorry that some of my honourable friends on this side of the House are not present. I believe they are in the precincts, as the vote is expected to be taken, but one of the disadvantages of the present state of things in the House is that on an important question such as this is, it is impossible to influence opinionperhaps that would be too much to expect in any circumstances-o r at any rate one has not the opportunity of influencing 01 appealing to the feelings and views of honourable members, because they are generally out of the chamber.

On the other hand, any one like myself taking a serious view is at this further disadvantage, that he has no adequate access to thc public through the press. But I must take things as I find them, and I am going to do my best at any rate to justify the action that I have thought fit to take in this matter. Allow me to sayI think I alluded to it beforethat the action I have taken has been taken as the result of mature thought and consideration, and of an absolutely disinterested desire to aid the Government, and to promote the public good. That is my sole object.. YetI am accused in the press of paltry and miserable motives; of being a faddista .man who has a scheme of his own and, therefore* opposes every other proposal, in order that he may get it adopted. under that imputation, and to have those gibes thrown at me.

To that I sent the following reply :Thanks for your telegram; you apparently misunderstood my position. I have set aside entirely my proposals, of which you approved. 1 and tliose Government supporters acting with me are unanimous in accepting the agreement made by the Government in its entirety, and will vote for it if it is inserted in the Con? stitution in similar terms as existing Braddonclause, by providing that 25s. f e r cafita shall be paid t ill the aggregate reaches ^7,500,000, and thereafter until the Parliament shall otherwise provide., I hope you will accept this, and so end the matter, and secure the permanent unity and co-operation of the whole party supporting the Government, who are friendly to the States.aud anxious to secure settlement advantageous to them.

As a member of a party maintaining a Government in power, however, I do not admit that all the brains of the party are in* the Government. I do not admit that I , or any other man, who takes upon himself the responsibility of representing the people, should become a mere cypher. do not admit that an honourable member, because he is a Ministerialist, is always to go with the Government, and is never to attempt to aid it. I consider that I have a right to assist the Government to the best of my ability. Not only in this Parliament, but in the Victorian State Legislature, I have never hesitated to devote time and thought, that might have been used to my own pecuniary advantage, in the management of my own affairs, to aid in the government of the country. I have done that, believing it to be my duty, and I utterly fail to see why, when an honourable member does so, it should immediately be asked concerning him, outside, "" What is his little game?"" ""What is he up to?"" or ""What does he want?"" That is a course of conduct to which I strongly object. I feel that it is my duty as long as I retain a position in Parliament, to do my best for the country and its interests, yet when one does so, one is twitted in the press, and even in this House, with being -a faddist. That is what I resent. I wish that some, of my honourable friends of the Government party, who are now absent, were present, because I had desired to speak plainly to them. I shall not have another opportunity to do so in connection with this Bill, and I wish to avail myself of that which now offers, not to satisfy any feeling of disappointment, or annoyance, because I have none, but to put before honourable members a view which is different from that which many appear to hold as to the duties of a public man. A section of the press, with singular unfairness, continues to put .before the country the view that in the action I am taking, I am playing into the hands of fhe Labour party. That was its first statement, and in its 'next issue it twisted it into a declaration that I am supporting the Labour party. The statement is too ridiculous to need contravention. never played into the honourable member's hands. position, and they understand mine. Every honourable member of this House knows that the Labour party knew nothing of the action that I thought fit to take in our own party meeting. It has been made equally clear that I did not know what the honourable member for Flinders thought, and was going to do in regard to this agreement, nor did I know what action the honourable member for Parkes contemplated. I On the other hand, they did not know what I was going to do. We each expressed ourselves in this House freely and without concert. Then again, I did not know what the Labour party were going to do, nor did they know what line of action I thought it would be my duty to take. They took their owri course without any attempt to influence me, or any attempt on my part to influence them. Many members of our party are absent whom I should like to see present. I would ask them when they say, as they and a section of the press have said, that I am supporting the Labour party -as if that were the unclean thing-to take one or two matters into consideration. I would ask some of my honourable friends whose names appear in the division list as voting with the Government on this question, to compare that list with the division on the Seat of Government Bill, when the Labour Government thought it their duty to ask this Parliament to reverse a decision at which a previous Parliament had arrived. How many of those honourable members hesitated to vote with the Labour Government on that occasion? How many of those honourable members who twit me with supporting the Labour party, because they happen to agree with me on this all-important and absolutely non-party matter, then voted with the Labour Ministry because it suited them to do so?

How was it that when the honourable member for Gwydir, a member of the Labour party, submitted a motion in favour of the appointment of a Commission to inquire into the working of the Post and Telegraph Department, and the Government, of which the present Prime Minister was the leader, resisted that not act in accord when they happen to hold proposition, some of them voted with a section of the Labour party, and so put the then Deakin Government into a position of serious difficulty? stood out against the advice-of many of my own jiersonal friends. I stood by the Prime Minister, when, as he knows, socially, and in every other way, to do so was to do that which very few were prepared to do. asked to remember that in taking that course I was going against those with whom 1 usually acted. But I stood by the Prime Minister for the same reason that, I have opposed him on this question. I believed I was doing that which was right. I approved in the main of his ideals. I felt that he was the only man in Australia fitted to lead the country, and I stuck to him through good report and ill . In doing so, I also supported my right honourable friend the Treasurer, and others now on the Government bench. But when the Labour party submitted a vote of want of confidence in the Deakin Government of that day, did not those very men vote with the Labour party, including the right honourable member for Swan? Are not their names recorded in Hansard as having voted with thc Labour party ? This great question is Constitution not a party matter, and the day has gone by for the humbug and absolute nonsense of which I complain. I have dealt now with that aspect of the question, and trust thai we shall hear no more of it. I wish now to say, as I have in the manifestos that I have issued in connection with Federal elections, that I am opposed radically and on principle to many of the proposals of the Labour party. I have always been so opposed to them, and have given my reasons for my opposition. They understand that my objection to their policy is the sole ground for my opposition to them. I should never feel that I was bound to oppose them merely because I did not like them personally, and it is the last thing I would do. In the Labour party I havemany friends whom I respect; and, if wedo differ politically, why should we fail to recognise each other's sincerity of conviction?

I am not attacking its policy, but I must tell the people what I think they should do We cannot escape our responsibilities by thrusting this matter before the people to be determined by them. T do not wish to go back on what has led up to the present position, but I say to Ministers that they cannot get more than thirty-six votes for their proposal unless they accept those of the honourable members for Flinders, Balaclava, and Corio. I do not speak for the honourable member for Corio. the honourable member came to me and said that he would stick to me-al l through, as [ understood him. Apparently, he has changed his mind. I am not his judge. I was present at the meeting of our party wihen the honourable member for Flinders made his promise-absolutely without pressure from the Government or its head. He voluntarily, and without qualification, said that if he had a free hand in Committee, and the majority of the Committee was against, him, he would' support the third, reading of. the B ill . When I heard him say that, I thought tfiatf, had he been a Scotchman, he wouldi not have said it. I , being a Scotchman-, rose immediately aiter him,, and said, "" While1 thoroughly agree with the honourable member's views, I. ami not prepared to. make any pledge of any sort as to what I shalldo when the third-reading stage is reached."" I regret that my honourable friend did not assume the same attitude, and I am sure that he does so too..' As to the honourable member for Balaclava, no doubt similar considerations weigh with him, though I am not so cognisant of the circumstances in which he is placed. Readers of the scriptures remember the affecting incident of Jepthah's daughter one of the most pathetic passages in sacred literature. Seeing that these gentlemen have made what I may term a Jepthah's rash vow, is it right to hold them to it for the sake of recommending to the people a grave constitutional change? WereI head of the Government, I would absolve them from their obligation. I would not, in the interests of party, seek to carry thus, not a measure of temporary importance, but one which may affect the future-of. the country in wavs which we cannot foresee: I should not take the responsibility of sending the matter -to the country by means of such support. I appeal to Ministers, even at this late stage, to say whether it is fair to men who have been loyal to them, as these gentlemen have been, to strain their loyalty, and to subject them to the vilest misrepresentation outside. Because they will be reviled and misrepresented. Is it right for the Government to hold these two men to their promise because they say "" We gave our word, and we must stand to it "" ? I say no. Ministers also know that of the thirty-six who may vote for the third reading, six or eight are not in favour of making the agreement permanent, and are yet going to vote for it . I do I solicited no one's support, -but not impugn their motives, because they have the right to do as they think best, but four of them have published their views in Hansard,, and two, if not more* have made their opinions known. Ministers know better than I do how these men feel. Without theirsupport the third reading wou'.d not be passed, with the statutory majority, and, indeed, only twenty-eight or thirty memberswould vote for it on their conviction as to theneed for permanency. I am not going toblame those who have felt it their duty to subordinate what I consider to be thesupreme rights of the. people to party interests. They say that the solidarity of the party isof more importance, and are going to vote for sending the agreement to the people with the intention of telling their constituents that they should not vote for it. They will find themselves in a very awkward position. What will their advice to the electors be worth? They will say, "" We voted for this, but we do not believe in it ; you had better not vote for it . "" To my mind the position is absolutely destructive of Federal loyalty, which should rise superior to every other political consideration. It is a subordination of loyalty to the country to the interests of party. I was going to say the vile interests of party, but parties are necessary under our system of GovernmentI will, therefore, say the worse aspects and worse abuses of party. Is it a good introduction that the agreement should be sent to the country on the opinion of a little more than one third of the members of the Housethat is, when you come to the essence of it-the well known and published views of the members of this House, and not the votes as they will be recorded? And what about our friends, the Premiers? AllI say is that they have somehow or other got the game in their hands, at. the present time, and have been very astute in their ""use of it. ' Those of us who were members of the first two Parliaments they were so very divergent from will remember that during that period mine. this Parliament was assailed every this merit, that any one who studied it -day in the week for failing in its duty in could see that it settled the whole ques-every respect, and expending too much tion, adjusted the whole of the differences money.

Everything was done to atcertainty as to the State finances. But tack us, and, above all, we were told what the Premiers saw thenI think for that this Parliament had failed in its duty the-first time-wa s that it ended there, and in regard to one of the prime conthat they had no further claim beyond siderations of Federation the taking that. One of them told me so. I replied, over of the State debts.

But by carrving out my scheme liberately smothered in the press?

I do not want my name to go never again referred to it. man said to me, "" Your scheme is too coma foul wrong on the Constitution. I canplete."" Its merit is that you can see the end from this manoeuvring has been. At each sucthe beginning."" The end of it was that cessive Conference the Premiers came to it took over the debts, and definitely disgether determined not to give up the hold entangled the finances of the Commonthey thought they had over the Commonwealth and the States. My honourable wealth finances, and not to allow the friend, Kooyong, had somewhat different views not object so much to the debts being on the matter, but I do not think taken over, but what they did object to Mr Harper: At any rate, my scheme had the The State Premiers perceived One public down to posterity as one who has inflicted I replied, ""Yes, it is complete. see perfectly well what the object of all the honourable member for State debts to be taken over. Thev did was that they were not to have complete control of future borrowing. That is the root of the matter. I tried to make it clear that they were to have the power of future borrowing, but that it would have to be regulated. The Prime Minister was, I believe, thoroughly at one with me as to that, and is so now. I venture to say that, if this Bill is carried, even though the House unanimously last night carried a Bill to enable Parliament to take over the whole of the State debts, we shall, in all probability, never take them'over, for it is not intended by the prime movers in this business that we shall take them over.

I should like the right honourable member to explain why on that occasion .he did not apply .the principle that he is now advocating? Why has he departed from the principle which he then insisted upon as a sine gua non? The Minister of Defence says that there were other reasons. I agree that there were, and apprehend that if the right honourable member had a right to have other reasons, we possess a similar right. Whatever the reasons, the principle involved was the same; yet the right honourable .member felt that the Braddon clause was a blot on the -Constitution, and desired that it should be removed. Why_ does he wish now practically to replace it in the Constitution? What his reasons are we may imagine. South Wales, the majority of whom share -his view, may know something of them; but I do-not. I am bound as.a public man to deal, not with insinuations of motives or reasons, but to ask why the very people The right honourable member who wished to take theBraddon clause out of the Constitution Bill should now practically I see his hand want to put it back again. Presumably, the action then taken was prompted by reasons He addressed to the President of that were thought .sufficient; but let me ask again why it is that at the present time. I admit the circumstances are differentthe very people who advocated then what we are advocating to-day should object to our proposal. We say, in effect, to t'->e States, "" We give you your own terms. We substitute for the provision that three-fourths of the 'Customs and Excise revenue shall be returned to the States one declaring that there shall oe a per capita return out of the general revenue.

We say that it shall continue for ""practically fifteen years, and thereafter as -Parliament may otherwise provide. I ask these honourable members why that .should not :be done ? Why .should they charge me with disloyalty to my -party, as Subsesome of them do-wh y should that .charge be made against me in the press-whe n I ask for a reason that will satisfy my judgment concerning the objection of the men who limited 'the Braddon clause, .to our prc-posai to limit in .the same way the operaHe was tion of this agreement? The question is unanswerable. The difficulties in the way of taking this agreement out of the Constitution will be enormous. Had the opportunity offered, I intended this morning .to take out a few figures showing how the Constitutional provision: with regard to the making of amendments would operate. As I have already said, the difficulty is not that fhe appeal will be to the whole of the people. If that were the position we could face it . If an appeal had to be made to the whole of the people they would have a direct voice in the determination of the question, and I could then understand the argument Sf those who support the Government proposition. But for the purposes of the Constitution we have divided into two sections rthe organizations that carrv on the business of the people. Collectively they represent the whole of the population, but. in reality, under the 'Constitution, they do not, because under the section which preRepresentatives of New scribes the manner in which the Constitution may be altered, it is provided for the protection of .minorities in the States that the State majorities are to count as well as the collective majorities of all in the States. Figures have been given during the consideration of this Bill to show that if, for any reason, the larger States thought it was desirable to alter this provision in any way or to withdraw it from the Constitution altogether, they would be powerless to give effect to that desire unless there were simipoint of order, and ask whether the honlar majorities in the smaller States. I ask honourable members to consider the other side. It is quite conceivable that the smaller States might be unanimously desirous of altering this provision or of removing it from the Constitution, but they could not do so because of their inability to obtain a majority in all the States. The provision cuts both ways; and those who decide to recommend this measure to the people are assuming a tremendous responsibility. What have we seen in the United States? Constitution is different on nnancial matters, and such friction as has arisen has had other causes; but in connection with slavery, the question of State Rights gave rise to the most bloody war on record. I am not a Cassandra, to predict that we may have civil war over money matters;, but it is conceivable that there may be the utmost friction and straining of the Constitution, and the utmost antagonism between people who ought to be one. time? members not to degrade the proceedings of Parliament in this fashion.

142,Mr Hughes (West Sydney) [3.3],"the Leader ot the Opposition had spoken, or after the member who replied to the Leader of the Opposition had sat down. Mr Speaker said he would do so. In those circumstances, I feel that I was perfectly entitled to the call, both by the fact that I rose on this side, and because that arrangement had been made. I did not see the Prime Minister rise previously, and I feel sure he will acquit me of any desire to prevent him from getting the call. He will see, however, that by the practice of the House, and by the arrangement I have mentioned, I have a right to the call, and I hope he will allow me to have it. ber for West Sydney is quite correct in saying that he spoke to me about being called at a certain stage; but as the late Speaker laid it down, any conversation of that sort cannot be looked on as an engagement on the part of the Chair to see any honourable member. I rose at the same time as the honourable member for Mernda to say a few words by way of personal explanation. I saw a statement in one of the morning papers that I had been threatened with opposition in my constituency if I did not vote for the third reading. been made to me, nor would any threat afreet me in any way. I have too much Welsh blood in my veins to stand a threat from anybody, and if it were made, I should resent it, and probably be much stronger m my opposition than before. I was, however, present at the meeting when the honourable member for Flinders stated that if we were beaten on the vote in Committee on our amendment he would vote for the third reading, in order to carry out the wish of the majority of the House. I said I would dD the same thing. I may not have been as Scotch as I ought to have been, but I said it. When I spoke on the second reading of the Bill, I said that if the Government defeated our amendment in Committee, I would make one to give them a statutory majority on the third reading. Whilst not approving of the proposal put forward by the Government, but favouring that of the honourable member for Mernda, I felt that I was not justified in taking advantage of a technicality to defeat the wishes of the majority of the House. That was the reason why I said I would not oppose the third reading, if the matter was carried against us in Committee. against us in Committee in one division. how the clause was carried. It was carried by a majority of one. I said that if we defeated the Government on our amendment in Committee, I was quite prepared to risk my seat. party question. posed to be a party question, but I had heard statements to that' effect, and I , for one, was prepared to take the consequences. I did not want to sit on a bed of roses, or to get down on the easy side of the fence. I fought all I could for the amendment of the honourable member for Mernda, and I compliment him now on the speech he has made.
