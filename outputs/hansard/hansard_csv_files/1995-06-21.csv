Although some larger departments have employed welfare officers/counsellors, this is not a viable or cost efficient and effective option for an agency the size of the Department of the House of Representatives. Moreover, staff often doubt the confidentiality of the services and the welfare officer/counsellor can have difficulty in reconciling his or her management advising role. The Employee Assistance Service was seen as providing effective, cost efficient, responsive and minimum intervention services to staff for work and family related problems. The service also reinforces one of our departmental values that the staff of the department are its most valuable asset. In October 1993 a review was completed of the employee assistance program using the following evaluation criteria agreed by the departmental occupational health and safety committee: usage rates of the service by staff and eligible relatives; feedback from staff and supervisors and unions and their expectations; cost benefit analysis of the current premium structure against a fee for service arrangement, and the views and practices of other agencies, particularly the other parliamentary departments. The review concluded that the program had the following positive aspects: wide support in the APS community, particularly the parliamentary departments; it is well regarded by staff, supervisors and unions, although support is not overt; it provides a valuable service to the department in terms of human resource management and OH&S principles, and",138,Bills Returned From The Senate It Was Not Why Not Can We Seriously

(g) No. (h) The department is unable to answer this question. Department of the Parliamentary Library (a) To provide confidential, impartial non-sectarian and individual face to face and telephone counselling by experienced counsellors with relevant professional qualifications to employees and their immediate families. Such counselling is to cover a wide variety of work related or personal problems which may adversely affect work performance, including but not limited to, such matters as family/marital/relationship problems, work place stresses and difficulties, bereavement and psychological problems, alcohol and other drug related abuse, legal and financial difficulties and critical incidents/trauma. (b) For 1994-95, the cost was $8,000. (c) During 1994-95, 12 people used the service; comprising 11 staff members and one family member. (d) The Department of the Parliamentary Library has a responsibility to its staff, particularly for work related difficulties, that is met by provision of a confidential and professional service. The employee assistance program is supported fully by staff, both formally through the consultative Departmental Council and informally. (e) Given the small size of the Department of the Parliamentary Library, this level of detail is not available because the program is confidential and provision of such detail would create a higher risk of identifying individuals. During 1994-95,48% of attendances were classified by the provider as work related and 52% were classified as being due to personal reasons. (f) The Parliamentary Librarian.

From 1971 to 1 August 1987, payroll tax on wages relating to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) were collected by the Commonwealth under the terms of the Pay-roll Tax (Territories) Assessment Act 1971. When the ACT self-government commenced, legislation was not put in place to make these Commonwealth authorities liable for ACT payroll tax. This bill will rectify this situation, and will make those Commonwealth authorities operating in the ACT liable to pay ACT payroll tax in the same way that they are liable to pay state and Northern Territory payroll tax. The bill applies only to those Commonwealth authorities which, immediately before the commencement of the ACT payroll tax regime, were registered as employers, or had an application for registration pending, under the payroll tax regime of the Commonwealth or of a state or territory. It will have no application to other Commonwealth authorities. Exempting provisions which would otherwise operate to exclude liability to ACT payroll tax are made inapplicable to those Commonwealth authorities. Those Commonwealth authorities that have paid ACT payroll tax before royal assent to the bill cannot recover the payments. This legislation will ensure consistency of treatment of Commonwealth authorities between the states and territories.

312,Mr Andrews (Menzies) (10.02 A.m.),"As the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Gear) has pointedMC 2048 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 June 1995 as employers under state, territory or Commonwealth payroll tax acts prior to 1 August 1987. The bill provides that such authorities are subject to the ACT Payroll Tax Act which came into effect on 1 August 1987, even though their establishing acts may confer a general exemption against state or territory taxation. It provides that, where regulations made pursuant to the act establishing the authority have the effect of making it subject to payroll tax of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory, it is subject to the ACT Payroll Tax Act 1987, Subject to one qualification where we seek further clarification, the coalition is not opposed to the bill. The ACT Payroll Tax Act commenced operation on 1 August 1987 and the bill is designed to make it clear that it applies to Commonwealth authorities as defined in the legislation. As the Assistant Treasurer pointed out, apparently some Commonwealth authorities operating in the ACT paid payroll tax to the Australian Capital Territory government assuming that its payroll tax legislation applied to them, even though they might have been entitled to a general exemption on state or territory tax. The effect of the bill is to preclude them from recovering these moneys. Clause6 of the bill provides: A Commonwealth authority that has paid tax payable under the Payroll Tax Act 1987 of the Australian Capital Territory cannot recover those payments if they were made before the commencement of this Act. The aim of clause 6 is to protect previous collections of payroll tax by the ACT government and avoid the adverse impact that refunds would have on ACT revenues. The bill is necessary to implement the power of the ACT government to levy payroll tax on these Commonwealth authorities. The bill affects only government authorities and I am informed that no private company would be adversely affected by this legislation. The adverse impact of the revenues on the ACT government, if it had to repay the payroll tax to certain authorities, could be considerable, especially as this is a situation which the current government of the ACT has inherited from its predecessor. If tax were refunded, the ACT would lose, Commonwealth authorities would gain, and no doubt a claim for the reimbursement would in tum be made by the ACT on the Commonwealth. Our query with one aspect of this legislation is with the use of the words 'tax payable' in clause 6 of the bill. It may be argued that-and it has been suggested to us-although the authorities paid tax, it was not tax payable by operation of law prior to the commencement of this bill. Therefore, a legal question arises as to whether a reference in this bill to tax payable has the effect, which is intended, of precluding the recovery of moneys if it was not tax payable under an authorised legislative instrument prior to the commencement of this bill. We are not going to stand in the way---even if we could-of the passage of this bill through the House. However, I have raised the matter with the Assistant Treasurer. I expect that it is not a matter to which he can give an immediate answer at this stage. If it cannot be adequately answered, we will seek to ask the Senate standing committee on legal and constitutional affairs to look at those particular words and that particular clause. We share the concern of the government that the bill, which purports that the money should not be recoverable, will be in fact a binding legislative instrument in the sense that it will not be challenged in the courts in any way and that the spirit of what the government intends is carried into operation. Except for the qualification that I have alluded to, the coalition does not oppose. this piece of legislation. Commonwealth Authorities (Australian Capital Territory Pay-roll Tax) Bill 1995.

313,Mr Langmore (Fraser) (10.07 A.m.),"I am glad that the opposition supports theWednesday, 21 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2049 its revenue base. It makes sense that the Commonwealth, as well as the private sector, should pay these kinds of taxes. In fact, the private sector sometimes complains that Commonwealth instrumentalities are not covered by tax provisions but this legislation will ensure that. The bill is entirely non-controversial and does not deserve debate for more than a moment or two. I would like to use the opportunity to talk briefly about payroll tax in total. Payroll tax is really quite a perverse tax at a time when we have high unemployment. It is a tax on employment. Payroll tax is a discouragement to employment at a time when one of the government's highest priorities, and, I do not doubt, one of the opposition's highest priorities, is to increase employment. We should be aiming in every way possible to reduce or even eliminate payroll tax. Of course, it is a state and territory tax, as is now quite clear from this legislation, so it is not something over which the Commonwealth has direct control. However, the Commonwealth could create conditions under which it was possible for the states and territories to reduce or eliminate payroll tax if other revenue sources were available. It is very speculative to talk in these terms, but it is important to speculate because we have to try to find ways of consistently and comprehensively creating the conditions in which growth of employment could be maximised. The elimination of payroll tax would be a very significant contribution· to that goal. In order to eliminate payroll tax, we would have to find some other comparable source of revenue to replace it. It is a major source of revenue for the states and territories but there are other such sources available. If payroll tax were eliminated then corporate tax collections would rise and they would go to the Commonwealth. That would give the Commonwealth the capacity to increase direct payments to the states, which would, in part, offset the consequences of abolishing payroll tax. I understand that that might offset about a third of the loss of revenue but it would still leave about two-thirds to be found. One way in which that could be done and which has a lot of appeal to me is the idea of the introduction of some kind of greenhouse gas emission tax. That is a complex, even controversial, proposal because it involves issues relating to the incidence of such a tax which have distributional consequences. But if we want to adopt the general principle of taxing 'bads' and reducing taxes on 'goods' it makes sense to try to tax greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage those emissions and their polluting effects, whilst reducing tax on employment, which we want to encourage. SoI think there is a strong case for a more detailed exploration of the possibility of some kind of greenhouse gas emission tax. It may well not be a tax that Australia should do alone. It could well be done in conjunction with other industrialised countries and with developing countries as well. That is on the agenda of the European Community, and it may well be on the agenda of other countries as well in due course. I do not think it is an idea that will disappear. It is one that will continue to be explored because there is so much concern about greenhouse gas emissions and that concern is certainly growing. So this possibility is one that we could well explore rather more thoroughly than happened at the beginning of this year. It is certainly one that I would like to see encouraged. To conclude, I think it is very important that we absolutely minimise payroll tax. While it is right, of course, to apply it to the public sector as well as the private sector, we should be aiming to reduce it so that employment growth is encouraged. speakers, the member for Menzies( Mr Andrews) and the member for Fraser( Mr Langmore), for their contribution.

Community Affairs Committee Report Debate resumed from 5 June, on motion by Mr Allan Morris: That the House take note of the paper. aspects of youth homelessness. At the outset, I would like to pay tribute to those members of the committee who hung in during the length of this inquiry. It was not easy but I thank them for seeing this report through to the end. I would also like to pay my tribute to Bjame Nordin and Peta Fitzgibbon for their tireless work during the inquiry and also for their help and guidance so freely offered to committee members. The sheer size of this report would hopefully suggest to those who see it that the committee has come up with a comprehensive and definitive statement regarding this vital issue which now impacts on so many families throughout Australia. The committee's terms of reference are worth repeating: To inquire into and report to the Parliament on the provision of assistance for homeless youth requiring income support, with particular reference to: 1. the availability of family support and welfare services (including mediation services), their role and effectiveness in reducing homelessness and in resolving differences before young people leave home; 2. the integration of income support provisions for homeless young people with services that assist with family reunion, transition to stable independent living, and opportunities for education, training and employment; and 3. the appropriateness of income support arrangements for homeless young people, noting the need to not create undue incentives to leave home or school. The issue of youth homelessness is a very emotive one. Stories abound across the length and breadth of this country which highlight the inadequacies of the system which is supposed to strengthen rather than weaken the roles of families in nurturing and supporting their children. The roles of state and federal governments and their various departments have been examined in great detail in this report. Parents, young people and service providers have all given us examples of where the system has failed, and failed dismally. The committee has come up with 129 recommendations for the government to consider. I would like to highlight some of these recommendations and speak briefly to them. At the outset I would like to say that we are facing two problems: firstly, the problem of dealing with the current crop of homeless young people, and, secondly and to my mind a far",155,Representatives Main Committee

316,Mr Quick (Franklin) (10.14 A.m.),"I am delighted to be able to speak on A report on Wednesday, 21 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2051 more important issue, the way in which we must cut off the supply of potential homeless young people by instituting a range of effective programs across state and federal departments to provide support for families and their children. In our report we cover the whole spectrum of homelessness: the historical development of youth income support,the current services for homeless young people and the current income support arrangements for this group. I do not wish to tackle that in my speech here today. I would like to focus on some of the other aspects of the report. I see these areas as the key to really addressing this vital issue. These areas are: the housing needs of homeless young people; family mediation and counselling services; youth and family policy initiatives; Commonwealth-state responsibilities for the care, support and protection of young people; the role of education; and parental roles and responsibilities. Firstly, I would like to mention the issue offamily mediation and counselling services. This is an area in need of vast improvement across Australia, and more so in the rural and regional areas of our country. It really concerns me that our society still has not come to grips with the realisation of the importance of these valuable services and the need for them to be integrated into all aspects of the life of a family. Like most community services which operate in our country, they are poorly equipped to deal with their case load, are underresourced with staff, usually situated away from their client base, and are the subjeCt of disputation between various state and Commonwealth government departments. It is interesting to note the comments of the Institute of Family Studies concerning an evaluation of the 11 pilot projects for family mediation set up by the Commonwealth government recently: The study supports the view that early intervention in situations of family conflict may prevent seemingly ordinary problems from escalating into crisis situations and leaving home with little or no support. The Attorney-General's Department's comments are also of interest: The preventative nature of the adolescent mediation and family therapy program means that it is more successful at reaching those clients who have not already left home. The target population is therefore potentially greater than the number of clients currently receiving homeless rates. Clients attending services are still at home and school and are experiencing difficulties which may eventually result in homelessness. What is the use of setting up excellent services if they are hamstrung, unable to cope with their case load, and raise expectations within the community only to let these people down through no fault of their own? Nationally we have an expectation that, irrespective of where we live in this great country of ours, we can equitably access telecommunications, postal and educational services. When it comes to health and community services, it is a real lottery. It all depends on where people live. Our recommendations 7.19 and 7.20 are vital if we as a country are ever to develop an effective and responsive network to support all families. Recommendation 7.19 reads: The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth and State and Territory governments immediately establish funding arrangements for the extension of Adolescent and Family Therapy and Mediation Services in a national program as a preventive measure for young people leaving home prematurely. Recommendation 7.20 reads: . . . recommends that targets be established for ensuring the establishment of adequate coverage of mediation and family therapy services in all States and Territories within the next three years. MC 2052 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 June 1995 It is imperative that, as well as doing this, we establish an effective linkage between other services offered and operated by the Department of Social Security, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Attorney-General's Department, the Family Court, and state education, housing and community services departments. At present, there is no such linkage, no effective network, no safety net. There is enormous duplication and an ineffective response to this vital issue. In the area of Commonwealth-state responsibilities for the care, support and protection of young people, it was interesting to read the initial knee-jerk response by all s.tates and territories to the release of our report, and more especially to the nine recommendations in this section of the report. Put the states under pressure and they trot out all the defensive cliches to try to deflect any blame. States are hopelessly blinkered into a departmental territoriality syndrome. When it comes to young people, examples of interagency cooperation are a rarity. All states have youth affairs departments, and they are almost exclusively located in the premiers' offices. They are all token efforts, having no effective liaising role, no resources, no clout when it comes to decision making. State and territory governments are responsible for child welfare but, because of Commonwealth involvement in a number of programs for families and their children, the states have sought to relinquish their responsibilities under the claim of fiscal incapacity. Services offered by state governments have been pared to the bone in the name of fiscal restraint and responsibility. Staff in these areas are inadequately trained and resourced and families in need have been extremely disadvantaged. It is interesting to note the comments in the 1989 Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report in this area which concluded: The failure of State welfare and health authorities both to provide appropriate and timely assistance to families in need and to prcivide appropriate nurture and support to children committed to, and leaving, their care, is a serious indictment on the willingness and capacity of those authorities to properly discharge their legal and social responsibilities ... The States are ill-equipped or unwilling to offer appropriate services ... Nothing, I would venture, has changed since this damning statement six years ago. We have now been offered the magic word 'protocol'. A federal-state government case management protocol for young people has been agreed to and signed by all parties. It acknowledges a shared responsibility for the welfare of children. It sounds fine in theory, but in practice out there in the real world it is a hopeless mess. It has been operating for close on a year. Our committee members were told of the following concerns in relation to the effectiveness and implementation of this protocol: the inability of state governments adequately to respond to the demands of the protocol in major cities as well as in regional areas of Australia; an increased worKload generated by the protocol placing an unmanageable burden on a service already unable to meet its statutory responsibilities to young people; young people becoming further disadvantaged as a result of the cumbersome bureaucratic procedures in operation; the inadequacy of state and territory welfare departments' financial support during the risk assessment period and beyond; the lack of accountability of the states and territories for the actions taken following referral; and, lastly, the failure of the protocol to include access to education. The area of parental roles and responsibilities is the area of our report which .produced the most angst from the members of the public who made submissions to us and from members of our committee. Of course it is controversial. When state and federal government policies Wednesday, 21 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2053 and programs impact on family relationships and arrangements, of course you will upset some people in our society. The most contentious issues are access to income support and the extent to which it acts as an incentive to young people to leave home, and the supremacy of children's rights over the rights of parents. It is interesting to note that there is consensus between parent groups and community and welfare organisations on a range of other issues dealing with young people. These are: the lack of preventative and early intervention services for families and adolescents; the inadequate support offered to families by state welfare authorities; the lack of responsibility and accountability of both the Commonwealth and the state governments for the welfare of young people receiving the homeless rate of income support; the need to improve and increase the training and the skills of people working in the youth field; and the absence of adequate and accessible family support services for families and adolescents. These issues and the other issues mentioned today are not barrows which the committee members are pushing for their own political advantage. Unless the Commonwealth and the state and territory ministers responsible for these areas bite the bullet and seriously look at the recommendations contained in our report and work tirelessly to implement them, we will end up with a situation which is evident in many other areas of the world where youth is out of control and where the services are inadequate. The punitive measures which are being forced upon these governments are far more costly and far more divisive than anything that we could ever envisage in this country. All members of the committee worked tirelessly to produce this report, and I thank them. It is a bipartisan report with a few exceptions towards the end. I can understand the concerns of members opposite, but we can work together to implement the many recommendations in this report. I trust and hope that the families who put submissions in, the service providers who are working tirelessly for young people and the Commonwealth and state government agencies who have the responsibility to ensure that these programs work effectively will examine the recommendations so that we can come to a sensible and effective conclusion in resolving this matter.

317,Mr Richard Evans (Cowan) (10.30 A.m),"I wish to talk about the report of the HouseMC 2054 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 June 1995 significant report and one to which a lot of members should address themselves, if they have a caring position for the community. The fact is that we have a serious problem with some of our youth, although not with all of our youth, because most of our youth are quite well regarded and take their positions. in the community. But we do have a serious problem with some of our youth in Australia at the moment. The facts speak loudly. The number receiving the youth homeless allowance has risen from 950 recipients to almost 10,000 in recent times. There are estimates that approximately 40,000 young people are considered homeless. This report investigated these issues and it is quite significant in some of the issues that it discusses and in its recommendations. It does not really try to seek solutions. Rather, it allows for further discussion on the whole matter of youth homelessness. It is a very important issue and is something that we, as parliamentarians, should be considering very urgently because, in my view, we have an urgent problem. Young people have a right to a future and to have some hope in our country, and it is a major problem for a country as rich as Australia to have young people, without much hope and without much future, seeking some respite from their own family home through no fault of their own. We should be nurturing our young people, who are really the major asset of our country. We should be trying to look after them and provide a future for them. Yet we have an estimate that some 40,000 young Australians are considered homeless. I do not think it is because of poor parenting, although I believe that a lot of parenting skills are not inherent: they have to be developed and taught. Perhaps we should be considering the teaching of parenting to classes in the community. It is not that we are trying to protect these young people by institution ali sing them. I do not think We should be doing that either. We should be trying to protect them, giving them some opportunity for the future, some choices that they can be making to provide a future for them. The report discusses a lot of recommendations. However, there are a couple of things that I should comment on. One is the role of the states. In my view, in most states that we visited, not enough attention is being paid to our youth in this particular area. The particular area of 15to 16-year-olds is a very grey area of responsibility at the federal level, and at the state level it is very grey indeed. A lot of these people who consider themselves homeless fall into this particular age group. I also strongly suggest that we look at early intervention measures. A case recently which related to community services in New South Wales is a typical example. Unfortunately. a young child, six years of age, was beaten by his parents and died. Two weeks prior to this event, the mother contacted community services and asked for help and gave them an early warning signal, but no-one took appropriate action and we lost a young child. In this report we have identified a number of people who asked for early intervention, for some help, and the help was not available. It really is a tragedy, when families in Australia are asking for help to be able to overcome some problems they have within the family, that we are not responding quickly enough. I ask the state governments to review the whole process of how they respond to these issues. In Melbourne, I was impressed by a parent who gave some evidence; I think she was from the Geelong area. She spoke of three types of children who are homeless. One type was the child that is abused-physically, sexually, emotionally or mentally. The second group includes the children who do not know what is going on. To use her description, they have 'storms in their head'. They are going through a difficult period of growing and they are not necessarily Wednesday, 21 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2055 overcoming some of the challenges facing them. Of course, the third group is those that fraudulently take advantage of the system. The trouble with youth homelessness, I believe, is the perception in the community; and perceptions are reality as it is seen. The perception is that most homeless youth are troubled, they are taking advantage of the system, and they should go home to their parents. I have been to a public meeting and listened to parents quite dramatically and emotionally express their feelings towards government department officers. A lot of parents out there would like to have their children back. But the problem is deeper than people taking advantage of the system. There are children who are abused, and we should be responding to that. There are young people who do have problems with their families. They may perceive problems with their parents,while the parents do not perceive any problems with their children. Some do have these storms in their heads, and some are children who are defrauding the system. This report has a problem in dealing with those three separate areas. It is very difficult to differentiate between them; and when we consider youth homelessness as an issue, too often we try to put all three groups into one bracket. It cannot be done: we have to address them as separate issues. Frankly, this particular report does not have any solutions to that, but it again reinforces the point that this whole issue needs further investigation. As I said before, I went to a public meeting at which parents were really grieving for their children. They could not understand why their children did not want to live at home, and they could not understand why state departments were not giving information to the parents. One parent explained her situation. She and her family went along to a squat to see her 14-year-old daughter. She had been away from home for about 12 months, and in that 12 months had been raped by some of the squatters in the same place, but she was choosing to live away from home. The mother explained the story quite emotionally, saying how the child's father was on his knees pleading with her to come home. These parents have no solution themselves, but they are grieving. I wonder whether we should be providing some sort of counselling to parents. We talk about mediation, we talk about counselling, and we talk about reconciliation and bringing these people together. But if they· are not· reconciled, and they will never be reconciled, there do not seem to be any counselling services available to parents-services they can actually go to and express their grief. It would be like having a death in the family to lose one of your children-a child you love and cherish; To not have the child with you any more would be like having a death in the family, and there is no counselling to assist that grieving process to take place. At this public meeting, the parents were really emotionally grieving, but there was not any help for them. So not only do we have to consider the future of the children in these particular instances; we should also be considering the parents and the families they leave behind. We have a minority report. Most of my colleagues on this side of the House have supported the report in most of its recommendations, but there are a couple of areas that we have concerns about, and we have expressed those concerns. One is the administration of the whole process, and the other is the abuse claims. There does not seem to be any recommendation within the report about an appeal process for parents in relation to abuse. What we are suggesting is that perhaps that should be available to parents. At the moment, if a child does claim abuse, there does not seem to be any follow-up by any of the state bodies, including the police. I think any abuse should be investigated, because of other siblings who might be MC 2056 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 June 1995 involved; but there is no appeal process at the moment for parents to have their day in court, and to discredit any other claims of abuse against them. So we need to look at that. The report is a significant report. We ask for its consideration by the government. We ask for the government to respond to a number of recommendations and I hope that it does that quickly. I have had other experiences in this place and on a number of other committees. I have been waiting for some response by the government for over two years on one very important report that I am dealing with concerning another committee. I am asking the government to respond to this particular report quickly because it is a significant report. I hope it is not lost through the election debate that is going on at the moment. If we have an early election, I hope that this report does get responded to in this particular parliament. I think it should because it is quite significant. My colleagues have mentioned the staff of the secretariat and the way they have handled the whole process of this inquiry. They have been very good at it. They have provided a lot of the information. I would also like to acknowledge my colleagues on both sides of parliament. I think they have been very compassionate in their dealings with this particular issue. It was something that was important for each of the people on the inquiry. It has shown that we as human beings are quite compassionate; we do not necessarily bring politics into our thinking all the time. I think that was shown during this whole inquiry. I would like to commend my colleagues on their attitude to the entire inquiry. Finally, I think this is an important issue. It is something that is not going to die. Youth homelessness is a growing problem in the community. It is something we need to address quickly in order to seek some solutions. I ask the government to respond to this report and I ask the state governments to treat it with some sort of urgency as well. youth homelessness inquiry. A report on aspects of youth homelessness is a good report because it finally lays to rest the myth that the existence of income support encourages young people to run away. I speak from absolute knowledge that young people are not, and have never been, encouraged to run away. For 10 years I worked in a family group home in Launceston and worked with many young people who could not and should not ever have had to live at home under some of the circumstances they were in. Therefore, the youth homeless allowance is of great assistance to many of our young Australians who often are in desperate and dire need of some support. Recently, I noted that it was very good of Senator Jocelyn Newman to write to the Launceston Examiner and alert the people of Tasmania to possible fraudulent claims on the Commonwealth for youth homeless allowance applications. As honourable members know, the allowance is administered by the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training. One does wonder, however, about the motive of Jocelyn Newman. After all, there is possible fraud going on all over the place where a benefit can be obtained. There are possible fraudulent claims on many public and private institutions. Fraud is a fairly serious business. To make allegations in a newspaper about a possible case of fraud by an unnamed young person is certainly not something to be treated lightly. According to the senator's letter in the 31 May edition of the Launceston Examiner, a conspiracy of teenagers is at work here. Let me quote: The electorate of Bass has more than a quarter of all Tasmania's YHAyouth homeless allowance-",159,Representatives Main Committee
318,Mrs Silvia Smith (Bass) (10.42 A.m.),"I also rise as a member who took part in thatWednesday, 21 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2057 recipients. I believe this is indicative of a 'network' of teenagers who, informed of the benefits available to them (from each other and from school)and I assume she means the infonnation comes from each other and through others at schoolrort the system. DEET figures indicate that almost 400 Austudy recipients were granted the independent-that is, free of parental income test-student homeless rate in Tasmania last year. That 400 includes students to 22 years of age, which is the nonnal age of independence for Austudy. They are not exactly teenagers. The electorate of Bass has 100 students at that rate. There are five electorates in Tasmania so, in Senator Newman's perfect state view, Bass should have a fifth, not a quarter, of the state's sharemembers that we are discussing a report, not an issue. I would ask the honourable member to come back to the precise report. of youth homelessness was brought up in that statement in the newspaper. In this Main Committee, we should stick to the non-controversial matters before us. Bass electorate appear to be consistent with the proportion of the state's 15to 19-year-olds living there. Therefore, in the study and the report, we discussed what was a homeless student. In the infonnation leaflets for students that we receive from DEET, it says: You must be living away from home because ... Your physical or mental health is at great risk because of your family situation. This could be due to domestic violence, sexual harassment, extreme family breakdown or other similar severe situations; your parents are in prison, missing or have a medical condition which means they cannot give you a home or support; you are a refugee ... What is distressing is the fact that the criteria are cold, harsh reflections of the reality that some students face, and I am particularly concerned about secondary age students. That was very indicative as we went around this country and listened to the submissions from people and organisations. The student homeless rate for Austudy is not easy to get, contrary to claims. It is not very easy to get because it has to be administered fairly. The government and the bureaucracy must administer taxpayers' money fairly. I am assured that the responsible department's guidelines, through our studies, require all aspects of the case to be taken into account, with input being sought not only from students themselves but also from parents-except, of course, where contact could place the student at risk. Many examples of that were given to us. Where possible, reconciliation and continued support from parents, rather than from other taxpayers, is encouraged, as the honourable member for Cowan( Mr Richard Evans) discussed in his statement. He said that reconciliation is a way to assist in lessening the number of young people claiming that allowance. The policy manual covering Austudy has 30 or 40 pages devoted to the assessment of the student homeless rate applications. Some of the committee references outlined the fact that there was no real case to be borne that public servants were not administering the policy and the correct guidelines as set down.",162,Representatives Main Committee

322,Mrs Silvia Smith,"Tasmania's Austudy youth homeless rate recipients resident in theMC 2058 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 June 1995 There is a lot of work involved in this issue. It is very sensitive and public servants also know that, with every grant or rejection of the independent rate based on extreme family circumstances, someone' s nose is going to be put out of joint. What showed up through the report and the undertakings throughout the country was that, in general, everyone who was involved was bipartisan. It is rather a shame that certain people easily whip up something that is very sensitive into a greater issue withouttaking into account the fact that we need to look at it carefully to make sure that all our young Australians, who desperately need our guidance and assistance through allowances or subsidies, are looked after. The case that I mentioned that was cited by Senator Newman represented the classic low act. I do not think anyone who publicises the fact that they are representing a particular person in need does that individual a favour. No rort was shown to have occurred. When the committee invited submissions, because Senator Newman actually felt so concerned about it, we would have hoped that she would have raised those concerns with the committee, but unfortunately she was not able to be in attendance at any of the hearings. We had a very good hearing in Hobart where some 11 individuals or organisations turned up and told us in no uncertain terms of the situation in Tasmania. I was advised that Senator Newman's letter in the Launceston Examiner appeared only a matter of a few days after she wrote to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training( Mr Free), so there had not been enough time for a reply. As a member of the committee looking into youth homelessness, I found it rather disturbing that a single case in the northern part of Tasmania, in my electorate, had been publicly discussed and had not been brought to our committee for discussion. I and no doubt every other member of the House would agree that Austudy should not be made available to students who simply are not getting on with their parents, or to students who are rorting the system, or to students who are fraudulently claiming circumstances which might qualify them for Austudy. I hope that every member would also condemn the way in which any other member would use this issue to promote suspicion and distrust of the way that student assistance is being administered. That is there to help the young homeless people to continue their lives and to help them continue their education. From past experience in working with those people for 10 years, I know that they have often found themselves in appalling and disgusting circumstances at that stage of their life. This is a good report. It recognises the sensitivity of these situations. It places a great deal of emphasis on case review, which itself will go a long way to foster reconciliation where possible. Most importantly, this report calls on the states to play their roles and to accept their responsibilities on these issues. The Commonwealth is essentially the financing agent for the program and is not equipped to play the enforcement role. The Commonwealth-state liaison must be addressed to achieve increased efficiency in delivery of the system. The report also deals with children under 16 being referred to refuges as step one rather than receiving the benefit. These are sound and well thought out recommendations to deal with a very difficult and a very sensitive problem. This report represents a pro-active approach, unlike writing to a local newspaper in an endeavour to score some cheap political points. BeforeI close, I would also like to pass my thanks to the chairman of the committee, the member for Newcastle ( Mr Allan Morris), who is present, and to all my fellow committee members. A special thanks also must go to Bjame Nordin, Peta Fitzgibbon, Lynette Sebo and Jodie Williams from the secretariat for their hard work, assistance and guidance. It was Wednesday, 21 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2059 certainly much appreciated. I would also like to publicly thank the 19 individuals and 130-plus organisations, 11 of those from Tasmania, who took the time to offer their submissions to the committee. I would like to say that their thoughts, their ideas and their suggestions throughout those hearings were much appreciated. I commend the report to the House. on Community Affairs on aspects of youth homelessness has in fact been tabled in the House and I have spoken on it in the chamber. This morning I just wish to add a few comments to the remarks that I had made that day. As we know, times for consideration of reports are short and this report is in fact very long. The report contains 129 recommendations. I touched on some of those in my earlier remarks, and I would like to go to a few more of them now. The first one I want to touch on is the fact that many people in submissions raised the question of some form of temporary payment for young people who are homeless or being evicted or being left stranded in traumatic circumstances and then it taking a substantial time for them to find some form of support. That is certainly a serious issue that we should be aware of. But at the same time there was a concern that that may well lead to frauding or to the allowance and support being diminished or demeaned in the minds of the community. We therefore recommended that the applicants should be dealt with very quickly. In other words, if the government could not respond within a day or a day and a half or so of an application, that was the government's fault and not the applicant's fault, remembering that in the report we recommend that all such applicants should have face to face assessment by a professional social worker and that it not be done by telephone or some other form of correspondence. I will come back to that in a moment. We have recommended therefore a probationary period for the allowance, so that within six weeks of the first payment being given the department would be required to review whether that payment should be sustained, and the review would be required to be substantiated with a case plan. I am not wishing to use the words 'case management' there but 'case plan' to make sure that we have taken into account the person's circumstances: home life, relationship with families, schooling and accommodation. So rather than simply granting an allowance and leaving it at that we recognise that the money is not usually the major problem; it is very often the other aspect, the support, that a young person needs. The first six weeks is the best possible chance for reconciliation with families. In that context the other raft of support measures such as extended families comes into play. A young person being fostered by a stranger is giving more support to that family than if it is some relation. In other words, we may well be able to find in that first six weeks, in that probationary period, alternative arrangements that offer more than money but rather offer support for that young person. That probationary period is a fundamental shift in concept because it indicates to the young person and to the family that the payment is not a permanent process but rather a means towards establishing a better long-term circumstance. That long-term circumstance may well be independent living or it may be reconciliation. There is a range of choices. The way that it has operated to date has been very black and white: if a person receives a payment, someone is making a permanent judgment about him or her and/or the family, and that is not helpful. Going further in terms of the alternatives available, the honourable member for Bass( Mrs Silvia Smith) spoke just briefly about refuges. The fact is that as a government, with the agreement of state governments, we do not allow special refuges for young people under the age of 16 years. We accept that they can go to a youth refuge as a matter of crisis or a matter of urgency, but we do not accept that refuges are solely for under-16-year-olds.",163,Representatives Main Committee
323,Mr Allan Morris (Newcastle),"by leave-This report from the Standing CommitteeMC 2060 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 June 1995 That really does pose a major problem. What we are facing around Australia is effectively a lack of alternative care. We were told by state departments that adolescents of 13, 14 or 15 years age who may have had behavioural problems, who may have had problems at school, who may have had problems with family breakdowns, are hard to foster. In addition, with the reduction in the number of state institutions-and institutional care is not the appropriate form anyhow-we are finding a very big gap in community support. Refuges are not a good place for young people to go to. The age group for youth refuges is notionally 12 to 14 years of age, so we may have a 13-year-old or 14-year-old who has just left home under extremely traumatic circumstances in a crisis situation housed on a temporary basis with young offenders, people in their early 20s in very difficult circumstances. In the same way as gaols are not necessarily a good place to send people for relatively minor offences, the refuge situation is not advisable. That point of view came through from the whole community. Refuge workers were telling us that they should not be taking in 16-year-olds and 14-year-olds and 13-year-olds because it is not an appropriate environment. So we have suggested that the state and Commonwealth governments should explore an alternative form of SAAP which focuses on younger people. Some form of community living, where people can live in a community context but with a home style environment, is required. Some states have played with the idea of community housing but, quite frankly, we could not find enough examples to justify using them as a model. They were too discrete and too narrow, if you like, for us to say that they would be suitable across the country. At the same time as we had the Commonwealth and states saying that they would not have SAAP accommodation solely for under-16-year-olds, which is an acceptance of the fact that it is not appropriate, we had the refuge in Western Australia that I mentioned where five of the six young people staying there were under 16. In other words, five-sixths of them were under 16. The reality is that an enormous number of young people are going into refuges because they have nowhere else. There is a desperate need for SAAP to be refocused. The report strongly urges the state and Commonwealth governments to review that situation and to perhaps look at some SAAP accommodation services that would be for under 16-year-olds but different from what we have now. Another point that we need to perhaps emphasise more strongly is the question of psychiatric illness, its prevalence and how it is treated. The report quotes the evidence of Professor Kosky, who was an extremely valuable witness to the inquiry. He had a great d.eal to offer in this area. He pointed out that about half of all psychiatric illnesses are diagnosed by the age of 19 and that the median age for half of those diagnosed mental disorders is 16 years. The under-20 age group receives about seven per cent of the funding. Adults make the decisions about the budget but it is that youriger age group where there is an enormously high level of psychiatric disorders. The budget that goes towards that group is in fact is very low and quite disparate. At the same time, with the deinstitutionalisation of psychiatric institutions that has been occurring; we are finding fewer and fewer resources available. The capacity for youth workers to diagnose whether a person has a behavioural problem or a psychiatric problem is minimal. There is no training available. These youth workers are not trained in that way. In fact, in the Northern Territory, we found that there are no psychiatrists, so people could not be diagnosed. There is a failure by governments, state and federal, to recognise that psychiatric illness is a Wednesday, 21 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2061 major issue with young people. The illness is both undiagnosed and untreated. It is certainly that group which provides the major source of homelessness. Professor Kosky also made the very valid point-I do not think anybody else raised it-that, in many cases, a young person with a psychiatric problem, which may be developing even before they reach their teens, will be seen as having a behavioural problem. Because the illness happens gradually and develops over time, the family will accommodate it and it often leads to a family breakdown. So, rather than the homelessness being a result of family breakdown, the family breakdown may be a result of a psychiatric illness that is not diagnosed. The parents, the family and teachers see it as a behavioural problem. They see the child as being wayward, undisciplined, uncontrollable, all of those terms that we use. In fact, Professor Kosky pointed out that in many families one parent will often take the side of the child and the other parent will not. It is that difference which often breaks up the family itself. Undiagnosed psychiatric illness of some young Australians is leading to family breakdown, which, in turn, leads to homelessness. Lack of perception and understanding of that is a major problem. This whole area is ignored. So when we talk about training our youth workers we are not talking simply about training in counselling. We are talking about training in recognising that a young person may not have a behavioural problem but may have a psychiatric problem which, if treated and dealt with, may mean that person can be restored not just to the community but to his or her family. A division having being called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.07 a.m. to 11.21 a.m. available. The first one is the question of schools as a place for early intervention and early recognition of a young person-and, in many cases, a family-experiencing trauma. It has been raised with me that teachers are trained to teach people, and that is certainly the case; but teachers are also very aware when their students are in difficulty or their performance changes dramatically over a short time. The fact is that in most cases they have no-one that they can refer to, because our systems are so caught up with crises. What we need to see is a much closer partnership between the education system and the community services sector-and, in some cases, the health sector-so that when a teacher perceives that a pupil is in difficulty there can be a very quick response at that very early stage. The way to address this problem is to try to prevent it occurring in the first place. Homelessness is not always preventable, but it certainly can be diminished from what it is now. That would require intervention and family support much earlier than we currently have it. One of the vehicles that we propose in the report is the use of the auditing provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. That is being put forward as a vehicle for premiers and prime ministers to start to look at policies on children and the family as one policy-across, between and within governments. Within anyone government we may have five or six ministers and departments all covering this area. In the states we have health, education and community services and juvenile justice departments all involved in some way. When looking at state and federal ministers combined, we may have 30 or 40 ministers involved, and their areas are treated as separate issues. We are arguing that there should be one policy within each government-one policy for each state government and one policy for",165,Representatives Main Committee
324,Mr Allan Morris,"I want to touch briefly on a couple more things in the short timeMC 2062 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 June 1995 the federal government-and they should be coherent. Rather than it being the responsibility of junior ministers and a junior part of their portfolios, it should be seen as being a problem for premiers and prime ministers as a major national focus. We put those structural changes forward because they really do need talking about. This report is not the end of the story: it is a vehicle for consultation and discussion. I expect that in the next few months the youth sector and the community sector across Australia will start to talk about this issue in a different way. We have tried to produce a report that they can work with and work their way through. I am urging governments of all persuasions and at all levels to listen to that debate, to listen to the community, and to watch their response to this report. The report may not have all the answers, or even the best answers, but it is a vehicle to help find some of the best answers for the sake of those 22,000 to 30,000 young people. They need much more than simply reports; they need some actions. During the inquiry we had a lot of help from a lot of people, and I want to make sure that that is recognised. In the months ahead we want those same people to stay engaged. They became part of the inquiry, and they are part of the report. This report is tabled by the committee, but it belongs to a lot of people. All those people who took part in the inquiry are now part of the result of it, and I encourage them to stay in support of this issue. Debate (on motion by Mr Hicks) adjourned. Employment, Education and Training Committee Report Debate resumed from 10 May, on motion by Mr Fitzgibbon That the House take note of the paper Employment, Education and Training for this particular inquiry, but I am interested in training programs in Australia, particularly in the vocational education sector of Australia. It is for that reason that I took an interest in the report entitled A best kept secret. That is an excellent title for this report, because training schemes in Australia do not have a high profile with the general public, but they do very effective work within the community and their role is very important. The reference was to look into improving small and medium sized enterprises' participation in, and access to, the training market, including Australian vocational certificate training, and training services that could be offered. It is very important that we are aware of how we can actually improve small and medium sized business enterprises in their training. The big companies in Australia are able to do this because they have the resources, the personnel and the financial facilities. But the small and medium sized businesses do need expertise and they do need skills in their particular businesses. Australia does have to work out how best to ensure that our young people-and sometimes riot so young people-are given the opportunities to upgrade their skills. This issue is particularly to the fore at the moment in Tasmania. I know of a couple of medium sized engineering companies and one of them feels that it may even have to relocate to somewhere else in the world because it cannot get the skills from the work force that is presently there. That problem is in relation to building the big catamarans in Tasmania. The demand for building more of these large vessels has created a demand for skilled people. But",167,Representatives Main Committee
325,Mr Miles (Braddon) (11.25 A.m.),"I was not a member of the Standing Committee on Wednesday, 21 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2063 within Tasmania and, the company thinks, within Australia there are not sufficient people skilled to undertake these projects. That is a concern for a country like ours. The group training schemes in Australia are very well placed in that regard because they enable small and medium sized businesses to take on apprentices or trainees-which are the two areas the schemes cover-and, if a particular business has a downturn, the person can be slotted into another enterprise but their training or apprenticeship can be continued. Once upon a time, the situation was that an apprenticeship was indentured to a particular company or person and if that person's business went through very difficult times and the apprentice or trainee had to be put off, they were left in limbo. Quite often that happened to many of our young people. So the group training schemes, which have actually been around since about 1981, came into being so that we could try to create a situation for training our young people without them running into the possibility that the business they had gone into was unable to see them right through to the end of their training or apprenticeship. The group training scheme is an excellent way of meeting the ups and downs of industry, of small business and medium sized businesses, but at the same time ensuring that we have a mechanism for training skilled people. This report really does underpin and give new impetus to group training schemes and I am pleased to be able to make a few comments about it. It is very important that we have this sort of structure in Australia so that, as we go through adjustments in the economy, there is flexibility to maintain a training base at the apprenticeship and traineeship level. The second issue discussed in this report is that of links with schools. At this stage, there are not good links with the schools in regard to training. I believe that within Australia there needs to be a restructuring in regard to our schooling and training, and in how ANTA operates TAFE colleges. This raises the question of the division of our schooling system into primary, secondary and college sectors. This is a historical division and I do not believe that it is any longer appropriate for our schools. The report alludes to one of the difficulties in regard to training: the lack of contact in Australia between training mechanisms and schooling. If we looked at this area more thoroughly, we would find that the division in educational terms probably should come at the end of year 8, instead of at the end of year 6. We need a new grouping, a new way in which we operate our schools, such as a segment from year 9 to year 12, or even from year 12 to year 13. Perhaps there should be educational institutions which run from year 9 to year 15, with diploma courses. There needs to be a linkage with training now, particularly from year 9 to year 12. Many of our young people who are going on to apprenticeships or vocational education are in schools in year 11 and year 12. They do not want to go on to university, but they do want to start to develop their skills in a particular vocational area of interest, long before year 13. This report does give some indication of a greater need for linkages for some of our students. I believe that those linkages should run, in particular, from year 9 to year 12. There is a great need. Those schools which are involved at these stages say that there is a lack of the support and funding required to bring about this adjustment. On the one hand, there is ANTA, which funds the technical and further education colleges and training institutions around Australia, but on the other hand there is a lack of interface with the schooling sector. This report alludes to that deficiency in its overview and recommendations, when it says: MC 2064 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 June 1995 The development of links between schools and work places is a key component to the success of the Australian Vocational Training System. I would like to underscore that. There is a need now for the articulation of linkages between our schools and the training system. The third point I wish to raise is that the committee noted: ... there are grounds to question the value of short non-accredited and non-articulated vocational training courses which were developed without extensive input from prospective employers. There are large numbers of our population, mainly young people, who are in training programs which are non-accredited and non-articulated. Frankly, most labour market programs of that type lead nowhere. We are deluding many of the people who go into these training courses. They know that it is tough out there to get jobs and they believe that those courses will lead to reasonable possibilities of employment. In fact, there are probably hundreds of people who are already more qualified in those particular vocations than those who do the non-accredited and non-articulated vocational training courses. This report highlights once again the lack of reality there is in our spending, as a nation, a lot of money on courses which lead many of our young people nowhere. I think many of us know that out there in these labour market training schemes there are people who have done course after course and are becoming pretty disillusioned because the courses mean nothing. They mean nothing to employers, in particular. Ultimately, the people who have done them see them as irrelevant and worthless. WhatI would encourage the government to ensure is that all training courses are in some way accredited and lead on to further courses. A labour market training program or course, even if it is for only 10 weeks, should in some way be articulated to and linked in with either a certificate course or a diploma course. It should not be a dead-end training scheme. I believe we are, essentially, only conning people who get involved in these training schemes. What they really need to be given is courses which are accredited. If we are going to have a successful Australian vocational certificate scheme, all our resources involved in training need to be directed into the types of courses which do have a genuine standing in the community, and particularly with employers. This report highlights the need, when we are talking about training in a whole range of industry sectors, to know where industry is going. There has been a problem with training in Australia, in that the people doing the training have often lagged behind in knowledge of where business is headed. I think that is one of the reasons why there is a lack of skilled people in certain sectors within Australia. In that sense we need to move particularly to a much more market orientated training system, as I believe is the present view of the board which runsANTA. The group training schemes in Australia are involved with 14,000 or so people at the moment. About 13,000 of those are apprentices and about 1,200 are trainees. They fulfil a vital role in the training sector within Australia. To ensure that they continue to do that I would support the recommendations in this report that there is a need for core funding to these organisations to be maintained so that they can plan and know that they are secure. They are a flexible arrangement which ensures that training and apprenticeships can be ongoing, irrespective of the downturn of particular businesses, so that people can be moved around. That is vital. There are always going to be adjustments in the Australian economy, across a whole range of different vocational areas. Group training schemes, as this report states, are ideally suited to ensuring that we have a trained work force. Therefore, I commend the report. Wednesday, 21 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2065 Employment, Education and Training and someone who took part in the development and finalisation of this report, I would like to start off by thanking the other members of the committee for the work that was done. A range of members put quite a bit of time into this report and I think the results are there in the recommendations and in the report itself. I would like to thank the secretariat of the committee, John Cummins and Lorraine Ball in particular, for the many hours of work that they put into the construction and development of this report. The work that they have done has been a significant consideration in coming forth with a report which is very extensive and comprehensive and gives a coherent approach toward what may happen in the future with group training-which, as the report says, is Australia's best kept secret. I will say a little bit on group training. As has been mentioned by the honourable member for Braddon( Mr Miles), it is a uniquely Australian system. We were unable to find evidence elsewhere in the world of a similar system. It has the capacity, when working correctly, to work into industries at all levels and particularly to develop training programs which are appropriate for small and medium sized businesses. As of June 1994 there were 104 group training companies across Australia and they employed approximately 13,000 apprentices and 1,200 trainees. The companies operate on an industry or a regional basis in both rural and metropolitan Australia and across a range of industries. It is interesting to note that, although apprenticeship numbers across Australia during the 1990s fell by 22 per cent, during the same period group training apprentict<ships increased by 28 per cent. In a situation where the market share was falling, the group training system was obviously doing something right in terms of its share of the market increasing. Industry group training companies operate in a range of sectors, for example, the automotive, retail, housing construction, electrical engineering, plumbing, finance, manufacturing, hospitality and local government sectors. The group training company acts as a broker and an administrator in the operation of apprenticeships. Many businesses are not large enough financially to sustain an apprentice in their own right and the administrative and other costs which relate to developing an apprentice are difficulties for small businesses. Often there are situations where particular industries are facing downturns. The circumstances this year may be such that a construction firm can afford an apprentice but the circumstances next year may be such that the firm cannot afford an apprentice. These circumstances create a number of problems for the apprentice. Occasionally an apprentice is midway through an apprenticeship and he or she loses the apprenticeship because of a downturn in the employing industry or company. This situation results in a loss to the nation in terms of the investment of education and training in the apprentice. The investment can be jeopardised or lost because of downturns in particular industries. Downturns in industry affect not only the personal situations of the apprentices involved but also the trained work force and the investment that Australia makes in its young people. Group training companies are able to rotate apprentices to industries where work is available. The committee was informed of occasions in the construction industry where, for a period of time, it may be necessary for the group training company itself to take apprentices on board in order to keep their heads financially above water until the industry improves and until opportunities are available for the apprentices to continue their training. In some circumstances, rotation results in a better rounded apprentice and, eventually, tradesperson; a tradesperson",168,Representatives Main Committee
326,Mr Griffin (Corinella) (11.39 A.m.),"As a member of the Standing Committee onMC 2066 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 June 1995 who is able, on occasion; to move from employer to employer, and, therefore, to become more aware of different aspects of their industry. The committee held hearings on the Gold Coast in Queensland and members of the committee were able to speak with people from the construction industry. An example was provided to the committee that an apprentice who works with one carpenter may become an expert at hanging doors or an expert in other aspects of the construction industry. In the process, that apprentice will obtain a broad understanding of a range of other issues. The apprentice will develop significant expertise in particular areas, but not in other areas. Through the group training approach, it is possible, on occasion, for apprentices to move from tradespeople who are working in particular aspects of an endeavour to tradespeople who are working in other aspects. Tradespeople are better tradespeople at the end of the process. They are better able to make their living and they are better able to contribute to the economic well-being of the country. There is another important issue about group training. Group training companies perform a pastoral care role in respect of their apprentices and trainees. The young people who go into apprenticeships are usually only just out of school. This employment may be their first paid employment and there can be a range of teething problems during their adjustment from school to empJoyment. Staff are available to assist with any problems that may occur in group training. Hopefully, they would be able to address problems which may develop in a young person's life which may jeopardise their capacity to continue with their apprenticeship and, in that way, improve the circumstances for a successful completion of that training and for transition to employment from education. With respect to the overall situation, training, diversity and independence are hallmarks of the group training companies. In that way they are able to adapt to circumstances better than in a number of other training programs. They are able to react to the needs of an industry and to the needs of a region much more quickly than many other forms of enterprise and ensure that they maximise employment and opportunity for the people they serve. One thing that came out through the inquiry is a concern that there is a lack of knowledge of the real importance that group training plays. Hence the title of the report, A best kept secret. One concern the committee did note and has asked to be acted upon in its recommendations is the need to further develop the concept of group training and the publication of that throughout the community. There are something like 30,000 small businesses which presently access group training, but in the region of 10 times that number of employers in the small and medium sized businesses are not aware of it, or do not access it but certainly could if circumstances allowed. Therefore, there is a capacity for a lot more employment to be developed out of this process and for a lot more valued and experienced trades people to develop. That scope ought to be used. Group training essentially has a community based structure in terms of its committee of management and it works very closely with industry in its area. In that way it is able to develop good quality programs in the local area. Another thing that the committee looked at was the question of links between schools and workplaces. There needs to be more publication of the value and opportunities of group training within the education sector. In that situation we mean particularly secondary schools but, also, to an extent, technical and further education. It was apparent from the committee's Wednesday, 21 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2067 hearings that there were quite a few schools which were not availing themselves of the opportunities and, therefore, not highlighting those opportunities to the kids who were coming through their system. That is a shame because there is a lot more capacity for things to be done in this sector. The member for Braddon talked about labour market programs and effective pathways in training. That is an issue which government as a whole has recognised is a concern and has tried to address in recent years. Certainly the development of the AVTS is about that. It is about developing pathways and having a situation where training-whether it be through T AFE, secondary school or through labour market programs-is designed to lead to qualifications that are real, are of value and can assist people to move into employment. A range of the changes that government is implementing at the moment is all part of that and should ensure that the results sought come to fruition. Another issue which was mentioned was core funding for group training companies. This concern was raised with the committee because of the great variation in the balance sheets of group training companies. We had circumstances where some group training companies had very significant financial assets while others did not. One thing that also came through from the hearings and the evidence taken was that there was a great variation in the level of accounting standards applied at various group training companies. The government has recognised that it is important that core funding be maintained and that essentially, although group training companies in some cases have moved into other forms of labour market programs and training and development, and that that is something that should be encouraged, the focus should still be on apprenticeships, in particular, and traineeships, and that in those circumstances core funding is essential. It should be recognised that sometimes there are very important reasons for the variation in financial balances according to group training companies. For example, a group training company operating in the building industry-an industry which is renowned for its highs and lows---can, more than most other industries, be facing the situation of having a number of apprentices in difficulty and needing subsidisation over a period of time until they are able to get employment elsewhere. In those circumstances, that larger financial balance sheet is essential. The question of what companies do with those financial assets is also important. We saw numerous examples of group training companies endeavouring to be innovative and intelligent about the use of those financial assets and trying to maximise the bang for the buck. That also has to be looked at. However, there needs to be an improvement in financial standards within group training companies. There needs to be a lot more detail and commonality in terms of statistics gained from those group training companies. What we have here with group training companies is a very good initiative. It is an initiative that can be improved on. What it requires is more information as to the success that is out there and the capacity to be able to use-that information in a way which benefits group training companies in terms of their initiatives, and which also benefits their target groups. By their target groups, I mean both the apprentices, potential apprentices and trainees out there, and also the businesses which they play an important role in serving. The other aspect is the question of best practice. We saw great variations in what group training companies do and how they do it. On some occasions, as I mentioned earlier, the circumstances of a particular industry or, for that matter, a particular region may justify the MC 2068 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 June 1995 difference in the results that are achieved. However, I certainly took the view-and I think other members of the committee did too-that there were best practice stories out there that needed to be highlighted and that needed to be passed on to other group training companies in the area. In that way, we could develop a better system. Another issue which I had some concerns about during the inquiry was the placement of group training companies throughout Australia. It was apparent to me that there were some group training companies which had areas which were too large for what they were actually endeavouring to do. In that way, there were gaps in the overall regional coverage of the system. There were also gaps in terms of areas where group training companies were not allocated. In those circumstances, when we are looking at the establishment of more group training companies-and that is certainly something that should be considered-we must be very conscious of those gaps, we must endeavour to identify them, and we must ensure that resoufcing is committed where it is really needed. I would like to finish where I started and once again thank the members of the committee, including the member opposite, the member for Hinkler( Mr Neville), who played an important role in the development of this report. I would also like to thank the chair, the member for Hunter( Mr Fitzgibbon), for his activity and energy during the process of the hearings and during the report deliberations. I would particularly like to thank John Cummins and Lorraine Ball and the other members of the secretariat for the very hard work they put into what is an important report for government to consider and to act upon in the future. When we look at maximising the bang for the buck from government in terms of labour market and other programs, this is the way to go. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired) Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled A best kept secret: report on the role and effectiveness of group training companies. As the report's title says, group training has been, up to now, our best kept secret, but with the tabling of this report it has now become an open secret. I think the whole system that we have looked at is indicative of the unique way that we do things in Australia. As the member for Corinella ( Mr Griffin) said, we cannot just rest on our laurels and let things happen willy-nilly. This is a good model and it needs to be refined so that it can go on to deliver further forms of training. In saying that it is indicative of the unique way we do things in Australia, that is not to say that group training schemes are out of the woods, so to speak, in terms of their long-term security, or that they have a perfect structure. It is a matter of continuing improvement. Equ.ally, it can be said that the organisation has a lot more to offer in structured training as a partner with government and as a conduit for delivering training to neglected areas of enterprise, such as small business. Further, its multi-disciplined approach across a wide range of enterprises and trade sectors gives the scheme the opportunity to set standards of world's best practice in the area of vocational training. It is a concentrated group with a national structure and, through it, the government can channel best practice methods into training. It can become a leader. Its structure is such that it can set these new standards and methods of deliyery not only in group training but also in refinements of that such as competency based training. I spoke briefly on this matter when the committee's report was tabled in the main chamber, and I welcome this opportunity to expand on my views in this debate. I should declare that",171,Representatives Main Committee
327,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (11.54 A.m.),"I rise to speak on the report of the House ofWednesday, 21 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2069 this is a movement very close to my heart. I do not have a conflict of interest in this, but I suppose I do have a profound interest in it as I was a founding director of a group apprenticeship scheme in the infancy of the organisation. I have seen it grow from one employee and a handful of apprentices, in my own area, to a scheme of 180 apprentices in Bundaberg and 130 apprentices in Gladstone in 1995: ' During the height of the recession, the organisation had been on the brink of potential failure only to bounce back through singular effort on the part of the manager, staff and directors. I have seen how demoralising it is for a team of voluntary workers to be threatened with the withdrawal of state and federal core funding. This is a very important aspect and I would like to touch on it. I am glad that the report deals with this in some detail. I will mention one of the instances that occurred at that time. There was a group training scheme, which can remain nameless, which was receiving $180,000 from the state and federal government. At that time, the scheme, with about 150 employees, was returning $540,000 to income tax collections. So, if we take $180,000 from $540,000, the public purse, be it state or federal, was $360,000 in ftont. Some schemes at tl}at time were threatening to close. Had that scheme or a scheme in similar circumstances decided to close, the cost to government of the dole would have been $900,000. So, on the one hand, we would have had a profit to the public purse of $360,000; on the other hand, there would have been a loss of $900,000. The difference to government would have been $1.2 million. If this is multiplied by the 50 or 60 schemes that were around at the time or by the 104 schemes that are around today, one can see the extraordinary potential that group apprenticeship schemes have not only in creating jobs and delivering vocational training but also in assisting government in removing the curse of unemployment and removing young people with skills from the dole queue. Group training is delivering about 11 per cent of Australia's apprenticeships and, in my own state of Queensland, it is as high as 15% per cent. In my own area, the Wide Bay, Central Queensland part of Queensland, at times the figure has been as high as 30 per cent. It could be said that, in the general area of my electorate, at times, nearly one-third of all the structured vocational training has been delivered by this scheme. As the honourable member for Corinella mentioned, the committee visited my electorate and I was happy for it to inspect works at three places-Bargara, Bundaberg and Gladstone-and we saw excellent work being carried out by BACAS, the Bundaberg group apprenticeship scheme, and GAGAL, the Gladstone scheme. Both organisations have bid for and received substantial housing projects from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Planning in Queensland. That is very much to their credit and it is hoped that will continue. Most of the schemes across Australia rely very heavily on the building industry in one form or another. If this is not to continue or is to be cut back because of the rise in interest rates or-to introduce just a small political dimension to this-the 12 per cent on building materials, I hope it does not impact on these schemes. At Bargara, near Bundaberg, and at Wattle Grove, in Sydney's west, we saw another interesting dimension of this: the delivery of competency based training in progress on site. We saw another innovative thing here, where TAFE teachers were delivering their vocational training and skills training not on the TAFE campus but away from the colleges in on-site classrooms. You yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, saw that. It was a particularly interesting concept. We were not just talking about theory; we saw it in practice. MC 2070 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 June 1995 We heard of apprentices who potentially could be through their courses in 21 months by that method. I am not suggesting that they will be through in that time-there is something to be said for keeping young people under proper supervision for a longer period-but competency based training is something that cannot be overlooked. Again group training, because of its disciplines and its structure, has the ability to deliver those new forms of training in the best manner. This suitability to handle major projects such as in the building industry is illustrated by the fact that 21 per cent of all group training apprentices were employed in the building industry, while in the allied field of electrical, a large proportion of which is household el.ectrical, it is as high as 13'h per cent. We can say, I suppose, that over a third of all apprentices in group schemes are in the building industry or allied fields. The motor vehicle trade, at 15 per cent, and food, at 12 per cent, provide the next level, and at the third level we come to things such as metals and hairdressing. I am pleased to note that the first recommendation of the committee, of which I was part, is that the Commonwealth, state and territory governments should agree to continue to fund core activities. Having been on the committee I find that there is a mood in some sections of the bureaucracy at present that we can throw some money at a problem, we can get a committee of willing volunteers together and they will run it for us, and when they have been doing it for a year or two we will slowly withdraw the government funding. Nothing could cause more damage to the group training scheme than that attitude. Those who work on one of these committees know what it is like to have to select staff, to go to meetings to supervise the setting up of the organisation, to arrange for the employment of apprentices, to carry out all the financial disciplines that are required in a big scheme turning over millions of dollars every year-'--all this being done at difficult times by voluntary workers. The last thing they want is the threat of the core funding being removed. They are prepared to provide the time, prepared to provide the energy and prepared to make sure that the statutory requirements of the Companies Code are met-that the staff are disciplined through the proper mechanisms, that competent staff are there, that submissions to government are made in an appropriate and professional manner and that all those other duties that company directors have are carried out. They should not then have someone tum around and say , 'Well, you know, we are thinking of reducing your funding.' One of the criticisms of the scheme, which was touched on by the honourable member for Corinella, is on the matter of financial standards. We were not saying in the report that anyone was conducting a shonky business-quite the contrary. But we were saying that there were no common financial denominators against which the schemes or some of their programs could be assessed and judged. I think group training schemes would be well served, in getting the best practice into that field of group training endeavour, by having some common denominators so that government can make an assessment of where group training can go in the future. I would like to add my own note of criticism to this idea of some in the bureaucracy that it is okay for the group training schemes to fund their activities from non-core profits but under no circumstances are they to use their core funding to run other schemes. There seems to me to be a lack of logic in that equation. Also it portrays the bureaucracy as saying that it is okay to fund core activities out of profits made from other government and private programs. Again, there is that lurking suggestion that core activities somehow in the future might be able to be Wednesday, 21 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2071 funded privately. The core activities in all these schemes should be corralled and identified, which they will be if these new financial standards are invoked, and governments, state and federal, should concentrate on that area. What the schemes do beyond that is on their own heads and they have to account for that in the normal fiduciary ways. There were three areas that I found particularly interesting in the recommendations, and I was pleased to participate in them. There is the recommendation that the Department of Employment, Education and Training, in consultation with Group Training· Australia, develop a network of placement coordinators. Now that is happening in some respects on an informal basis between schemes but it is critical to have a form of coordination to place people in jobs at the end. The schemes have a very good track record. Just before I came in today, I had a look at some evidence that was given to the committee. The credit union group training company of New South Wales, New South Wales business trainees and the Bankstown retail skills centres were guaranteeing that over 90 per cent of their apprentices and tt:ainees would get jobs. That is an amazing strike rate, and it is not a strike rate that is coming out of other government workplace programs. In South Australia, in the hospitality industry it was found that those young people coming out of the group training schemes had a better chance of employment and a higher rate of employment than other apprentices. Again, it shows that young people who go through these schemes are much sought after. One other point I make on that is that having placement coordinators is a better form of control than just having case managers. Another one that I found pleasing was that group training should move in providing services for small business-I think that has been long awaited. Also DEET should accredit group training schemes to be able to carry out other labour market programs, and ANTA should allow group training schemes to carry out assessments. After all, they are the leaders in the field, yet sometimes they have to bring in people from organisations of lesser expertise to help them. I congratulate my fellow members of the committee, I compliment John Cummins and his staff and, indeed, compliment Tom Quinn, the President of Group Training Australia, for his cooperation with the committee. apprentices and place those employees on a rotational basis with host employers for the duration of their indentures. Group training is uniquely an Australian scheme of providing people with skills necessary to make them productive members of the work force . .The companies occupy a particular niche in entry level employment and training in small and medium sized business in Australia. Taken together, group trairiing companies are the single largest employers of apprentices and trainees in Australia. This makes them potentially one of the most powerful forces for the implementation of change. Their strength is their diversity, and the independence given to them gives them an ability quickly to respond to the special needs of their business clients, their industries and the regions they serve. The contribution that group training companies can make in ensuring that workers develop the skills necessary to guarantee Australia's long-term prosperity into the next century has been recognised. Group training companies have responded to the challenge of a radically changing approach to vocational education and training. This is particularly so in Tasmania, where there are no longer the same opportunities to train with big companies, to go from a trainee all the way through to the ranks of the executive.",174,Representatives Main Committee
328,Mr Adams (Lyons) (12.09 P.m.),"Group training companies recruit and employMC 2072 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 June 1995 Nowadays employers want skills from the time the worker starts and cannot afford to take on several levels of trainees. They could perhaps take on a first year trainee, but could not at the same time carry a third year trainee, whereas another company may require the skill level of a third year trainee and therefore be able to take on one at that level from the group training company. It gives the opportunity for trainees to gain their skills in a more varied environment. For instance, in the hospitality industry a first year trainee might start in a city takeaway and spend a second year in a hospital, a third year in a suburban hotel and a fourth year in an international hotel. This gives a much greater scope for experience than ever in the past. There are still some opportunities for going through with one company but these are much fewer than they were in the past. The development of links between schools and workplaces is a key component of the success of the Australian vocational training scheme.· As yet, many of the school systems have not reached out to create genuine learning partnerships with employers. This report says that group training companies are ideally placed to provide the link between schools and the workplace, and they must be supported to enable them to playa key role in the implementation process. Tasmania boasts one of the early group training companies, which was established through the boil ding industry training board, partly as a result of the downturn in the building industry. Stan Joiner set upa group training scheme in 1984 and had a contract for 48 apprentices over four years. In actual fact, the company had 57 in the first 2Y2 years. In 1987, the third full year of operation, itturned over $1 million dollars and was employing around 63 apprentices, with up to 60 employers on its books. It was successful because there were many employers who could not carry apprentices for the full four years and this scheme allowed them to retain apprentices. Their businesses had a lot more flexibility because of the scheme. Now there are many schemes all over Australia. But Tasmanians have become more innovative at times, because we have fewer resources than most other states-as I am sure you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker. Necessity being the mother of invention is avery apt idea for us. Now, as things change, the group training schemes themselves have to become broader and take on the concepts of both apprentices and trainees. They need to meld them, develop modules to suit particular industries or businesses, and develop what is, after all, a chance for young people to get the proper training so they can apply for jobs that are available. The report has recognised that the maintenance of funding of core activities is essential. Although other business activities are useful, they must not be at the expense of apprenticeships and traineeships, building the core skill level for our country. It is strongly suggested that funding be recurrent, to take into account the special role that group training companies play in enhancing the skills of the Australian work force. Group training can assist small business and there is a recommendation that will encourage small businesses to take advantage of these schemes and also seek to have them promote the services that group training can provide. There are a lot of other positive recommendations that come from this report. The committee found that group training has helped to get a lot of people back to work, and it has proved very successful in Tasmania; but we are still only dealing with a very small percentage. The challenge now is to get more people to use the scheme, and it appears that medium and small businesses can be a growth area if it is made easier for them to have access. This may be Wednesday, 21 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2073 helped by making the processes simpler and much easier to understand. There are so many different programs and names, and letters spelling out even longer names, that it is hard for everybody to keep u-specially people in small and medium sized businesses, who do not have the same access and opportunity to pick up on government programs. There needs to be a strong selling point from group training companies in this area. They have to market themselves much better. They need to be very conscious of being out in the marketplace, gathering in these small businesses so that they can become a part of group training's overall process. There is ongoing funding to promote the concept of group training, and this may help the process become simpler in the longer term. I am pleased to see you, Mr Deputy Speaker Ftizgibbon, in the chair. As you said in your speech introducing this report earlier this year, group training companies have shown their potential to adapt to changing circumstances by diversifying their activities, and it is important that this be recognised and that this potential be used to its fullest. I am sure that we all agree with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on those comments. This scheme should be used to the fullest extent, continuing to train Australians to give us the skill level that we need to be in front of our competitors in the world. As we go into Asia we need to continue to keep that skill level high, from our technical trainees through our fitters and our electricians to our building companies. We need to keep the skills right through, now that opportunities are broadening out for vocational training, and give people broader opportunities. We need to build those pathways into the future from our education system--from high school right through to people receiving degrees, in the longer term-over a longer period of time than we ever have in the past. Talking to a number of overseas people at the global cities conference in Melbourne last year left me in no doubt that Australia leads the world in the way that we are developing training and employment opportunities. This report is a very important part of that. There is no doubt that we are on the edge and that this report must be considered as an important part of the ongoing debate on training and the direction in which we are going. I have a daughter involved in group training, and she seems to be achieving a very good result from her involvement; so from a personal point of view this has also touched me.
