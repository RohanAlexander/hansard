There are sixty-five clerks now in the 6th subdivision of the fifth class. 6. The apparent congestion is the result of the general advancement of junior officers to the maximum of their class, which was higher than it was under the State. Promotion can only be given on the recognised principles, namely, when a vacancy in the higher class occurs, or where the value of the work and the merit of the officer justify advancement. ter-General, upon notice1. Is it true that the senior letter-carriers in Victoria were, for four years prior to the reclassification scheme propounded by the Public Service Commissioner, in receipt of £150 per year, secured to them by State law, Act No. 1721, and that by such scheme their salaries have been reduced to £138? 2. Is it true that junior letter-carriers in Vic101 as to sale of cofFee, No. 17 (d) as to overtoria were, by the same law, entitled to salaries rising by increments from £ 9 0 to £132 per year; that two increments were granted, lpringing such salaries up to Commonwealth Government has refused to grant Hie third increment to bring the salaries up to £132? 3. Is it considered just or reasonable that the rights and emoluments of transferred public servants, secured to them by State law, should be taken from them by Commonwealth law ? 4. W i ll the .Postmaster-General submit to the Public Service Commissioner, for reconsideration, the question whether the grade system should be allowed to prejudice existing rights and interests, and whether the increment system up to a maximum of £150 would not be preferable? monwealth Public Service Commissioner has 12 th September the honourable and learned furnished the following information in conmember for West Sydney asked the follownexion with questions 1, i , and 3:1. Yes. Under section 19 of the Victorian Public Service Act, No. 1721, some of the senior letter-carriers in Victoria were raised, just prior to Federation, to £150 per annum. .£138 per annum was fixed under the classification as fair remuneration for their work, against which Ihey made an unsuccessful appeal to the High Court. 2. No. The majority of the officers referred to became letter-carriers under a regulation providing a minimum of £72 and a maximum of £108 per annum. This, however, a few days before Federation, was superseded by a regulation providing for discretionary increments up to £132, and the latter was replaced by the Commonwealth regulations, under which they are eligible to eventually advance to £138 per annum. 3. Yes. as it has been held by the High Court that Act 1721 conferred no permanent right, the State provision being merely a temporary one, pending the Commonwealth legislating itself for its public servants. The reply to the last question is4. There is no objection, but it may be stated that this question has already been thoroughly considered by the Public Service Commissioner, and in his report presented to Parliament on the 31st October last, he estimates that to abolish the grade system would involve the Commonwealth in an increased expenditure of £75,000 per annum. following papers :Provisional regulations under the Pacific Island Labourers Act relating' to proceedings for obtaining orders for deportation.

What amount of payment, if any, has been made to the clerical staff for any extra time worked by them since ist January this year? 7. In view of the representations made by the Acting-Deputy Postmaster-General and the heads of branches, General Post Office, Sydney, concerning the overworking of the clerks, does he intend to provide any further relief for these officers besides that which is expected to be received in consequence of the amalgamation of certain branches? The answers are as follow:'-1. The number of clerks now employed is fourteen less than at the date of transfer to the Commonwealth. The number at the latter date having been inadventently stated at 194, instead of 242. 2. Twenty-three clerical positions have been abolished', but Ipther positions have, in the meantime, been created, leaving 228 clerks now employed. 3. It is difficult to say at present, but it is thought that about ten officers will be surplus when the amalgamation is effected. 4. Certain officers expressed such an opinion, but, as already stated, the Public Service Commissioner, after an examination by his inspector of the work of the General Post Office, Sydney, intimated that so soon as the proposed amalgamation of branches is given effect to some of the present positions will become unnecessary, and there will be a superfluity of officers. It is proposed to abolish certain unside, and the Commonwealth Government necessary work, and also to simplify the transaction of business in various directions, and thus afford relief to all concerned. 5. It is necessary at times for officers to remain on duty beyond the regulation hours of attendance to cope with the work, and to perform special or urgent work which will not admit of delay, but this condition of things is not Sydney. 6.

The amalgamation of branches is in progress, and will be completed shortly, and, it being anticipated that the clerical staff will then be in excess of requirements, it is not considered necessary to appoint any additional clerks to the branches concerned. (SPECIAL DUTIES) BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from n t h September, vide page 4365): Clause 2Section eighty-seven of the Constitution is altered(a) by inserting after the word "" Excise"" the words "" (other than special duties of Customs and of Excise)""; (b) by inserting after the word ""balance"" the words "" of the revenue from those duties (other than special duties)""; (c) by adding at the end of the section the following paragraph :"" A special duty of Customs or of Excise is a Customs or Excise duty upon goods of a description rfot liable to Customs or Excise duty on the first day of January One thousand nine hundred and seven, and imposed expressly for specific purposes."" way of amendmentThat the words "" 'Excise,' the words '(other than special duties of Customs and of Excise),' "" paragraph a, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" 'Expenditure,' the words 'other than expenditure for a national scheme of old-age pensions.'"" External Affairs) [2.47] Honourable members will see that under our proposal it is intended to alter section 87 of the Constitution by placing special duties of Customs and Excise beyond the restriction to one-fourth to which all revenue derived from Customs and Excise duties is now subject. Under the proposal, of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, however, the raising of special duties of Customs and Excise is put on one will be entitled to charge against the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue now returned to the States, the whole cost of a national system of old-age pensions. Under the Government proposal, any future Parliament could provide any portion of the monev required for old-age pensions by peculiar to the General Post Office, imposing ""special duties. The amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would render the imposition of special duties unnecessary, because the Commonwealth' would be able to deduct the money required from the amount now returnable to the States. As I have already stated, I hold that as, when the Constitution was framed, an understanding was arrived at that for at least ten years three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue should be returned to the States, we ought not to adopt the course proposed by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie without the consent of everv State. I explained at some length that the proposed change could be made if t his amendment were accepted by a majority of the States, instead of by all the States.",15,Clerks General Post Office Sydney
28,Upon Which Mr Frazer Had Moved By,,16,Constitution Alteration
29,Mr Deaki N (Ballarat,"Minister ofit that the object of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is to avoid giving the Government a roving commission, which would enable them to levy special duties for any purpose that they pleased. pensions are to be provided for out of Customs and Excise revenue, without committing myself to support the amendment in its present form, I think that the proposal of the lionorable member is preferable. I have a very strong objection to the imposition of extra taxation through the Customs House. Honourable members may say that this is due to my free-trade proclivities, and, of course, that may be very largely the case. is not a fn*e-trader, but a revenue tariffist. woman will be entitled to a vote?"" Then, revenue tariffist, but a straight-out free trader. I am opposed to piling up burdens of taxation upon the poorer sections of the community. It is well understood that no large amount of revenue can be derived from Customs duties without taxing, the necessaries of life, and it follows, as a natural consequence, that the, poorer sections of the community have to bear the greater part of the burden. It has been suggested that special duties] should be levied upon tea and kerosene to provide the funds necessary for old-age pensions. Any such imposts would impose a specially heavy burden upon settlers in the back blocks, such as miners, farmers, shearers, and others, and upon the poorer dwellers in cities. Moreover, if such duties are imposed, we shall be practically calling upon, those who will most need the benefit of old-age pensions to' make the necessary provision out of their own pockets. This would be a paltry and contemptible proceeding on our part. Committee will resist any proposal that will have the effect of imposing greater burdens upon the poorer classes. support the amendment. The operation of the Braddoni section would not be interfered with, except in regard to the provision that might have to be made for old age pensions, and the amendment is therefore preferable to the original proposal. As I have recently pointed out, we are at present collecting £ 2 5s. per head of the population in Customs and Excise duties, and this is the highest amount contributed in that form in anv civilized country in the [164] world. If we were to impose special Customs duties for the purpose of raising another ,£1,500,000 to enable us to provide for old-age pensions, we should add 7s. 6d. per head to the taxation through the If old-age Customs, and thus bring the total up to £ 2 12s. 6d. per head. I remember that when the Commonwealth Constitution B i ll » was before the people, Mr J. H . Gordon, of South, Australia-no w Judge Gordonwho was a member of the Convention, addressed a large meeting in Adelaide, which was attended by both Conservatives and Democrats. Mr Gordon was arguing very strongly in favour of the Bill Turning first to the Democrats, he asked: "" What fault can be found with the Bill? Isi t not democratic enough, seeing that every man and turning to the Conservatives, he said: "" Is it not conservative enough, seeing that all the revenue required by the Commonwealth will be derived from Customs duties, and the working classes will therefore pay the whole of the taxation?"" That was quite honest. I do not think that even the Prime Minister would deny that the revenue derived from the Customs House comes, principally from the workers of Australia. If we, as a Parliament, are not prepared to impose direct taxation, it will be a good thing for us to utilize a portion of the present Customs and Excise revenue, and thus reduce the amount returnable to the States. Then the States may find it necessary to f a l l back upon direct taxation. If we deprived them of a certain part of the revenue which is raised by indirect taxation, I suppose they would have to resort to direct taxation to make good the amount. has argued that at the presenif) time it I trust that the would be unfair to propose an amendment of the Braddon section of the Constitution, because if the matter were referred to the electors, it is quite possible that two of posed amendment, whereas the remaining four States and a majority of the people might pronounce themselves in favour of it. If the States hacl federated upon the understanding that the Braddon section was to continue in operation for ten years, and if this Parliament had violated that understanding, I admit that there would be some force in his contention. But it is beyond the power of the Parliament to do that. Any amendment of the Constitution can",16,Constitution Alteration

If a majority of the people of Australia and a majority of the States supported any proposed amendment of the Constitution, it is only reasonable to assume that a large number of the electors in the other two States would also declare themselves in favour of it. I have ai vivid recollection of tlie time when the draft Constitution was about to be submitted to the electOK-. of New South Wales for their approval. mund Barton, Mr Wise, and other strong advocates nf its acceptance, pointed out that (he Constitution itself prescribed the means by which its amendment could be secured, if the people deemed the adoption of that course desirable. I believe that a large number of electors in that State voted for the Constitution because they recognised that it was within the power of the people themselves to amend it if they so desired. When the right honourable member for East Sydney returned to Sydney from the Conference of Premiers at Melbourne, he pointed out some of its defects, and declared that its greatest blemish was the Braddon blot. He urged that, so long as that section was retained in the Constitution, there would be a great temptation to the Commonwealth Treasurer to raise 'money by means of direct taxation, because, by so doing, he would be. able to retain the whole of the funds thus derived for Commonwealth purposes. In speaking of the Braddon section, he saidIt is a very serious matter which I am putling to you.

I have not seen him doing that since he entered this Parliament. The right honourable member continuedI give these Treasurers notice, and those who speak with them, that if they come into this Federation with me, and those who side with me, so far as I am concerned, they must come into it on this footing : that they must look out for themselves. If they are in a mess they must get themselves out of their own mess. In the Federation there should be as fair and equitable a 'division of the national taxes -as, if I may be allowed to say it, we have here. Throughout the Convention I In view of those statements, I think we are quite justified in asking that all the taxation for our national requirements shall not necessarily be raised through the Customs. I may add that if the amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie be defeated, I am almost persuaded to vote against the proposal of the Prime Minister.

I am not in favour of the scheme submitted by the Government, nor am I enamoured 'of that put forward by the honourable member for K a lgoorlie ; but I should select the latter as the lesser of two evils. I trust, however, that those accustomed to deal with financial questions will yet evolve a less objectionable scheme. -We are in effect asked by the Government to submit to the electors of Australia the question"" Shall we anticipate by three years the alteration in our financial system which was contemplated when the Constitution was framed,"" and which I venture to say no one thought would be continued after the ten years period fixed by the Braddon section had elapsed. The only question which the electors will have to consider' in this regard is whether the provisions of that section should cease next year, or three years later on.

The great mass of the of what she collected prior to Federation, and that while she is paying old-age pensions out of the additional revenue so received, she is still able to show a surplus? I repeat that I agree with the honourable member for Barrier that no Ministry which fails to bring in a Federal scheme ought to be allowed to remain in office. next Government will be confronted with the difficulty which presents itself to the existing Administration, and which others have had to face-the difficulty of finding the necessary funds without raising three times as much as is really required for fhe purpose. Our financial readjustments have caused much friction, and some of the States Treasurers have availed themselves of every opportunity to criticise the Federal Treasurer and the Federal Parliament. It is time that we had a scheme by which we could make each Treasurer independent of the other. The Question as to the amount to be returned to the several States of course involves another consideration. I lean very strongly to the proposal that we should agree to the payment of a fixed sum for a certain number of years, and so enable each State Treasurer' to know exactly what his position is, while leaving ourselves free to raise whatever further sums we need for Federal purposes. confess that, although I am as much averse as is any one to the imposition of additional Customs duties, I can see no other means of securing a Federal old-age pension scheme. In the abstract, I am with those who have advocated direct taxation. I suppose that most of us in the abstract prefer direct to indirect taxationi. but when we have said that we have said all we can on that phase of the subject. cannot be induced to recognise how much better it would be to bear direct taxation, and so to be called upon to pay less than they have to do under a scheme of indirect taxation. the average elector that £ 1 paid at the present moment will satisfy the demands of the Government so far as he is concerned for, say, another twelve months, but that if he refuses to make that payment he may be taxed indirectly to the extent of 30s. in the course of the year. Whilst he will a.gree that direct taxation is the cheapest in the long run, he will at the same time finger his sovereign, ,and say, "" Let me keep it, and you may take what you want from me by mean,s of people prefer indirect taxation; and I think it would require many years to educate them up to the point of paying by direct, as opposed to indirect, taxation; anything like the sum we shall require for this or any other purpose. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie proposes something The so radical that I am impelled to think that he hardly realizes what his proposition amounts to. very genlerous. honourable member allowed himself to be influenced by the fact that just now two or three of the States are showing a large surplus. ing about £ 4 per head by way of Customs taxation, and I think that is quite enough. extent with the honourable member, and I am glad that the amount of Customs taxation per head in Western Australia is gradually being reduced. I am afraid, however, that the honourable member has been induced to make his proposal by the fact that the two largest States which have I independent old-age pension schemes have what is to them an enormous surplus. He thinks rightlv enough, from his point of view that States which have so much public money to spare ought not to be asked to raise, by means of indirect taxation, a further sum for a Federal old-age pensions scheme. I wish to ask him to look for a moment at the position of the State of which he is a representative, and The bulk of the people to consider what would be the effect of his proposal upon it. As the result of the operation of the sliding scale, the revenue collected from Customs and Excise duties in that State has been reduced during the It is useless to point out to last four or five years by something like £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, and the Treasurer of Western' Australia is to-day struggling with an enormous deficit. The Government are just now fighting hard to impose direct taxation; but I shall be very much surprised if the Upper House allows them to do so.

At the present time there are hundreds of men out of work in the Kalgoorlie district alone, and the Treasurer of Western Austalia says that the reason why public works are almost at a standstill is that, because of the operation of the sliding scale upon the Customs revenue, there is not enough money to do more than he is doing. AlthoughI can see many objections ""to the proposal of the Government to raise additional taxation, I think that the only way to provide for a Commonwealth old-age pension scheme, which the people have declared for at two or three elections, is to raise monev by means of additional duties. I prefer to fake that course rather than say to the electors, of Western Australia, "" To provide for old-age pensions you must give up £85,000 of your share of the Commonwealth revenue."" that the Committee will not accept the amendment, but will adopt the proposal of the Government. I thoroughly approve of the proposal for the establishment of a national system of old-age pensions, and shall assist the Government in every way to take all the steps necessary to facilitate its preparation and adoption. In my opinion, the means suggested by them are the best under the circumstances, and my views coincide with those of the honourable member for Fremantle as to the unwisdom of adopting the amendment. Section 87 of the Constitution was once known as the "" Braddon Blot."" believe that it received that name in Svdney during the anti-Bill campaign. wards it became known as the Braddon section, a more respectable name; and it now deserves the title of the Braddon guarantee, as it .is generally regarded as one of the guarantees of the Constitution against Federal extravagance, and for securing the return to the States of a well defined and ascertained proportion of the net revenue from Customs and Excise. I think that it was a wise thing to insert this provision in the Constitution, and that it should be allowed to remain in unimpaired operation for the ten-year period assigned to it. people whether they are prepared to alter that period. is made in the Constitution for the amendment of this as well as of other sections; but how would representatives of New South Wales view a proposal to amend section 125, which says that the Federal Capital shall be in that State? Section 87 is as much a part of the Federal compact as is section 125, and, whilst the majority of the people voting in the majority of the States may have the legal and constitutional right to amend these and similar provisions, I should be sorry if Parliament were disposed to sanction any act of Federal repudiation. learned member supports the proposal of the Government, he is supporting action such as he condemns. It is only a question of degree. the large as well as of the small States have, I hope, therefore, I understand, agreed to a scheme such as is proposed by the Government for the setting aside of the revenue from special duties-whethe r upon tea or kerosene is not material now-for the purpose of providing a fund for the payment of national old age pensions. The adoption of this scheme leaves the Braddon section unimpaired,, and, consequently, does not allow any violation of the sacred conditions of the Federal compact. Those who favour the establishment of an old-age pension system would be wise to pause before pressing the amendment to a division, because its adoption is likely to defeat the end they have in view. If the amendment were agreed to, the proposal which would have to be placed I before the people would meet with the strenuous opposition of the Governments of Afterthe States, and probably the most influential members of the States Legislatures.",21,Constitution Alteration

I welcome the proposal of the Government, and I shall give it my hearty support. I was very much astonished to hear the I believe that it honourable and learned member for Bendigo advance the arguments he did in favour of the Government proposal. Apparently, he is one of those who suppose that the instrument under which we are federated should not be altered under any circumstances. Yet, apparently, he is in favour of amending it in a certain way. According to him, we must not lay our iconoN o doubt the peoclastic hands upon the Constitution in one direction, but we may do as we please in another. We may pile upon the shoulders of the hapless people as many additional burdens as we like, but the moment we endeavour to curtail the privileges of the States as such, we are told that we shall run counter to the wishes of the members of the States Parliaments. These gentlemen must not be affected; but the unfortunate people, who may be bulldozed by articles in the press or hypnotized by speeches delivered by persons gifted with the power of oratory, may be imposed upon to am unlimited extent. The honourable and learned mcnber for Bendigo supports the Government proposal, which is to amend sejction 87, and yet claims that that section of the Constitution should I think that a be allowed to remain in operation for the f u l l period of ten years.

Our position may be similar to that of the man on a race-course who is approached by another, and is induced to pay him over £ 1 upon the promise that if something happens he will be paid back his money and something in addition. But upon his afterwards searching for the man who has his money, he is unable to find him, and his money is gone for ever. How can we tell what will happen ? War might break out, or there might be rumours of war, and no sane person believes that the Treasurer would hesitate for one moment as to the purpose to which he should devote any money at his disposal if old-age pensions weighed with him on the one hand and the bubble reputation which war would bring influenced him on the other. The right honourable gentleman has swum on to glory on the top of the Coolgardie waterworks scheme. This was lifted by the godsout of the pit of Hadesby a chance, the right honourable gentleman was lifted with it . Now he has induced the Government to embark In a hare-brained scheme, and to pull down the Constitution to which we and so many others attached our names in the belief that it would prove sufficient for all our purposes. should have thought that honourable members of the Opposition would have been anxious to descend, like the cohorts of old, upon this proposal. sitting still, or, at any rate, not saying very much. learned member was not here when we discussed the proposal upon a formeroccasion. am doing my best now. I shall not vote in favour of any scheme for the imposition of fresh taxation unless I can see that some definite good will result from it. If I , as a free-trader, were told that £ 5 ° > ° > wanted by way of bounty for the encouragement of a languishing industry, I should be prepared to consider the matter as a business proposition. Eveni f it were proposed to afford assistance to the industry by imposing Customs duties. I mieht be disposed to lend a favoring ear. This, however, is no such scheme, because if an industry were to be supported we should have to look forward to receiving less, rather than more, revenue. This is nothing more nor less than a device to make the poor unfortunate public pay more for what they eat and drink and wear. I believe that in such matters as this direct taxation is the best check upon extravagance. We have heard a great deal about the extravagance of the Commonwealth Government, but what is to be said with regard to the financial management of some of the States Governments. I remember that one of the chief complaints made against the See Government, in New. South Wales, was that it lavishly spent enormous sums of money which were placed in its hands as the result of the increased revenue returned to New South Wales under the Commonwealth Tariff. When a Government has a large surplus it must get rid of it somehow. Deputations come from here, there, and everywhere, and submit all sorts of schemes, arid Ministers must be adamant to resist their appeals. In view of the fact that we know exactly how much will be required for the payment of old-age pensions, I propose that the money should be obtained by means of direct faxation. It does not follow that a direct tax must be a tax upon land. Under the German pension system, the funds are provided in the 'majority of cases by a tax upon receipts a stamp tax. I am . astonished that it should have been reserved for the honorI able member for Fremantle to point out the disadvantages of direct taxation. I do not claimi that direct taxation is more attractive than indirect taxation. In many fBut we find them respects it is not. As a matter of fact, one of the main claims of indirect taxation to preferment is that it is evasive, and, to some extent, dishonest. It is a specious pick-your-pocket kind of taxation. When a man is told that at the end of the year he will have to pay for his water at the rate of 8d. or is. per gallon he is careful as to the quantity he uses. When you know what you have to pay you know exactly how far you can go, and direct taxation is one of the best possible checks n( w as upon extravagance either by the Federal or States Governments, or by municipal bodies. Direct taxation cannot go on and on indefinitely in the same way that indirect taxation may be imposed. The present isituation affords an effective illustration of this point. Every day in this House the Government brings forth a fresh proposail for taxation.

We ought, in my opinion, to resort to direct taxation,' to which members of the Opposition are largely pledged, but which they do not seem very much disposed to support. It is in the last degree important that some limit should be fixed to Customs taxation. If we impose direct taxation, we shall be extremely careful, as to what we are about. There are plenty of means by which we can with safety to the community, and without injustice to the States, and without laying our fingers upon the Constitution, provide the funds necessary for the. payment of old-age pensions.

A l though it is put in that form, I have always understood that the Commonwealth is to discharge all those duties as soon as it can conveniently do so.

The honourable and learned member for West Sydney spoke very strongly in favour of the imposition of direct taxation to provide for old-age pensions.

But no such proposal is before us.

I agree that, its consideration being complicated by the fact that the conditions of the States differ widely. While we are all in favour of the principle of a Commonwealth old-age pensions system, we must give a great deal of attention to the details of any scheme propounded for its establishment. I agree with the honourable member for Mernda that we may be forced to accept the proposal .of the Government as the best put forward; but I think that some provision should be made as to the date on which the Bill shall take effect. It is manifest that the ""Governments of the States are awakening to the need for dealing unitedly with the financial position of the States and of the Commonwealth. It is clear, from letters which I received last week front two of the State Premiers to whom I had submitted my views on the subject, that they are determined that it shall be deaJt with. But the great questions involved in the consideration of the financial position cannot properly be dealt with in any piecemeal fashion. I think that the Governments of the States will resent the proposal of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to reduce their share of the Customs and Excise revenue. They may take it as a_threat on the part of the Commonwealth to the effect that, if they do not provide old-age pensions for their people, we shall take the matter into our hands, and provide for therm out of the revenue returnable to them. I do not hold the view that all the powers conferred upon the Commonwealth by the thirty-nine articles of section 51 of the Constitution are to be put into operation at once, and to be construed so as to make them as far-reaching as possible, and in fa,vour of the Commonwealth as against the States. We shall do best if we co-operate with the States in regard to all matters such as this. We hear about the extravagance of the States, but there may also be extravagance in Commonwealth administration. In any case, the people of Australia have to bear the burden of unwise expenditure. may be compelled to vote for the Bill as it stands. I think that sufficient advantage has not been taken of the power of conferring with the States in this matter. I shall certainly vote against' the amendment; because we have no right to coerce the States; and I regret, for the reasons I have stated, that, without any request from the States, or any expression of desire on the part of the people, we are now unnecesi f the present opportunity is not taken, it may not be convenient to refer the question to the electors for another three years, but I think that nothing would be lost by even so long ai delay as that, and that the consideration of the subject might well be deferred until the financial position of the States and the Commonwealth can be effectively considered and dealt with. I hold myself free to vote against tlie Bill. seems to me that the honourable member for Boothby has furnished the strongest argument against the adoption of the amendment. It needs only a cursory examination to show that it would result in an evasion o. responsibility by the Commonwealth. <: We should place upon the States the necessity of finding the money required for the payment of old-age pensions. The amendment provides not only that the necessary money shall be deducted from the present Customs revenue, but that it shall be the first charge upon such revenue. under a misapprehension. The amendment is proposed to be inserted after the word expenditure,"" and not after the word ""-Excise."" ment placed in my hands by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie certainly puts an altered complexion on the matter. Now it appears that it is proposed that the .whole amount necessary to provide for old age pensions shall be taken out of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue that is now returnable to the States. If that course were adopted, the Commonwealth would not be called upon to pay its share of the expense. If the Constitution were altered in fhe direction proposed by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, it would be a very serious matter for the States, and more particularly for the smaller States.

I am always quite willing to give the Government the benefit of any suggestions that occur to me, but, unfortunately, they do not often accept them. In connection with a previous debate I -pointed put that the Government were neglecting the opportunity presented to them to deal with this matter much more effectively than by treating it in an isolated manner. I suggested that provision for the payment of old-age pensions should be made in connection with the settlement of the grave financial questions which must, within a very short time, engage our attention. take ? proposals were reasonable, it should not take long. to anv such agreement. be remembered that to some extent tihose parties will have to give their assent to the Government proposal. vears. Governments of the larger States oppose the Ministerial proposal, I fear that the majority of the electors necessary to secure an alteration of the Constitution will not be forthcoming. Another objection which I entertain to this Bill is that it indicates the intention of the Ministrv to Taise by means of additional Customs duties .at least £ 1 , 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 annually. They are already committed to a policy of increased protection which must result in a reduction in the amount derived from the Customs. Consequently, I am compelled to conclude tlhat they will not be able to raise the funds with which to pay old-age pensions from that source, and they will be compelled to resort to direct taxation. So dissatisfied am I with that position that I would rather support the amendment of the ihonorable member for Kalgoorlie than the Government proposal. The Government policy of increasing the protective character of the Tariff will compel them to resort to direct taxation for the purpose of raising the £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 00 required to pay old-age pensions, whereas the amendment will at the most, compel the States Governments to adopt that form of taxation. Personally I would rather leave direct taxation to the It is not States, especially in view of the fact that we already raise a great deal more revenue than we require for our own purposes. BurI do not think tihat either the Government proposal or the amendment really touches the root of the question. I would further point out"" that if the States Ministries are not satisfied with the proposal of the Government they can go a long wav towards defeating tlie proposed amendment of the Constitution at the polls. If in two of the States in which old-age pensions are at present being paid, the Governments oppose the proposal of the Commonwealth Government, they can do a very great deal to prevent a majority of the electors throughout the Commonwealth voting in favour of it. apply with greater force to the amendment? Would not the States Governments oppose that even more strenuously ? It must would oppose it quite as strenuously.

I should like to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to a few figures which seem to indicate"" that if the bookkeeping' provisions of tihe Constitution had been tackled seriously, it would have -greatly facilitated the settlement of the question of old-age pensions. If a n d I put the figures as an example only-instea d of proposing to return to the States£ 6 , 9 4 9 , 000 during the current financial year, it had been proposed to return to tfhem only their actual, three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, the Commonwealth would have had an additional sum of £ 3 1 1 , 0 0 0 available for its own purposes to go towards the initiation of a national system of old-age pensions? The effect would be, as compared with the Treasurer's proposed distribution for 1906-7, that New South Wales would lose £403,000. and Victoria£ 9 4 , 0 0 0, whereas Queensland would gain £ 7 6 , 0 0 0.",32,Thomson Bu T How Provide For Old Age Pensions But I Can

Under a per capita distribution, instead of £6,949,000 being returned to the States, the amount returnable to them for 1906-7 would be £6,638,000, which is their exact three-fourths of the estimated revenue. The effect of that would be that New South Wales would lose £403,000, and Victoria £94,000, whereas Queensland would gain £76,000, South Australia £80,000, and Tasmania £53JOOO, whilst Western Australia, with a special allowance of £338,000, would lose £23,000. then occupy the position of the poor relation. than she has under the operation of her special Tariff. We should be merely saying to her "" We will not continue the troublesome bookkeeping system and your special Tariff, but we will make you an allowance for your higher revenue per head in a lump sum.""

As a matter of bookkeeping, therefore, he would gain about £114,000. Similaily, whilst the Victorian Treasurer would lose £94,000, he would be relieved of the payment of £208,000. Thus, there is an opportunity presented to secure what is very desirable, namely, the adoption of the per capita system, with advantage to those States whose finances are at present strained, and with no injury to the finances States in respect of any increased revenue of the Treasurers of New South Wales and Victoria. that we shall ever have to secure the adopfind it very difficult to make its revenue tion of that system of distributing, expenmeet its expenditure.

The Government in power must put forward a scheme for the payment of old-age pensions throughout the Commonwealth, and take full responsibility for it. It is only in this wav that the matter will be satisfactorily dealt with. If a. number of big financial corporations were in the predicament of the old people in some of the States, the reform necessary to remedy their grievance would have been passed long since. Parliament should not continue session after session to do nothing in this matter. But while the injustice being suffered by big corporations would be voiced in every newspaper, and spoken of from every platform, the old people of the Commonwealth can only whisper in their homes, or remain silent while nothing is being done. The Government have now come forward with a scheme which, although it is not such as I quite approve of, should not be subjected to a microscopical examination. There must be a difference of opinion as to what is the best thing to do. Whether the Government scheme is the better with or without the amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is a question upon which the people mav well be asked to give their opinion. What is proposed is a direct appeal to the people. The electors will be asked whether they are in favour of the establishment of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions, and, if they are, they will vote for the proposed alteration of the Constitution. submitted. tion of the Constitution were sanctioned, the Government would propose the raising the largeness of the majority. of special duties to obtain the revenue necessary to provide Federal old-age majority of the people in the more populous pensions. is incapable of doine so should remain in office. the amount necessary cannot be raised tend to vote for it, because I think that, if through the Customs. opinion, not a matter of policy. If the necessary money is not obtained by special duties, more money will have to be obtained by other means. But justice must be done to the aged poor of Australia. There is something in the statement of the Prime Minister that, when the Constitution Bill was before the people of Australia, it was understood that the Braddon section would continue in operation for about ten years, and that it was upon this understanding that the States Parliaments agreed to the Constitution ; but the objection that it will not be necessary to obtain the consent of all the States in order to effect an amendment of the Constitution is, after all, largely of a sentimental character. If it were proposed to make some change in the Constitution without consulting the people, the position would be entirely different. Although we passed the Constitution only a few years ago, it is very much like the grasp of a dead hand. New people have grown up and new ideas-mor e enlightened ones, I hope-no w prevail. The object of the amendment is merely to remove an injustice, and to assist those who cannot help themselves. It is not proposed to give one State an advantage over another. The amendment seems to me to present the only way in which we can do justice to those who are least able to help themselves, and I dare say that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would be prepared to put his amendment to the test of the approval of all the States, instead of only a majority of them. If that course were adopted, we should ascertain the true feeling of the people with regard tp the payment of old age pensions. The proposal need be defeated in only one of the larger States in order to bring about its rejection, because it would be a very difficult matter to secure the support of the majority of the neoole States were opposed to the scheme.

272,Mr Fisher,"Although it mightit will meet with the, acceptance of the people. I know that the States' Treasurers have had great difficulties to contend with in the past, but we must not forget that we are entering upon a period of prosperity. The States' revenues are increasing, and, I trust, will continue to do so. The payment of old-age pensions by the Commonwealth would relieve every State to a certain extent of direct financial responsibilities, and would inevitably have the effect of increasing industry, and thereby adding to the prosperity of the community. It is a singular thing that those States which have provided for old-age pensions are the most prosperous. the honourable member could establish the connection between the two circumstances. prosperity has been directly due to the provision made for old-age pensions, but I could show plainly how general prosperity is contributed to when the State makes provision for the proper treatment of the aged and infirm poor. The responsibility of providing for those who cannot help themselves f a l l in a large degree upon our s very best citizens. It is not borne equally by all those who might reasonably be called upon to bear a share of the cost, but the whole burden falls upon the shoulders of those whose energies and enterprise should, in the interestg of the whole community, be free from any restraining influence. Under such conditions the community, as well as individuals, suffers. That is the reason why it should be one of our principal objects to see that the most deserving and valuable members of the community are not unduly burdened. A . scheme of old-age pensions would adi'ust matters equitably, and would throw some share of the burden of maintaining the aged poor and infirm upon those who, at present, do not discharge their legal and moral responsibilities. The States which, according to the Treasurer's statement, claim to be the most prosperous, have, so far, failed to provide for old-age pensions. The Treasurers who claim that their States contribute more revenue per head of the-population than do others protest that they cannot afford to provide for old-age pensions. There must be something radically wrong in such a condition of affairs. It is most regrettable to think that we cannot look with any prospect of success to anv f u r ther negotiation between the States and the Commonwealth with a view to arriving at a settlement of this much vexed question. We are told that every effort has been made by the Prime Minister and the Treasurers of the States, and that no satisfactory result has been arrived at. I understood the Prime Minister to say that the Premier and Treasurer of Queensland had no objection to the imposition of special duties with a view to provide for old-age pensions, but I have heard it rumoured recently that he is not prepared to consent to even that course being adopted. Kidston objects to the proposed amendment of the Constitution, because it is not proI do not think that posed to limit the powers of the Commonwealth to providing for old-age pensions only. He argues that the authority to levy I do not say that the special duties might be used for other purposes. He also thinks that any amendment of this kind would involve some risk of further interference with the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue returnable to the States. taken in getting in or out of bed, but we cannot very well avoid incurring them. It is singular that trouble always arises in regard to any proposal for an old-age pension scheme. Although it may be said that the whole of the States in which no provision is now made for the payment of old age pensions are agreeable to the Government proposal, no steps have been faken to induce such States to agree to contribute out of their present revenue the amount necessary to meet the expenditure in connection with the proposed scheme. Premiers, as well as the Federal Parliament, some responsibility to the people? of what the States Premiers have done, but I am setting forth the facts so that the people may know exactly where they are. The same people who elect representatives to the States Parliaments also send representatives to this Parliament, and I wish them to understand that what we are aiming at, and what the States Governments also are aiming at, will involve the same amount of taxation whatever the way in which the question may be settled. It should be the obiect of the Government of every State in which no old-age pensions are provided for to bring about the adoption of a Federal scheme as soon as possible.

I am sorry that I cannot support the proposal of the Government, which, I adI f we were to mit, is a practicable one so far as it relates to the raising of revenue with which to pay old-age pensions. My position is that I do not desire to see the people who But that cannot possibly be the are poor as the result of having been obliged to contribute so largely through the Customs compelled to find the money with Much which to pay these pensions. I admit that many of the recipients of old-age pensions are probably poor through improvidence, but the more improvident they have been, the more they have contributed through the I admit that from Customs. AlthoughI am a protectionist, I do not propose to add to their burdens. other side is that, if all the people of Australia became teetotallers, the States Treasurers would be ruined. sorry that I cannot support the amendment, inasmuch as it would throw upon the States the responsibility of providing the necessary funds with which to pay old-age pensions, and consequently they would say, "" Seeing that we are to provide the money, we will undertake the payment of the pensionb ourselves."" The intention of the present Government is that special duties shall be levied only for the purpose of paving old-age pensions. But Governments come and go.

There must be some reason for the maintenance of the same expenditure as before on outdoor relief in New South Wales. cally the expenditure has not been reduced. estimating the cost of poor relief in the various States, the upkeep of benevolent institutions, as well as the expenditure on old-age pensions, should be taken into consideration. The burden which the establishment of this system would place upon the people would not be so great as a cursory examination of the scheme leads one to suppose. Under a Federal system a considerable amount of the expenditure now incurred on poor relief in the States would merely be transferred to another heading, and its allocation would be more readily ascertained. The people would then know exactly what was being done with theii money. I fail to see how we should be able, under the Government proposal, to obtain the sum necessary to finance this system. In the end, we should have either to resort to direct taxation, or, as the honboth the schemes before the Committee. orable member for North Sydney said, force the States to do so. I hold that we should take upon our own shoulders the responsibility for our own expenditure. If we are going to institute a system of old age pensions, and take credit for it, we should also take upon ourselves whatever odium may attach to the imposition of the increased taxation rendered necessary by it. We ought not to ask the States to do that which we do not care to undertake for ourselves. I do not attach much import.ance to the outcry raised in opposition to a tax on land values. Many people do not recognise the distinction between such a tax and a tax on land. We have in view the taxation of land values which have been largely created by the people whom we are now proposing to assist. Manv of them, in times gone by, have borne the heat and burden of the dav. and much of the increased values of land to-dav are the result of the strenuous lives they have led in developing the resources of Australia. That being so, I do not think we ask too much when we call upon the owners of that land to contribute something towards the maintenance of these old people. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would involve our trenching too largely upon the revenue which the States hiave a right to expect. In these circumstances, it seems to methat I have to choose the lesser of two evils. alternative, unless I vote for the rejection of the whole proposal, and that I am not prepared to do. I would remind the honourable and learned member that, even if the amendment of the Constitution be agreed tp by the people, the scheme by which the Government propose to raise the necessary funds for old-age pensions will have to be submitted to the next Parliament, and. that honourable members will then have an opportunity to criticise it. do not approve of it, they may then reject the scheme. have to choose between the lesser of two evils, and I , therefore, propose to vote for the Government proposal.

385,Mr Joseph Cook,"I am glad to him for some time, and have found it rather difficult work. able and learned member has been following the leader of the Opposition for some time he has been doing so afar off. A p parently he now wants to keep a little closer to him. I heard with surprise this afternoon the reference of the honourable member for Wide Bay to the triviality diat was involved in amending the Constitution. He declared that our Constitution, which is only six years old, represented the grip of ai dead hand. .that of all Constitutions. of our Constitution. The Age to-day describes it as nothing but a clumsy compromise able member himself called it . that our Constitution ought not to be amended until we cannot achieve the ordinary legislative objects which we have to pursue under it by any other means. Now the question arises, "" Isi t necessary to alter the Constitution in order to give effect to that article in it which empowers us to legislate in respect of old-age pensions?"" I do not think that it is. The only reason urged by the Prime Minister against the amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie was that it would violate the 87th section of the Constitution, which he declared was part of the original bond. Does he suggest that his own proposal will not modify that section? that the Prime Minister does not propose technically to trench upon the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue which is at present returned to the States, but he does propose to undermine the source from which that revenue is derived. It has been impressed upon us time, and again by our statisticians that our Customs duties average themselves over any material period with almost unerring accuracy. tempt to raise another £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 through the Customs for the purpose of paying old age pensions must necessarily according to all statistical and economic lawdeteriorate the sources from which that revenue is derived. Minister is proposing only I have been following alteration as will permit of a different allocation of the revenue raised through the Customs, he is in reality undermining the If the honorsources of that revenue, and therefore vitally interfering with the 87th section of the Constitution. If he desires to do that, he might as well call the States Premiers together and frankly inform them of his intentions. I claim that there' is no necessity either to ear-mark Customs duties or to impose further Customs taxation to anygreat extent. Under the amendment submitted, the Government may sail merrily along and expend the whole of their one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue. I understood him to say During the present year the Treasurer proposes fo expend £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 more than was expended last year. Then they will be at liberty to take an additional £1,500,00 0 out of the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue which would otherwise be returnable to the States. The inevitable result of the adoption of the amendment must be to drive the States to direct taxaI venture to say tion, and to such an extent that it would be a very serious impost upon them. Let honourable members clearly understand that it would mean compelling the States to impose an additional land tax of 2d. in the £ 1 without any exemption whatever. posal than I thought it was. them to do anything like that. in New South Wales, to begin with.

But all the necessitous States would require to make the provision which I have indicated. to levy a tax of 2d. in the £ 1 .

My object in rising is to reply to one or two of the remarks made by the honourable member for Parramatta. His attitude in regard to the proposed amendment of the Constitution is extraordinary. Of late he seems to have been inoculated with the idea promulgated by the 'Argus and other similar journals that the Constitution is so sacred that hands must not be laid on it lightly. But a few years ago he and I , in common with, others, were denouncing it as a most ineffective instrument. He now sneers at the statement which he says has appeared in the Age, that the Constitution may be described as a "" clumsy instrument,"" although it is not long since fie applied much stronger terms in its condemnation. A short time ago he held that the Constitution was bad, and that one of its worse features was the provision which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie desires to amend. was the head and front of the objection -whi:h the right honourable member for East Sydney. the honourable member for Parramatta. and others of us tcok to the draft Constitution, when its acceptance or rejection was before the oeople of New South Wales.

Then, again, although he now finds no phrase too strong to hurl <at those who advocate direct taxation, he a little while ago objected to any other but direct taxation. I do not blame him for objecting to the imposition of direct taxation by the Commonwealth Parliament, if he pledged himself to his constituents to oppose it ; but when difficulty arises he, like other honourable members, is free to seek for fresh authority fromi those who sent him here. As to his statement that the Labour Party have no concrete scheme to put forward for the establishment of a Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme, my answer is that in this The existence of that provision respect our position is the same as that of the Opposition: we are not in a position of responsibility, and are therefore not compelled to put forward a detailed scheme for raising revenue.

None of the items to which I have referred could very well be interfered with, and it certainly would be difficult to cut them down materially. the sugar bonus is naturally' a largely increased one, owing to the legislation passed for increasing the Excise and raising the amount of the bounties to a corresponding degree. The increase this year will amount to about £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 . how difficult it is to cut down expenditure to anything like the degree indicated by the honourable member for Parramatta. It seems to me that he left out of his calculations all new expenditure. Surely he must admit that the Commonwealth will, at an early date, have to take over a number of functions which it has not yet been able to assume. If we are to have an effective Australian administration in regard to a number of Departments, we shall have a number of new items figuring upon the debit side of our account before very long.

I am loth to believe that his action in this connection was other than unintentional. Let me mention two points by way of illustration. I did not say that at the Hobart Conference three of the States had agreed to the scheme which the right honourable member for East Sydney submitted to them. WhatI said was that Victoria. New South Wales, and Western Australia agreed to permit the Commonwealth to deduct the amount necessary for the payment qf old-age pensions from the sum that was returnable to them. Premiers agreed to do that. respect of the Treasurer was that, instead of going to London to consult the Imperial authorities in regard to taking over the States debts, he should have visited the Treasurers of the States, and discussed with them the whole of his financial proposalsnot this particular proposal. things are entirely distinct. the honourable member for Bland rose to continue the discussion he almost apologized for his action. that this Bill, involving as it does, an amendment of the Constitution, ought to be subjected to a very f u l l discussion. There are many difficulties in the way of the Commonwealth initiating an old-age pensions scheme. administration of a system of old-age pensions by the States would be more economical than would be. its administration by the Commonwealth. that at the present time two-thirds of those persons in Australia who are entitled to old-age pensions are in receipt of them. who have lived in both New South Wales and Victoria for forty and fifty years, and who cannot secure a pension ? not been resident in either State sufficiently long to entitle them to the pension. The Commonwealth might well have provided the .small amount necessary to pay the claims of such persons from the general surplus that we have at the present time without asking us to adopt the extraordinary course of amending the Constitution. How is it proposed to raise the money with which to pay old-age pensions? We are to told that certain duties will be ear-marked. That is all very well if we are to place the funds thus raised in the hands of trustees, and if Parliament is no longer to exercise supervision over them. But the moment we view it in any other light the proposal to ear-mark certain sums becomes ridiculous. All our revenue ought to be ear-marked in that it ought to be raised only for useful purposes. But to prescribe that one pound shall be collected for a certain purpose, and another pound for a different purpose is, to my mind, the acme of folly. I would further point out that if we ear-mark duties in the way that is suggested, they must conI do not think that the tinue to be ear-marked until the Constitution is again amended. The ""Government must have been in a very childish mood when they put forward this proposal.

If they go fully into that report they will learn how such a measure as the Elizabethan poor law, which was intended absolutely for the relief of the poof and destitute, was so diverted in the course of years from its original purpose that the best friends of the workers recommended its absolute abolition. That report shows how evil is often inextricably mixed with what appear to be good schemes for the benefit of the people. from the point of view that we all desire a Federal system of old-age pensions.

I am able to prophesy the effect of measures that have not been thoroughly considered. One has only to look at any of the measures we have passed during the last two or three years to discover the conflicting principles running through them. I regretted to hear the honourable member for Bland speak so lightly of the alteration of the Constitution. I can conceive of nothing more calculated to bring the Constitution into contempt than to ask honourable members to assent to amendments, the effects of which have not been thoroughly considered. I trust that no such proposal will be accepted by the people unless it is clearly shown that it has been well considered. When it is found that the Constitution can be readily altered, the whole fabric which has been built up with so much care may be shattered. If we teach Ave teach them to disregard the very law that binds the States together. The day has not yet arrived when it can be said that the Federal control is no longer considered irksome, and if we tell the people that the Constitution can be easily altered they will desire to go further. It is useless, however, at this stage of the session to address the Committee on constitutional questions. Honourable members are not prepared to consider what mav be the effect lo-morrow of legislation passed to-day, let alone to consider what may be its effect years hence.

The Legislatures of South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania, are mow capable of managing the internal affairs o those States than we are. What right ha'.e we to thrust upon them our opinions ? Honourable members seem to have lost sight of the Federal idea.

If the honhonorable member impose it? orable and learned member for West Sydney and other honourable members were sincere, they would endeavour to alter the ratio of direct and indirect taxation. I think that we should raise 35 per cent, of our revenue from direct taxation, and 65 per cent, from indirect; but at present we raise barely 20 per cent, from direct, and 80 per cent, from indirect taxation. In New South Wales prior to Federation the ratio of direct to indirect taxation was as 29 to 71. . My remarks on the subject of taxation, however, must always be taken as qualified by the statement that the less taxation imposed upon it-he people the better for them. Members like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports would have us believe that it does.not matter how much taxation is imposed, so long as it is called protection. It is a ridiculous thing that members should support or oppose a proposal because of the name given to it. or because of the Minister by whom it is brought forward. But when I asked an honourable member whether he thought that if the Treasurer introduced a measure whereby £500,000 could be obtained it would be passed, he said "" No."" Later on, when, after having diverted his mind by other conversation, I said, "" If the Minister of Trade and Customs introduces a measure which will yield £500,000 by the imposition of protective dutiies will he carry it , "" the reply was ""Yes."" I need hardly say that the brain which is so feaifully and wonderfully fashioned that it gives different answers' to the one question belongs to a member of the protectionist party. revenue ? is meant prohibition; but, just as free trade does not mean the abolition-of Customs houses, so protection does not mean absolute prohibition. Can any one contend that necessity has arisen for the alteration of the Constitution in the manner proposed? already expended in the payment of old age pensions, and that only another £700,000 need be provided, can it be shown that special taxation must be imposed to provide the money?

When it is necessary, direct and indirect taxation should be combined; but I refer him to any elementary primer for information on the subject at large. It is an outrage upon the sound principles of constitutional government to ask us at the fag end of the last session of a Parliament, when we are sitting from ten in the morning till twelve at night, to consider a proposed alteration of the Constitution. That in itself is a sufficient reason for opposing the proposal of the. Government. No justification has been urged for the course proposed. The ear-marking of certain funds is one of the worse schemes that could be devised. One'good result that would follow the adoption of the proposal of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is that it would prevent the raising of money until a scheme hacl been formulated. The Government would not resort to such taxation if they knew that the money raised would not be available for purposes other than that specified.

Does any one suppose for a moment that, if the present proposal be agreed to, the public will have an opportunity to make themselves acquainted with the question regarding which they will be called upon to vote? Every one knows that the public mind is alreadyagitated by a dozen other questions, and that the present proposal is being slipped through, as it were, in the dark. If we agree to the measure now before us, we shall be acting in a. manner unworthy of men who aspire to be called politicians. If honourable members had any claim to the title of statesmen, they would know that progress and prosperity are not brought about by continual changes. fixed Government, though not a good one, may be -better than one that is always being changed. Settlement and continuity in the policy of the country are necessary to progress and prosperity, and changes in the Constitution should not be made until f u l l time has been given for consideration, or unless the interests of the people as a whole are at stake. If the Constitution is amended in the manner proposed, the alteration will be used as a precedent for other changes, which we may expect to have placed before us in rapid succession. There might have been some reason for proposing to submit to the electors the question of electing quinquennial instead of triennial Parliaments. The Government might have claimed that it was better, and more in consonance with the principles of governmerit, tihat honourable members should be able to study for a longer period the questions demanding their attention in the wider political field opened up to them in the Federal Parliament. In this Parliament the first year is spent by an honourable member in obtaining knowledge as to the manner in which parliamentary work should be carried out. The second year is really the only period during which he is in a pro|3er frame of mind to devote himself to the consideration of the questions which come before him. During the third year he is so much occupied in making speeches to .his constituents, with a view to securing his return at the forthcoming elections, that it is impossible for him to give f u l l and fair consideration to the' measures submitted to the House. In view, further, of the risk now incurred of repeated reversals of policy, the Government might very well have asked the elec8 tors to consider the desirability of electing the House for five years, instead of three. If , however, they had brought forward such a proposal, I should still have urged that a change of the Constitution should not be lightly contemplated. ' In fact, we should not seek to amend the Constitution unless we find it impossible to arrive at any other solution of tlie difficulty which confronts us. If , by repeated alterations of the Constitution, we weaken the belief of the great masses of the people in its stability, we shall prepare the way for more dangerous innovations, which may ultimately lead to the breaking-up of the Federation. A have listened very patiently to the debate, and it appears to me that no insuperable objections have been raised to my amendment. Up to the present time this Parliament has utterly failed to carry out the promises made to the electors at the last elections. In Western Autralia, at all events, no candidate urged that it would be impossible for the Commonwealth to institute a scheme of old-age pensions. Difficulties were raised only after honourable members had secured their return. I had the honour of being a member of the Old-age Pensions Commission, which entered upon its work upon the Understanding that the establishment of a Federal old-age pensions scheme was approved of by nine-tenths of the member's of this Chamber. It was not regarded by members as the duty of the Commission to consider whether it was desirable to establish such a scheme, but the attention of the members was devoted solely to devising the best means by which provision should be made for giving effect to the wishes of the people as expressed by honourable members. The time has arrived when the Government should face the responsibility of providing for old-age pensions. Ministers have urged that in order to give effect to the will of the people, it is necessary to amend the Constitution. I have always held the view, however, that we have had the means at our disposal without resorting to any such step. By a judicious manipulation of our funds, and by retaining the surplus of the Commonwealth share of revenue which has been paid back to the States, we might have been able to lav the foundation of an old-age pension scheme. This Parliament, however"", seems to desire to take over from the States almost every other",58,Thomson Woul D Customs And Excise Now Returnable And

We have incurred a liability in connection with the payment of bounties to the extent of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and to the extent to which certain duties recently imposed become protective, they will involve a loss of further revenue. there is the proposal to lose between £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 and £300,00 0 by establishing other directions, we have thrown away revenue whicli would have provided us with at least a portion of the funds required to establish an old-age pensions system. The balance required could have been raised by imposing direct taxation. The point raised by the Prime Minister as to our constitutional obligations to the States has been effectively disposed of/. As I stated on a former occasion, no one part of the Federal compact is more sacred than another, and no provision should be amended without the fullest consideration. I believe that if we decide by an absolute majority to remit to the people the question whether old-age pensions shall be provided for out of the Customs and Excise revenue, an' affirmative answer will be given. Under the Government proposal, special duties are to be placed upon articles now admitted free into the Commonwealth,, and it will be impossible to raise the funds required without imposing duties upon tea and kerosene. If taxes were levied upon these articles, they would impose a heavy burden upon the poorer classes of the community who live in cities and who cannot afford to pay for electric light or gas, and also upon farmers ancl other residents in the country districts whom the Government profess to be very anxious to assist. Apart from the question as to the sections of the community upon whom the greater part of the burden would f a l l , I do not think it is desirable to levy special duties in order to provide for old-age pensions. The Commission unanimously condemned resort to any such means. has flouted all the reports presented by Commissions which it has appointed. is very material to the point at issue. Nevertheless, it is a fact that the Old-Age Pensions Commission unanimously reported against the imposition of specific taxation for the purpose of raising funds with which to defray the cost of a national Constitution [REPRESENTATIVES.] Alteration scheme. Under the Government proposal such items in the Tariff as narcotics, silks, & c , upon which it might be deemed de-' sirable to levy extra taxation, would be specifically excluded from additional taxation. I do not think that it is any part of Then our duty to provide large surpluses for the States Treasurers. I ask honourable members whether the surpluses at present availpenny postage. In these and able in the different States are being distributed in the best possible manner ? Personally, I regard large surpluses as a great evil. We all recognise that they are allocated by the States Treasurers in a most objectionable fashion, and that if constituencies are not actually bought with them, particular care is exercised to see that the interests of the electorates which return Government supporters are not neglected. buying the constituencies as possible. utilize the surpluses which they derive as the result of bountiful seasons to relieving the deficits which are accumulated during lean years, a great many of my objections to the Government proposals would be removed. But the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carruthers, who anticipates having a surplus of £1,400,000 next year, is already making provision for a considerable decrease in the apology for a land tax which is operative in that State, despite the fact that a large section of its people are being crushed by land monopolists. Under these circumstances, I can see no possible justification for adding to the surpluses of the States Treasurers. A t the present time, the inhabitants of Western Australia have to pay £ 4 per head in indirect taxation, chiefly upon articles of general consumption. 14s. per head. surer that it has reached about £ 6 per head. Consequently, a man with a family of four is at present required to contribute £ 2 0 annuallv. So far, no land tax has been imposed in Western Australia. The whole idea of its Government has been to collect Customs duties upon the I do not know that that foodstuffs required by the people. But having been compelled by the force of public opinion to take some action, its members are now adopting just that fragment of a, land tax which will enable them to save their political skins..

I find that in 1903 the Commonwealth imported 24,716,000 lbs. of tea and 15,000,000 gallons of kerosene. Probably honourable members will be surprised to learn that a duty of 5d. per lb. upon tea and of a like sum per gallon upon kerosene would realize only half the amount that would be required for the payment of old-age pensions. duty would represent an ad valorem rate of 77 per cent, and 74 per cent, respectively. I think that is a pretty stiff tax. It would require a duty of about iod. per gallon upon kerosene, and of 9d. per lb. upon tea to provide for a national system of old-age pensions, providing the imports remain the same. That appears to me to constitute such an enormous tax that no Government would be prepared to father it. Unfortunately, the taxation of these commodities will f a l l only upon the poorer section of the community. In 1904 West-, em Australia imported 2,150,000 lbs. of tea and 1,470,000 gallons of kerosene. Upon the assumption that a duty of 5d. per lb. were levied upon tea, and an equal amount per gallon upon kerosene, she would be called upon to contribute £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 annually. But, inasmuch as the rate I have mentioned would only be sufficient to meet half the amount necessary to pay old-age pensions, Western Australia would have to pay on that basis £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 annually. According to the Government Statist/ there .are only 4>3°° persons in Western Australia who are eligible by years for old-age pensions. State the proportion that obtains in the other States of those necessitous persons, only about 1,677 persons there would be the recipients of pensions. A great number of these have only been resident in Western Australia during the past few years. To pay them upon tlie New South Wales basis would cost Western Australia £ 4 0 , 0 0 0. Under the proposal of the Prime Minister, therefore, we should be taking from Western Australia £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 annually in specific duties for the purpose of meeting a liability of £ 4 0 , 0 0 0. Such a proposal is too outrageous for this Parliament to consider. Western Australia has shown her patriotism by accepting the sugar bounty, the sugar duties, and the duties on boots, as well as by extending consideration'to various manuI have in my possession factures chiefly carried on in other States, but she is not prepared to contribute £100,000 per annum to pay the old-age pensions in other States. I therefore say that the honourable member for Fremantle, when making his criticism, had not gone beneath the surface of the Government proposal. The scheme suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney is, to my mind, one that would not secure the support of a majority in any_ deliberative assembly. That tical politics. that if my amendment be adopted it will meet with hostility from some of the States' Treasurers. learned gentleman says that it will meet with hostility from all the States' Treasurers, he weakens the argument advanced, by him. I hold that it is a more feasible scheme than that proposed by the Government. About two-thirds of the people of Australia reside in Victoria and New South Wales, where old-age pensions schemes are in operation, and where the people, by means of indirect taxation, have been required to raise more than is necessary to carry on the government of the country. Does the Prime Minister think that the people of New South Wales, where, notwithstanding that provision is made for an old-age pensions scheme, a surplus of nearly £1,500,000 is this financial year anticipated, would consent to additional Customs taxation, adding enormously to their present surplus? Applying to that lieve themselves of that taxation. degree improbable that the people of either of the States which have made provision for old-age pensions, and have a large' surplus, will vote for a proposal which means the imposition of additional Customs taxation upon commodities used chiefly by the poorer sections of the community. It is said that the remaining States will not be prepared to accept any reduction of their Customs revenue.

WhilstI do not consider that we should lightly agree to any alteration of the Constitution, I think that we ought to be prepared to accept an amendment of it when it is necessary to enable a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions to be established. I certainly think that it is It would probably imour duty to take this question into serious consideration, and to bring the scheme into operation as speedily as possible. We have been told that the introduction of these proposals at the fag-end of the session prevents our giving proper consideration to them. As a matter of fact, the question I cannot appreciate the argument has been discussed at almost every political gathering since the inauguration of Federation, and since the Hobart Conference we have had ample opportunity to consider it in all its details. I know that there are many difficulties in the way, and I would point out that Tasmania, owing to losses sustained as the result of Federation, has been compelled to resort to various means of raising the revenue necessary for the administration of her Govern: ment. It has been stated during the debate that the money not so raised remains really in the pockets of the peopleThat is not the case. Since the establishment of Inter-State free-trade Tasmania has largely imported from New South Wales and Victoria instead of from foreign countries, with the result that she It was; but I regret has suffered a considerable loss of revenue. With the exception of a few articles she has not been able to obtain what she required cheaper from the mainland than she could .previously obtain ;them from other countries. Taken as a whole, the position of the Treasurer of Tasmania has been one of great difficulty, since he has I admit, of lost half of the revenue that was collected under the State Tariff.

If the people assent to the Bill, they will give us a power to exercise if all other means f a i l. We shall still possess any other means now open to us to make a re-adjustment of our financial responsibilities to enable old-age pensions to be provided. If such a re-adjustment can be made, we shall at the same time settle several other great problems and do a splendid work that we all desire to accomplish. But we desire to have this power in reserve in order that if other ambitions are foiled we shall not have to postpone for another four years the granting of old-age pensions.",65,Pairs

I was from the first a member of the Labour Party in South Australia,' and although that party was a protectionist one, it had as one of the planks of its platform a provision that no duty should be imposed on tea, coffee, cocoa, kerosene, or other articles which could not be grown or manufactured in the State. That plank remained in their platform until 1901, but if the Prime Minister's proposal be carried, we shalh raise the bulk of the sum necessary for ' old-age pensions by means of duties on two of the articles mentioned. I quite agree that if the Parliament is given power to say that tihe necessary funds shall be raised in that way, we shall keep back the imposition of direct taxation. I know of no section of the House outside the Labour Party which is prepared to impose a national land tax. I therefore think that the Government should first make an effort to obtain the necessary funds for that purpose from other sources, and that no difficulty would be experienced in making good, by means of Customs duties, any slight deficiency. .
