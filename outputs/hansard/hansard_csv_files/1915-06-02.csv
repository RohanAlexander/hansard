Defence Department continues to pay to the mother or other relative of the soldier the allowance agreed upon, until any question concerning a pension has-' been dealt with. I shall communicate' the honourable member's question to the Treasurer, though I think that the Treasury is already doing what is desired. General satisfied that the arrangementsfor the despatch, of mail matter to our men at the front are the .best that canbe devised, and that in future deliveries will be more regular 1 Many men at the front have received no letters at all, though several have been written to them. that every letter will in future be properly delivered, but, BO far as this end is concerned, the best arrangements possible have been devised. The work is under careful officers, and special attention is paid to it . sistant Minister of Defence said that he would consult with the Postmaster-General for the devising of a scheme for improving arrangements both at this end and at the other, so that there might be a speedier delivery of letters and telegrams.

9,Mr Spence,"I am not aware of it .but it certainly is not the general practice. Assistant Minister of Defence, in view of the fact that the postal arrangements in Egypt seem to have so hopelessly broken down-admittedl y broken downif he will consider the advisability of placing the arrangements for dealing with the mails in Egypt in the hands of the military authorities instead of the postal authorities ? the delivery of mails in Egypt and at the front has hopelessly broken down. the front; I said in Egypt. man must remember that for some weeks past many of our soldiers have been leaving Egypt for the Dardanelles, hence there have been no replies to many of the letters which have been sent to them from Australia. But the honourable member must also see-and I wish to impress this upon honourable members -that the Department has more regard for the lives of those at the front, and for the welfare of the Empire, than for the delivery of a letter. It is necessary that every attention should be given to those who are fighting for their very lives, and this phase of the question must be regarded as more important than the despatch arid delivery of letters from Australia. We are endeavouring to do everything that we cannothing. ing to do everything that we can, but we must not expect that soldiers in Ihe trenches will get their letters as quickly as they would if they were residing somewhere near Melbourne. That is an impossibility. .about Egypt. .stretched! Minister of Defence aware that parents are being put to considerable inconvenience by the military authorities in SydneyI think it is by the Paymaster's Department-in obtaining the personal effects of their sons who have died at the front? Is the Minister further aware that the military authorities are writing to the parents whose sons happen to be nineteen years of age, and in some cases less than that, asking if their sons left a will, or if the parents intend to take out letters of administration? This is against the law of New South Wales, and I would ask the Minister if he will direct the attention of those responsible to this particular matter, because it is hardly fair that so much inconvenience should be caused to the parents concerned. I did not say at bring the honorahle member's question under the notice of the Minister. is received by the authorities that a soldier has been killed at the front, all payments to his relatives cease. I know of individual cases in which great hardship has been thus caused. Will the Minister of Defence take steps to make the pensions available as soon as possible after the cessation of other payments? Executive Council to-day approved of certain regulations permitting the payment of pensions. All reported deaths of soldiers will be considered by the Pensions Board as quickly as possible, with a view to granting assistance to the relatives. brought under the notice of the Assistant Minister of Defence the fact that the Imperial Reservists in the ranks who have been called to the front from Australia are paid the difference between the Imperial and Australian rates of pay, but that Imperial officers similarly situated are not treated in the same manner. The Minister promised to let me have a reply. Will he say whether the matter has yet been considered by Cabinet? If not, will he expedite consideration of it , am talking so that the officers may be on the same footing as the men in the ranks? ber will put his question on the notice paper I will endeavour to give him an answer to-morrow. sistant Minister of Defence any statementto make in regard to charges for birth",5,Soldiers Pay Troops Is Due To The Tact That The Letters

On the same day, the honourable member for Fawkner also asked the PrimeM in ister the following question: 1. Is it a fact that Mr Skewes stated (and was supported in his statement by tbe Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner) that the letter carriers were guilty of "" robbing the Government of time,"" and that when he was asked to prove the assertion he ( Mr Skewes) could only produce fifty-three cases in the whole of Australia, covering a period of three years, which had been dealt with for loitering, out of 1,706 letter carriers? 2. Isi t also a fact that when Mr Skewes was addressing the Court he made use of the following language:-""That if the claim of postal the claimant organization (letter carriers) was conceded it would mean, capitalized at 5 per cent., £500,000-hal f the cost of -a battle cruiser ""? 3. Is such insinuation fair? 4. Will the Minister take steps to see tliat this officer ( Mr Skewes) conducts his cases with strict fairness? An interim reply was furnished, and the Public Service Commissioner has now supplied the following replies: 1. No; the statement made by Mr Skewes and the Commissioner's view of the matter are set forth in his report on Arbitration Court award. This report has been tabled in Parliament. As indicated therein, the cases brought before the Court were only submitted as cases in point. 2. No; the statement made was that, if the letter-carriers and others were granted 6d. per day increased pay, the cost would be £20,000 per annum, which, capitalized at 4 per cent., would equal 1500,000-hal f the cost of a battle cruiser. 3. It was not an insinuation, but the statewhether the confession alleged to have ment of a fact. 4. I am not aware that these cases have been -conducted other than with strict fairness. The Court may be relied upon to insure fairness to all parties. Acting Prime Minister whether, in view of the reply made through the press by Mr Knox, chairman of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, he does not think that the public statement by the Attorney-General should be withdrawn, as being both misleading and mischievous ? 1 Acting Prime Minister whether the Attorney-General investigated the subject of eugar supplies in his judicial capacity under the .War Precautions Act ; if so, does he consider that the Attorney General was justified in publishing in the press a rancorous party utterance? did investigate that matter in his judicial capacity as a Royal Commissioner appointed under the War Precautions Act. What any honourable member may think of the Attorney-General's statement depends on the party to which such member belongs. General issued his recent report dealing with the shortage of sugar stocks in the Commonwealth, did either the Minister of Trade and Customs, or any officer of his Department, attend at the Attorney General's office, and give evidence regarding the reDorted export of 3,000 tons of sugar to Canada? tend and give evidence before the Attorney-General. I do not know whether any officer of my Department did so or not. A f t e r the Government decided in September last to prohibit the export of sugar it was agreed to allow raw sugar to be brought in and refined here, kept in bond, and re-exported. the sanction of the Government? to as having been exported to Canada was in all probability part of that arrangement.

Was the officer in charge of the letter carriers consulted in the matter? 3. If not, why was he not? 4. Will the Postmaster-General submit the whole matter of "" letter sorting systems "" to a properly constituted tribunal of experts? The answers were not then available, but the following particulars have now been obtained1. The alteration was recommended by a conference of representatives of Mail Branches of all States, comprising the followingMr A. J. Christie, Mail Braneh, New South Wales; Mr W. B. Aston, Mail Braneh, Vietoria; Mr J. Robinson, Mail Branch, Queensland; MrH . H . Dollman, Mail Branch, South Australia; Mr S. R. H . Roberts, Mail Branch, Western Australia; Mr J. W. Clinch, Mail Branch, Tasmania. 2. No. 3. Because tbe conference was fully competent to deal with the matter without seeking other assistance. 4. This has already been done. 'See reply to 1. published statement by Lord Denman giving credit to the Labour party for the efficient establishment of the Australian Defence Forces, is the Acting PrimeM in ister aware that the honourable member for Balaclava, when Premier of Victoria, stated at an A .

A . banquet in the Exhibition Building, in 1913, that if the Labour.party had done nothing else but tary Forces of Australia, their name would be linked with all that was best in Australian life? fore the Minister replies? The honourable member's version of what I said on that occasion is incorrect. call attention to the irregular way in which questions without notice are asked. A t the last meeting of the HouseI warned the Government that most of the questions put without notice should be answered only on notice. This afternoon a question waa asked, and four fresh questions were founded on it . I have decided for the future to allow no question to be put founded on a question already asked during the same sitting. I regret to have to take this stand, because when a question is not quite clear it is possible to elucidate it by a further question; but, in view of the abuse of the practice, I have resolved that in future I shall allow to be asked no questions, founded on one already put. order, may I suggest that, instead of you, sir, taking the matter into your own hands and making a new practice for the House, it would be f a r better, in the in terests of the liberties of honourable members, if Ministers themselves were to act? I submit, with great respect, that you, sir, have no reason to complain if M in isters do not. So long as the question is in order, your function is at an end. For instance, the ruling you have just laid down may preclude from putting a question the very honourable member who, above all others, is entitled to put it . able member's point of order? is that the rule you say you aTe going to lay down would be unfair to honourable W it h regard to the members who have questions to ask. I am waiting now to put one concerning a matter of which I gave notice on F r i d a y ; but if somebody else happens to raise the point before me, I shall be precluded from asking ib.

It is quite customary in other Parliaments, and even in another place in this Parliament, for questions to be asked arising out of the answers to questions of which notice has been given. I suggest that all the trouble that is occurring here of late is due to the political speeches notice of the questions. made in many cases in answering questions. more involved in the position I am taking up than the honourable member for Parramatta has indicated. If the Ministry will not take the necessary steps to ask that notice be given of questions, I still have the responsibility of seeing that the business of the House is reasonably conducted, and I propose to attempt to assume that responsibility. It was carried out by my predecessor last session with satisfaction, and the practice laid down by him seemed to me. to work very well. I have allowed honourable members to get as much information as possible from Ministers, because I realize that that is desirable, but when I see on one afternoon one question asked and many other questions founded on it , I recognise that this cannot go on indefinitely, and, in the circumstances, I intend to take another course. that, if honourable members are not inclined to accept your ruling, the only way to find out the true opinion of the House will be to move that the ruling be disagreed with?

The Administrator subsequently repeated his recommendation, but in view of representations that the property was about to be transferred to new owners, who were prepared to fulfil the stocking and all requirements of the lease within a specified time, forfeiture was not proceeded with. All rentals, penalties, &c., have been paid. 3. The Classification Board, of which Mr Bourke. Hyland was chairman, did not recommend to the Administrator the subdivision of the land. 4. There have been various applications for transfers, but Mr Lassetter's name does not appear in connection with any of them. Delay has arisen in completing the transfer owing to the death of one of the original lessees. I assume that the run is still unstoeked, but am not aware that it is being held for speculative purposes. Home Affairs, upon notice1. Is it true that the secretary of the Workers Union( Mr Costello), on the Kalgoorlie end of the transcontinental railway, was recently brought over to Melbourne to consult with the Department on questions relating to the length of rails that should be laid daily by platelayers, and on other matters pertaining to the construction of tbe line? 2. If so, were his expenses, or any portion thereof, defrayed by the Government? 3. What was the amount of the expenses, if any, allowed to Mr Costello? orable member's questions are1. As the business of the Commonwealth did not permit of the Minister leaving for so long as a visit to Kalgoorlie involved, Mr Costello came to Melbourne on the invitation of the Government to discuss^ as representative of the men, certain matters which were in dispute between the Commonwealth and their employees on the railway, thus including, amongst other things, the speed of plate laying. members who were in this House during % and 3. Yes; Mr Costello was reimbursed his expenses incurred in coming to Melbourne, ns he had come at the invitation of and to meet the convenience of the Government.

I should like, at the honourable member. All I have to say is that hard work does not agree with me, and apparently with many other honourable members, but the proposal, amongst other things, will probably avert a political strike. I believe if the Government asked members to sit more days per week at the present time there would be a strike. I would lead it . old days, then. a lot of things to my credit, but up to the present I have not led a strike, although I am threatening one now. Seriously, I cannot see the value of the afternoon set apart for private members' business as at present availed of.

170,Mr Glynn (Angas) T4.10],"I wishthe outset, to call attention to some estimates given as to the cost of management of the Territory in answer to a question asked by the right honourable member for Swan some little time ago. cost was stated, I think, at £611,320. Details are given at page 76 of the Budget-papers, but it is necessary to analyze the figures to discover what really may be considered as the annual cost of the management of the Territory. Taking the figures for 1912-13, the Budgetpapers show a deficiency of £390,523. In 1913-14 there is a deficiency shown of £460,654, and in 1914-15 a deficiency of £467,320. This is the deficiency on receipts and expenditure, without taking into account the expenditure from loan funds; but in these figures are included items of expenditure such as interest and sinking-fund payments, and payments for works constructed out of revenue. Taking the figures for 1913-14, £260,447 of the expenditure was for interest and sinking fund only, not taking works into account. These are items transmitted to us in connection with the management of the Territory for about twenty-five 'or thirty years. grown since the first construction, I think in 1881, of the railway connection between Port Darwin and Pine Creek. We have to leave this expenditure out of account to get at what ought to be regarded as the normal annual expenditure upon the Territory. Let us consider, again, tlie expenditure for 1913-14, and ta'ke into account the expenditure from tlie loan fund. The total expenditure from revenue is given nt £535,260. If we add the loan expenditure, chiefly for redemption, and amounting to £262,107, to that, we get a total of £797,367. I do not say that these figures are given by the Administration, but when one quotes them without explanation, one may be guilty of self-deception and the deception of others as to what ought to be regarded as the real financial position of the Territory. The expenditure from loan fund for the year I have mentioned was £262,107, and interest and sinking fund taken from revenue bring the total of that class of expenditure up to £522,547 out of a total expenditure of £797,367. We must all acknowledge that tlie Northern Territory presents a rather difficult problem. We have there 527,000 square miles of country, of which about 147.000 square miles, or a percentage of from 29 to 30 per cent. Mr Glynn. . of the total area, has a rainfall of under 10 inches. If we consider the whole of Australia, we shall find that from 36 to 37 per cent, of the total area has a rainThe total fall of under 10 inches, and looked at from that point of view the problem in the Northern Territory is not one which should dishearten us. Another matter which has to be considered is tliat up to the time of the transfer to the. Commonwealth the development of the Territory was stayed by the fact that in 1902 a proposition was made, of which I never approved, for a land-grant transcontinental railway. Fortunately, that was defeated, and then the question of the urgency of the transfer to the Commonwealth .was mooted. From that time up to the transfer development by pastoral leases was stopped, and annual permits were substituted for leases. Other conditions affected development in those years, and one of considerable importance was that in 1883 or 1884 the Imperial Government refused to give a title to the Territory to the State of South Australia. As a consequence, the Government of that State did not quite know their position They are expenses which have until the actual transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth took place. A t the time of the transfer the best part of the pastoral land of the Territory had been let on pastoral leases, which originally; were for forty-two years. I believe that at the time of the transfer the unexpired terms of those leases ran from twenty-five to thirty-five years. There was an area of about 70,000,000 acres under such leases, but the total rental they produced was less than £9,000 a year. We must remember, further, that the Northern Territory, which is about one-sixth of the total area of the Commonwealth, is not a tropical country. Very often when people talk so glibly about the use of coloured labour, the fact is overlooked that, apart from other objections to the use of that class of labour, only a comparatively small area of the Territory is really tropical country. I think that the coastal belt, which has a 60-in. annual rainfall, ie not deeper than from 150 to 200 miles. I can give one or two of the figures, which honourable members will find set out in detail in the report of the Railways Commission. Pine Creek, which' is 145 miles from Darwin, has an elevation of 175 feet. The Katherine River, 200 miles from Darwin, has an elevation of 600 feet. Bitter Springs, 270 miles from Darwin, has an elevation of 500 feet, and the Macdonnell Range country, 915 miles from Darwin, has an elevation of 2,500 feet. The ranges gradually rise to that elevation -coming down from the north, and drop with almost a precipitous face when they -come to their limits on the southern side. I have not all the figures relating to the rainfall, but I gather that the coastal rainfall is about 60 inches, and that it does not always fall at the best time of the year for the purposes of development. It falls chiefly between November and April. A t the Katherine the rainfall is 41 inches; at Daly Waters, 24 inches; at Borroloola, which is 60 or 70 miles from the Pellew Islands, in the GuK of Carpentaria, it is 27 inches; at Alexandra Station, one of the typical stations on the Barclay Tablelands, it is 15 inches; whilst at Alice Springs it is less than II inches. In other words, the rainfall varies from 11 inches in the Territory proper to 60 inches within the limits of tropical settlement. Statistics show that men from the south do not care to remain in the Territory. The absence of society with the better half of humanity I suppose that a married man ought to say that-affect s the inducements to settle there. From Brisbane to Port Darwin the distance is 2,100 miles, and from Sydney to Port Darwin 2,600 miles. Mr J. H . CATTS -Round the coast? -communications within the northern part of the Territory itself. From Port Darwin by sea to the Barclay Tablelands -on e of the best parts of the Territorythe distance is 800 miles, whilst by coach the distance is 130 or 140 miles. From estimates which I have seen, I believe that if a man ordered in Melbourne machinery for well-sinking, the plant could not be erected in the Barclay Tablelands in less than twelve months, so .great is the difficulty of transit. Attention has been drawn to some of these facts by the Administrator in his reports. In his report for the year 1912 he referred to the great isolation experienced by residents in the Territory, to the high cost of cartage, and to the then -complete absence of facilities for the sale of stocka disability which the late Government endeavoured to overcome by entering into an arrangement with Messrs. Vestey Brothers for the erection of freezing works at Port Darwin. As to the means of communication, I think there are three lines of boats running to the Territory, including Burns, Philp Limited; but until recently these vessels undertook about twelve voyages a year, and there was often a very short interval between their arrival. I wish now to refer to the cost of cartage in the Territory. When I was Minister of External AffairsI took advantage of the presence in Melbourne-as I am sure my successor does-of officers from the Territory, and also of some visitors, with a view to securing personal information to supplement the official information which I had already acquired. That official information, I may remark, is exceedingly reliable. Although we may draw different conclusions from certain data, there can be no question as to the honesty of the data supplied by the officials. Amongst the persons whom I saw was Mr Playford, Chief Warden of Mines. On page 75 of his report for 1912 he points out that the great drawback to mining development in the Territory is the high cost of cartage. Upon good bush tracks this cost amounts to 2s. and 3s. per ton per mile. The cost of transporting machinery to the Marranboy tin fields will be almost double that. Mr Playford saysfApart from the inaccessibility of the Territory, the principal other drawbacks to mining here have been want of capital, high charges for storage of explosives (reduced one-half two years ago), high eost of living I am not sure that he is quite correct in that statement. I think the Administrator inquired into the cost of living about twelve months ago. not wish that portion of Mr Playford's statement to be regarded as absolutely conclusive. That gentleman continuesexcessive charges by teamsters (ranging from 2s. to 3s. per ton per mile, although roads are good and feed plentiful most of the year), high charges on gold, and, until recent years, no local buyer. The prospects of Brunette Downs, which are distant from the Gulf of Carpentaria some 420 miles, are jeopardized by the high cost of cartage, which at times amounts to £20 per ton. Now let me point to the transit charges which obtain from the other end. From Adelaide to Oodnadatta the cost is £7 per ton; from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, whence goods are conveyed principally by camel,",24,Estimates 1914 15

It will give, too, what cannot be got in the other parts of the gulf lying towards Queensland, and along the Queensland coast-it will give a good anchorage near the coast. For over 100 miles of coast in Queensland an anchorage inshore cannot be got, because, owing to the shallowness of the water, the vessels have to lie 10 miles off. Such a harbour will enable us to deal with most of the country called the Barclay Tablelands, and some of the Queensland country, and also to command the trade that I believe will be developed in connection with the Roper River, which is only about 130 or 140 miles from the mouth of the Macarthur. vicinity of Borroloola, which is about 60 miles from the mouth of that river, would, according to the evidence taken by, I think, the Royal Commission, deal with 30,000 or 40,000 cattle during a season. I think the Minister will bear me out in saying that there is a possibility, but not a probability, of the development of freezing works in connection with that part of the Territory. Coming for a moment to the Macdonnell Ranges, the climate is good. On the around for many days in the year the early temperature is at freezing point. One gets bracing mornings, sunny days, and cool nights-to quote the evidence of mining men. The White Range is described as a big hill of low-grade ore. I was informed by one of the officers from the Arltunga district that there is a very large extent of country running from 6 to 8 dwts., and that it cau be developed by open cut. ing prospects of the Macdonnell Ranges are absolutely proved, for it would not be right to say that the reefing has been wholly determined. A t all events, we have had the report of Mr Brown, who was Government Geologist for South ander Davidson, an English mining expert, who explored the country, that the prospects of finding minerals in that part of the Territory are exceedingly good. The mica I have mentioned-and that country measures 70 by 10 miles, but it requires capital and communication. In the Territory we have gold, tin, copper, silver, lead, wolfram, and mica, and very nearly £3,000,000 worth of metals, even under the disadvantageous conditions which have prevailed there, has been raised. It was part of the policy outlined by the late Government, which has been printed as a parliamentary paper, to improve those communications. I feel sure that my successor in ofiice looks favourably at the development of railways within a reasonable period. your conclusions. because when the honourable member for Barrier was Minister of External Affairs he had a flying survey made of some of the country by Lawrence and Chalmers. I think that 1,390 miles were surveyed by the firm, namely, 330 miles from Oodnadatta to Birt Plains or Alice Springs, Freezing works in the 450 miles to Newcastle Waters, and 250 miles to the Katherine River, and 360 miles from Newcastle Waters to Camooweal. The survey was of the central route, which approximately meant the route of the telegraph line, and also of a line which one may describe as a branch line from Newcastle Waters to Camooweal, apparently with the intention to give two connexions, because the connection with Queensland is not a big one, when you have a transcontinental line' to branch from. I will refer to the four routes which were considered by the late Government. When Dr. Gilruth was in Melbourne in March of last year, I went into this question of the railway very carefully with bim, because he had gone over a good portion of the country with a view to seeing it first-hand, and getting some data, apart from the reports of officers, on whicli he might come to a decision. HeI do not say tliat the minhad proceeded from Camooweal vid the Alroy Downs to the Macdonnell Ranges, and made a fair observation of the country through which he passed. The lines of which the last Government approved are set out on pages 7 and 8 of my "" Outlines of Policy for the Northern Territory."" These were: Oodnadatta to Katherine River, 1,026 miles; Newcastle Waters to Camooweal, 360 miles; and Anthony's Lagoon to the Pellew Group, 230 miles; or a total of 1,616 miles. I shall mention the routes taken into consideration when I was discussing the matter with the Administrator, but, first of",27,Estimates 1914 15
176,"Australia For Many Years, And Mr Alex",,28,Estimates 1914 15
177,Mr Mahon,I agree with most of,28,Estimates 1914 15
178,Mr Glynn,"I make that remarkall, I point out that it was a settled part of the policy of the late Government to connect Oodnadatta with the Macdonnell Ranges by a line running to Alice Springs, and to continue, from the Katherine, the construction of the line now in hand from Pine Creek to Katherine River. survey has also been made for a continuation of this latter line southwards to Bitter Springs. The point for consideration was what should be the intermediate line of connection between Alice Springs and the termination of the line running south from Darwin. All sorts of recommendations have been made. One was for a line to be regarded as a central line, and to follow approximately the telegraph line between Alice Springs and Pine Creek. Some people consider that this is a straight line, but that is not the case. Tliere are several bends in it. It does not run due north and south. runs south-east from Katherine River to Bitter Springs, and there are curves from Barrow's Creek to Ryan's Well, and from Ryan's Well to Alice Springs. But as the country lying along this proposed route mieht not prove to be so good as some country lying more to the east, and as it was doubtful if the country to the west is even fair, it was not decided, without proper examination, to accept the telegraph line as the route of connection between Alice Springs and the Katherine River. Another route would come south from the Katherine River through rich pastoral country, passing through Milleroo Station and Victoria Downs Station, and joining the telegraph line somewhere in the vicinity of Tennant's Creek, and thence running south to Alice Springs. I think that in March of last year a feature survey of that country, as well as of some other parts of the Territory, was ordered, and I do not know whether that survey has been completed; but the objection raised to that route was that it would only serve the cattle country of the Victoria River, and that below Tennant's Creek the country is comparatively poor. However, these facts have yet to be tested by feature surveys. Another route proposed is one from the Katherine River by All Saints' Well to Borroloola, which, as I have said, is 60 or 70 miles from the Gulf of Carpentaria, and thence goin^ south via Brunette Downs, Alroy Station7 and Arltunga to Alice Springs. There are engineering difficulties in the way-comAfr. Glynn. paratively great engineering difficulties)and a great deal of the country is purely pastoral, and mostly suited for cattle. Railways do not pay by traffic derived from cattle country, and this class of country does not pay for developing a» well as does sheep country. I now come I understand that a to the route which, subject to further examinations, the Administrator thought would be the best, and I think I may safely say that it is one of which the right honourable member for Swan, with his fairly large experience of the Commonwealth, would approve. I may say that the right honourable member for Swan did support the transcontinental line. Whatever views may have been entertained previously as to the expediency of commencing the connection between the Darwin line and the southern line, I think that all parties now recognise that in our action of taking over the TerriIt tory there was a declared policy to bring about that railway connection; and, so far as I can see, I cannot admit that any Ministry, this or the last, has given ap the idea of fulfilling loyally the carrying out of that policy. able member for Swan did not agree as to the route. some minor points. I have the correspondence that passed between us. proposal contained in the letter written by the right honourable member for Swan to the Acting Premier of Queensland ? his action in writing a letter of which T was unaware, but the whole of the correspondence came before me. The honourable member acted with the very best of intentions. On occasions Treasurers, in matters affecting expenditure, assume certain control which perhaps other Ministers would not care to assume, or, rather, make inquiries in departments other than their own. for Swan said that he had no axe to grind, but that was because his axe was-already ground. Mr Barnes, the Acting Premier of Queensland, was in Melbourne the honourable member for Swan discussed matters: with him, and was rather impressed with the desirableness of pushing the line downwards first.",28,Estimates 1914 15

I was not aware at the time that the right honourable gentleman, in endeavouring to help iu the matter, had written a private letter to the Acting Premier of Queensland; but I think that if he had thought the matter of any consequence he would have told me of his letter. The route conditionally recommended by Dr. Gilruth was to proceed from Katherine River by Newcastle Waters, Brunette Downs, and Alroy Station, and thence southwards to Arltunga and Alice Springs. He had been over that country, and he thought that we should have the portion between Alroy Downs and Macdonnell Ranges tested, because' he expressed the belief that, though it was not as good as the Barclay Tablelands, there was a fair portion of it nearly as good. He favoured that connection between Alice Springs and Katherine River. Everything had been based on the assumption [131] that the transcontinental line was to be extended to the Macdonnell Ranges. That policy had been set out in black and white. Dr. Gilruth was of the opinion that if we deviated perhaps 100 miles to the east, and made the connection by Newcastle Waters or Daly WatersI think he would have preferred Daly Waters, subject to certain surveys being completed-and by Anthony's Lagoon through Brunette Downs and Alroy Station to Alice Springs, better results would be obtained, and, as a matter of fact, would complete the whole policy by If it had enabling a connection with the Pellew Group from Anthony's Lagoon, a distance of 230 miles, which would mean a saving of 100 miles as against connecting the Pellew Group branch with the line surveyed by Lawrence and Chalmers. What was done as regards that ? Before leaving office, I directed that a feature survey of that route should be made, and the present Minister of External Affairs has sent Mr Day along the route, from south to north, to examine the country. I also sanctioned the survey of the Victoria River country. We proposed to As I was saying, the spend up to £20,000 on sub-artesian boring, and made provision for artesian boring. Generally we set to work to carry out the policy which we had outlined, and submitted for the approval of Parliament. ting down bores when freights are as costly as the honourable member has intimated ? be kept open. There is a stock route from Victoria River to Newcastle Waters, and thence on to Camooweal. Captain Barclay recommended the putting down of five or six bores, and we directed that that should be done. It was necessary also to keep open a stock route from All Saints' Well to Newcastle Waters, and to do that, and to enable the country to be tested, we gave instructions for the sinking of bores there. A ll this work was incidental to development. Provision has been made for boring on the Barclay Tablelands. Incidentally, we made arrangements for the granting of new leases. I had the assistance of a Queensland draftsman in the preparation of a Land Bill to encourage, among other things, lessees to spend money on boring.

At the same place I was shown some splendid cobs of maize. On suitable soil maize grows two crops in the year, and with fair seasons each crop yields 40 bushels to the acre.

In the possession of the Federation, it ought not to be an impossible proposition, for where South Australia could do something, the Commonwealth ought to be able to do much more. But, as the honourable member for Maranoa has said, they have done nothing, and as the honourable member for Robertson said, South Australia could not have done less than the Commonwealth have done. Let me quote here an extract relative to the sheep-growing possibilities of the Territory, of which the honourable member for Corangamite spoke. Mr. F l in t , Inspector of Telegraphs at Alice Springs., in the course of evidence given on the subject of sheep, says, in reply to the questions that were put-rHave you any experience in keeping sheep? -We have about 4,000 for the telegraph 10 miles north of Alice Springs. How do they do?-Splendidly . What is the increase?-The highest increase has been 97 per cent., and the lowest 67 per cent. You have plenty of water there?-Unlimited . How about wool-d o you find the wool fail? -The wool is very good. It is not like the wool grown further north. I sent some specimens to Adelaide a few years ago, and the wool from Alice Springs was worth Id. a lb. more than wool from sheep of the same age I bred and shorn near Farina. I w ill now quote the Hon. J . Lewis, who is a member of the f i r m of Messrs.

It had a very good rainfall, and suffered very little from drought, and was better to go squatting on than the dry saltbush country, which this country could well replace. Some members would remember that the country was known as the Herbert River blocks, and brought as rents up to £2 or £3 a mile. It was close to the Gulf of Carpentaria ports. MrJ . B . Solomon gave evidence on the same lines in regard to sheep.

I think the report was quoted by the honourable member for Angas-and contains the evidence given before a Northern Territory Railway Commission as to the potentialities and possibilities of the Northern Territory. statements contained in it , it is interesting to compare them w it h the statement made by the Minister of External Affairs a day or two ago that he did not know what to do w it h the Territory, and that the only fresh, suggestion that had been made to h i m was that by the honourable member for Wimmera, who suggested irrigation. , An Honorable MEMBER T h a t is. the only hope. hopeless, unless you let light into the Territory. hope for closer settlement. settlement and for the raising of agricultural products irrigation may be necessary, but where there is big sheep country, big cattle country and big horse country, such as is referred to in this report, good communication is of far more importance. Men holding leases there now w ill tell you that if a railway is constructed they w ill be prepared to forego half their leases. The country, they say, is not one-quarter stocked, because of the great cost of the carriage of materials required to properly develop the land. These men say that under present circumstances it is impossible to properly develop the Territory, and that they are forced into big holdings. I w ill quote now Mr Winnecke, F.R.G.S., F.R.A.S., who wrote a letter to the editor of the Adelaide RegisterI think it was the Register-in 1902. He saysMy experience of the Northern Territory extends over thirty-flve years, and I have been astounded at the frequent mention of desert country: My experience is that some of the finest pastoral country in the world is found in Central Australia. Water, principally artesian, is more abundant than is supposed. Gold is scattered all through this vast area, one quartz range showing gold for fully 36 miles. The Orabarra reef, in the Jervois and Tarlton ranges, has never been visited by any white man but myself. Professor Tate and Experts Watt and Achimiovitch (members of the Horn expedition, of which I was comI have plenty of them. mander) all stated that the best indications' of diamonds exist to the west of Charlotte Waters. Coal of good quality is found in the Macdonnell and more northern areas. ItI t ' was issued in 1902speaks for itself that more than one-fourth of the Territory is settled with mines, &e. I have no hesitation in declaring that it will be the finest and most remunerative country in Australia. The extent of auriferous country is simply unknown, and a railway would increase ail these resources a hundredfold. MyI n view of the past remarks on the fertility of the Northern Territory should be a guarantee that I am not in error. I might also quote Mr Simpson Newland, a man who has for many years taken a great interest in the country also there as a young man. refer to a report issued by this Parliament. I refer to the Northern Territory Railways and Ports Report, issued in June, 1914. It w ill be within the knowB u t everything w ill be ledge of honourable members that it refers to what the Territory now is. On page 6, dealing with the cost of carriage, the report statesThe conditions are further reflected in the I grant that for closer exceedingly high rates of. inland carriage. Bates on the railway from Darwin to Pine Creek range from £3 upwards per ton. As the roads are closed for several months each year during the wet season, teamsters are compelled to fix rates at a figure which will compensate them for the long period of enforced idleness. In the mining districts of the north cartage averages 2s. to 3s. per ton per mile. The figures that were quoted by the honourable member for Angas are the same figures that I have annotated here as showing the disabilities under which settlers labour by their not having any communication w it h the south. Freights have to be carried round by sea, and, in addition, from 2s. to 3s. per ton per mile has to be paid to convey goods from Port Darwin to their inland destination. This means that we cannot expect the Northern Territory to be anything but the white elephant whicli it proved to be whilst controlled by South Australia, if the Commonwealth Government continue to be as inept as, judging by this report, they appear to have been in its administration. I learn also from this report that the total area held under agricultural leases is 8,317 acres. These leases are chiefly within the coastal district, and the rental average is 4 | d . per acre. The rentals are not prohibitive, provided that facilities are afforded to make these areas useful and productive. A t page 9 of this",33,Smith I S Rice Grown By Ing The South Australian Parliament

At present mining costs, including almost prohibitive rates of carriage, are an insuperable difficulty. We have no right to expend money in making investigations hy means of a Royal Commission if we are not prepared to take action upon its reports, more especially when the question involved is so important as is the development of the Northern Territory. When before this Commission Mr Allan Davidson saidThese are vast fields where prospect trials yielded at the rate of 15 dwts.. to 2 ozs. of gold per ton.

Mr J. H . CATTS -But a previous Government was in favour of the building of that line. showing what was done by the late A d ministration. is much to choose between the two Governments, so far as the Northern Territory is concerned. so much with the honourable member's opinions as with the question of what are the actual facts relating to this matter. In the policy statement laid on the table of this House by the late Government, we have this paragraphCommunications in a country of vast spaces and great distances (see Royal Commission's Report, paragraphs 9 and 10) being essential, proposals will be submitted for the construction of railways to connect Oodnadatta and the Katherine River through the Macdonnell Ranges;Is that not clear and explicit? to connect Newcastle Waters, or some other point on the transcontinental railway, with the Queensland border at Camooweal or elsewhere, when the great western railways system of Queensland is in course of construction to such place; and, as probably a later project, to link Anthony's Lagoon on the branch line to Queensland with the Pellew Islands, at the mouth of McArthur River. It is clearly beyond dispute that this was the policy of the late Government as publicly announced by the honourable member for Angas. The honourable member for Adelaide, however, has endeavoured to show that because of certain correspondence which passed between Queensland and the late Treasurer of the Commonwealth a breach of the original agreement was contemplated. He is quite mistaken. Does he say that the Northern Territory line is never to be connected with the Queensland railway system? honourable member to say when it will be. statement from the honourable member. I have been associated with the taking over of this territory from the time that the agreement was drafted. As a matter of fact, my signature is attached to that agreement, in which the Commonwealth covenanted, amongst other things, toConstruct, or cause to be constructed, a railway line from Port Darwin southwards to a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper (which railway, with a railway from a point on the Port Augusta railway to connect therewith, is hereinafter referred to as tlie transcontinental railway). In other words, we undertook, if the Territory were handed over to the Commonwealth, to construct a railway, one I do not think that there of the terminal points of which would be Port Darwin, while the other would be Port Augusta, and that that railway should traverse the Northern Territory and pass through the northern boundary of South Australia. There is nothing in that agreement, however, which binds the Commonwealth to any specific, definite route. If the line had these two terminal points, and ran within the Territory as well as through the northern boundary of South Australia, nothing more could be required of the Commonwealth. So liberal a view did the late Mr Tom Price and his Government take of this agreement that they submitted to the South Australian Parliament the plan of a railway, which, instead of crossing the southern boundary of the Territory as suggested, would cut into Queensland and into South Australia itself. This action on the part of the Price Government seemed to imply that South Australia would be satisfied with a railway from Port Darwin coming south, crossing over to Camooweal, and thence back to Hergott Springs, and on to Adelaide. That is the view which the South Australian Government at that time took of the matter. Australian people did not share that view. that point. I am merely showing the liberal view which the South Australian Government of that day took of the agreement. I speak with a"" f u l l knowledge of the facts of this matter, because No ; I sliould like the it was my duty to invite the House to accept the agreement.

I pointed out thatIt is open to the Commonwealth to allow any connection from any of the other States with this particular line in the Northern Territory. lutely useless to us until we build railways The late Mr Batchelor, who then representedBoothby, interjected, "" That is the safeguard."" He admitted that the safeguard was that, although the Commonwealth undertook to make this connection from north to south, there was nothing in the agreement which precluded it from being linked up with the railway systems of the other States. Governor Le flunte, in reporting on the Northern Territory, said there would have to be three railways for its development. One of these, he urged, would have to run through the centre, another would go east to the Queensland border, whilst a third would ultimately go west and connect up with the Western Australian railway system. My view, as stated by me in this House as far back as 1909, is that under the agreement the Commonwealth pledged itself to build a railway from Port Darwin to Port Augusta. That obligation is clear and unmistakable, and cannot be evaded without the consent of the contracting parties. As long as the agreement stands in its present form that objective must be kept in view. member think that the central line should be the first to be constructed ? tion. The view of the late Government was that the construction of this line should be proceeded with; that a start should be made with a line running from Oodnadatta northwards, and that we should also proceed to lay a line from Pine Creek southwards, and that seeing that it was possible to have a connection with the railway system of Queensland^ posal which was submitted to Queensland by the right honourable member for Swan. Forrest's letter simply indicated that he desired the Queensland Government to press forward with the line they were constructing, and he indicated the intention of the Commonwealth Government to connect the Federal line with the Queenswere spent on one line it would block the land Government's line. Will the honorconstruction of the other. able member say that that is not a fair thing to do? Honourable members must press forward with the whole line, which admit that the Northern Territory must be developed, and that more thau one railway will be required for that purpose. The Territory must remain absothrough it. The point I desire to emphasize ia that the members of the party on this side of the House have always distinctly understood the constitutional obligations of the agreement with South Australia. We have never desired to deviate from its terms one hair's breadth. On the contrary, the desire of the Liberal party has been to proceed in accordance with the spirit and letter of the agreement. The honourable member for Adelaide has fallen into a serious misapprehension, simply because Sir John Forrest urged the Queensland Government to make a connection which would be entirely in harmony with the spirit of the agreement, and not in substitution of the line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. I think the honourable member should admit, in justice to the honourable member for Angas and those associated with him, that the Liberal Government all along tried to adhere to the letter and spirit of the agreement. that the north-south line should he built first. Why did Sir John Forrest say that the Queensland line was an alternative? must understand that the Queensland line is to be a continuous railway of great extent, and that it has already been started, and a proposal was to be submitted for linking it up with the line from Oodnadatta. Sir John Forrest was urging the Queensland Government to expedite the line it is already constructing, so that a connection could be made with the north-south line. That Queensland connection was not put forward in substitution for the north-south line or with any idea of committing a breach of the agreement with South Australia. I am sure that Sir John Forrest, if he were in the Chamber, would assure the Committee that the Queensland connection was never intended to be a substitute for the other line. Mr J. H .

The Northern Territory and Queensland are the principal sources of supply. When the war is over meat will not be cheap; the putting of this party or that party into power is not going to result in the community getting their meat at a cheaper price, because there will be an increasing demand in the markets of the world for our products. Before the outbreak of war a big demand had set in in Queensland for pastoral proneglectful of the important matter of perties suitable for beef raising, and I am satisfied that if the Northern Territory railway is constructed, and a connection made with the Queensland system, the pastoral resources in the Northern Territory will be opened up, and the railways will be of great help to both the Territory and Queensland. The Northern Territory will not be developed for a great many years as an agricultural proposition, but it can be developed on pastoral lines. The land policy of Queensland has led to the settlement of the greater portion of the northern State on a sound basis. Queensland lies side by side with the Northern Territory, but whilst on one side of the boundary there is in operation a land policy which is rapidly settling the land and leading to a considerable increase in stock, on the other side the whole province is lying practically idle. Queensland has already the elements of prosperity, and if the Minister will investigate the land tenures of that State and apply the same policy to the Northern Territory a considerable development will follow. same rents for the Territory land as Queensland gets for its lands. will be obtained if the Territory is given railway communication. People will not go to that country without railway facilities, but provide the railway and offer fair inducements to people to take up land under reasonable conditions, and I believe that land settlement will be fairly rapid. I am sorry that the honourable Honourable member for Adelaide entirely misinterpreted the action of the right honourable member for Swan by basing his criticism on an isolated document. The policy of Another reason why the late Government was clearly and unmistakably that which was explained by the honourable member for Angas this afternoon. ing all due allowance for the many changes in the occupants of the office of Minister of External Affairs since the Northern Territory was taken over by the Commonwealth, I still think that Parliament cannot feel satisfied with the little progress that has been made there. On this matter neither side can point the finger of rebuke at the other, because it appears to me that both parties have been pressing' forward with the development of the Territory. It is not sufficient to lay down a policy; we desire to see a policy carried out. I agree with the remark of the honourable member for Darling Downs that the Territory can never be developed until railways are built through it ; except in the extreme north there are no waterways, and the railway must be the only means of communication and transport. When the subject of the Territory was before the Committee a few weeks ago we heard .the usual pessimistic speeches which we are accustomed to hear when the Territory is under consideration, and it was refreshing to hear from the honourable member for Angas to-day a speech which was both hopeful and instructive. I desire to see a definite move made in connection with the development of the Territory. I do not propose to enter into the merits of the discussion ns to the action which the right honourable member for Swan took when a member of the last Liberal Government. I am quite satisfied in my own mind as to what the honourable member intended to do, and there is no getting away from the meaning of the last paragraph in his letterThe western portion, however, is impossible, unless we have communication with Queensland, and if that is denied to us, we must turn our attention to connecting the Northern Territory from Oodnadatta, a policy to which we are already pledged.

I do not blame the late Government. There is no doubt that the honourable member for Angasi n his outline of policy for the Territory distinctly stated what the intentions of the Liberal Government were. However, it is not the intentions of Governments that we have to deal with. I speak as one who is not a member from South Australia or Queensland, but who is interested in the development of Australia. We have a great problem to handle in developing the Territory, and a problem in which a large sum of money is involved. It is a problem that must be tackled on a large scale, or not at a l l . If the Government attempt to develop the Territory by spending thousand pounds they w ill be throwing their money into Buti f a bold policy is adopted, and money is spent in millions in promoting it , it will be found that the Northern Territory will prove a great asset to the Commonwealth. country in the Territory is poor, but some of the so-called poor country in Australia has already been proved by development to be some of the finest land in the Commonwealth. Victoria is in the Mallee district, which a few years ago was considered unfit for settlement. Near my own home is a considerable stretch of country which, thirty years ago, was not considered worth fencing. To-day the value of that land has been proved. Therefore, it is idle to say that a particular piece of country is poor, and is not worth developing. As views adverse to the Territory have been expressed over and over again in this House, I make no I have quoted the right apology for repeating opinions which I have previously quoted with reference to the lower portion of the Territory. From much of the talk that is heard in this Chamber, it would be inferred that the Territory consists entirely of the land in the far north. Honourable members seem to forget altogether that there is an enormous portion of territory south of Newcastle Waters which is worthy of development, and which can never be developed means of developing tliat area is by the extension of the railway from Oodnadatta northward. The honourable member expressed by Mr AllanA . Davidson, the leader of the Central Australian ExI have already said that ploration Syndicate. Mr Davidson, in his report published in 1905, said. . . The country is there and the gold is there, and it remains for others to improve on the prospects obtained. . . . The one essential feature necessary for the development of the interior, and the opening of payable gold-fields is cheaper communication. This can only be accomplished by continuing the transcontinental railway across the continent. An extension from Oodnadatta to the Macdonnell Ranges and the Arltunga gold-field would very materially assist in opening the interior and making other portions more accessible. The possibilities this country contains certainly warrant a great endeavour (even at a sacrifice for a time) being made to create a central mining population. . . . No effort or expenditure should deter those in authority from constructing a line. a few Honourable members may recollect the famous journey made to the Territory by the gutter. Lord Eantore, when he was Governor of South Australia, and those who were in terested in politics will rememoer the stir made by his publishing his report on the journey without first obtaining permission We are told that the of the Ministry of the day. Referring to this particular portion of the Territory, Lord Kintore saidMy visit to that portion of the country led me tojshare the hopes that are universally enSome of the best land in tertained, that the exploitation of that district will handsomely repay South Australia for the money expended on it. Professor Baldwin Spencer, who went through the Territory on two, if not more, occasions, wroteCentral Australia and the Northern Territory, except that portion of it which borders the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Carpentaria, is commonly regarded as desert country, more or less useless, and not only uninhabited, but uninhabitable.

264,Mr Wise,"small part of it, such as the region which centres in Lake Amadeus, and extends to the eastern borders of Western Australia, is certainly true desert, but there are, on the other hand, vast areas, including the Finke Basin, the Macdonnell Ranges, and practically all or the central country north of these to Port Darwin and the Gulf of Carpentaria, which are anything but desert. Referring to the railway, he observedHowever, nothing serious can be attempted until the railway, which now ends on the southern fringe of the steppe lands, is continued across to the north. In his work Across Australia, published later, referring to the desiccation that might occur there, he saysAs yet, however, except during occasional severe droughts, they are far removed Jrom being anything of the kindthat is, a desertand all that is needed to transform the greater part of the centre into a valuable territory is, firstly, some scheme of water conservation on a large scale, and, secondly, adequate means of communication with the coastal districts. When Professor Spencer was in Port Darwin, I had a conversation witli him with reference to water conservation, and he told me that, in the Macdonnell Ranges, there are some magnificent gorges with narrow necks, which at a comparatively small expenditure could be closed in to make reservoirs for the conservation of large quantities of water. In 1910, there was published in the Age a. letter received by Mr William Orr, of Shepparton, from Mr William Taylor, of Cresswell Downs, to this effectShould the railway ever be built from Oodnadatta-South Australia's northernmost railway point-to Pine Creek, it would touch the western boundary of th'ese Downs, and a railway run from Newcastle Waters to Camooweal (to connect with Queensland) would run right through the centre of the Barkly table lands. There. would be no more engineering difficulties than there are between Hughenden and Cloncurry. Say a branch were then run from tbe main trunk line (Oodnadatta to Pine Creek) from either Newcastle Waters or the Katherine River to either Wyndham or Derby, in Western Australia, all this fine pastoral, mineral, and agricultural country would be made available. articles in the papers advocating different routes for railways, but I have spent thirty years in this country, and I do not think any one knows it better as a whole than I do. The three lines I have suggested would open all the country, would be the least expensive to build, and would, I firmly believe, be the best for the future of Australia, and: that is what I suppose most of us have at heart. Again, when some American land seekers were in the Territory, Mr Albert Campbell was reported thusHe considers that the whole place is held up, because, with the exception of droving, there is no means of marketing stock. All the really good pastoral country could be most profitably occupied if railways and freezing works were provided. Professor Spencer pointed ouc in one of his reports that the trouble from a pastoral point of view is that the land cannot be utilized for stock without a railway, because when dry seasons set in the graziers wait to the last moment before shifting their stock, and then find it impossible to travel them the necessary distance to get feed. Without talking about the whole of the Territory from north to south and east to west, I want to impress on the Government the fact that if the southern part is to be developed it can be done only by the continuation of the line from Oodnadatta north to the Macdonnell Ranges. We ought to have from the Government, when the next Budget is introduced, a distinct promise that before the next session expires they will introduce a B ill authorizing the construction of the railway from Oodnadatta to the Macdonnell Ranges. When that railway is built, I would suggest that the Government should divide the Territory into two, making the part from Newcastle Waters south into another Territory, and putting it in charge of a separate administrator. By that means only shall we be able to have that portion of the Territory developed. Once that is done there will be no trouble in looking after the rest. Settlement w ill push itself forward from south to north, and the land w ill be developed accordingly. Then, of course"" we shall agitate for extensions both to the east and to the west; but the first and primary necessity is to make the railway from Oodnadatta north to the Macdonnell Ranges, covering that 337 miles of desert, which makes everything in the way of commerce and business with the Macdonnell Ranges prohibitive at the present time. I have seen most of the [5.58] I take up the parable exactly where the honourable member for Gippsland has laid it down. Not only do we want development from the south, but we want the development that has been so severely criticised, from the east. If we are to develop the Territory in the lifetime of any one of us, making it an economic as well as a racial and national proposition, we must attack it from several points. It is a many-sided problem, and the longer we delay tackling it , and",39,Foster Th E Adelaide For Angas Referred To Day To The Opinions

He professes to be still full of hope and enthusiasm, but he is modifying his opinion on some matters very considerably.

283,Mr Joseph Cook,"Many membersSpeaking of the progress of land settlement, he writesThe progress of land settlement has been disappointingly slow, as will be seen by the report of the Director of Lands. the whole, I am not surprised. While the southern 'States continue an active policy of land settlement in districts already partly settled, the Territory will not offer any real inducement for the small farmer with reasonable capital to transfer his home from the south. And as, apparently, there is still much available land in Australia, where the climate and life generally offer more attractions than in the north, this is not altogether to be regretted. Here we have H is Excellency saying that it is of no use trying to get men from the south, because, if they do go there, they' will not stop in the Territory, but, whatever the conditions, will d r if t back again. He goes on to sayI have always been of opinion that it would not be a desirable method of settling the Territory, even were it possible-whic h I doubtto over-stimulate the transference of agricultural settlers from the south to the north; or, in other words, the transference of people from a sparsely-populated area of a comparatively empty continent to even a more sparsely-populated, especially while the States generally are using every effort to encourage immigration of that class of settler. Southern residents rarely appreciate the fact that the journey to Darwin occupies at least twelve days from Sydney ;-that mails are infrequent and practically only twice monthly -in some cases four weeks elapsing between mails. Even applicants for land and other would be settlers seem to fail to grasp these facts. On another page he saysAs regards labourers from the south becoming permanent settlers, the experience of all our Departments is against the probability. Rarely indeed do men remain for over a year. All countries of the newer world to-day are finding greater and greater difficulty in securing what is deemed to be the best class of immigrant, namely, the Anglo-Saxon and the Northern European, and it may be safely said that the extra-tropical parts of Australia can readily absorb all its available share-eve n .with the most strenuous encouragement-for years to come. But were such induced to come to the Territory by the most liberal concessions and labour treatment, the likelihood is that as soon as many had saved a fair amount of money they would remove to the south. He goes on to sayWere immigration of a good class of Southern European encouraged-it being insisted that a large percentage be accompanied by their families, and the remainder more or less related to them-the nucleus of permanent settlement may be established. Then he says that the construction of a railway would provide such settlers with work, and that there would be a chance of peopling the land in this way. Again, he saysSuch visits, which have not been confined Yet, on to the best parts of the year for travelling, have impressed me with the necessity for providing the two prime necessities to the advance of the Territory, viz., roads and means of communication generally, including railways, and the greater tapping of subterranean waters, together with conservation of surface waters. The Government may do much, but it is also necessary that the land-holders should do their share. The increasing value of cattle, the establishment of freezing works, and the extension of the railway, will warrant both public and private money being expended to a very great extent in such' prime necessities. Here, in tlie last paragraph of his report, he shows what in my judgment is the only practical policy, namely, the provision of water, railways, and roads-al l means of communication. cultivation land. with a freehold title, I doubt if , for some years to come, there would be any large amount of land settlement of a close kind. The main thing is that, even if men be placed on the land, and treated as well as possible, they w ill return to the more temperate latitudes, where they can enjoy life contiguous to civilization. 0 There are one or two facts outstanding of which we ought to take notice. The Territory is at a stand-still. the attempt is being made to develop the tropical portions of the Territory, instead of directing our attention to the more temperate parts. that we have been trying to do something that, perhaps, we should not have done, though I am not sure that we have been trying to do much at a l l . money. about the Territory in this House. When His Excellency made his last visit here, and discussed the matter so exhaustively with the late Government, and particularly with the then Minister of External Affairs, the honourable member for Angas, we understood that a policy had been enunciated with which he was in thorough accord.

Any one who reads the letter of the right honourable member for Swan outright, cannot, without straining language, interpret it . as it has been interpreted in South Australia. Here is the famous passage to which exception is taken' The western portion, however, is impossible, unless we have communication with QueenslandThat is to say, we cannot develop the western portion of the Territory except through Queenslandand, if that is denied to us, we must turn our attention to connecting the Northern Territory from Oodnadatta, a policy to which we are already pledged. If that means anything more than that, if we are nob permitted to tackle the Territory on one side as well, we must confine ourselves to development from the south, I do not understand the meaning of language. claimed that. members in South Australia have claimed that; they say that this was suggested as an alternative policy, but I say that it was an additional and not an alternative policy. vernment, yes. the view taken by some honourable members. A territory like this cannot be developed from one single point; this is a many-sided problem, and the more railways we can build from various directions, the more chance there is of making the Territory an economic proposition. The Territory has many disadvantages, and not the least of them, from an agricultural point of view, is connected with the labour conditions that have been imposed by the Arbitration Court. Do not let me be misunderstood for one moment. I do not say that the Judge has fixed the rate of payment for labour too high; but I am afraid that the rate fixed makes agriculture, with all our known means, impossible. been fixed of £ 3 four hours. The in one of his efficiency up there is not more than 80 per cent, of what it is in the southern States; and if we add 20 per cent, to the £3 13s. it rneans a real wage of about £4 7s. 6d. per cent, is a very low estimate. mark, in my judgment; but I am taking the figures of the Administrator. how preposterous the whole thing is? preposterous it is, under present conditions, as an agricultural proposition; and the facts have driven the Administrator to say that agricultural settlement of tha kind desired is impossible for many years to come. But are we to allow tlie matter to remain dormant and do nothing? There are certain things that can be done. A good part of the Territory is good cattle country, and good sheep country, too; and, further, it is, in my opinion, good mineral country, if it were only systematically prospected for water. already under cattle. a thing as developing country that is already in occupation of cattle. Just as it is possible to make two blades of grass grow where one grew before, so two bul0 locks can be produced where one was prothe Goduced before. ments the production of cattle can be increased four-fold. agree with that opinion. Cattle»and meat are rising in value, and this, I think, will help materially in the development of the Territory. So far as mixed farming and agricultural experiments go, we may spend money to the extent wo are able, but my opinion is that the economic conditions make it impossible to develop the agricultural side of the Territory at present. ture, how far will the stock trade go towards making the railways pay? is that the stock trade will develop many forms of collateral trade, as has COOK A wage has been experienced elsewhere in Australia. 13s. per week of fortyWe could scarcely push a railway anyAdministrator has said, where into good stock-raising country reports, that labour without improving that country, and",42,Foster Th E Adelaide For Angas Referred To Day To The Opinions

In a country like Australia, with the present prospects for primary products, we could scarcely go wrong in piercing any country with railways. The more railways we can get into the country, the more likely we are to eventually get a return. The problem requires that we should proceed by a process of elimination as well as by a process of accretion; and the Administrator himself is learning what to set aside and on what to concentrate. years learning what to do with the Territory ! 100 years learning what to do with many propositions. the same blunder in trying to develop the Territory from the same enda blunder that cost South Australia £4,000,000. is that we ought to develop the Territory from both ends. If we had railways connected with the Queensland system we should, I think, do more to develop the interior of the Territory than, perhaps, by any other means. There is plenty to be done, in addition, with the southern system of railways. The sooner the line is started from the south the better I shall be pleased. ing for. not the honourable member ask his own Government to do it?

The problem is a difficult one, and it will never be solved, in my opinion, until three of the essentialsrailways, roads, and water-ar e provided. Given these, together with the freezing works that are to be established, I venture to say that the stock-breeders of Australia will develop the country. The prospect is not so clouded, and I do not despair over the Territory at all, but would urge that we cannot go on with an adverse balance-sheet year after year. Something must be done to relieve our revenue of this tremendous incubus. What should be done, and done immediately, is to institute a different form of government to that which we have at present for the Territory.

If that is characteristic of land administration in the Northern Territory, there is very little wonder that it should still continue to be a white elephant. I believe that the very beginning of Federal administration of the Northern Territory was based upon principles which were just about as far from sane business principles as anything could possibly be. There are in Australia practical men who have known the Northern Territory intimately for from twenty to forty years. If we had the most experienced and brainiest men to be found in Australia in charge of this tremendous work, they would deserve all the sympathy which the Federal Parliament and the people of the Commonwealth could give them in their efforts to solve the big complex problems involved in the settlement of this country. It seemed as though the Government of the day decided that practically no one should be employed in the Northern Territory who knew anything about it, and the appointments to the various positions there included scarcely a single man of experience. I regret to say, and this is the first time. I have made the statement in this House, that the mistake began with the appointment of the Administrator of the Territory. He was called upon to perform work for which a university professor was not likely to be an ideal appointee. It was work in connection with which an ounce of experience was worth a ton of theory. which the honourable member supported would not leave the practical man there. agree, so far aa the control and administration of the Northern Territory are concerned, with what has been done by any Federal Government so far. I did not intend to mention any Government, because I am not discussing this matter from a party stand-point at all; but since the honourable member has interjected, I think I wonder I should say that no man could have put in more devoted, conscientious, and big problem than did the honourable member for Angas when he was Minister of External Affairs. The work of administering the Northern Territory, from the Ministerial and parliamentary point of view, is rendered more difficult because it involves the settlement of the country from the Seat of Government.

I tell honourable members, as I have told them repeatedly before, that South Australia recognised the White Australia principle, and it was because the South Australian people desired to hand the Territory over to the Federal authorities on those lines that they did not do a very great deal more for its development than they did. If it had not heen for their regard for that principle, the people of South Australia might have secured the investment of any amount of British and foreign capital in the Northern Territory. The honourable member for Grey, who knows the facts, will agree with me when I say that South Australia would have had no difficulty at all in inducing the investment of money in any quantity in the Northern Territory, and did not do so because otherwise the White Australia principle would not have been preserved. I hope that the last reproach we shall hear on the subject is that which we have just heard from the honourable member for Barrier, against South Australia, because she was not more successful in her administration.

I do hope that the Government will ask the Public Accounts Committee to visit the Northern Territory for the purpose of investigating what money has been expended there and how it has been spent. Distant as we are from the scene of this public expenditure, Parliament ought to have some first-hand check on what has been done there. If closer settlement in the Territory is possible, our first task must be to secure suitable settlers. If we can only obtain them at the rate of one man in nine months, the sooner we abandon the idea of closer settlement the better. resolve this problem by definitely pushing forward with pastoral and mineral development. all Australia has been settled by the pioneering pastoralist. He has demonstrated the possibility or otherwise of closer settlement. If that process has characterized Australian development in the more favourably situated portions of this continent-portion s in which there is a suitable soil and a reliable climate-ho w much more necessary is it that a similar process should be followed here? But if we intend to promote closer settlement in the Northern Territory we must commence by getting suitable families to settle there-familie s which can do the greater portion of their own work. I venture to say that we shall not get such families in Australia. There is not the shadow of a doubt about that, because there are in Australia untold undeveloped areas in districts which are relatively settled-district s which lie close to all the best phases of civilization. If there were any possibility of getting such families to settle in the Territory we should certainly have to offer them the inducement of the fee-simple. If men, after devoting the best portion of their lives to the task, succeeded in converting what is now comparatively a desert into a fruitful place, they would deserve every penny that they made. of the Administrator seems to breathe in every line a recognition of failure to attract this class of settler. Prom the very beginning I predicted that there was no likelihood of getting Australians to settle in the Territory, seeing that they could secure so much happier conditions nearer home. If a practical attempt is to be made to secure settlers from Southern Europe-as appears to be suggested by the Administrator-w e shall have to maintain them for a few years, and even then, if they ultimately succeed, it will not be bad business on our part. But whatever chance there may have been of securing such immigrants a couple of years ago, the prospects are much less alluring to-day. I think it would be infinitely better for this Parliament to bend the whole of its energies to the development of this Territory on pastoral and mineral lines. There is just on© other phase of this question to which I desire to refer. Hitherto only inexperienced men have We ought to been sent to the Territory to handle this complex problem. If these men would tell us the truth, they would admit that We must recollect that they are only just beginning to learn that they know very little about the Northern Territory. The only way in which this country can be developed along pastoral lines is by providing the pastoralists with adequate railway facilities. Until we do that, the heavy cost of cartage will be such a serious item that nobody can embark upon the industry except capitalists-and big capitalists at that. ThenI would point out that drought-stricken areas have to be traversed in order to get stock to market from the more favourably situated climatic portions of the country. That is the difficulty that has been experienced in connection with the pastoral settlement in the Macdonnell Ranges. that we got a bad bargain from South Australia. thing of the kind. But the position in regard to both the east-west and the north-south railways is that a lot of inferior country will have to be traversedcountry possessing only a limited rainfall and subject to periodic droughts. But we must not condemn a country which is big enough to be a continent in itself merely because, here and there, droughtTlie latest report stricken areas have to be traversed. I repeat that we shall not secure pastoral development to any great extent unless we face the railway question. I make bold to affirm that by bridging with a railway the country between Oodnadatta and the Macdonnell Ranges we shall secure an infinitely better financial proposition than we shall get from the east-west transcontinental line.",47,Fosteb Th E Present Place Of Our Great Continent As A Very
366,Mr Mathews,That is more evidence,48,Fosteb Th E Present Place Of Our Great Continent As A Very
367,Mr Richard Poster,"It is noForrest? honourable member for Swan knows that. Between Oodnadatta and the magnificent pastoral country in the Macdonnell Ranges an. area of 300 miles of droughtstricken country has to be crossed. The bridging of that track would not only render pastoral settlement in those ranges infinitely more prosperous than it is, but would immensely increase the revenue-producing capacity of the line between Oodnadatta and Port Augustaa line upon which there is a considerable loss each year. It is just like constructing a costly bridge across a wide stream. The honourable member has reached the time limit. -The honourable member for Wakefield has delivered a speech on the settlement of the Northern Territory which, to my mind, displays a good grip of the situation. But there is one remark he made to which I desire to take exception. He said, "" We will never get Australians to settle in the Northern Territory."" member qualifies his statement in that way, it is a different matter. An interjection was made from the other side that under the system he was putting forward we were advocating sheep, not men. How has Australia been settled? This is no new problem. The problem of settlement, as it presents itself in the Northern Terriplace mentioned-O'Neil l Creektory to-day, has been met and overcome in every State in the Commonwealth. First we get the cattleman and the prospector for minerals. When the mining towns are developed; when the cattleman has opened up country, and, to a certain extent, has developed and rendered it more useful hy putting on permanent improvements, along comes the sheep-man, and with him settlement, improved conditions, and a larger population. That has been the history of the development of Australia from one end of it to the other, and that, undoubtedly, sh.ould.be, and will be, the history of settlement in the Northern Territory. There can be little doubt that, so far, the Territory has not been properly handled. For one thing, it has not been properly advertised. In looking through the report of the Administrator for the year 1913, one may be well surprised to see the wealth of mineral deposits which are found, and which are being developed, in certainly an unsatisfactory way, in the Territory. We are all more or less aware that there is a great quantity of minerals scattered throughout the Territory. We are also aware that it contains good cattle country; but to make people understand what minerals are there, may I quote a few excerpts from the report of the Department of Mines. It starts off with a reference to gold, and talks about a seam of 1 foot of stone which is carrying 4^ ozs. of gold to the ton. We do not need anything better than that. That is surely OF A TRMAN -Orde r 1 The good enough for any one. In various paragraphs gold is mentioned. There is quite a number of places which are being developed, and concerning Tanimi, in particular, we read-> It will, therefore, suffice to say that, from surface indications, the field is a good one, and will go ahead by leaps and bounds when it is afforded means of crushing and treating the stone. There are mentioned fully a dozen places where there is good payable gold, and all that is wanted are means for developing it. Next we come to tin. There is no need for any one, either here or outside, to emphasize the fact that there are large deposits of tin in the Northern Territory, because it is well known. But what is, perhaps, not common knowledge is the fact that there are also large deposits of silver-lead. For instance, here is one The silver-lead lode, now known as McCarthy's, at the head of O'Neill Creek, about 24 miles east of Pine Creek, is opening up far better than was expected from the look of its outcrop. This lode was discovered by the late Bobert Cundy, locally known as "" Bob the Stranger,"" who showed it to the present holders. Last year a party of Chinese tribnters were put on, and these men have worked portions of the lode to a depth of 60 feet. At the lower workings the lode carries solid galena over 3 feet wide. One cannot ask for anything better than that in any part of the countryThe 300 tons of ore sent away from thiamine averaged about 70 per cent, of lead, but were low in silver values. On the next page copper is dealt with, and one copper deposit is spoken of in the following wayAt the old Copperfield mine, 4 miles ..west of Pine Creek, a rich chute of copper ore was met with at a depth of 50 feet.",48,Fosteb Th E Present Place Of Our Great Continent As A Very

372,Mr Fleming,"If the honorableUnfortunately this, like most of the other mines in the Territory, is at present being worked by Chinese, and we must recognise, as is commonly recognised in many parts of New South Wales, that Chinese will undertake the ""developing, or rather the destroying, of our mines without the means of communication which the white man needs to open up the country. The longer we leave these mines and rich mineral lodes in the hands of Chinese, the less valuable will they become, because, as the honourable member for Wakefield rightly interjects, they do the pig-rooting. They pick out the eyes of, and destroy the value of what should be, large workable reefs. These are not all the minerals that we have in the Territory. In this report mention is made of wolfram, and also mica, about which we read in the reportThe new manager, Mr Haworth, is well leased with the prospects of the district, and as sent away several small lots as samples, which have been pronounced by an expert in Sydney to be equal in quality to anything produced in any other part of the world. That aggregate of mining possibilities is * of those who are qualified to do the mining work of this country. man who knows anything of Australia is aware that cattle men have already been working the Territory, and working it under a great disadvantage. In this report we are told that they are well on the way to establishing freezing works, which, of course, will not only make a much larger area of land available for profitable occupation, but will render a great deal of that land which is already occupied far more profitable. The whole world to-day is beginning to look to Australia for meat. The Northern Territory is an absolutely ideal place for the production of meat. But there is another point which appeals to me even more strongly. We know that, of the total revenue of Australia, fully a third is made up from wool .%production,and that at present the wool production is decreasing. We also know that the gold production is decreasing, and that within the last ten or fifteen years it has decreased by about 33 per cent. Here, it seems to me, is a part of the country adapted by nature to fill those two wants. When the present terrible war is over there must be not only a large demand for our wool, meat, and other products, but we shall want gold to meet the situation. In all probability, so far a? human foresight can foretell, the war will yet last long enough to give us a chance to in some measure meet the requirements of the situation by the development of the Territory, if its development is taken in hand at once and pushed on as it should ""be. We will have the food supply which the world is even now demanding, and which every year it will be demanding more and more. We will have wool, which has been, after all, the staple industry of Australia, and which more than any other industry has gone to pay the interest on our national debt. We can produce the gold which will be necessary to meet our tremendously inflated note issue. gest? has been suggested here time and again. In the first place, the development of this country must be done by railways. But there is another aspect which appeals to me very largely, and that is that there has been no sympathetic administration. We know very wellI dare say that a great surely sufficient to attract the attention majority of the public know it too-that the people in the Territory have protested Every against the Administrator. He may he a well-meaning manI have nothing to say against him in that respect-bu t he does not understand the position, and, as the honourable member for Wakefield quite rightly said, no man who is a university professor, and that only, can be expected to go up to the Territory and take a practical grip of these questions. that the people up there would protest against any man who conscientiously did his duty? these men who go out to pioneer a country like the Northern Territory are of the real stuff. They are absolutely, as the honourable member for Wakefield interjects, the finest men in the world. They are not out looking for trouble, trying to find complaints about the Administrator or any one else. They are out to develop the country. They have gone to the Territory because they like the life, and because they see opportunities before them. That is one of the troubles we find in connection with the Territory.

Buti t is an immense country, and though there are some poor parts, there is an immense area of it that is rich which, if properly handled, must become a valuable asset to the Commonwealth.

My honest conviction is that there is only one policy with which we can start the development of the Northern Territory. provide facilities for people to get there with their stock, and to send their produce away, the money now being spent might just as well be thrown into the Gulf of Carpentaria. I differ from the honourable member for ""Wakefield.

As the honourable member for Angas has said, the first 150 miles from the northern coast only may be said to be under tropical conditions. that is destined to carry the agricultural population of the future. on; but I venture to say that the Barclay Tablelands and the Macdonnell Ranges country will carry more population than ""We have had a clearly-defined that tropical country will carry, and under healthy conditions.

In fact, there will be room for three or four railways. But we have first to consider what will be the first thing to do in order to get a move on. The Prime Minister was interviewed in Adelaide, and I noticed that, while he said the policy was to construct from Oodnadatta onwards, he also said that the starting of the work was largely a matter of finance. I venture to say that if the strategic railway be approved by Parliament, the money needed will be found. £7,000,000? fully.

A t present we send men to Port Darwin, and dump them down there under tropical conditions. We have to pay big fares to get them there, and since quite a number of them become dissatisfied because the conditions are so foreign to those to which they have been accustomed, we have to .pay big fares to bring them back again. Again, if we wish to stock the country, every hoof has to be taken to Port Darwin, and then moved south through tropical country, some of which is more subject to disease than are the higher portions where the altitude is as much as 4,000 feet. Taking all things into consideration, the expense of building the line and the expense of stocking the country is greater than if we adopted the policy of building northward from the present settlement. When the Minister of External Affairs was speaking on the last occasion on which this matter was discussed, he left us gloriously in the dark as to what was his policy. He complained that he did not know what to do. His was really a policy of despair. He said that his own policy was that indicated by the right honourable member for Swan; but that right honourable gentleman makes the South Australian connection an altogether secondary consideration, as shown by his final letter to the then Prime MinisterThe offer of the Federal Government is onesided, but 'still the interests of Australia (which are our main consideration) have to be given prominence, and if the Northern Territory is to be opened up by railways in a few years, we must build from the Katherine Our policy was consouthward to Newcastle Waters, and from Camooweal westward to Newcastle Waters.

The righ t honourable gentleman, who was then Treasurer, wroteI was disappointed in reading Mr Denham's official reply, dated 22nd June, to your letter to him of the 16th May last, on the subject of the railway extension from Cloncurry to Camooweal.* Although the proposal was that Cloncurry should be connected with Camooweal, I do not think it matters much how the connection with the western border is made, whether from Hungerford or from any other place, so long as some place in the vicinity of Camooweal is made the terminus. T should like to point out some of the great advantages that Queensland would derive from the connection of her western border with her railway system :1. The Commonwealtli would undertake to construct a railway from Camooweal through the Barclay Tablelands to Newcastle Waters, and thence up to the Katherine River, which will by that time be connected with Port Darwin. 2. In the construction of this work all the traffic of rails, machinery, and sleepers would be carried over the Queensland lines; and I am informed wooden sleepers can be obtained in Queensland. This in itself during the time of construction would mean an immense advantage to Queensland. have the trade of the Northern Territory from Newcastle Waters and the Barclay Tablelands, which would all gravitate into Queensland. 3. It would be an outlet for the enterprising people of Queensland, and would encourage them to occupy and utilize the lands in the Northern Territory. Looking at the matter from whatever point of view I can, I cannot conceive of anything but great advantage to Queensland from this connection (and advantage to the whole Commonwealth as well), because we would have communication in a very short time from Fremantle on the west, to Port Darwin, via Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Rockhampton, Camooweal, and Newcastle Waters. The expenditure necessary to be incurred by Queensland to connect her western border is very small compared with the expenditure that is proposed by the Commonwealth Government; and, as I have already said, I am not only disappointed, but I may add surprised, that such an advantageous offer should not have been at once accepted. I can only advise you to again submit the matter, and ask for further consideration. The offer of the Federal Government is one-sided, but still COOK -No; what he the interests of Australia (which are our main consideration) have to be given prominence, and, if the Northern Territory is to be opened up by railways in a few years, we must build from the Katherine southward to Newcastle I did not wish to Waters, and from Camooweal westward to Newcastle Waters. The western portion, however, is impossible, unless we have communication with Queensland, and, if that is denied to us, we must turn our attention to connecting the Northern Territory from Oodnadatta, a policy to which we are already pledged. This pledge was to be regarded only in the event of the Queensland Government refusing to accept the suggestion of the right honourable member for Swan. honourable member's meaning. struction to p u t on his words. not clear. tion put on the words by the honourable member for Angas, who was at the time Minister of External Affairs, and charged with the administration of the Northern Territory.

The press report saysThe Prime Minister( Mr Fisher), who is in Adelaide, was questioned on Monday regarding the attitude of the Federal Government on those matters. He said it had already pledged itself to go on with the railway to the Northern Territory. It was its policy to construct big and necessary lines throughout Australia, which was the only way to develop the country in the absence of water-ways. The question of route had nothing to do with the big main question. It was not for him to say whether the line would go north and south; people could look at the surrender agreement in connection with the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth, and see that for themselves. It would be settled on an economic basis, in keeping with the terms of the agreement. The starting of the work was largely a matter of finance. the right honourable member for Swan was vague, how does the honourable member characterize the language of the Prime Minister which he has just quoted? I received from the Prime Minister, during the State elections, he saidThe strategic railway relates to defence, and does not in any way affect the obligation of constructing the north-south railway, nor will it retard it, if it be undertaken. question. I think most honourable members would like au answer to it . south railway have been made if the suggestion of the right honourable member for Swan had been accepted? two railways then. plain in tlie letter written by the right honourable member, whose suggestion evidently had not the endorsement of the Cook Administration, as is shown by the correspondence. We should have some statement by the Government of its policy regarding the Northern Territory. The statement of the Prime Minister is about as definite as that of the Minister of External Affairs, who said, in effect, "" If I have any policy at a l l , it is such as has been indicated by the right honourable member for Swan."" I look upon this question purely as one of finance. get the money to build the line now? money for strategic railways? Unquestionably, if there were agreement as to route, the necessary money would be found at once. Ofteni n private business it is necessary to spend money in order to save money, and that is our position in regard to the Northern Territory. The manner in which the development of the Northern Territory has been attempted is not creditable to this Parliament. As far as the Administrator is concerned, there appears to have been nothing but trouble since he went to the Northern Territory. He is one of the worse hands that ever I came across at handling men. If there is likely to be any trouble at all, he seems to help it along. I stated in the South Australian Parliament that it would be foolish for South Australia to attempt to develop the Northern Territory from the north, and that any such proceeding would be a huge failure. It will be an equal failure if we attempt it . The journey from the south is into a different class of country in which any of our people can live, and I venture to suggest that by the time the railway is constructed, and a proper survey made by the Department of Lands, millions of acres of good Mitchell grass country w ill have been taken up by the men who w ill gravitate along that line. Mr Wells, Deputy Commissioner of Taxesi n South Australia, is as pronounced as anybody in favour of the possibilities of this vast area of country; but what are we going to do? Surely we are not so financially stuck that we cannot raise sufficient money to bridge the piece of bad country between Oodnadatta and the Macdonnell Ranges. Once through there the chief difficulty will be overcome. The honourable member for Robertson referred to mining propositions. Carriage to some of these propositions costs, no less than £ 4 0 a ton. It is a moral impossibility to get explosives. Take the Macdonnell Ranges through the Murchison country. You cannot get explosives there, because only camel teams in charge of Afghans are available, and they will not carry explosives.

With things as they are, it is impossible to do anything in the way of development. If the railway were constructed many developments in other directions would take place, but until we take the risk, or have the courage to spend money, we shall, year by year, discuss these Estimates, which are showing an increasing deficit, without any results at all. I hope before the Estimates go through that a statement will be made by the Minister giving some indication that, at any rate, this work is to go on. the Pine Creek railway was made by coloured labour on contract? the work was done by contract. The contractor imported the labour himself. There was a proposal that South Australia should import Tamilsa race of Indian coolies-bu t in the interests of keeping Australia white, South Australia refused to take this step, though the recommendation was strongly made thst it should do so. This Parliament does not want to conduct operations with any coloured labour, and we ought to be very proud that the Territory is now comparatively free of coloured population. The Chinamen that have been spoken of were brought to the Territory by Miller Brothers for construction work, but the step from the stand-point of settlement was a bad one. Had the line been constructed by white labour, I have not the slightest doubt that a number of the men would have settled near the line, and that development would have eone on as soon as the line was opened. I believe now that as soon as the line is opened hundreds of men will settle in the Territory. [9.2] I desire but a few minutes to conclude my remarks, which were cut short by the time limit. Leaving the Oodnadatta railway where it is to-day, is like building a bridge across a wide stream, taking it half-way across, and then leaving it, with the bridge absolutely purposeless. That is very largely the posiI wish it to be clearly understood that I tion owing to the northern railway terminal not being continued from Oodnadatta. The suggestion of the South Australian Government in regard to the Great Northern Railway system was that, starting from Port Augusta, it should branch off from Parina to tap the north-west Queensland country; but before the construction reached Farina, the South Australian Government determined upon a fresh policy. They decided to tackle the question of Northern Territory development, and instead of deviating in the direction of Queensland, it was decided to carry the railway straight through in a direct line to Palmerston. The construction by sections was carried on until the railway reached Oodnadatta, and then, owing to a period of financial stringency, the further construction had to be held up. In the meantime, the proposal to transfer the Northern Territory to the Federal Government was introduced, and that is the reason why South Australia did not continue its original intention to carry on the construction of that railway until it reached, at all events, the Macdonnell Ranges. The honourable member for Grey has referred to a statement by the Prime Minister, and another statement in regard to strategic railways; but I would remind honourable members that when Lord Kitchener was in Australia-thi s proposal was in hand at the time-h e distinctly referred to this as a strategic military railway that would connect the south with the large populations in the eastern cities. Mr J. H . CATTS -I s that on record ? it is. Mr J. H .

434,Mr Richard Foster,"Yes, thisthat I thought there would never be any agriculture in the Northern Territory. WhatI do say is that at present, and possibly for a good many years to come, agriculture there is not a promising commercial proposition, and should be abandoned for the pioneering development which flows from pastoral pursuits, from wool-raising, stock-raising, and the production of meat, for which there will continue to be an ever-increasing demand. There are millions of acres in the Macdonnell Ranges that are just as promising for wheat production as the average wheat country within the settled areas of Australia. The climate of the Macdonnell Ranges is better than the best climate in the southern portions of Australia. rainfall ? rainfall of from 10 inches to 21 inches over millions and millions of acres in the Northern Territory. in the summer time? like that of the semi-tropical and tropical parts of Australia, it does not. It does not fall, possibly, in what we in the southern parts of Australia would regard as the ideal months of the year, but it comes at a time when large wheat-growing areas in New South Wales have their rainfall. The most competent judges in Australia-the best bushmen, men who are most conversant with Australia's interior areas-sa y that there is nothing to surpass the way-back country of the Northern Territory for stock-raising purposes, and that in the hills there we have the finest horseto maintain the reputation of Australia breeding country to be found in any part of the world. But while millions of acres of this part of the country would grow wheat, it cannot be regarded to-day as a wheat proposition, because the haulage to the nearest outlet at the seaboard would be out of the question. it be-50 0 ? be between 700 and 800 miles from Port Augusta. The day will come when that part of the Territory will not only grow wheat, but will be required to grow it. In Canada, the haulage of wheat over 700 miles of railway is regarded as a mere bagatelle. Wheat is carried three times that distance, both in Canada, and in some parts of the United States. The proposition which the Parliament and the Government of the Commonwealth should foster, however, is the development of the pastoral and mining industries in the Northern Territory. Nothing to-day has a more encouraging outlook than has the pastoral industry. Indeed, I am not sure that the pastoral industry has not a more encouraging outlook on the average generally than has that of wheat growing. The pastoral industry in the Northern Territory will become a necessity, because, in the areas that have carried the flocks of Australia, graziers are gradually being pushed out by the promotion of closer settlement. As the honourable member for Robertson has pointed out, wool is the staple product that has made Australia. As he said, very truly, Australasia contributes 25 per cent, of the whole of the wool production of the world; or, if we take the wool production of the world that is worked up into textiles, the Australasian output represents about one-third of the whole. Again, if we take sheep, and all for which they stand, they represent 48""r per cent, of the exportable 7 values from Australasia. ' There was never a more promising outlook for the pastoral industry than to-day. A few years ago, when this matter was debated in the House, and when the pastoral industry did not look anything like so promising as it now does, I was inclined to think at times that the picture was not altogether too rosy a one for the Government in taking this responsibility; but a great change has come over the scene. Not only have we a right in our own interests, as a business proposition, for the production of wool-to maintain the highest level of the past, and to go beyond that level-bu t we have the prospect to-day of making bigger profits than we have ever had before from stock-raising in the disposal of meat by export. We have, in this respect, a prospect of profits, and of a volume of trade that we did not dream of eight or ten years ago, and, indeed, of which we little thought only five or six years ago. It is a good proposition, therefore, to let the pastoralist do the pioneering work in the Northern Territory, as he has done all over Australia. When I said that young Australians would not be induced to go to the Northern Territory, I meant to convey that I did not think they would go there to engage in agriculture or horti-",56,Fosteb Th E Present Place Of Our Great Continent As A Very

But if we gave young Australians in the interior an opportunity to secure leases of from 20,000 to 50,000 acres of good pastoral land, they would readily seize it. We have in the interior of South Australia, as well as in Queensland and Western Australia, numbers of claypan squatters who for years have been looking out for decent leaseholds. Give them fair areas under lease, and they will rush the Terri: tory. I agree with the honourable member for Grey that vast areas of the best pastoral land are held under leases which have yet to run for a considerable time. AndI should not mind their being held in large areas if the lease-holders would develop and improve the country-if they would increase production year by year. Unfortunately, we shall have to wait for these long leases of large areas to come to a termination before we can secure closer settlement by the settlement of smaller pastoralists and graziers. The day will come, however, when that will be possible. Meantime, I believe it would be fair to say to these men who are holding unduly large areas -thousand s of square miles in extent"" You got these leases at a peppercorn rental, at a time when you had to face the greatest possible pioneering difficulties that were ever known in Australia, and if you secure railway facilities, intersecting the Territory east and west, and north and south, the value of your leases will be increased enormously, so that it is reasonable that you should have to pay something, possibly, in the way of a betterment tax."" the Northern Territory Ordinances. so. I believe that that proposition is not only legal, but very fair. I look forward to the day when these immensely valuable pastoral areas will have, not one proprietor for every 5,000 or 6,000 square miles, but a proprietor for every 500 square miles. I do not take a pessimistic view of the Territory. The possibilities of the meat export trade are bound to increase from year to year, and a very satisfactory return will be obtained, not only from the wool, but also from the carcasses and hides, and we shall yet have a prosperous settlement in that Territory, which is almost big enough in itself to be called a continent. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [9.16] I wish to claim the Minister's attention to a few remarks I shall make on an island territory recently acquired by the Commonwealth. I refer to Norfolk Island, situated about 1,000 miles east of Australia, and comprising an area of some 8,000 odd acres, upon which are settled about 600 descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Most honourable members are acquainted with the story of the mutiny of the Bounty, and the sequel. The mutineers settled on Pitcairn Island with some Taliitian women. The families"" increased until it was found that Pitcairn was too small to support them. When the British Government discovered, many years after the ""mutiny, where the mutineers were settled, it was reported that the islanders were a most pious, happy, and righteousliving socialistic community. In consequence, the Pitcairners became known as pets of the late Queen Victoria, and she gave instructions that when any ships of the Admiralty were, passing Pitcairn they should leave there clothing, blankets, and foodstuffs for the settlers. In fact, I understand that special instructions were given that ships voyaging in the direction of Pitcairn Island should load up with articles of comfort and necessity to be left for the islanders. were not treated so generously by Her Gracious Majesty. Some of them were taken Home by the scruff of the neck. Mr J. H . CATTS I have no desire to go into the detailed history of the affair; I am merely making a few preliminary remarks in order to make more understandable what I am about to say. The population having grown to such an extent that Pitcairn Island was found too small, the British Government were asked if a more suitable habitation could be found. A t that time Norfolk Island was a convict settlement, and eventually it was offered to the Pitcairn Islanders as a permanent home. After holding public meetings they decided to accept the offer of the Government, and some sixty or seventy years ago a vessel, specially chartered by the Imperial Government, conveyed some 198 Pitcairners over 3,000 miles to Norfolk Island.",57,Fosteb Th E Present Place Of Our Great Continent As A Very
441,Mr Poynton,That can be done under,58,Fosteb Th E Present Place Of Our Great Continent As A Very
442,Mr Richard Foster,I believe,58,Fosteb Th E Present Place Of Our Great Continent As A Very
443,Mr Bbennan,"The original mutineersBy this time the whole of the convicts had heen removed from Norfolk Island, but a number of magnificent residences, completely furnished, had been left standing. It is quite apparent, from the deep-rooted impression of the local population, that they were told that they could occupy Norfolk Island under the same conditions as they had previously occupied Pitcairn Island-that is to say, the island would be practically theirs in perpetuity to occupy and administer as they thought fit. Although legal document confirming this arrangement can be found, it is a fact that those houses have been occupied for sixty or seventy years without any question having been raised as to the rightful occupation of them. Indeed, the houses have been willed from father to son as if the occupants held regular titles to them, as we understand such titles in Australia. some four or five years ago an islander, who had made some legal studies, raised a question as to the ownership of the houses, and an effort was made to obtain a proper title to them. The outcome was a decision by the Administrator, the then Governor of New South ""Wales, that the fact was to be placed beyond all future dispute that the houses belonged to the Government, and the local people had no right to them. They were, however, to be allowed to continue in occupation, provided they signed a form of nominal lease, which would guarantee to them the use of the houses for three generations to come. This decision the islanders practically unanimously refused to accept. simply said, "" If , by signing such a lease, we acknowledge that these houses do not belong to us, we shall be impugning the veracity of our parents, who told us that the properties were handed over to them, and who claimed to have bequeathed them to us in a proper way."" The authorities went to the extent of evicting some of the people, with their goods and chattels. I object to that procedure^ mainly for this reason: Even if it be true that the islanders had no legal claim to the houses, the fact remains that the Government had absolutely no use for them, and the islanders have absolutely refused to occupy houses from which others have been evicted. I understand that the only two such houses which are now occupied Ifr. J. E. Catts. are those in which live the local medical oflicer and the Church of England minister respectively. Those houses, which would probably be worth thousands of pounds in Australia, are lying vacant and simply crumbling to decay. The Government have turned the people out of the buildings, and, having no use for them, have allowed them to go to rack and ruin. That is more than unjust; it is farcical. If the Government had any use for the buildings, there might have no been some justification for asserting their authority. They put the people out because a question as to the proper title was raised; and to assert the authority of the Government the occupiers were told that they must sign leases or be put out. The matter could have been as effectively, and more humanely, handled, even from the viewpoint of the authorities, by the mere issue of a proclamation assertIt appears, however, that ing ownership, but without uselessly disturbing the local population. The holders, who in many cases had occupied the buildings for several generations, refused to sign leases, and were promptly turned out, with their goods and chattels, on to the road. The local indignation was so intense that I was informed that there certainly would have been a riot; but they were told that, if they insisted, a British war-ship would be brought to shell the place, or land a party, and that they would be practically slaughtered .if they did not yield. There is a good deal of property in the way of buildings standing on Nori folk Island, and if the Government They are going to assert ownership there ought to be some systematic arrangement for putting the buildings into and keeping them in repair. There can be no justification for turning the people out and allowing the houses to go to ruin. Will the Minister, who knows something about the hardships of evictions, and whose sympathies are, I am sure, with the people in a case like this, see that a stop is put to this business ? A case was brought under my notice there where a young widow, with several young children and an old maiden sister-in-law, was living in a place which had been occupied by the family for about three generations. They had kept it in repair, but they were given notice to shift. I asked the Administrator what justification there was for this action, and he said "" We want the place for the local policeman."" There are plenty of other places, from which people have already been evicted, which are being allowed to go to rack and ruin, and that could easily be put into repair to accommodate the local policeman. Will the Minister look into this case and act on his own initiative? The present Administrator was probably an official in the Department in New South Wales, and many of the evictions may have taken place during or under his authority as an officer in New South Wales. He may have recommended some of them, or may have had something to do in carrying them out. I am not certain on this point, and I would not like to do the present Administrator an injustice. What has happened is altogether beneath the dignity of the Government, and I hope that an effectual remedy will soon be applied. So far as regards local government on Norfolk Island, there are 600 descendants of the early mutineers in occupation of 8,000 acres, which is fairly close settlement. There are also, probably, a couple of hundred coloured people connected with the Melanesian Mission.

CATTS -No. I would give them the right to manage their own local concerns by some form of local government, and place upon them the responsibility of providing for their own administration. Local affairs would be much more economically managed. them? Mr J. H . CATTS I believe it would. It would uot cost much for them to manage their own affairs. About £3,000 is on the Estimates for managing the island for the current year. Fancy £3.000 for the year to manage the affairs of some 150 families! There must be gross extravagance while the affairs of the island are managed from Melbourne. Tho whole thing is small, and probably the Commonwealth Government, with its £20,000,000 of revenue, can pitch away £10,000 a year without any one taking any notice of it. We have there quite an array of officials who are absolutely unjustified. There is an Administrator, a Secretary, a Customs Officer, a Medical Officer necessary. Mr J. H . CATTS -Absolutely . Mr J.

Mr J. H . CATTS -First of all, let me finish the list of officers. There is a postmaster, a secretary to the local Executive Council, and a policeman, who has two island assistants.

CATTS I think the Administrator could do the Customs work, seeing that the boat calls only once a month, and is there but a few hours. work of the Lands Office. Mr J. H . CATTS A Lands Office for less than 150 families on 8,000 acres! Let me give an illustration of what I mean. There are any number of trade unions, with memberships up to 1,000, the secretaries of which manage the whole of the business; and a trade union secretary has much more to do for individual members than the Government have to do for individuals on Norfolk Island. From Mr Atlee Hunt's report it will be gathered that there is little occasion for a policeman, because, in the absence of liquor, there is no crime-non e of those petty misdemeanours which arise from over indulgence in drink. A t present there is an Executive Council, a minority of which is nominated by the local people; but that Council has practically no authority. All it has to do allowance in addition to his salary, is to see that the bridges and roads are kept in repair; and this work is accomplished by the male population, who devote so many days a year to it, the Council deciding when any repairs are necessary, and whose turn it is to make them. Beyond that, however, the Council has really no power or authority. When we were at Norfolk Island, a public meeting was held, at which the islanders laid their views before the visiting members; and I must say that there was more ability manifested by the islanders than is found in most of the municipal bodies in this country; indeed, I feel certain that their case was put probably as well as it could have been by even the representatives of this Parliament. People who know what they want, and can state their views so clearly as did those islanders, ought to have the right to manage their own local affairs. A t present, of course, very little money is raised locally by way of taxation, the Commonwealth making all the necessary payments; and I may say that the first year the island was taken over by the Commonwealth, the expenditure of the New South Wales Government in the previous years was doubled. local people, if they are spoken to about it, say that they cannot understand why all this official paraphernalia is necessary, seeing that they used to be able to manage the island on very little expenditure; but, of course, if the Commonwealth cares to appoint these officials, and pay them, the islanders wish the Commonwealth good luck, so long as they are not ultimately called upon to find the money. there now than there were when the island was managed by the New South Wales Government? Mr J. H . CATTS-Yes, and we are levelling up their salaries. The Customs officer, who was getting, say, £75 a year, felt that that salary was not a fair one, while for similar officers in the Commonwealth service there is a minimum of £126. If we employ men, we ought to pay them decently; but it is a farce to employ so many, when one could do the whole of the work. I notice that the Administrator has £100 a year as a living although the cost of living there must be about one-third of what it is in Australia. The standard rate of pay for'labour on the island is 6s. a day; and we who have visited the place know that the cost of living is very low. Probably 6s. a day on Norfolk Island is equivalent to 10s. a day in Australia; and yet the Administrator has this allowance, as though he were stationed in some place where the cost of living was sufficiently high to justify it. The local people feel that, in all probability, the money spent on the administration will be charged up to them, and that, if ever they are placed on a basis of local government, and have to raise their own taxation, they may be called upon to pay interest on the previous expenditure, and gradually liquidate the debt. If we gave those people the right to manage their own local concerns, and to raise the necessary small amount of money by local taxation, there would be a better state of affairs. It is complained that there is no originality or initiative shown by the' local people-that they do not take a pride in the place, and keep the roads and bridges in as good a state as when the convicts were there. But there must The have been upwards of 1,000 convicts, and, of course, it was possible to keep every-",60,Fosteb Th E Present Place Of Our Great Continent As A Very

A t the same time, if we do not allow these people to manage their own concerns, how can we expect them to take a pride in the place. simply put officiate in charge, and affairs are administered without any knowledge on the part of the islanders. As a matter of fact, when we were there, I found that the local Executive Council did not know what was being spent by the Commonwealth during the current year; and when I turned up the Estimates for them, that was the first intimation they had had of local administrative expenditure and its abnormal increase over that of the previous year. listened with a great deal of interest to the remarks made by the honourable member for Cook, but at this stage I do not intend to discuss the matter referred to by him. Having been a visitor to Norfolk Island, I understand that the Commission which has recently visited the island wil l shortly bring down a report, together with a recommendation. robbery. bers appear to be anxious to know about the robbery to which I referred, but I think, on reflection, that it took place four or five days before we arrived there.

CATTS isolated instance. the whole place, for there had never been anything of the kind on this island before. Mr J. necessity for police there? liceman would be quite enough, but he has other duties to perform. However, it is not my intention to discuss that question just now. I intend to direct the attention of honourable members to what we are doing with regard to the Northern Territory. I think, in the first place, we have been endeavouring to develop the Territory quite from the wrong angle, and that we should have followed the example set us by the other States, [132] by paying more attention to the pastoral industry, allowing the development of the mining industry and"" farming to follow in their natural order. Instead of doing that, we have been trying to develop the farming resources of the Northern TerA t present we ritory, and I think it would have been a good thing for the Northern Territoiy, as well as for the taxpayers of Australia, if we had never spent a penny in starting those Utopian demonstration farms. Up to the present something like £30,000 has been expended ou the Batchelor farm, on the Daly River, and I find there has been an expenditure of £7,944 on machinery alone for these farms, whereas in South Australia the expenditure last year for similar farms was only £8,068, and Western Australia, which is fast developing into an agricultural centre, only spent £3,014. In view of all the circumstances, I am not surprised that settlers should feel reluctant to go to the Northern Territory. The net gain last year, according to a report recently submitted, was only one settler. I have been looking through the reports, of the managers of the demonstration farms, and could not help thinking that they read like a page from the Arabian Nights. If a man had an idea of settling in that country, I think he would certainly be discouraged after reading the reports. I now intend to entertain the Committee for a few minutes while I read a few extracts. The manager of the Daly Demonstration Farm statesCorn planting had to be delayed till the grasshoppers disappeared, as they demolished It was quite an the young plants as they cams up. The wet weather set in very suddenly after this, and prevented the sowing of ground that had been ready before tbe advent of the grasshoppers, and it was necessary to replough the land on account of the weeds. Theni n regard to cattle he remarksH. CATTS D i d you see any Seventy full-grown bullocks and four brokenin workers were purchased for the purpose of supplying working bullocks for the settlers, but were not availed of. Fourteen of these have been killed, and the meat sold to settlers and to the men's mess. Turning now to the Batchelor Demonstration Farm, I find that the report statesOn the retirement of Mr C. N. Woolley, Mr J. E. Syme was appointed acting manager on Oth June. His first duties were the sorting out and accumulating of machinery, much of which was in the paddocks owing to the strike.

459,Mr Pigott,"No; I think one poJune, when the traction engine started ploughing in the railway paddock-6 5 acres. Fortythree acres were ploughed, at a eost of 15s. per acre. Further on I find that there was trouble in ploughing, owing to the hard nature of the land, and the report statesAlso water had to be brought from Adelaide and Darwin Rivers by rail, and was supplied in leaking tanks, much of it being lost. Fancy supplying water in leaking tanks in a country like that! I saw men who were carting water twenty miles from the railway line. furtherThe remaining 22 acres in this paddock were ploughed with the new oil tractor, and also cost 153. per acre. . . . This can be understood when it is borne in mind that it is green timber country, full of roots, hard and compact by heavy rains and sun, with a Heavy growth of suckers and seedlings and deeprooted grass, that in a favorable season grows 8 to 10 feet high. Turning now to sorghum, I find the report statesAnother area of 5 acres was sown on 10th ""November in paddock C, the ""soil being a sandy loam. The seed used was "" Planters' Friend,"" 10 lbs. to the acre. As there was not enough "" Planters' Friend"" to finish the area, the remainder was drilled with Sorghum Saccharatum, the seed being sown^at the"" same rate. This crop germinated evenly, but the parrots destroyed a lot by pulling it up, and the native annual grass grew so strongly as to choke the sorghum. The experiments regarding cotton are thus describedAn area of 5 acres was sown down with Caravonica cotton on 25th November, in squares 10 feet apart, and germinated well, but as the annual grass grew so strongly it was decided to scarify and resow, which was done on 30th December. Lucerne is referred to as followsAbout 14 acres have been sown down in lucerne. This land was ploughed twice at a depth of 7 inches. manured with stable manure, which was spread over the land before the second ploughing. Now, how could it be expected that land could he heavily dressed with stable manure in the Northern Territory? Oats, I find, are referred to in the report as follows: An acre was sown in the experimental plots on 8th November with Algerian oats. I have never yet heard of a farmer puttin g in oats on 6th November. report continues1$ bushels being used, with 56 lbs. superphosphatesWe know that the effect of superphosphates in a hot climate would be to burn the seedbut did not germinate.

I have marked thirty or forty passages of the report, but In South Australia. I shall not weary the Committee with them. I venture to say that if these reports were published in pamphlet form and circulated among our farmers, they would prefer them for reading matter to the Bulletin or Punch, but they would not be encouraged by them to go to the Northern Territory. We have heard a great deal about the suitability of the Northern Territory for cereals. I should be disposed to agree with the honourable member for Wakefield that the Macdonnell Range country and other elevated parts in the centre of the Northern Territory would be eminently suited for cereals, but to attempt to grow wheat near Darwini n a tropical climate would be ridiculous. member does not say that wheat will not grow in tropical countries. v grown in India. is only on the highlands. I have been in Ceylon and India, and I never saw a grain of wheat grown on the lowlands. I admit that there is a great deal of wheat grown on the highlands of India, but the climate there is similar to the climate of Bathurst and Orange, in New South Wales. According to Mr Knibbs, the net result of all the efforts of farmers in Five acres was heavily the Northern Territory, including those on the experimental farms, was the growth of 1,350 bushels of maize; oats, n i l ; rye, n i l ; wheat, n i l ; other cereals, n i l ; lucerne, 1 to n ; other hay crops, 80 tons; beans, 100 bushels; sweet potatoes, 20 tons; pumpkins and melons, 24 tons. I think that the possibilities of the Northern Territory are very great, but they should be developed in the right way. I have said that Canada and Russia The settled and developed their big empty spaces by first of all building railways through them.

467,Mr Pigott,"That may be so, but i tran through a vast empty country, which now, under the occupation of teeming millions, has become one of the granaries of the world. The same may be said of Siberia. The effect of the construction of the trans-Siberian railway has been really wonderful. Only the other day in SydneyI was informed by an agent of the Massey-Harris Company that tbey sell more agricultural implements in Siberia than in any other part of the world. This shows how fast that country has been developed, and it has been almost entirely owing to railway extension. Looking through Mr Knibbs' figures, I find that in the Northern Territory there were 22,792 horses, and 1,181 were exported in the year. There were 417,643 cattle, and 57,289 fat cattle were exported in the year. 67,109 sheep, and 11,296 were exported, and there were 1,018 pigs in the Territory. I think the Government made a big mistake in the selection they made of sheep for the Territory. They secured a big flock from Avon Downs, and took the sheep towards Port Darwin. I consider that the country there is quite unsuitable for merinos. The class of sheep for which that district is suited would be a cross between 'the Romney Marsh and the merino. Por quality of wool, length of staple, and robust constitution, the Avon Downs flock is not excelled for merino sheep, if it is equalled by any other this House. flock in Australia, but those sheep are quite unsuitable for the Darwin district. We must have there a cross with the Romney Marsh sheep that are immune from foot-rot and fluke. I venture to say that if you put-merino sheep on that country, and leave them there for any length of time, they will develop foot-rot and fluke, and none of them will be left in a few years. I cannot say how much wool was grown in the Northern Territory, as the records do not disclose the facts, but I was pleased to find that in 1913-14 the Territory exported minerals to the value of £44,626. That is a good nucleus to start with. If such results could be obtained for mineral development without the assistance of railway communication, how much better results might be obtained with an extensive railway system! The honourable member for Wakefield quoted Lord Kitchener as saying that for strategic purposes the railway should be extended from Oodnadatta to Port Darwin. [132]2 I said that the railways should be pushed on to connect with Brisbane and the other big cities on the eastern coast. correction, because that is what I was prepared to suggest myself. I advocated from the platform during the Federal elections that the railway should be extended to the Katherine River, and from there as close as possible to Cloncurry and Camooweal, and that there should be extensions towards the Territory from Longreach, Charleville, Bourke, and Broken Hill. That would link up the Territory with the whole of the railway systems of the eastern States. We should bring the railway system of the Northern Territory as near as possible to centres of the popuThere were lation and the seaboard. In travelling through Queensland a few years ago, I noticed that at Townsville, Rockhampton, and many of the eastern coast towns, extensive freezing works have been established, and it is above all things necessary that we should find a market for the produce of the settlers in the Northern Territory. If we do not, we cannot expect to have any settlement there^ member suggest that to the late Government? that on the platform and, I think, also in ment adopt the suggestion ? far adopted it . If the honourable member for Gwydir agrees with the suggestion, I hope that I shall have his support in recommending it to the present Government. member's influence worth when he could not get the late Government to move in the matter? the honourable member for Gwydir has. On the question of settling the interior of the Northern Territory, I may say that I was only last week reading an article on Siberia published in the Nineteenth Century. I find that the Russian Government, in settling people there, went so far as to give them a freehold title to a certain area of land for themselves, and for each of their children. In addition, they allowed them the timber necessary to build their houses with; they defrayed the",63,Fosteb Th E Present Place Of Our Great Continent As A Very

475,Mr Pigott,"I have a vote just asexpense of cultivating the land for one year, and further advanced the settlers sufficient money to equip them with a good agricultural plant. It is all very well for us to show people how to grow various produce, but the trouble in the Northern Territory is to find a market for the produce grown there. I gave a lecture some time ago in the ""Wingham district of New South Wales on the subject of bee-keeping. The editor of the local newspaper was good enough to publish my lecture in three different issues, and some few years later Mr Gale, the Government expert, visited ""Blayney, and lectured there. During the course of his remarks he stated that at Wingham some years previously a bank manager had shown the people how to grow honey. They had paid so much attention to his counsel that they produced tons of honey, but, unfortunately, he had not told them where they would find a market for it. pears to be our position in respect of the Northern Territory to-day. It is idle to grow cereals there unless there is a marNorthern Territory-wealt h which only ket for them. The honourable member for Maribyrnong has said that wheat and hay can be produced in the Territory. If the Government wish to stimulate the production of these commodities, let them say to the people, ""We will pay you 6s. per bushel for all the wheat you can produce in the Territory, and so much per ton for your lucerne and hay."" wishes to socialize all industry. socialize anything. To my mind, the Government might well take a leaf out of the book of the late Government of Queensland. That Administration has assisted settlers in the central western parts of Queensland-whic h comprise some of the best wool-growing country I have ever seen-to put down more than 2,000 artesian bores. Yet, in the southern part of the Northern Territory we have only one artesian bore. Certainly, we have subartesian bores, but not artesian bores which go down thousands of feet. The result is that in the portion of Queensland to which I have referred bores are now to be found running freshly like English brooks, and instead of the sheep having to travel to the water the water travels to the sheep. The honourable member for Wakefield spoke of portions of the Territory which have a rainfall of only about 10 or 11 inches. they get a rainfall of 70 inches. sea-board the rainfall runs up to 70 inches. But there are other portions of the country in which it varies from 4 to 10 inches. I consider that the Minister of External Affairs should place a sum upon the Estimates for the purpose of testing this country for artesian water. So far as the mining industry is concerned we have a big asset there. £35,000 in prospecting without securing a decent show. £35,000 in prospecting there, but in the year 1914 alone the returns from minerals aggregated a value of £44,626. This sum was made up as follows:-Diamonds, That ap£482; gold, £13,250; silver, £2,228; tin, £25,526; and wolfram, £3,140. I believe that there is untold wealth in the requires to be developed. When I was in the Kalgoorlie electorate some time ago I learned that millions of pounds' worth of gold had been taken out of a very limited area. That circumstance should encourage us to try and locate these rich mineral deposits. In the Northern Territory I find that there are engaged in the mining industry only 90 Europeans and 530 Chinese. If the Government will only endeavour to develop this country upon right lines, and by closing up the experimental farms, I venture to say that the taxpayers will be much better off. I wish to direct the attention of honourable members to a letter which has been sent to the London Times by a former Governor General of the Commonwealth, in the person of Lord Denman.

It is a subject of sufficient importance to be discussed in the House, and in a way which would cause the Government of the day to bring down a comprehensive policy for the development of the Territory, which is constantly costing the Commonwealth enormous sums, without any appreciable result. It is unfair that honourable members should be denied an opportunity of discussing a general policy, ancl should be constantly called upon to discuss the matter on the Estimates within a space of time which does not enable them to do justice to the subject, and which at the same time precludes us from coming to a definite conclusion or instructing the Minister what kind of a",65,Fosteb Th E Present Place Of Our Great Continent As A Very

500,Mr Sampson,"The honourable mempolicy he is to carry out. Several years ago the Commonwealth took over the Northern Territory, for the reason that the South Australian Government had failed to develop the country as rapidly as should have been done. It has been under our control for a number of years, but we have lamentably failed to do anything which is calculated to lay down even the foundations of a general policy of development. your own Government. the question from a party stand-point. It is a question which belongs to this Parliament, and, indeed, to Australia. As this Parliament undertook the great and serious responsibility of settling the country, it should take the problem in hand and deal with it in a way which would give some results, or would, at any rate, they cannot get stock to market. lay down the foundations of an effective scheme. is a good deal of misconception regardTerritory you will find out that the ing the Territory.

510,He Should Launch A General Mr Sampson,"If it is a wellproposal to take over the Northern Territorv was before Parliament, I contended that our hands should not be tied by the obligation to build that line; but I hold now that, having agreed to take over that Territory, honourable members did so with all its responsibilities, and it is a solemn obligation upon us to construct the line from north to south. There is only one method by which we can have anything like dense population in the Northern Territory, and that is by the establishment of agriculture, and agricultural settlements can only be established in the most tropical parts where there is a good rainfall, and where there are rivers enabling water to be conserved, thus facilitating intense cultivation. No one has attempted to show that my contention in that regard is wrong. The honourable member for Grey has spoken of 80,000,000 acres of land on the Barclay Tablelands suitable for raising cattle, and no one disputes his statement. He also said, _on the authority of the honourable member for Kennedy, that the area would probably need to be cut up into stations of about 20,000 acresI believe that the limited rainfall there would necessitate its being held in very large areas-whic h means that it will only carry a population of 4,000 or 5,000 people, the population of a good-sized village. A t Darwin the rainfall is 62 inches, and 200 miles south, at Katherine River, it is 40 inches. There are 70,000 square miles between Darwin and Katherine River. falls in the hot weather. be conserved, so that an agricultural population may use it all the year round. There is sufficient rainfall, with an extensive river system between Darwin and the Katherine River, to carry an agricultural population, and probably the greatest proportion of the mineral deposits situated within that tropical portion of the Northern Territory. There is a further area of 50,000 square miles from the Katherine River to Newcastle Waters, 150 miles further south, where the rainfall is 20 inches. tween Newcastle Waters and the southern boundary of the Northern Territory is about 550 miles, and the rainfall drops from 20 inches at Newcastle Waters to 5$ inches at the southern boundary. I think every one will agree that this lower portion of the Northern Territory, with so light a rainfall, can only support a population on very large holdings, on which the number of sheep or cattle must be relatively small. It is doubtful whether it will pay to run a railway through that country except as a great national artery connecting the northern with the southern part of the continent. The future hone of the Northern Territory lies in agricultural settlement. There is no reason why we should not have some dairying under a system of irrigation along the rivers. spear grass. honourable member apparently does nol know that there are irrigation settlements in Australia equal to anything in the world. There are, in South Australia and in Victoria, several irrigation areas. The only way to have the Territory developed will be by close settlement on irrigation areas devoted to the growth of fodder, mixed farming, and a system of dairying. There is plenty of markets available for dairy products. Great Britain at present imports milk products to the value of about £33,000,000 per annum. deal of that land is often 6 feet or 7 feet under water. and on those flats there is no reason why we should not grow all the rice we require in Australia. I am not speaking of this matter from a theoretical point-of view. I have been in the Northern Territory, and have seen the country about which I am talking. I believe that there are flats along the Adelaide River that could be put under rice in the course of time. There are flats which could be inundated by the fresh water of the river which receives its supply from the higher lands of the Northern Territory. economic position? system of the wooden plough and the reaping-hook in the Mallee we could not The distance becompete in the world markets with India or any other low-wage country, but we do so by the use of the latest agricultural implements and labour-saving machinery.

We can only achieve a satisfactory result by every honourable suggest some constructive policy applicable to country of this kind.

The plantation is situated on the delta of the Burdekin River. conditions in the Northern Territory? Territory water can be conserved on the surface. Messrs. Drysdale Bros, are cutting up their land, and selling the freehold in conveniently-sized blocks to cultivators whom they supply with water, and probably not even in Utah is there a better system of water control. The settlers are sure of a permanent supply of water, and the plantations are among the most successful in Queensland. Something of that kind can be done in the Northern Territory. Knowing, as I do, what is done in the Murray Valley, I can testify to the value of the application of water to the land. I should like to touch on a number of other points, but time does not permit now. I ask the Minister if I may continue my remarks. has made two speeches. particulars regarding rainfall that I wish to bring out. member has said about irrigation is largely a repetition of his previous speech. size my views. The Minister told me on to look into the possibilities of irrigation in the Northern Territory, and to obtain from India, or some other place where large experience of irrigation has been gained under tropical conditions, an expert engineer to report on the subject. We could afford to pay £4,000 or £5,000 to an expert for a report on the possibilities of the Northern Territory. Such a member attempting to man would show us how we could best establish agriculture by means of irrigation. The utilization of the whole of the grazing area within the Territory can afford a means of livelihood to only a few thousand persons at best. If the dense population, agriculture must be fostered there, and for that irrigation is necessary. The bulk of the mineral deposits of the Territory, excepting those on the Macdonnell Ranges, lie on each They have put down side of the line from Darwin to Pine Creek, which runs through about 140 miles of country.

How does the right honourable member account for the fact that in ordinary times the dairying districts on the north and south coasts of New South Wales have produced largely in excess of local requirements, and that, although they have just enjoyed one of the best seasons ever experienced by them, it is not possible now to obtain butter in that State? they are supplying the rest of Australia. Mr J. H . CATTS -The answer to that interjection is that since A p r i l last the Government of New South Wales have prevented the export of butter to any other State. MrJ . H . CATTS -No butter has been exported from New South Wales for two or three months: that is so. Mr J. H . CATTS -The Minister of Trade and Customs knows that the State Government have done something in the matter. a proclamation to the effect stated by the honourable member, but I do not think it had the force of law. MrJ . H . CATTS -It may not have had the force of law. That is not the point. It had the effect pf stopping the export of butter to other States. Something like 83,000 of our men enlisted to go to the war, and are receiving, as privates, 6s. a day. When the majority of. them enlisted, foodstuffs were available at normal rates; but the cost of supplying a household has since almost doubled. What is to become of the families of these men, who were prepared to go on comparatively short rations, whilst their breadwinners went to the fron t to fight the battles of the Empire? and largely because of the greed of some people, who think they can make a few extra pounds out of war conditions, the cost of maintaining the households of these men has practically doubled. And yet the families of these men are expected to live on 6s. a day. The situation demands some special action on the part of the Government. They ought not to wait t ill they are pushed a little here, and a little there, before they do something. These unrelated, spasmodic, and uncoordinated efforts accomplish little.

In ingenuity in endeavouring to devise means quiries that have been made, however, show that there is plenty of fodder stored away in country districts. But every one is waiting for a rise. Holders of these supplies think that because of the war prices will go up, and they are holding on a little longer in the hope of securing a little more for their produce. The machinery is not in existence to meet the situation. This is a defect which should be at once remedied. The Government should act even on the information at hand. I believe that they have ample power under the export laws, the War Precautions Act, and our statistical powers to deal with this matter. The country is in a state of war, and surely if the Government find that those who have control of food supplies are manipulating the markets, that they are making money out of the war conditions tliat prevail-that they are. prepared to starve people and to starve the families of men who are fighting at the frontthey should take action.

The Labour party is fairly entitled to the credit of it. In my opinion, it is due chiefly to the efforts of Mr Fisher, Senator Pearce, and Mr Hughes. The honourable member for Ballarat has just handed to me a copy of the Herald of this evening, in which the following cable message appears:Following upon his first letter to the Times on the subject of the adoption by Australia of universal military service, Lord Denman, formerly Governor General of the Commonwealth, now writes to that journal to point out that it was at the invitation of a Liberal Ministry that Lord Kitchener went to Australia. Inasmuch as it was on his report that universal training was based, and as the Labour Government administered the scheme during the early years of its operation, the responsibility of its inception was shared by both political parties. I am glad to read that modification of Lord although deny read. a former Governor General, in advocating national .service in Great Britain, should have imported any names into the discussion; but as names have been so i m ported, it is only just to those to whom I think I would not the real credit is due that their names also should be mentioned.

If the names of three men who are most entitled to credit for having given concrete and statutory effect to the policy of national service are to be mentioned, those names should be the Honourable A l f r e d Deakin, Sir Thomas Ewing, and the Eight Honourable Joseph Cook.

Indeed, I am glad that the policy of defence, which has been such a success, has generally been regarded as of a non-party matter, and I am willing to extend credit to the Labour party, together w i th the Liberal party, for having given loyal support to the Liberal policy. I am glad that we have liad partial, if not complete, unanimity on the question of universal training. The former Governor General showed questionable taste in introducing any political names into his advocacy of national service in England, but as that has been done, it is necessary that the credit should be placed where it is due, and I say again that the credit for giving concrete and statutory effect for the formulation of a policy of national serDenman's original statement, vice, the introduction of the policy into his Lordship does not this House, and the placing of it on the the statement.

578,Mr Sampson,"I do not wish to beMrM c GRATH (Ballarat) [11.12] Th© hour is late, and I would prefer that the honourable member for Cook had brought the matter of foodstuffs before the House by moving the adjournment tomorrow. The Leader of the Opposition in an interjection made a remark which I think is worthy of note, and for once I am in agreement with him. The right lionorable member said that in time of war the Pederal Government have f u l l power to do practically anything in regard to ithe control of foodstuffs. I believe that to be the case. In time of war the Federal Government are in the same position as they would have been in had the referenda proposals been carried. tion with the State Governments. t h a t the Federal Government have f u l l power to do anything and everything that is necessary in the interests of the community. Some honourable members interjected, when the honourable member for Cook was speaking, that it would be necessary to proclaim martial law in order to take over supplies of butter, meat, and other commodities. The Government did not proclaim martial law when they seized the woollen goods throughout the Commonwealth at the commencement of the war, and appointed an officer to fix prices for the goods. They simply took that action in the interests of the defence of the Empire. What the Government were able to do in regard to woollen goods they can do with regard to wheat, sugar, butter, and other commodities. I charge Ministers with being negligent of, and unfaithful to, their duty, We are fighting an enemy outside Australia, but there is an enemy inside the Commonwealth that ought to be fought. I am sorry that the Acting Prime Minister is the only member of the Government present to hear what honourable members have to say on this question. say it when Ministers are present? MrM c GRATH think to-morrow. There is hardly one necessary of life that has not been in creased enormously in price during the last few months. In Great Britain the -purchasing power of a sovereign has dwindled to 15s., and I suppose it will decrease to the same extent in Australia. Fodder has risen in price, not because there is not sufficient obtainable in the Commonwealth, but because supplies have been cornered by a few people. The Victorian Liberal Government have taken a whole month to make inquiries as to where commodities are being stored, and have not yet given an answer to questions on the subject. In the Federal arena there is a Labour Government in office, with f u l l and unlimited power to deal with these matters at once, but they have not yet taken advantage of the opportunity to make the necessary inquiries. I hope to say more on this subject to-morrow. honourable member for Wimmera has done Lord Denman an injustice. Lord DenI said in associaman, referring to compulsory military training, saidIn Australia its success is generally acknowledged. The Labour party is fairly-entitled to the credit of it. In my opinion, it is due chiefly to the efforts of Mr Fisher, Senator Pearce, and Mr Hughes. Ther© is nothing there about who advocated or introduced it . He simply says it was a success, and mentions the persons to whom the credit for the success is due. statement, whichever way you look at it . able member for Wimmera was speaking, that the honourable member for Balaclava had said the same thing. In 1912, or before A p r i l , 1913, at the opening of the cement works at Geelong, the honourable member for Balaclava, who was then Premier of Victoria, saidAt different times he ( Mr Watt) had criticised the doings of the Federal Ministry, but whether it had done well or ill with regard to industrial or financial matters, there stood to its everlasting credit that the defence problem had been faced and met. quoting from? Watt's speechAs a Liberal, he did not take any notice of I w ill say what I those who claimed that the defence' scheme was the product of Liberal thought.

The success could only have come from putting it into practice. No other Government could get a chance of the credit for its success, because shortly after the Bill was passed the Deakin-Cook Government went out of office;.

Then, when the Bill was in Committee, an amendment was moved from the then Opposition that the training should go up to twenty-five years of age, and one of the most pitiable sights I ever witnessed as the result of party government was to see Sir Thomas Ewing, who was understood to have got his knighthood for being the first Minister to propose compulsory training, voting against the twenty-five years' limit, which was his original proposal, and for the twenty years. Then Lord Kitchener was brought out, and one of the things that gratified us who had stood up for the twenty-five years all through was to find Lord Kitchener backing up the twenty-five years.

Consequently they are entitled, as Lord Denman said, to the credit of making it a success. credit. making compulsory training a success, because nobody else had a chance to share in that credit. The three men on whom the task really fell were the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, and, above all, the present Minister of Defence. I mention that simply because the honourable member for Wimmera did not get a proper impression of the meaning of Lord Denman's words, but did him an injustice by making it appear that his statement was wrong, whereas, as a matter of fact, the same credit was given to the Labour party by the honourable member for Balaclava, when speaking at Geelong.
