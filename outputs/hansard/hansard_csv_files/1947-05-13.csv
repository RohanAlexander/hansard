I consider that graziers and farmers who, of their own volition, desire to earmark their -stock specifically for export to Great Britain should not he frustrated in their good intentions 'by the Commonwealth Government, any more than should other charitably disposed people who voluntarily send food parcels to Britain and contribute to Lord Mayors funds, appeals by the Australian Rod Cross Society and so forth.

Was this action taken without consulting the Chicory Board? Is it the practice of the Government to ignore completely those elected by the growers to negotiate on their behalf, when making such important decisions affecting primary industries? Was the Chicory Board given notice of this decision or did it receive its first notification from the Gazetted number of letters, from constituents who assert that artificial foods for infants are virtually unprocurable in the metropolitan area of Western Australia. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Health whether he will consult with his colleague to ascertain whether it be possible for a reasonable allocation of shipping space to be made for the transport of these foods to Western Australia, and whether some space can be allocated on Trans-Australia Airlines airliners for this purpose, the extra cost for air transport being met by tlie Department of Health? with the Minister for Health to see whether additional quantities of these foods can be made available in Western Australia.

In spite of the fact nf substituting a straight deduction system in lien of the present cumbersome and unfair rebate system. I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) in a. well-reasoned speech in which he analysed Australia's financial position, and clearly demonstrated that taxes could be reduced. When suggestions made by the Opposition are ignored, as is often the case, honourable members experience a. sense of frustration and are tempted to wonder whether their efforts to improve legislation are worthwhile, but when we reflect that the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) has so far changed his attitude as to present to the Parliament a measure designed to give effect to practically the same reductions of taxes as the Leader of the Australian Country party said during the election campaign were possible, we ai'e led to believe, that, after all, the Opposition has its value, and does, in fact, influence legislation. It is evident that the Government has yielded to pressure, even if only to the degree of granting a small measure of relief to taxpayers. The doleful statement of the Treasurer in his budget speech justified the comment that he and his advisers were indeed "" dismal Jimmys "". At that time, they gave no hope of relief, but the latest figures supplied by the right honourable gentleman show that he greatly underestimated the revenue of the Government and also grossly exaggerated its estimated expenditure. Proper budgeting would have reduced the gap between the estimated revenue and expenditure, and would have shown that a substantial measure of relief from heavy taxes was possible. Let us examine some of the statements of the Treasurer and his advisers made fen months ago when he submitted his budget, and compare them with, what has actually happened up to the end of April. There are now only two months of the financial year to go. The returns from customs and excise duties are now only £5,000,000 short of the estimated return for the whole year. As the average return for each month is about £9,000,000, turn from this source is likclv to be over £3.00,000.000, instead of £89,000,000 as estimated.

86,Mr Anthony (Richmond) [4.7],"fir«t ten months of the year will be £31,239,000, as a.gainst an .estimated return of £31,000,000 for the whole year. In the light of those figures, how can the Government justify the retention of many of the irritating impositions which now apply? It is not possible to reduce taxes to any great extent unless there is a willingquarterly summary of Australian Statness on the part of the Government to effect economies where possible. When tlie last budget was introduced, it was expected that there would be a gap of £59,000,000 between revenue and expenditure, and that this gap would have to be bridged by borrowing. We find, however, that for the first, ten months of the those industries which are unable to pass financial year only £9,000,000 has been expended from loans and, according to the expectations of the Acting Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Watt, loan expenditure for the full twelve months will not be much more. This leaves an amount of £50,000,000 to be accounted for in some way. down by this amount, or it has not been necessary to raise so much by way of loan as was expected because of the buoyancy of the revenue. That, of course, is the true explanation. Revenue has been so buoyant that it was not necessary for the Treasurer to go on the market to borrow money to anything like the extent that he expected would be necessary when he framed his budget. benefit of this situation has not been passed on to the taxpayers. It is true that this bill provides for the granting of certain concessions, but I maintain that the taxpayers are entitled to all the relief that the financial position of the country renders possible. whenever there appears to be a prospect of lightening the load of taxes this Government immediately embarks upon some new form of expenditure which puts adequate relief out of the question. Taxation per head, State and Commonwealth, has been as follows during recent years:Year1939 .1942 1943 .. 39 0 0 1944 :1045 1946 Mr Anthony. It might be claimed by these who believe in heavy taxes that there has been an increase of national production during the period under review, and that heavier taxes can, therefore, be borme by tbe community. That is partly true, but production has not increased in the samiratio as have taxes. According to the istics issued by the Commonwealth Statistician, net production per head for all industries in 1939 was £56, while in 1945 it had increased to £S7, an increase of £31 per head. As against this, taxation has increased over all industries by £33 per head. I emphasize, however, that on taxes have not increased their production in anything like the same proportion. For instance, in the pastoral industry production amounted to £9 per head in 1939, and to only £13 per head in 1945. In the dairying industry production per head was £5 in 1939, and £6 in Obviously, expenditure must be 1946. Those figures emphasize the bad state of the dairying industry in particular, and point to the need for taxation relief. However, I am not .making a special claim for any particular industry. All industries of the Commonwealth, and all the people of the Commonwealth; should be given relief from the present load of taxes, if 'it is possible to do so. It is on that point that the Opposition and However, the the Government differ. The 'Treasurer says, the financial position of the country being what it is, and our requirements for social services being what they ar,e. taxes cannot be further reduced. But I shall show, first, that, in spite of a However, very substantial reduction of w-ar expenditure from £548,000,000 in 1944 to £110,000,000 in 1,947, a reduction of £438,000,000, which would naturally give rise to the expectation that there could be a reduction of taxes, the 'Government has seized the opportunity presented by this decrease of war expenditure to increase non-war expenditure. Nonwar expenditure, which amounted to £164,00.0,000 in 1945-46 was estimated at f ,s. d. £221,000,00.0 far 1946-47, an increase ,of 18 0 fl approximately £57,000,000-, but .even that .. .33 0 .0 estimate did.not materialize.

Consequently, as the proportion of the income of the people taken by Government there greater need to grant concessional deductions for expenditure on items which cannot be regarded as luxuries. When this bill reaches the' committee stage I trust that the Government will show a disposition to accept any reasonable medical expenses incurred by a taxpayer as a concessional deduction. While such relief as this bill affords is welcomed by us all, I trust that the Treasurer will re-examine the rates of income tax because it has been made abundantly dear that, in spite of tax remissions already granted, Commonwealth revenues continue to remain buoyant. It has also been made clear that expenditure on certain items has been very much less than was anticipated. The Government might go .further in making tax concessions which will help to stimulate the proworthy performance by this Government, duction of commodities which we require so badly. speech of the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) was couched, in very reasonable terms. The general reactions to this latest piece of income tax legislation are very good. During the recent election campaigns in New South Wales and Queensland not one question was asked regarding taxation. I believe that absence of criticism of the (iovfrninent's taxation policy is general throughout the Commonwealth. The reductions of taxes amounting to more than £30,000,000 which are ro become operative as from the .1st July constitute the fulfilment of the promise made by the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) during the Commonwealth election campaign last year. In general rliobjectio n to the bill on the part of honourable members opposite is purely bitterly disappointed that they themselves had not formed the Government which was able to bring down a measure such as this. Honourable members opposite tried to win the last elections by making, specific tax reduction promises. The Labour party gave electors no promise of specific tax reductions, the Prime Minister saying that, taxes would be reviewed from time to time in the light of existing circumstances. The right honourable becomes greater so is gentleman has fulfilled his promise. There are five principal methods of raising revenue open to the Government to carry out its programme. First, there is income tax. For the year 1945-46 income tax yielded 56.94 per cent, of our revenue. The second method of raising revenue is by means of customs and excise duties. For the same year 20.61 per cent, of our' total revenue was obtained from that source. The third method is by means of sales tax. From that source in the same year S.SS per cent, of our total revenue was derived. The fourth method of raising money is by. internal and external borrowing. It is true that extensive internal borrowing was resorted to during the war, but, no external loans were floated. The fact that not one penny was borrowed outside the Commonwealth during the war represents a very praiseespecially when we consider the great .interest debt piled up as the result of overseas borrowing during World WarI . Finally, money may be raised to meet, the commitments of the Government by the creation of credit-no t a very popular method. During the war this method was resorted to by the Commonwealth to an -amount of aprox-iniately £240,000,000. I realize that we cannot continue creating credit indiscri-. minutely, but it is a worth-while method for any government to adopt, in times of great difficulty. The real wealth of a country is represented by its production and the money we raise should be equated to our productive output. The total moneys raised by the first of these three methods, namely, income tax, customs and excise duties and sales tax, represented S6.43 per cent, of all revenue raised during 1945-46. The remaining 13.p7 per cent, was raised by 'other methods, including probate duties. Income tax psychological. They are covers by far the largest field.

Those are the avenues through which our revenues are re-distributed to the people. the Government's purchasing power, the physical life blood of the nation. guaranteed prices for products constitute the people's life blood. Money is a commodity which enables the transfer of goodsand services from one to the other. With sufficient purchasing power in the hands of ..the people we have what I regard as financial health in the community; without it we have what I might describe as financial death in the nation. An uneven distribution of incomes, wages, salaries and revenue is almost as disastrous to the nation as allfeature of finance in those days of eight round scarcity. We have only to go back eight years to recall the story of ruin and despair brought about by the restriction of purchasing power and low taxes on high incomes. Then we had the spectacle of abject poverty in the midst of abundance. Those were not depression days, but the days which immediately preceded War II . Anti-Labour governments then failed to set finance circulatingthrough the nation's economic arteries, so that our producers could get payable returns for their production, workers could get employment, and our people could buy the goods that were piling up in the warehouses, factories, silos and shops. Abject failure to get this life blood circulating was one of the main criticisms of anti-Labour governments prior to the war. As an illustration of the financial death of Australia when World War II . broke out, let me give one or two instances: In 1940, there were 2,000 deserted wheat farms in Victoria, with 80 per cent, of all farmers virtually bankrupt. There were more than 1,500 deserted farms in Western Australia. In South Australia, 1,700 farmers went through the bankruptcy courts a few years before the war; and 200,000 of our working population were out .of employment in 1940-afte r the war had already begun. £187 a year, or £3 10s. a week. The remaining 15 per cent, were averaging tion of credit was on a world-wide basis prior to the war, but anti-Labour governments in this country seemed' incapable Taxation represents of setting finance or purchasing power flowing within this country by any means. In other words, just prior to the war, Wages and salaries and production had outstripped purchasing power. There were more producers than there were people who could buy the goods they produced. No wonder we had slums -when there was no money to build houses. That is one of the reasons for the grave shortage of homes to-day. There was a shortage of 240,000 as far back as 1940 clue principally to lack of purchasing power in the hands of our people. Ample supplies of building materials were available. Another years ago, was high interest rates. Interest charges strangle production, both secondary and primary, and we ai'e still paying off debts incurred at that time through interest rates of 6 per cent., 8 per cent., and even 10 per cent. For instance, in 1936, wool-growers and wheat-farmers in this country totalling 170,000 had a comthe outbreak of World bined indebtedness to banks and other lending institutions of £2S8,000,000, with the interest bill of wheat-farmers alone amounting to £14,000,000 a year. That was only a little more than eight years ago. Over-production was the cry heard everywhere. We were told that we had over-produced, but that was a lie. We could have consumed or exported every bushel of wheat that we grew, and we could have used all the products of our factories had there been sufficient purchasing power in the community to buy them. The real trouble was under-consumption. We read of the scandal of wheat, coffee, oranges, and potatoes being dumped into the rivers and seas of the world. In The Grapes of Wrath, by John Steinbeck, the bitter conditions existing in the United States of America between 193437 are revealed. The author describes how armed guards lined the banks of rivers in California, while potatoes, were dumped into them. Huge dumps of granges jyfijje also guarded so that people .could net take them away. The frui.t was allowed ,tp ,i;ot, and the jujee ,tp soak into the ground. Yet the people were starring!

This Government has relieved people in lower-income groups of income tax. No better investment could he made than that. People in those groups receive social security. Contentions that high taxation destroy the incentive to produce are grossly exaggerated.

It has been stated that Australia is the highest taxed nation in the world, but the Prime Minister has effectively scotched that charge, which had currency during the election campaign last year. In order to emphasize how incorrect that statement is, I cite the following comparison of taxes levied in Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand on poisons earning £350 a year. A. person without dependants pays £3S in Australia, £68 10s. in the United Kingdom and £57 5s. 7d. in New Zealand.

97,Mr Duthie,"Not every group,many of the anomalies that may he discovered will be ironed out and further concessions granted. I commend the Government for having exempted from income tax all money expended by farmers on combating soil erosion. That is a new departure. It is the first time, that a Commonwealth Government has even considered that concession. We all realize the menace of soil erosion Every year, at the present rate, about 2,000,000 acres of Australian land becomes desert. Ion Idriess has said that he has seen sand' hills in western Queensland 200 miles farther east than when he first saw v them some years ago. Soil erosion is an increasing menace, and within a few years a national plan may be required to combat it. I congratulate the Government of New South Wales upon the, creation of a Conservation Board; it is the only State government in Australia that has a Minister for Conservation. The Commonwealth Government is encouraging that board and the Departments of Agriculture in other States by allowing to farmers exemptions from income tax in respect of' all amounts expended in combating soil erosion on their farms, whether by terracing, draining, strip-cropping, strip-clearing on new land, or by other means. That is one of the most practical methods over introduced to encourage farmers individually to check soil erosion. We shall never be able to defeat this menace without farmers, and anything done hy the Government to encourage soil conservation is a national service. Erosion is very severe on many farms, and, in some instances, the cost of eliminating it would amount to many hundreds of pounds. Many farmers consider that the expenditure of such sums would only amount .to "" pouring money down the drain"". However, the Government is doing much to overcome that attitude by making income tax concessions for all such expenditure. That is very commendable. The Government's overall proposals ' show that it is encouraging a Christian principle in the application of taxes. The rich will help the poor, those who are healthy will help the sick, the strong will which developed outside Australia. Howhelp the weak, and those who are secure will help those who are insecure. I have Mr Duthie. yet to. learn of any higher principle of government policy. The speech made by the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) was divided into three parts. The first part was a narrative of a kind which I have rarely heard in this House. In fact, I believe that a more biased narrative has never been delivered in this chamber. It was composed mainly of truths and halftruths relating to a certain period of our history prior to the outbreak of 'war. The honourable gentleman's speech reminded me of an old adage which is current in country districts: "" When a man is religious, put an extra brand on your calves "". As the honourable gentleman referred in detail to the economic depression, I shall do likewise in order to rectify some of his omissions. He did not mention the period of 1930-31, when the Labour party was in power all over Australia. as that. member very conveniently left that period out. It ill becomes an honourable gentleman of his description when he starts to' make a case the co-operation of individual calm. However, I point out that the honourable member made no reference to the period which I have mentioned. The depression that occurred during those years was world-wide, although I agree that there was a secondary depression in this country. The main depression arose from certain circumstances which originated outside, of Australia, namely, a calamitous fall of . the prices of all primary products. There will be another such debacle unless this Government alters its financial policy. If the prices of primary products ever fall to low levels again, there will have to be a very quick reconstruction in Australia if thousands of men are not to be thrown on the streets out of work. As I have said, the main depression arose from events ever, the secondary depression which followed took place because the Labour",28,Second Beading

On the contrary, the fact denotes that he is a progressive man, who, by using borrowed money and developing his farm or business, increases its productivity.

The farmers have-, much more wisdom than to. believe such a statement. They know that these increases have occurred as the result of war needs and post-war scarcities. They are not so foolish as to believe, that the present. Government has secured such good results for them. Here, I sound a note of' warning. If the Government is basing its commitments on the extremely high prices of those commodities, the day of reckoning will overtake it. Thesooner Australians realize, that truth, the better it will be-. This continual building up of expenditure, based, upon the existing high prices of our exports, must, if continued lead us to disaster An honourable member would befoolish wio> contended that these priceswill remain indefinitely. those who do not desire to work, to escape They may continue for another few years, again as tbe resultof the needs of the world for food,' but they are not stable a prize to, those who dp not desire to work. prices, and if the Government bases its. : estimates on the assumption that these values will be permanent, a day of reckoning will come to those who pursue that policy, and the Australian people generally. The Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) indicated in his finanical statement a. few weeks ago that many people in the lower income groups would be relieved of the obligation to pay income tax and social services contributions. I wonder whether honourable members realize what is happening to-day. numbers of persons in receipt of high incomes is not sufficiehtly large to bear the major part of the cost of administration. The result is that the people in the middle ranges of income, are bearing almost the entire burden of financing the Government of this country. When a government imposes an excessive burden on these progressive classes, I doubt whether it is laying a sound and stable foundation for its social services. This bill will allow as a deduction money which primary producers expend on measures to combat or prevent soil erosion. I propose to let honourable memdescribed as "" hardship cases"".

I do. not believe that the primary producers wi-M benefit substantially from the proposed concession. My principal purpose in participating in this debate was to refer briefly to three matters. The. first -relates to the failure of the Government to relieve former civil servants and others of tlie obligation to pay income tax on money that they derive from a superannuation or similar fund. Australia is a most extraordinary country.. The Government places a penalty on those who desire 'to work, and allows any penalty. Government grants tax concessions to those who accept its charity, but hits with a. heavy hand the person who, through his own providence duringhis working life, draws money from a superannuation fund. The exemption of these payments from income tax will, not mean the loss to Consolidated Revenue of many thousands of pounds, because the number of persons in this, class is relatively small. I haye a considerable regard for the person who contributes to a superannuation scheme, Itn Australia, the or for a firm 'which, begins such a scheme in. the interests of its employees. Tho contributor then receives a. pension as a right which. he has earned. In that instance, there is no hint of charity. The least that the Government can do is. to exempt from tax the. amount of tlie superannuation payment equivalent to the old age pension. The pension is not subject to tax, and I do not contend that thai is wrong. AH I am saying is that similar consideration should be given to theperson who receives a pension from a superannuation fund. I now propose to refer to what '",29,Second Beading

These cases are not numerous, and I contend that the contributions which other members of the family make in these circumstances towards the maintenance of their relative should be allowable as a deduction for taxation purposes. The abolition of the deduction system and the introduction of the rebate system was a shrewdI nearly said snide-wa y of extracting more money from the married taxpayer. The figures which the Treasurer supplied to the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) last year showed that the rebate system was responsible for yielding an additional £29,000,000. figures. I well recall the introduction in 1942 of several bills which provided for the adoption of a uniform income tax. frankly that the system was recommended by a parliamentary committee representing all parties in this House. of that committee were not selected by the respective political parties. The remarks which I shall make are applicable not only to the government of the day, but also to those members of the Australian Country party and the United Australia party who served on bills were ' introduced, the Treasurer informed the adoption of uniform income tax might mean a slightly higher yield to the Taxation Department. Now, the stage has heen reached when the married taxpayer is bearing a heavy impost. .When the Treasurer replies to this debate, I should like him to supply figures showing exactly how much additional revenue the Taxation Department will receive, in the next financial year, through the retention of the rebate system. The adoption of uniform income tax, honourable members were assured, would mean a simplification of the tax system. Personally, 1 never experienced any great difficulty with he considers that taxes should commence the returns when we paid Commonwealth and State tax. The taxpayer was required to fill in figures in two columns, but that was relatively easy. To-day, he fills in figures in only one column. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) and other honourable members have complained that at present, the average citizen is not able to understand how the Taxation Department compiled his assessment. Many leading accountants have had the greatest difficulty in working out assessments. The honourable member for Wentworth cited specific cases.where people complained to lie department that their assessments were incorrect. The department agreed with their submissions, and, subsequently, despatched a revised assessment, which also proved to be wrong. Once a system becomes too complex for the average These were Treasury person to understand, the way is open for inefficiency and abuse of. power. The position becomes most difficult when a taxpayer is obliged to approach a high At the outset, I admit priest in the department in order to obtain a decision on a particular point of procedure. We have reached that stage to-day. Many people have not the faintest idea of how their assessments have beenmade. That is wrong. The solution, possibly, could be the. reconstitution of the Public Accounts Committee. The Commonwealth is now expending hundreds of millions of pounds a year, and this vast expenditure is not examined by any parliamentary committee. As the honourable member for Fawkner suggested, a special Parliamentary Committee, or that committee. When the the Public Accounts Committee could examine these matters, and ensure that honourable members that ordinary taxpayers shall have an opportunity to understand the details of their assessments, and know whether they have been correctly assessed. Any further remarks that I desire to make upon income tax, I shall reserve until the Income Tax Bill is before the House. listened with great interest to the remarks of members of the Opposition and I have noted that they echo the catch cry that our troubles to-day are all due to extremely heavy taxes.

To expose the falsehood of the contention of the critics of the Government, I propose to examine the actual incidence of taxation on a taxpayer with a wife and two children. That unit is typical of the people, and embraces those who accept some responsibility in the community. people to whom we must direct our attention. At the height of war-time taxation, when the country was in grave danger and money was„most needed, a. man with a wife and two children to maintain who earned £300 had to pay £17 Ss. in income tax; to-day he pays £11 3 7s., and after the 30th June next he will not pay any income tax. If he earns another £300 by way of overtime, which results in a considerable income, his tax rises now from £11 17s. to about £S5, In other words, the Taxation Department collects £74 from his extra £300. And the Australian liar argues that if he earns £300 in overtime the Government "" takes the lot "" because it takes £74! I hope that any one who threatens to "" take the lot "" from me takes only £74 out of every £300. And that is the answer to the falsehood so widely circulated. Now, although the Commonwealth Government does take £S5 from his present earnings, it refunds him ""nearly £20 for his second child. In the result, all the Commonwealth takes in taxation is £65; in other words, he is left, with £535 out of the £600 he has earned. ' That, I emDr. Gaha. phasize, is the tax levied on him to-day. not the tax to be levied after the 30th June next. The argument that high taxation destroys the incentive to work and to produce is obviously false. The real reason for any lethargy in the community-and I do not a.dmit that there is any lethargy-is that the community has . never had so much money before. Every one is so solvent to-day that he does not need to work hard. As I said on a previous occasion, Australian morality is in a parlous condition, and that fact has been the subject of general comment. Looking at the position that will obtain after the 30th June next, a taxpayer with a wife and two children will not pay any tax on an income of £300; he will not be called upon to pay tax until his income aggregates £4.00. Then he will pay £12, and he will receive a rebate of £1.9 10s. for his second, child; in other words he will be £7 10s. to the good. I think that that disposes of the argument that heavy taxes destroy the incentive to work. Even under present taxation rates, if a man earning £300 a year wants to earn They are the an additional £300, making £600-whic h is a large income and far beyond that received by any working man to-day-al l that he has to pay in tax is £85. And he receives a. rebate of £20. In other words, only £65 is taken out of the £600, so that he has £535 clear. Notwithstanding the fairness of the present taxation scale, it, is still contended that substantial taxation is the reason why men will not work, but, of course, that contention is a lying one. Unfortunately, the assertion is not only mendacious, but because of it working men have been induced to support the Liberal party's cry that taxes are too high. This is a. time when goods and services are in very short supply. What would happen to the community if , by some miraculous means, taxes were dispensed with altogether? Supposing, to please the capitalists of this country, another £1,00,000,000 were put into circulation by means of tax reduction? Does any one think that any method of price control would succeed in keeping down prices? Does any one fool himself that in spite of the price-fixing machinery which operates to-day the cost of living has not increased? What would happen then if a huge .sum of money .were suddenly released into circulation? In tbe interest of tbe "" big man "" it is all very well to say, "" G i v e it back""; but you cannot give it back unless you give tbe lot back. It is illogical to argue that some should be returned, but not all. ""We must take a sane view on this subject. I a.m not, an advocate of unnecessarily high taxes, but T. do advocate high taxes at a time when goods and services are ' in short, supply. The inevitable result of releasing money at such a time would be to force up the already high cost of living. [ believe that the economic lifeof the man with a family who earns £300, £400, or £500 a. year has not been improved, even though tax reductions have considerably lightened his burden in that respect. Theoretically, the principle of tax reductions is sound, but in practice I do not believe that it is. The Governinent, for what reason I do not know, "" f e l l for "" the argument that the reduction of taxes would provide an incentive for the working man to increase his output, unci to the business man to expand his operations. The business man could not, expand if he were given £10,000,000, because of the unavailability of the necessary commodities. The working man has had all the incentive which a government could reasonably give to him to produce, yet to-day commodities are in very short supply. and the press of this country, would not have been pleased had the Government, continued to impose high taxes and to -control our economy as rigidly as possible, using the proceeds for the discharge of some of our debts and thus reducing the interest bill that will have to be borne by posterity. They convinced the working class that, all their troubles were caused by high taxes. yielded to the pressure and the advice of those would be economists, and by the time the next tax reduction comes into effect the total amount of revenue forgone will be approximately £90,000,000. [ believe that the people will not receive the benefit which they expect from these enormous reductions. For that reason, the Government might have held down our economy for a much longer period, paid off a lot of our national debt, and thus reduced our interest bill, deferring the removal of restrictions to the time when the supply of goods and services had vastly improved. I am very interested in the position in relation to taxation, because there are features of it. that are very conveniently overlooked by those who wish to criticize governments. At the present time, the Commonwealth has to return to the States £42,000,000 a year whicli it has collected on their behalf, out, of the total revenue that it receives from direct taxes. It also has to make interest payments amounting to £70,000,000 a year, of which £20,000,000 is on account of World WarI . I do not know whether the Liberal party or th-.' Australian' Country party intends to repudiate, the interest bill if it should be returned to power in the future. Whatever government may be in power, it will have to return to -the States an ever increasing amount as their functions increase, and in addition, it will hav» to make interest payments totalling at least £70,000.000. Asthe aggregate amount collected from direct taxes is only £129,000,000 or £130,000,000, the Commonwealth has not much lef t after it has made these disbursements. It w ill thus he seen that the Government is the object of a good deal of undeserved criticism. The time is rapidly approaching when we shall have to consider the present alinement of the. functions and Honourable members opposite, responsibilities of the Commonweal th and the States. Let us study for a moment our export and import trade. Before the war, our export trade was conducted largely by private enterprise, through the medium of banks, agents and so forth , and our import trade was carried on in much the same fashion. Owing to the tremendous economic turmoil in the world to-day, and the enorThe Government mous interest bills of the various nations with which we traded in the past, the different transactions have to be conducted through governmental authorities. Permission has to be obtained to import or export goods, our sterling balances have to be adjusted, and our dollar position must be kept in a satisfactory condition. We cannot have that free flow of trade which we had in other days, because of the sanctions and restrictions that have grown up out of the economic upheaval that has taken place throughout the world. The people are now rebelling, and cannot understand why they are tralia's economy generally, but seeing unable to trade as they did prior to 1939. that you, sir, have ruled me out of I cannot see that this Government is order playing a greater part than any other government in international turmoil and disruption.

As I have said, I do not believe that a reduction of taxes would be of any great benefit, particularly to those on the lower incomes. AlthoughI should have preferred something different, I realize that the proposal before us is the best that can be made when we consider the pressure brought to bear on the Government by-various pressure groups, quasi economists, and the press. Mr Hor/r -Does the honourable gentleman, want a short period of deflation ? that trap.. ""We canv only wait and see what effect a reduction of taxes will have on production and on the people generally, particularly those in receipt of the basic wage. I do not believe that the effect will he what honourable members opposite think. The great bulk of theworkers will not be in. the taxation field at all after June next, and those whose incomes are high enough to be taxed will uot be subjected to any great burden. Time only will telli what the effect of these reductions with the object of obtaining a reduction will be. -On the last occasion that I spoke on. finance in this HouseI followed the honorable member for Denison (Dr. Gaha), and dealt fully with his remarks,, so I shall not deal at length with his speech to-night. All honourable members will agree that. Commonwealth revenue is increasing. It is well to keep that fact in mind when discussing the various proposals that come before us. The budget expectation of an income of £404,976^000 for the financial year is likely to be greatly exceeded. The revenue for the ten months ended the30th of April amounted to £325,656,000. It is generally believed that Commonwealth revenue will increase slowly for the next few years, and, if that be. so, greater reductions of taxe3. than are proposed'by the. Government would be possible. Supporters of the Government have contended that a reduction of taxes would not increase production, but that does not seem to me to be a logical argument. Some Opposition speakers have pointed out that goods are being withheld from the market until after the 30th June next, when merchants know that the taxation position will be' more favorable. If the promise of a small reduction, of taxes has that effect, is it not logical to say that heavy taxes do retard production? The best way to ascertain the effects of taxes is to move freely among the people and learn their views. Large numbers of workers refuse to augment their incomes by any considerable amount because, they say, their extra earnings are taken by the taxation authorities. A striking illustration can be found in the fruit-growing districts of Mildura, Redcliffs and Merbein. Many men on piece-work will work only for a certain number of days in each week, notwithstanding that it is essential that the fruit be picked at the proper time. The reason is that additional earnings l if t their income into a higher range in respect of which the rate of tax is so great as to preclude them from netting any worthwhile additional amount. Because of this the industry as a whole suffered considerable loss. I recall that at that time representations were made of tax on incomes above a, certain amount in order to induce these workers to continue on the job. However, those representations -were not successful. In the dried fruits industry it is essential that the fruit be harvested at a certain time of the year if the grower is to derive full benefit from his crop. If , because of taxation anomalies, pickers will not continue to work after they have earned a certain amount, production is limited. This was emphasized in the case which 1 have in mind, because at that particular time thousands of bushels of fruit which the workers refused to pick were destroyed by heavy rain.. In that way the industry suffered considerable loss. The fruit destroyed could have been exported to Great Britain; but,, in any case, the country generally suffered that loss. Honourable' members opposite have often deplored the wantonness of producers in certain countries, who deliberately dump surplus production at sea, oa: destroy it 1 in other ways. I for one. cannot see any",35,Second Beading

118,Mr Turnbull (Wimmera) [5.46].,"difference between destroying fruit in that way or allowing it to be destroyed by failing to remedy taxation anomalies as the result of which pickers refuse to haragree that production in this country was vest all of the crop. The honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) has told us how thousands of bags of potatoes have been allowed to rot in the ground in Tasmania. Therefore, honourable members opposite have no grounds for denying that excessive taxation retards production. AlthoughI disagree with most proposals advanced by the Government, I wholeheartedly support some of the provisions in this measure. I was pleased to be informed by the Prime Minister( Mr cult to obtain bicycle tyres. Essential Chifley) that provision has been made to allow as a deduction in respect of income tax 20 per cent, of the amount expended by a taxpayer in the purchase of new machinery, and that that concession is in addition to the existing allowance to 10 per cent, in respect of that item. .1. welevidence of increased prosperity throughcome particularly the provision to allow as a concessional deduction all expenditure incurred in combating soil erosion, because this problem is most acute in the electorate which I represent. This provision will benefit not only producers who come face to face with soil erosion, but also the nation as a, whole. The bill also allows as a deduction depreciation on such improvements as bores, wells, and dams. This will be a valuable aid to primary producers generally. However, this concession could be made more generous. The Government should allow a similar concession in respect of expenditure on fencing. In most country areas fences have fallen into serious dissupplies of wrapping paper and paper repair. I am, however, pleased that a concession is allowed in respect of expenditure on rabbit-proof and. wild-dog fencing. In the Millewa area, where wild dogs are a serious menace, such a concession would be of great aid to producers who reside on its boundaries. I also appreciate the concession made wi.tb respect to gift tax. The other concessions provided in the when the Government gets this money itbill are not so generous.

The Prime Minister, in his second-reading speech, said, in effect, that all would, at a. commendable level, and that one had only to look around the shops to convince one's self of that fact: Recently, when I was in Melbourne, I recalled that statement by the Prime Minister and decided to put it to the test. However, I found that, whilst many luxury goods such asperfumery and beauty aids were plentiful in the shops, one had difficulty in obtaining many essential articles. 1 am reminded that the honourable member for Hume( Mr Puller) has often inquired at question time why it is so diffigoods generally are now in short supplyThe honourable member for Hume alsocited the deposits in the savings hanks last year, and as these showed a considerable increase over deposits in 1941, ho produced those figures as out the community.

Money in the savings bank earns for its owners only a low rate of interest. It is being used, for the most part, to fill government loans, but. I canthought that this supported his argument",36,Second Beading
119,Mr Turnbull,"I disagree withI cannot see any signs that the Government is .trying to economize with its expenditure. If , before the war, you went, on to a farm and found that everything was falling into ruin, the fences were down and ihe machinery out of repair, while the owner had a considerable amount of money in the sa vings bank, you would have said to yourself, "" This man is a. poor manager. Why docs he not use. some of his money to get his farm back into full production, as his neighbours have done?"" To-day, with a few exceptions, all the farms all over Australia are falling into disrepair. Certainly, there is some money in the banks, but the farmers cannot get goods which they need to increase production. When all the farms in Australia are in this condition it is a sure sign that the country is heading for a lower standard of living. We sometimes read in the papers of a man having lived in poverty and having died almost of starvation, although he had £10,000 to his credit in the bank. We say of that man that he was a miser. At the present time, the Government's policy is not giving the people a chance to use their savings, and so Ave have a depression of a somewhat different kind from that of L930-33. Then, we had the goods, but not the money; now we have the money, but not the goods. In spite of the Prime Minister's statement that the shops are full of goods, and that the country is in a high state of prosperity, I say that we are, in fact, in the midst of a depression. good farming machinery, for one thing. Every one who has had any experience of these things knows that farm equipment all over the country has deterioratedvery greatly. I. believe that the basic wage should be tax-free. We should not fix the tax-free amount at £250, or at any other specified figure; but it should be provided that the hasic wage, whatever it may be, shall be free of tax. If the basic wage were to be raised considerably next week it would bring into the income tax field many persons who could not afford to pay tax. We may be sure that if the basic wage goes up wage-earners will not be able to buy any more goods with the money than they can buy to-day because goods will have increased in price accordingly. I am glad that the Treasurer ha? at last seen fit to make some reduction of taxes, but I am sorry he did not do it before. Those six months.from January last until next July are very important in Australia's national economy. Had taxes been reduced at the beginning of this year I. am sure there would not have been so much industrial strife. Even now the reduction is not big enough. Commonwealth revenue is increasing all the tim.e, and from three items alone revenue will exceed the estimates by over £1S,000,000. I believe that further concessions should have been made in some directions, and one of them is in. respect of medical expenses. For instance, a man -living at Ouyen, in my electorate may have to travel to the city for treatment by a specialist. The amount spent in travelling for this purpose should be an allowable deduction. Many people sufferingfront ill health are compelled to travel long distances to the cities for treatment, perhaps once a fortnight or once a .month; if such a concession were granted it would be of real benefit to them. As many honourable members know, country people frequently have to board their children at high schools 20 or 40 mile? away or even further. The boarding fees charged should also be exempt from tax. These may appear to' be only small matters, but. in the aggregate they represent very heavy expenditure which has to be met by the taxpayers, principally those in rural areas. If all items associated with the education of children were subject to rebates of tax, people would he encouraged to give their children a better education. Before asking the people to be content with the small reductions of taxes proposed by this bill, the Government should set, its house in order by drastically curtailing its expenditure of public money, much of which is still maintained at the war-time level. Unless and until that, be done, we cannot expect the people to be satisfied. The taxpayers are restive under the continuance of heavy taxes. Above all we must have a contented community. We are not a nation of motor cars, of railway engines, of tractors and fishing fleets, but a nation of men and women and children. Some people regard",37,Second Beading

These are, first, what I might describe as the controversy between the relative merits of the rebate and deduction systems, and secondly, the allegation .that the tax schedule is nnduOy complicated and that the term: "" motional income "" is something which describes an instrument for the extraction of .money from the taxpayers. The Leader of the Australian Country party .(Ma-. Eadden) made a statement with regard to the methods of rebates which I desire to repeat. I took a very careful note of the right honourable gentleman's 3i?aitement, This is what lie saidAlthough when the Labour Government introduced ' the rebate system, it may have had a pproximately the same effect on .taxpayers with dependants as had previous .deductions, its subsequent extension has undoubtedly mused the dice %ofoeheavily loaded against tliuni. The Treasurer -subtly -admits that that is true by resisting all attempts on my part Lo have the deduction system restored. The right honourable gentleman argues that it would cost too much; in 'Other words, lihose who would benefit by the deduction system are now contributing much more to revenue under the rebate system. That is entirely false. I issue ia challenge to the Leader of the Australian Country party and say that under tlie proposals now before the House in respect of all incomes up to £500 a year the taxpayer is much better off under the rebate system-that is to say, he has to pay less in taxes-tha n he.would have been had the deduction system,, as it operated at the time uniform tax was introduced, been continued. i ng his statement. cation about it. I . repeat that tie rebate system is of greater benefit to taxpayers with incomes of up to £500 a year. I believe it is of greater benefit, to all taxpayers, but I have been able to check it only in respect of incomes of up to £500 a year and that is why. I am limiting my assertion to that figure. After all, we -on this side of the House are more conr earned with those with incomes of less than £500 a year thaai with those who enjoy incomes above that amount. [S.15] I rise to deal Mr Fadden interjecting. give .£il'O0 to any charitable institution the right honourable member may eare to name if he cairn prove that my statement is untrue. Let us look back over the history of this .jmavtter. The fact is that -rebates amd deductions both 'constitute methods by which some concession may be granted to, individuals because they have certaaai expenditures to 'meet. Consider the case of two taxpayers earning, -say, £50.0 a year. One of them may not be married .and miay have no dependants; the -othiei' in ay have a wife .and 'children. 'One may have large doctor's bills to meet, and tbe other may .not incur any expenses of that kind. One may make large gifts bo charitable institutions, and the other may make no .gifts -at all. Rebates and deduotioms -constitute two methods by wJiich these 'differences 'can be adjusted. Tlie ip.rincLple of allowing a deduction from net income on account of dependants was incorporated in the original Income Tax Act passed in 11915, and -with certain amendments, it was continued till 1941, when a further amendment -of the act was made following the introduction of child endowment, which . abolished the deduction previously applicable to all children other than the first child. The deduction previously 'allowable was £50 for a spouse OT female relative, and £50 for .a dependent child. The system of deductions worked in this way: A .single taxpayer with am income of £500 a year -was taxed on £500 ,-a.t the r.ate applicable to that amount .of income. A married .man with a wife and child was allowed . a deduction of £50 for his wife, .and £50 for his child. Tbus, a .married .man with .a wife and one child",38,Second Beading

The honourable member for Parramatta may claim £-100 for any charitable institution he likes to name if my statement is untrue. The system of granting concessional allowances by way of rebates was introduced by the legislation providing for uniform taxes, in 1942. The change was the outcome of a recommendation made by a committee presided over by Professor be the same.

In regard to all dependants, however, the value of the allowance*should not exceed the maximum amount that would be allowed under the existing law. 37. All concessional allowances should, in future, be made toy means of a rebate of tax. calculated on the allowance at the taxpayer's personal exertion rate, instead of a deduction from his taxable income as at present. Those recommendations were adopted, and later were incorporated in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1942. Critics of the rebate system overlook the fact that the rebate is calculated on a larger amount than the amount formerly allowed as a deduction. It is, in .fact, calculated on an amount which is approximately twice that formerly allowed as a It is. I issue the deduction. For example, the amount previously deducted from a taxpayer's income -in respect of a wife was £50, whereas the rebate for a wife as calculated for the financial year 1946-47 is on the basis of £100, and under the new proposal it w ill be £150. I have here a table showing the tax payable by different, categories of income-earners under the rebate system, and also the tax which they would have paid had the old deduction system remained in operation. criticize I ask leave to Leave not granted.

131,Mr Harrison,"We should like themean when he refers to the old deduction -.system ? tion system which was in operation until it. was replaced by the rebate system. On an income of £250 a year a married man without dependants would be £7 Is. 'better off under the rebate system than under the deduction system. The table gives particulars in respect of incomes ranging from £200 a year to £500 a year, by £50 stages. As I expect to incorporate the table in Hansard, I shall not read all llie details, but shall refer to the case of a married man without dependants in receipt of an income of £500 a year. Under the new proposals he will pay as -rax £50 3s., whereas under the old deduction system he would have paid £59 9s. ft will be seen that under the rebate system he will be £9 6s. better off than under the deduction system. .gest that the rebate system is more beneficial tp the average taxpayer than was -the deduction system? gest it ; I say emphatically that it is better. The figures in this table prove it. Under the rebate system a married'man with one child will pay a tax of £37 5s. -on an income of £500 a year, compared with £48 6s. under the deduction system, so that he will be better off by £11 ls. a year. A married man with two children in receipt of the same income will pay £30 under the rebate system, instead of t'4S 6s., which he would have paid under the-old system, and will therefore benefit hy £'JS 6s. a,year. Not only are all these -categories of taxpayers with dependants better off under the rebate system than under the deduction system, but they are .also progressively better off. The married man without children with an income of £500 a year is £9 12s. better -off; the married man with one child is Ell 2s. better off, and the married man with two children is £1S 12s. better off. That proves conclusively that the contention of tlie Leader of the Australian -Country party is entirely false. These concessions ""are granted to meet the different circumstances of taxpayers earning the same income. A taxpayer who mates a gift to a charitable institution may have been better off under the old deduction system than under the rebate system. I have always considered that there is something wrong about the law that exempts charitable gifts from income tax. In an extreme case like that which .1 am about to cite, I think one could say. "" Well, it is a matter that may have to be considered "" If a person with considerable capita] earned £5,000 a year from personal exertion and chose to live on hiscapital and to make a gift of his incomeI am assuming that he had no unearned income-h e would pay no tax under either the rebate system or the system of deductions. I think that that is entirely wrong. Mr 'HO.LT -Does the Minister know any one who has done that? a case-a n exaggerated one I admit-i u order to bring out a principle. I think it is entirely wrong that a person could be placed in the position in which he would pay no tax for the maintenance of law and order, and the services that the Government gives to the people, for which of course, they have to pay, merely because he chose to give his income to a charitable institution. Ordinarily a person earning £5,000 a. year would, under these proposals, pay £2,658 in tax, but if he took the extreme course of making a charitable gift of all his income, he would pay no tax, and the Treasurer would, lose £2,658 » the Treasurer should be put in a position like that. A person earning £5,000 a yearwho makes a gift of £3,000 would, under the deduction system, pay tax on £2,000 a year, and his tax would amount to £6S2. Under the rebate system lie would be taxed on the £5,000 at the £5,000 rate and would then have rebated to him the sum represented by tax on the £3,000 at the £5,000 rate, and he would have to pay tax amounting to £1,063. to gifts to charitable institutions? system would be of greater benefit than the rebate system to taxpayers only when gifts were made to charitable institutions.",40,Second Beading

140,Mr Dedman,"Yes. The deductionI doubt the wisdom of legislation where-: by a man can make a. g if t to a charitable institution and escape the tax that he should pay on account of his income. The next matter that I refer to is the allegation that the tax schedule is unduly complicated and that the conception of a notional income is something whereby more money can be extracted from taxpayers. Honourable members will have noticed that I said at the outset that I wanted to talk about two matters raised hy Opposition members. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang) belongs to the Opposition. In an interjection when the honourable member for Hume( Mr Fuller) was speaking he said that it, would be much simpler if the progressive rates in the schedule could be cut out. He implied that the most desirabletiling about a tax schedule is simplicity, but the simpler one makes a schedule the more Tux everybody in the community £5 a head regardless of income and you produce the simplest schedule possible; but is it said that any one in this House, at any rate, any one on the Labour side, would support a schedule of that character? It would be utterly inequitable. When one begins to take into consideration the varying circumstances of people on different ranges of income, the schedule necessarily becomes somewhat complicated. Any argument for simplification is an argument in favour of .replacing a progressive system with a retrogressive system. The honourable member for Reid asked, "" W h a t is this notional income? I have never heard of it "" . The honourable member either stated a deliberate untruth or is completely ignorant of certain occurrences when he was a member of the Parliament of New .South Wales. I have taken the trouble to write out a definition i of "" notional income"", and I shall show that it was adopted by not only the Commonwealth Parliament, but also the Parliament of New South Wales. The definition is as follows:When -a premium or other consideration is received hy a taxpayer for the grant, transfer or assignment' of a. lease, it falls to be taxed in the year of receipt. If the whole amount of the premium is taxed at the rate applicable to the total income of that year, the incidence of fax is unduly harsh, due to the graduation of income tax rates. . The Royal Commission on Taxation of 1934 considered this question and in view of the fact that a premium may be regarded as a commutation of several years rent made certain recommendations which were incorporated in the Commonwealth Uniform Tax Act of 193fi and in certain State tax acts. lecture ? Apparently the honourable member is learning something. He had better keep quiet and t r y to take it in . Section 86 of the Commonwealth Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, which provides for a definition of notional income, was introduced by the Treasurer of a non-Labour government, Mr R. G. Casey. Mr Casey represented the electorate of Corio. As with the electorate of Robertson, which I mentioned earlier, the former' representative has been replaced by a much more competent individual. The effect of the appliinequitable . it will be. cation of this conception of a notional income is that the taxpayer is assessed on his actual taxable income at the rate applicable to his notional income, which, is always lower than the rate that would be applicable to the actual taxable income. The idea of a notional income was not conceived in order to extract more money from the taxpayer. It was designed to. give the taxpayer a concession from the tax that he would have to pay if the ratewere, based on his actual income. duced with the uniform tax system. ception of a. notional income was introduced on the recommendation of a Royal Commission on Taxation. It was introduced both in the Commonwealth sphere and in the New South Wales State spherein 1936, and it continued to be applied in New South Wales from that time until the introduction of uniform, tax in 1942. During the period from 1936 to 1942, the honourable member for Reid, who interjected that he had never heard of notional income, was a member of the State Parliament of New South Wales. Either he was completely ignorant of thetax laws of New South Wales, or he was deliberately attempting to mislead this House when he said that he had never heard of notional income.

I hope to do so in a much shorter time than the honourable gentleman took to deal with his two points. First, I hark back to a telegram which,. I believe, was misunderstood by the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) at question . time to-day and which has a direct bearing on the Income Tax Assessment Bill. In this telegram, the president of. the Orange Graziers Association raised an important point affecting this measure. He has asked that meat sent to Great Britain as a gift should be free of tax. I shall give some background information on this subject in order to show the complications arising from the method of assessing tax on stock. I speak on behalf of a wide stock-raising area of New South Wales. Many farmers in that State are in a dilemma. I have spoken to some of these men by telephone tonight. They are eager to make gifts of stock to Britain because many of them have not sufficient ready cash to enable them to make a direct monetary gift and it is easier for them to donate livestock. Furthermore, the making of a gift, of stock gives them a greater personal interest in the campaign to provide food for the hungry people of Britain. As honourable members know, any monetary contribution made to charitable organizations schedule; that,, in; fact,, if we are to have an equitable system of taxation, it is almost essential that schedules should be complex:. ""With the concurrence of the HouseI shall incorporate in Hansard the table to which I have already referred.. It is as follows:Married-On o Child. Married-Tw o Children.

Unfortunately, gifts to provide food for Britain are not treated in this way. I was pleased to-day.to hear the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) announce that the Government is anxious that food shoiild be sent voluntarily to Great Britain, and that its policy is to encourage the making of such gifts, particularly stock. Farmers want to help the Food for Britain campaign as much as possible, but their gifts will be taxed under the present scheme. The Government is asking taxpayers to makea gift with one hand and to pay tax on that gift with the other hand. Even Shylock at his worse would not demand such a sacrifice, and. I suggest that the Aberdeen Court, which everybody holds in the highest respect, would rule such a demand completely out of order. The income tax law provides that, on the 1st July every year, stock-owners must indicate, on the appropriate forms, what has happened to their stock during the preceding year. They have three courses open to them. They may state that they have sold their stock, that they have killed stock for their personal rations and that deaths have taken toll of their flocks and herds. There is no provision in the schedule to cover stock which may have-been given away for any purpose; such as for the purpose of providing food for Britain. Therefore, every stockowner is in a' dilemma. If a farmer has",42,Second Beading
145,Mr Howse (Calare) [8.44],"given away, say, 50 steep to provide food for Britain, he is not able to claim any tax allowance in respect of that gift. The sheep represent capital from his business. Although he may be prepared to sacrifice that capital for a good cause, it is unfair that he shpuld be taxed on it at the same time. Thpre are two methods by which the tax schedule co-uld be amended so as to provide for this contingency. First, the gift of stock could be indicated in "" amount the place of disposal"". Secondly, a separate item could be introduced providing for a deduction to be made in respect of stock given to the Food for Britain appealThe latter method would simplify the position $f men who are prepared to release some of their -valuable capital in the form of .stock as a gift tp the British people. What is clearly required, and the Government should agree with me, is an amendment to provide that any .one who complies with government ipolicy by giving stock tp Great Britain, without .accepting any payment for it, should be allowed the value of the stock as a deduction for purposes of income tax. At present, the stock-owner is in .a dilemma. He wants ,to donate stqck to this worthy cause; but it is no,t fair that he should have to pay .tax on its value. Therefore, I ask the Government to submit to the House this vital .amendment so that persons who desire .to contribute food to Great Britain may be able tp do so without incurring a financial penalty. Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) has proved conclusively to the House and the country that under the new system of rebates compared with the former system of deductions,, the earner of income up-.to £500 per annum will be in a better position after the 1st July next than'he was jn the past. When a Scotsman is prepared to gamble £100 on die accuracy of his statement, we can rest a ssured that he is correct. MrO ONEL AN -In -the circumstances, I -am prepared to be on the side of the Ministeri f I place a bet. ""The honourable member for Wimmera '( Mr wife, in receipt .of an income of £250 a Turnbull) expressed surprise at what he [78] described as the small reductions of tax which the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) has granted. The honourable member is the Q.nly member of the Opposition who is surprised. The Leader of the Australian Gpu-ntry party ( Mr Fadden) accused the Treasurer of being unduly cautious. If everybody else is quite satisfied that the concessions a -rs adequate, the Treasurer has obviously done something worthwhile for the community.

The honourable member for Fawkner( MrH o l t ) stressed the amount of money being paid by the people of this country .in indirect taxes. ever, that the people of Australia pay less in direct taxes than the people of most British countries. Take the case of Great Britain to-day. Almost everything purchased in the United Kingdom to-day is taxed. The small amount of smoking or drinking indulged in by working men is subject to heavy taxes, whilst luxuries are taxed up to 100 per cent. In the United States of America and in Canada there has been for some years past a special tax of 15 per cent, on all persons travelling. Those are huge countries, and in the course of a year many millions of people have occasion to travel. In New Zealand there is also a tax on travel of 5 per cent. For every £1 spent while travelling iu that country the traveller has to pay a special tax of Is. The Commonwealth Government, by contrast, has consistently reduced taxes since the war ended, and it has foregone indirect taxes to the amount of £24,850,000. In Europe all kinds of taxes are imposed on the people, even fowl beiug taxed. In Canada and United States of America almost every article purchased is regarded as a luxury and is subject to a sales tax of 25 per cent. Even crockery and cutlery and other ordinary household goods are liable to sales tax. Despite what the honourable member for Fawkner said, I think those facts prove that the people of Australia tell us of any country where taxes per head of population average £50, as they do in this country? And what is the reason why indirect taxation is high in this country? Obviously, it is because the worker to-day has more money Mr TuiiNnur.L -More money in the bank! and in his pocket, too. Before World War II . there were 250,000 unemployed in this country who could not earn sufficient to subsist, let alone deposit any money in a bank. But to-day, the workers have all got good jobs and most of them have money in the bank. Despite the amount which the Government takes out of their pay envelopes by way of tax, they The fact is, howhave more money in pay than they Hid before. That is why the workers of this country' are s.o grateful to this Government and why they ' will return it, at the next elections! The policy of Labour governments has always been to make the incidence of taxation bear most heavily on those best able to support it. During the war a Labour government imposed tax as high as iSs. 6d. in the £1 on incomes of £5,000; but people receiving £5,000 a year still had enough left to buy most of the luxuries they needed. What matters is not how much is taken from people in taxes, but what is .left, to them. Whilst, the Government may take thousands of pounds from a man with an income of £10,000, and take only, say, 10s. from a man on the basic wage, the basic wage-earner feels the impact of that taxation more thanthe man who pays thousands of pounds in tax. I am pleased that the Government has determined to exempt from taxation any man with dependants who receives only the basic wage. Whilst a man with three dependants does have to pay £5 osr a year social service tax, he receives substantial benefits for it. The tax amounts to only 2s. a week, and, in return for that small contribution, he receives social services for the four units of his family. A single man, of course, is more heavily taxed; but he, too, recei ves a number of social services. A -married man with a family, who becomes incapacitated, receives an invalid pension, whilst his wife also receives financial assistance. If he and his wife attain the age of 65 years and are in indigent circumstances', they each receive 37s. 6d. a week, plus 5s. endowment for the first child. In addition they are entitled to sickness and unemployment benefits. A married woman is entitled to child endowment of £19 for each child after the first, and she is",45,Second Beading

I feel that this Government has done a magnificent, job, and that the Treasurer should be congratulated and.not criticized by honourable members opposite. The Government; is desirous of reducing taxes, whenever it is possible At the last elecMenzies-). and the leaderof: the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden;) solicited the: rates of: the electors with promisesof reduction of taxes.. On the other hand-, all the. Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) promised was that he would review taxes from time .to time. He has kept that promise to grant concessions when pos,sible. It woidd be difficult, for any government to give effect to tax reductions: in less than two-or three months. The Government was returned to office in September,, and the Parliament met in November., of last year. At thebeginning of the new year, the Treasurer examined the position, and! at the firs,t opportunity has. submitted' to. the Parliament proposals {'or the granting of concessions that are to-be given effect as from the 1st Julynext. The people will be satisfied with what' the Gbv,ernment:has done,, and it. is hoped that the granting of further, concessions may be possible twelve months hence.

That is the sort of half-truth which is more villainous thanany lie. The Minister knows perfectly well that, pripr to uniform income tax there was no basis of comparison between. Commonwealth deductions and State deductions, because each State had its. own deduction system and the system did not allow of proper comparison. It is amazing, that a Minister of State who is about to go overseas and discuss our trade relations with foreign countries should' come into his own Parliament and attempt to deceive honourable members, no doubt most unwittingly, by specious and unfair reasoning of that description. ber can prove any statement to be untrue,, my £100 is there for him. to have, too, no desire to have my fingers touched by the Minister's money. I only want him to speak the truth on these matters. I do not. want his money, any more than luiis misrepresentation., Perhaps he can argue the matter with the Commissioner of Taxation. The Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden), whom the honourable gentleman attacked, has handed, to me a copy of a letter signed by Mr P. S. McGovern, who, I believe,, is the Commissioner pf Taxation. It is dated the 2nd August, 1946, and is in answer to certain questions that were put to him by the Leader of the Australian Country party. In paragraph 3, he statedTlie effect on revenue of reconversion from tlie. present concessional rebates to concessional deductions depends upon tlie, amounts allowed as deductions. Of course it does! One might as well say that if it be a fine day to-morrow it will not rain. The Commissioner went on to sayPrior to the introduction of the rebate system, tlie amounts varied considerably. That is my case. There was no uniformity, and there is no basis of comparison between those days and to-day. The Commissioner continuedFor example, prior to 1936 no deduction whatever was allowed for a spouse, whilst only under the age of sixteen years. Allowances for medical expenses were on a much restricted scale.' Tlie present rebnteable amounts were designed, upon the introduction o£ uniform taxation, to give approximately the. same concession as had been obtained under the old deduction-, pf, therefore, conversion were made to the basis of theamounts nowtaken into account for rebate, purposes, it is estimated that the cost would be upwards of £25,000,000 at present rates. Eor purposes of this estimate, it is presumed that the allowance for a spouse would be constant at £100. If it would cost the Treasury £25,000,000, on the statement of the head of the Taxation Department, to reconvert-that is the word that he used assumption. that statements on tax matters over the signature of the head of the TaxationI f . the honourable memDepartment,, addressed to the Leader of the Australian Country party, should not be based on assumption. If they are, I have then they are. not worth the: paper on which they are written, and they are as misleading as the statements of the Minister. If the reconversion of the taxation system to whati t was before, is to cost £25,000,000, how can there be any benefit to the taxpayers under the present system ? If the £25,000,000 is to be lost to the Treasury, it stands to reason that it must be , gained by the taxpayers. According, to the Commissioner for Taxation himself, the present rebate system "" socks "" the taxpayer. That is indisputable, because the basis upon which the taxes are calculated is higher than it was under tlie concessional deduction system. ' The Income Tax Act is' a sticky piece of legislation at all times. It raises hostility partly because people do not understand the returns that they have to fill in. There' is urgent need for a review of the whole system of income taxation in this country, both in relation to private individuals and to companies. The present system of rebates was recommended by the special taxation committee referred, to by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction.

170,Mr Archiecameron,"I put i tCountry party was represented on that rouunittee. 1 say that it was not. I Taut that denial placed on record, because it. is just as well that people should know' who was responsible for the present system. The Australian Country party was not represented by an appointee of the party. The honourable gentleman who has been described as the representative of the Australian Country party, was a self-appointee, and did not attend as a result of any decision by the party. Therefore, we have a perfect right to ask for a review of the present system, and that, I believe, should include an investigation of methods under which taxes could be assessed without making . the lot of those engaged in agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, as hard as it, is to-day. The present returns are most complicated, and should be simplified. A taxpayer has to supply separate returns ore numerous occasions, and has to give lists of all kinds. On the front, of the return is a declaration that has to be signed by the taxpayer stating that every statement in the document return is accurate. I should be extremely surprised if the Commissioner for Taxation himself expects to get, 100 per cent, accuracy in view of the complicated forms that are presented to taxpayers. dentally, taxation officials themselves do not achieve 1.00 per cent, accuracy in, their assessments. Evidence of that has been given in this chamber on many occasions. We have all had the experience of hearing from constituents whose taxation assessments have had to be returned to the taxation authorities for revision. In some cases assessments have had to be amended by hundreds of pounds. Only to-day I had brought to my notice an assessment which had been reduced by some hundreds of pounds after the Taxation Department had delayed the matter for some months. The live-stock schedule attached to business and professional income tax forms is a model of complexity. ask.?, for a statement of stock on hand at the 1st July, purchases of stock, natural increase-numbers only-gross sales, killings for rations, stock, including all natural increase, on hand at the 30th June of the following year and .then, stock losses by death-numbers When the department asks a taxpayer for Mr Archie Cameron. the total value of stock on hand at the 30th June, and then, immediately under that, for stock losses by death,""I know that quite a number of fair-minded people, and I have a strong suspicion, a few tax agents, do not understand what this schedule means at all. Mr Por.r.Ajtn -They must be very simple. they are electors of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard). Extensive information is also required in regard to wages paid. An employer is supposed to know the Christian names, marital state, and almost the pedigree of his employees, and what will be their fate in the hereafter. Also, if any one is employed under contract, the employer is obliged to make deductions for taxation pururses. Tbat, is going a bit too far, and it, is about time the Taxation Department showed some sense of responsibility in carrying out its own duties instead of making every taxpayer an honorary tax collector on its behalf. Any committee inquiring into the taxation system should examine' the whole question of simplifying income tax Inciforms, but I am quite sure that any fair minded person, apart from those now on the treasury bench of this Parliament, would be able to devise some better method of securing returns than the present one. The next matter to which I shall refer is one that I have mentioned in this chamber on previous occasions, namely, the position of the Northern Territory in relation .to taxation. Under this measure, people in the Northern Territory are to be exempt'from taxation for another five years. That period is not long enough. IT we want, to induce people to go out to this territorv and undertake the hazards and difficulties of settlement, there must 1)0 some -better method of giving a longThe department range exemption from taxation than is provided in this bill.

With, the views expressed in those articles only. most, people will be in complete agreement. After an extensive tour of the",48,Cameron Tha T £50 Was Allowed For Each Dependent Child
171,Mr Archie Cameron,"Possiblyterritory, the writer put the case for a longer period of exemption from taxation than is provided in this measure. I am very much in favour of that. I believe, however, that a certain percentage of the money that accrues to settlers through exemption from taxation should be used to improve their properties. Anybody who goes to the Northern Territory is entitled to taxation concessions because he goes out to work under conditions that are entirely foreign to those operating in the southern part of the Commonwealth. 1 have noticed with a great deal of satisfaction that the Government has copied parts of the Opposition's taxation policy. I refer to the provisions dealing with soil erosion, and the conservation, reticulation, and discovery of water. There are one or two points in regard to water that I should like to have made clear at the committee stage, because I am not quite satisfied that the clause as * drafted really gives effect to what the Taxation Department or the Government intends. I come now to the question of assistance by way of income tax deductions to people engaged in private afforestation. Next to water conservation the planting nf areas of land in adequate rainfal l country with suitable types of trees is of outstanding importance. afforestation is lef t to the State governments, but there are some areas of timber that were planted privately long ago. In South Australia, in the district from which I come, owners of these properties reaped considerable benefit* during the war years. Although some of the timber has been cut before it would have been in peace-time, under the present taxation system, if a. man sells a eertain amount of timber in one year, the entire proceeds from that sale are added to his income for that year. W it h taxation rates as high as they are to-day it is doubtful whether a man, after making his donation to the Treasury, would have enough left fro m the proceeds of the sale of the timber to compensate hi m for all the rates, land tax, &c., that he bad paid during the last 25 years on the land on .which the timber was grown. In the case of pine forests the ground has practically no grazing value while the timber is growing. There is in Australia a very serious shortage of timber. We certainly have no immense stocks of iron ore, but we are much better off in this respect than we are in respect of timber. Less than j per cent, of South Australia is under forest timber. Professor Wood, in a book published in New York dealing with the resources of Australia, points out that in Western Australia, out of every 625 acres under forest only 3^ acres carry forests suitable for timber. In other words, only one acre out of every 1S7 carries suitable forest. The first limiting factor in regard to the growth of forests is rainfall. Pine forests and hardwood forests cannot be grown in low rainfal l areas. Many of our suitable native timbers have been completely cut out. When I was in the Ministryi n 1938, much trouble was experienced in obtaining suitable timber for the manufacture of butter boxes. It then came to my notice that great forests of hoop pine in Queensland and northern New South .Wales had been cut out for the manufacture of butter boxes and, so far as 1 know, those areas have not been replanted. It is a crime that such areas, especially in hill country, should be cut out without being replanted. ( MrB u r k e ) I hope the honourable member will connect his remarks with A t present, the bill. ' the bill is in committee, I propose to move certain amendments relating to the matters which I am now discussing. We could learn much from other countries about reafforestation, by which I mean, tht continuous use of land, with a suitable rainfall, for the production of timber. Such countries as Sweden, Norway, Germany and other countries in the neighbourhood of the Carpathians would be able to supply, us with this information. GreatB r it a in is notoriously deficient in timber, and during the last war terrific inroads were made into its timber reserves, which will not be established again for a long time. Under normal conditions, and even with such a quick-growing timber as Finns radiata, it takes from 30 to 34 years to obtain a return from afforestation. In Australia, there is poor grazing country in high rainfal l districts which would be very suitable for growing timber, and we should encourage",49,Cameron Tha T £50 Was Allowed For Each Dependent Child

173,Mr Archie Cameron,"Whenprivate land-holders to devote it to this use. Information can be -obtained from State Forestry Departments showing how many trees should be planted to the acre. I would go so far as to say that if a -man -plants a windbreak along his fences he should be able to'claim a deduction from his taxable income for the money expended. I propose to move au amendment providing that if a person plants land in a suitable rainfall area with trees deemed by a State Forestry Department to be suitable for timber he should be able to claim an income tax deduction equal to 5 per cent, of the capital value of the land on which the trees are planted. As I have said, while the trees are growing, the land-holder gets very little return from it-practicall y none at all in the case of pine forests, and only very inferior grazing when the laud is planted with gums and certain -varieties of hardwoods. When a man cuts timber on his land he phonld be allowed a deduction of 3 per cent, of the capital value of the land each year for the time he has held the land under timber. Thus, if he planted the land 33 years ago he would pay no tax on bis income from the timber. If he bought the land ten years ago, 30 per cent, of the return would be exempt from taxation. Timber is one of the most needed commodities in Australia to-day, and its uses are increasing every year. These include the making of plywood, composition board made by grinding up the wood, and also the manufacture'of cardboard, paper, &c. Some of the States are embarking upon an active afforestation policy, but in some instances valuable forests have been destroyed by fire, and this is a tragedy. The damage cannot be quickly remedied, and it is necessary to replant the land. My third, point might be regarded as being selfishly South Australian, but I put it to, the Treasurer, none the less. Recently, an inquiry was held in South Australia into proposals for the settlement of ""Kangaroo Island, partly with a view to settling returned servicemen, and it was proposed that the land should be planted with belts of olive trees and carob trees. A man who plants land with olive trees, or with walnut trees, does not receive any return for twelve yeans. In peace-time, we import about Mr Archie Cameron. two-thirds of tlie olive oil consumed in Australia, mostly from Italy, Spain and Greece, and perhaps some from the Middle !East. We also import a good many of the :nuts that we eat. In South Australia, there are areas which have been proved to be suitable for the production of walnuts, olives, fee. I should like the Government :to do something to encourage the planting of these areas. Once the trees are in production, they provide the raw materials which are required in secondary industries in every State of the Commonwealth. The trees may not come into full production for twenty years, but I suggest that for a^' period of fifteen years, any land-holder in any district approved by a State Department of Foresifcs or Agriculture, who puts land under olive, walnut or any other tree aga-eed upon by the Commonwealth and tlie States, should be allowed a concession for income tax purposes of 30 per cent, of the capital value* of the trees while they are being eared for. I make that suggestion because we are backward in these things in Australia. It is true that, our forefathers were more concerned with destroying rather than conserving timber. We must reverse our outlook with regard to timber and trees. We have also imported various pests into this country. Under normal conditions most, native trees in Australia propagated themselves, but, to-day, where we have not only the shorthorn, but also the merino and the rabbit, the seedlings do not get a chance. Even in the more populated districts, action must be taken to protect the trees until they reach a certain age. Encouragement must be given to people to do that work. In the outback, one of the greatest problems is the rabbit, because it will not allow the young foliage to come up and get a start. For this reason, inferior, or mediocre, -country is becoming virtual desert. This process will continue unless we remedy the position. It is time that the Commonwealth not only said to the State governments that re-afforestation is necessary and itself set an example to the States in that matter, but also said to private landholders, "" If you are prepared to devote certain of .your land to re-afforestation for trees approved by your State Department of Forests or Agriculture, the Commonwealth Governinent will subsidize you to the extent of certain deductions of income tax "". That is not too much to ask of the Commonwealth, because, without going into facts and figures which I shall use if necessary at the committee stage, it is clear that the timber resources of Australia were never lower whilst our timber requirements were never greater than they are to-day. Great forests have been cut out. In the interior the Murray pines have almost disappeared. will spare one of those trees to-day. They are being cut out to make way for wheat and grazing. The same observation applies to the sh.e-oa.k and variouskinds of gum; the Commonwealth Government could well afford to move in the direction I have indicated. With respect to other provisions of the bill I shall offer certain criticism at the committee stage. I am not yet satisfied with the provisions with respect to depreciation. That is a matter also which could be referred to a special committee, because whilst the present method of calculating depreciation is well understood by departmental officers; the Treasurer in reply to a question said that he was not prepared to allow lists of these percentages to be exhibited at country taxation offices, with the result that taxpayers who make out their.own returns do so in ignorance of the law of the land. It is time that that ignorance was dispelled. The bill deals with two matters. First, it deals with certain reductions of income tax, and for those reductions, I suppose, most of us are grateful. In addition, it deals with other matters in respect of which, 1 suspect, some of us are not so grateful. Most members of the Opposition believe that under this measure which, consisting of 38 clauses, amends the principal act consisting of between 200 and 300 sections, the reductions of tax proposed are not sufficient. We say that the rates are too high notwithstanding the concessions which, the Government now proposes. On the other matters to which I shall now refer, we are still less satisfied. In particular we direct attention to a certain point of view which pervades this legislation. I am glad that the Primu Minister and Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) is now present, because I believe that he should hear the remarks I am about to make. One thing to which we object in all these matters of taxation is what I might describe as tlie official point of view. I am a believer in the rectitude, uprightness and, by and large, the efficiency of our publie servants. I believe that most government servants occupy their positions on their merits, and serve the country to the best of their ability; but nobody Very few people who has had experience of governments and the operations of government instrumentalities can deny that there does tend"" to creep into the activities and. point of view of those who purport to serve the people an official attitude. Those officials cease to be human beings and individuals in the way we are, and cease to think in terms of what is best for ordinary individuals. They inevitably think of things from a detached, cold-blooded and, sometimes, ruthless point of view. point of view is plain, down-right ruthlessness. I shall give a good illustration of what I mean. I do not wish to be thought uncharitable. I have in my profession worked with hundreds of government officers for many years, and many of them are my personal friends. I pay tribute to them for the work they try to do; but somehow or other any one who works for the government tends to get out of touch with the ordinary citizen. That is demonstrated by a number of provisions in this bill. Section 44 (1) of the principal act provides that the assessable income of a shareholder in a company shall, if he is a resident, include dividends paid to him by the company out of profits derived by it from any source. Then in the memorandum in black type, indicating the words proposed to be inserted .in the principal act, we read1. (a) The operation of the last three preceding sub-sections shall not be affected by tlie provisions .of paragraph [g) of section 23 of this act.. We need not worry what paragraph q says, but I draw attention -to, the comment which is added at the instance and instigation of the deparmental officers-the",50,Cameron Tha T £50 Was Allowed For Each Dependent Child

It has been said by the Ministerf or Post-war Reconstruction that it is impossible to have simplicity in income tax legislation. ""With respect to the Minister, I describe that statement as the most arrant rubbish I have ever heard in this Parliament. I direct attention to the great Finance Act passed by the British Parliament in 1920 under which all income tax is now collected in Great Britain. There is a piece of legislation which the draftsmen-of the bill now before us might very well examine. It may be true that many citizens of Great Britain would refer to the British act.as a complicated piece of legislation; but compared with the bill arid act now lief ore us it is a model i.f simplicity. When the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction save that it is not possible to have a greater degree of simplicity in income legislation I do not know whether he is ignorant or cynical. his statement is completely false. In the bill now before us there has been no attempt at simplicity, and in dealing with it Government spokesmen have made no attempt to deal with the question of deductions on the one hand as against rebates on the other. The Ministerf o r Post-war Reconstruction attempted to defend the rebate system and, in the teeth of all the facts, suggested , that this warm-hearted Government, out of its sympathy and loving desire tp help the taxpayers of Australia, had really adopted the rebate system because it was kinder and easier on the taxpayer than was the deduction system.

I remind the House that that was done without a single change being made in the law. The Commissioner of Taxation completely reversed his former opinion. Not only did he do that, for he also took a different view from that taken by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Finance Act 1920, passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, specifically exempts scholarship money from tax. In committee I propose to move an amendment for the inclus'ion of a similar provision in the Income Tax Assessment Bill. Even before that provision was put into the United Kingdom law, scholarship money was exempt from tax. Let us now see how this decision of the Australian Commissioner operates. The Gowrie scholarship, which enables an Australian student to study at an English University, is worth £475 a year. The tax is no less than £126. The exchange of £87 further reduces to £262 a year the money that the student has to live on for three years while studying at Oxford or Cambridge or whatever other English university he chooses. That is what this Labour Government, which professes' a belief in education, really thinks of it. I remind the House that all sorts of representations ""were made to the Government, but it would not budge. In addition, students have to pay their own travelling expenses. Every other British dominion pays the' fares of scholarship students travelling overseas, but to its eternal shame Australia does not. Representations made to the Government over the last ten years have failed to move it. One Sydney University scholarship is worth £375; but when tax and exchange are deducted the unfortunate student is left with only £180 a. year to live on. From that he has to provide himself with food and lodging, clothing, and books and pay lecture fees and fares. The Government which purports to believe in education has resisted every representation made to it to lift the burden of taxation from these young men and llr. Beale. women. I am glad that the Treasurer is present because 1 direct his attention to the fact that sons and daughters of wealthy people are not the. sufferers from this policy, because their parents can afford to help them. I know that several honourable gentlemen opposite sympathize with my views because they know that the sons and daughters of the poor are the sufferers. The son or daughter of a poor man who is so brilliant scholasticallyperhaps a genius-as to win a scholarship at a university abroad, often has to refuse Section 3S of the if because of the impossibility of living on £180 a year. I know that from experience. What sort of a Labour government is it that tolerates that state of affairs. A tax on learning is' the worse thing that can be done in a democracy. If you deprive democracy of learning, you deprive it of its very life-blood and, in the end. it will perish. But the matter does not end here. What about the anomalies of this extraordinary situation? I shall enumerate to the House two or three things which result, from the attitude of tlie Government. The Treasurer knows what I am talking about, because many of these cases have been represented to him again and again. I have before me files of papers whicli have been submitted to me on this subject. Many other honourable members are aware of the anomalies that are revealed in them. I .remind the House that none of these injustices occurred before 1941 and .that there has been no change in legislation which would justify any change of attitude by the Taxation' Commissioner. I suppose that all that happened was that the Commissioner and his officials were looking for more money and thought, "" This is a push-over"", and decided to tax these amounts at the source. An extraordinary thing is that, in the cases of several scholarships, such as the Nuffield, Carnegie, and. Rockefeller, which, oddly enough, are tenable in America, the Government has conceded the i^rinciple which I espouse and, by reason of one adjustment or another, taxes are not levied upon them. In the case of Rhodes scholarships also, where a recipient can prove that he is no longer resident in Australia, he is not liable to tax. In other words, if a Rhodes seno'lai happens to be married, and if he takes his wife abroad with him and does not ' indicate to anybody that he will ever return to Australia, the Taxation Commissioner kindly says to him, "" You are not liable to taxation"", and collects nothing'from him. However, if a Rhodes scholar happens to be married or to have a family in Australia, or if he says inadover Australia is, in fact, not, worth very vertently that he intends to return to Australia some day, thus making himself an Australian only temporarily resident, overseas, the Taxation Commissioner insists upon his pound of flesh and taxes him ihere. Another anomaly is that, if these sums are -granted to students as lump sums for a whole period, the Commissioner does not tax them, whereas, if they are granted to students in periodic payments from year to year, they are taxed. That is inexplicable to me. It seems 'that the Commissioner says to the University concerned, the Gowrie Trust, the Lucas Tooth Trust, or whatever trust it may be-ther e are dozens of them"" Give us the money "", whether it be £S0, £120 or £200, and these authorities are bound to disgorge. In that event, the scholarship-bolder never gets the money at all. The reason -why this should be so, whilst lump sums are not touched, is unknown to me or to any of the trustees. Another disadvantage and anomaly is that these demands are made at the source. They are made from the trustees or from the universities, with the unfortunate result that nobody has any right of appeal. A university has no right of appeal, because it is not being deprived of anything. The scholarship holder has no right of appeal, because his only right is against the university, not against the Taxation Commissioner In practice, it is extremely difficult to have these matters not be made "". In all of these files that challenged at law. This is an important fact, because it is the opinion of better legal minds, than mine that these deductions are illegal and are not justifiable under the income tax law as it stands. Still another anomaly is that under various forms of pressure, the Taxation Commissioner has, in fact, allowed deductions for expenses by way of books, lectures, and matters of that sort, but, he will not allow any deductions for boardi and lodging. As everybody who has any experience of scholarships abroad must know, board and lodging amount to nine-tenths of the expenses of a scholarship. Therefore, the slight concession which the Commissioner has been forced to make as the result of years of pressure brought to bear upon the Treasurer and his officers hy trustees all much. Perhaps the most anomalous thing of all is that the Taxation Commissioner taxes a scholarship holder not upon the basis of income derived from property, but upon the basis of income derived from personal exertion. It does not require a lawyer to point out that, whatever else these sums may be derived from, they are not derived from personal exertion. We on this side of the House, and some of the best legal minds in Australia, say that, these sums are not income at all, but allowances, and therefore that they should not be taxable. We believe that, if the opportunity were afforded to the unfortunate recipients, they could challenge the Taxation 'Commissioner's decision successfully in the High Court. Whether that be so or not, the fact is that these amounts are certainly not income derived from personal exertion. WeverthelesSj no doubt because he has a guilty conscience, the Commissioner taxes the recipients upon the basis of income derived from personal exertion. The reasons given for this action have been various. The Treasurer, in his inimitable way gives no reason He. 3 merely waves our claims aside, and says ""No"". The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, is perhaps not so wise. He purports to give a reason. He says-f-and I quote his word's-^"" There are weighty considerations why this concession should I have here-ther e are perhaps 70' pages' of them-h e has never given to any of these persons who have giveii information to me any real reasons, weighty dr otherwise,, why these concessions should not be granted. He merely says, "" There are weighty considerations'"". He says' that, if he did as-1 suggest, he would create a precedent for somebody else. What has precedent to do with it ? I s not this the simple issue: Does, Australia want the cream of its manhood and womanhood to gut the benefit of rhe world's knowledge, information and culture? want the best people in this country, the young people, to go abroad and get the best of the world's knowledge and come brick and use it in the service of Australia? If so, then precedent has nothing to do with the matter, and the exemption must be granted, as has always been done iu Great Britain, and as was done in Australia prior to 1941. If you tax learning you ""starve Australia-no t in a physical sense, because nobody will get Is. a week less in the 'basic wage, but in the most important sense of all, you starve this country because you deprive it 'of knowledge, and without knowledge this country will truly perish in the long run. In the committee stage, I propose to .move an amendment along the lines of section 2S of the British act. I am well aware, from personal knowledge, that several honourable tnembers on the Government side of the chamber will agree with what I have said, and I hope that, in committee, they will have the courage to stand up and, once and for all, strike a true blow for education in Australia.

In addition, assessments, it was the speech made by I hope that, it w ill touch h i m in a differ'the Minister to-night. stantly with two sets of figures which Does it have no possible basis of comparison, as the honourable member for Barker( Mr. Archie Cameron) pointed out. When this matter was before the House in 1944, there was a great deal of argument concerning the case of a man supporting three children and earning £500 a year. On that occasion, Government supporters argued there would be a considerable gain for the taxpayer under the rebate system as opposed to the concession system. I was not satisfied with the figures which had been adduced up to that point, nor with the basis of argument, so I approached the Treasury officials and obtained certain figures from them. I found that a man, in receipt of £500 a year, with a wife and three children, had a gross tax liability, under the terms of the bill then before the House, allowing the same basis of exemptions and the same rates of tax, of £136 1.3s. He would receive a rebate of £72 16s., and therefore his net tax would be £63 17s. I asked the officials whether they would, on the same basis, compute the. figures under the deduction system, and I found then that his net liability would be only about £40 a ENI D LYONS (Darwin) year or nearly £24 loss than under the I believe has so much he will be prepared I return now to the matter which I menattend to rny suggestion and tioned earlier. Under present conditions, amendment women employed in industry are allowed He dealt conent way from that i u which it touched' me; that is to say, in the colloquial sense of the word. My correspondent, who is a school teacher, is a widow and supports two children She points out that a ' young man on her classification draws a larger salary than she does. If he has a wife and one child, or two dependants, the number which she herself maintains, the young male teacher pays lesstax than she does. She writesI pay as much rent as he does. I presume my children eat as much as his child does. Where, then, are our laws of equality and fairness whicli are so much boasted about by our Ministers? I commend that suggestion to the Treasurer. I feel sure that, with his generous spirit and his love of fair play, he will give to this matter a great deal of consideration. I hope that, before this bill is passed, the right honourable gentleman, in response to this appeal on behalf of the women of Australia, will submit an amendment to give effect to my suggestion. Minister and Treasurer) [10.24] -in replyI do not propose to examine at great length many of the suggestions that have been offered in this debate. The Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) has submitted an amendment which is designed to make the proposed reduction of tax retrospective to the 1st January, 1947. ment will have to be moved to the Income Tax Bill. gentleman proposed that the. reductions of tax should operate from the 1st January, 1947. One matter which all honourable members must bear in mind is that it becomes increasingly important that the finances of the country shall be kept on an even keel, and that expenditure of every kind shall be met as far as possible from taxation. I am not too sure that the proposed reductions of tax are not overgenerous. I believe that I am erring on the side of generosity. I have tried to look at prospective budget figures, not only for 1947-48, but as far ahead as 1950. Certain commitments will accrue in future which are not recurring expenditure, such as the payment of war gratuities, and I am not too sure that in the period up to 1950 taxation should not be retained at such a scale as to provide reserves to meet those contingencies and commitments. It is more than possible, if one heeds the warnings of those best qualified to speak on the subject, that there may be some recessionary movement, particularly in the United States of America, within the next two or three years, or even earlier. I like to believe that while I am Commonwealth Treasurer, and acting in that capacity as the agent of the Government, the Commonwealth will always be prepared to face some measure of recession. .1 am not attempting to predict the extent of, such a recession, but it is generally considered that some recession will occur at least within the next couple of years. After six years of war, and the ensuing transition period to peace-time conditions, the Government has tried, by its taxation policy, to ensure that expenditure shall have some reasonable relationship to income. It is for that reason, and no other, that I consider that no justification exists for the adoption of any course other than which we have followed, but at the same time. I feel some doubt as to whether the very extensive concessions which are proposed should be made. As honourable members are aware, between 75 per cent, and 80 per cent, of the taxpayers in receipt of incomes less than £800 a year will pay only one-half of the amount of tax. that they paid when taxes were at their peak during the war-time period. That is -a very substantial concession. ""No honourable member can, with justification, deny that. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) endeavoured to picture me as being a financial conjurer, who granted remissions of one form of tax amounting to £18,000,000 or £30,000,000 but recovered that concession in some mysterious way by the imposition of some other tax. sales tax. during this debate, to digress by engaging in a discussion of sales tax. However, the view expressed by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) completely contradicts the contentions of some members of the Opposition that Australia is",54,Cameron Tha T £50 Was Allowed For Each Dependent Child

195,Mr Chifley,"I am not permitted,suffering to-day from economic stagnation. When debating this bill they have declared that the incomes of companies and individual taxpayers are most buoyant, and that even my optimistic prophesies -were an under-'estamatibn of receipts from taxation. I have pointed out that Australia is enjoying a period of full employment and that industry is booming. . Industrial and commercial buoyancy is very great. Despite the Story which some in embers of the Opposition have told, this buoyancy has revenue. When that position has been clear, the 'Government decided to grant substantial' remissions of income tax. That brings lis to cold, hard facts. The honourable member for Fawkner indicated that in the aggregate taxation was greater than ever it was before. He Overlooked the fact that the average citizen is not concerned with aggregate taxation. The average citizen is not, interested in what the whole of the community pays; his Sole interest is in what he pays. Accordingly, I shall bring the honourable rnembe'r for Fawkner right down to earth. A's members of Parliament receive an allowance of £1,000 a year, I propose to examine the case of a man in receipt of that income, because it will bring home tbe facts to a very sensitive nerve iii the human constitution-the ""hip-,pocket nerve"". Under the peak rates of 'tax in war-time, a married man with a dependent wife and two children, in receipt of £1,000 per annum, paid £2S'5 4s. Under the proposed rates he will pay £159 18s. That is a concrete instance that the average taxpayer understands. ""applies also to .persons on the lower ranges of income. A man with a dependent wife and two children, in receipt of £350 a year, will not pay any tax after the 1st July next. At present, he pays £5 5s. That compares with £13 which a taxpayer in similar circumstances pays in the United Kingdom, and £26 5s. in New Zealand. That is a. complete reply to the statement of the honourable member for Fawkner, when he complained of the heavy tax burden borne by Australians, compared with that borne by taxpayers in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. At the same time, I agree that rates of tax on the larger incomes in Australia a re 'high. Mr Chifley. The honourable member for Fawkner stated that indirect taxation in Australia was very high. I inform him that indirect taxes which Australians pay are less than those which the people of the United Kingdom and New Zealand pay. One honourable member asked me to supply the figures for the Dominion of Canada. I am not able to do that very well, because taxation conditions in Australia are not comparable with those in that dominion. Australia, the .United produced additional Kingdom and New Zealand have a single taxing authority, but in Canada a number of provincial taxes are imposed. Incidentally, in the United States of America, different taxes are levied in the various States. However, T shall circulate among honourable members a schedule showing the position. In Australia, indirect taxation is £22.9'5 per capita. In New Zealand, the figure is £27 and in the United Kingdom nearly £42 a head of the population. Those are cold hard facts. They reveal that in indirect taxes the Australian public pays less than the people of New Zealand or the United Kingdom. The honourable member for Parraniafcta ( Mr Beale) advocated that expenditure on education should be allowed as a deduction for income tax purposes. I point out that the Labour Government has granted greater assistance to education than all its predecessors. Out of taxation revenue, we expend £16,000,000 P'T annum for the purpose of assisting education. A considerable proportion of that money is devoted to paying subsidies This to the sons and daughters of persons whose financial circumstances do not enable them to send their children to a university. This assistance to boys and girls of parents in comparatively poor .circumstances has not been granted by any previous Commonwealth government. I remind honourable 'members of the old saying, "" Good wine needs no bush "". Remissions of tax amounting to £34,000,000 a year and reducing 'by one-half the war-time payments of tax of 75 per cent, of the taxpayers, do not require any defence. I was called upon in this House to defend increases of tax a few years ago, hut now I consider that, in justice, honourable members should congra'rula'te me on having granted these remissions. I realize that criticism of the Government's measures, whether they be good or bad, is a prerogative of the Opposition. I presume that that policy has been adopted on this occasion. The rebate system has been discussed by several honourable gentlemen opposite. The Leader of the Australian Country party had a good deal to say about it. Whether or not he was logical, he certainly was very persistent in his advocacy of the concessional deduction system in preference to the rebate system. If the same concessions were given under the one as are now given under the other, the figure of £150 or £100 that has been mentioned would probably have to be halved. I believe that even the Leader of the Australian Country party would find that, psychologically, that would be difficult to explain to taxpayers. I have explained to the House previously how the rebate system came into operation. A special committee, consisting of an independent chairman, Professor Mills, the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr and indirect taxes. Scullin), and the former member for Robertson, Mr Spooner, examined all the concessions and exemptions in the different States, and decided that the most equitable way of dealing with the subject was to give concessions in the form of rebates rather than as exemptions. I do not think it is very difficult for honourable members to realize that a man with an income of £5,000 a year who pays income tax at the rate of 16s. in the £1 would have his tax reduced by '£120, whereas, a man on the lowest range of income would have his tax reduced by -only £1S 17s. 6d., if each were granted an exemption of £150 for his wife. It is quite evident that there would have to be a drastic limitation of the application of the exemption system, otherwise the man with the high income would obtain a tremendous advantage, and .practically nothing would be gained by the man on the lowest range of income. As a matter of fact, a man with a wife and two children whose income is £300 a year will not pay income tax under the proposed rates. That will give to men who have family responsibilities a concession' which, in all the circumstances, I consider is completely warranted. When I issue the scales and the schedule, they will certainly te given to the press, but. I do not anticipate that they will be published. Members of both the Opposition and my own party will be able to see in cold black and white a complete contradiction of the statements that have been made from time to .time by the honourable member for Fawkner. The Government has faithfully kept the promise that when circumstances permitted both direct and indirect taxes would be reduced. The honourable member for Fawkner tried last week to convince the House that, an act of wizardry had been performed, in that £30,000,000 which had been given away had immediately returned to the Treasury. I repeat, for the benefit of the honourable member, that members of the general public are not at all interested.in the aggregate amount of taxation that is paid by the community as a whole. Their sole interest is in what is paid individually. Mr HO:LT I referred to both direct honourable gentleman's appeal, I have had figures prepared showing what the direct taxation is in New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Australia. They show that a man with a wife and two children whose income is £1,000 a year paid at peak war-time rates an income tax of £285 4s. Under the new scale, he will pay £159 13s. The proposed rates are, if anything, over-generous. Nevertheless, the Government is prepared to take same risk, in the belief that its policy of maintaining full employment in this country will continue to produce that buoyancy which the Leader of the Australian Country party said was evidenced in the increased revenue derived from direct and indirect taxes, particularly the latter. The o l.Y l test of prosperity n r e a in a country is the employment of everybody who wants to be employed and earning money. That that state of affairs exists is proved entirely by the figures which members of the Opposition have cited with a view to illustrating that the returns have exceeded my estimates. We are confident that that position can be maintained. Should our expectations be realized, the Government will be prepared to be, perhaps, even more generous.",58,Cameron Tha T £50 Was Allowed For Each Dependent Child
196,Mr Chifley,"In response to the right word to use ? look ahead to 1950, and to anticipate what w ill happen year after year. The Government is adopting a long-sighted, not a short-sighted, policy. It w ill leave in the financial history of this country an almost phenomenal record of a practically balanced budget, after six years of economic travail, and the transition fro m war to peace-time conditions.

201,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Leade r ofA few days ago I asked questions of the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs in these terms1. la it a fact that a number of public servants returning tn Australia from duty in the United States of America have been accusidinod to bring with them baggage classified as personal luggage which sometimes weighed up to several tons and on which the Government piiid the freight charges? 2. If so, what arc the names of the ollicials cniiuurncd whose personal luggage weighed one run or more: in what departments were they employed; what was the weight of their individual luggage, and was it declared to the customs authorities on landing here? 3. What sum iu the aggregate has been paid by the Government or has been authorized to In: paid by the Government in freight bo bring r-iich personal luggage to Australia from 1944 up tn the present? 4. What, were the facts that would justif y I lie bi nding of such an extraordinary amount HI' personal luggage? t expected that those questions would have been answered quite easily by the Department of Trade and Customs because there arc not a great number of public servants returning to Australia from abroad, and it should have been easy to ascertain who the public servants concerned were and the date of their return to Australia. That information could have been obtained simply by referring to ships' manifests, which show the a mount of luggage carried for each individual. The freight paid by the Comm'onwcalth in each case should have been readily available. But consider the answer given by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard), who saidI have consulted the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Courtice) who has informed me that a special record of the transactions to which the honourable member referred is not kept by the Department of Trade and Customs. To obtain the information required would involve a lengthy investigation in each State of the Commonwealth, and this, the Minister advised, could not he justified in existing circumstances with the department heavily 'understaffed. If , however, the honourable member will give a reference to the case or eases whicli he has particularly in mind the Minister will obtain and supply him with the details sought. If that is not an obvious evasion of the ones tion I should like to know what is! The Department is saying in effect: "" What does the honourable member for Wentworth know with regard to the3e matters, because unless he gives us specific cases we are not prepared to obtain any information which he desires in this regard. If he has not got that information we do not propose to go any deeper into it ; we propose to keep it a close secret."" The general public has a right to know whether these charges are wellfounded. I shall give the Minister information in regard to three specific cases. For obvious reasons I shall not give the names of the officers concerned, but 1 shall give the names of the vessels on which they travelled.

On these goods £46 18s. 6d. was paid in freight out of Commonwealth funds. department. In May, 1946, Whistler carried another officer of the Division of Import Procurement, who brought with him seven cases of luggage, freight on which was paid out of Commonwealth funds in New York. I come now to a more recent case relating to bill of lading No. 1009, Melbourne. The vessel is City of Capetown, which arrived in Sydney on the 80th April from New York. . The vessel carried sixteen pieces of personal luggage, the property of an official employed on behalf of the Commonwealth in Washington, United States of America. The cubic content of the luggage was 7 tons, and its dead weight If tons. The freight payable by the Commonwealth on these goods is £92 4s. 9d. The authenticity of the information that I have given in regard to these three cases can be ascertained readily from the Department of Trade and Customs. I should like to know how many officials have been' allowed to return to this country carrying luggage exceeding 1 ton in weight, how much the Commonwealth has been called upon to pay in freight on such luggage, whether the contents were declared; if so, what they were, and what was the justification for officials carrying such large quantities of luggage at the expense of the Commonwealth?",61,Adjournment Commonwealt H Literary Fun

The Minister's reply to my question was most evasive. He said, in effect, "" We shall call the honourable member's bluff. We shall see whether :he knows anything, or whether this is a stab in the dark. If he does not know anything, we shall just forget about tbe matter, but if he .has some information we shall 'find out just what it is''. I have given portion of the information that is in my possession. I shall not show my f u l l hand until I receive some answer from the department itself. support the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison). I realize that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) who represents the Minister for Trade and Customsi n this chamber, is at a disadvantage. This emphasizes the point that I have made on several occasions that the Minister for Trade and Customs should be a member of this chamber. The honourable member for Wentworth believes that preferential treatment has been given to Gertain officials. He put certain reasonable questions on the notice-paper and received an evasive' reply. He has now given specific instances of what he says is taking place, and I believe that the Government should make available to him the information that he seeks. The treatment of Ministers, members of Parliament, and the general public by the Department of Trade and Customs should be impartial. If it is not, both the Government and the department are suspect-. There is no need for this suspicion, and I am quite sure that the Government does not desire it. It is only a matter of asking for the information required. All the entries have been made and the records should be readily available. Eor the good name of the Department, the information should be forthcoming. Commerce and Agiuculture) [11.7.'] -The honourable member .for Wentworth -( Mr Harrison) has been morespecific to-night in regard to' a question that he asked some days ago, and the information that he has now furnished may make it possible for the Minister for Trade and Customs to be more specific in regard to the prospect of furnishing the answers. It must be obvious to the honourable member for Wentworth however, that for a number of years visits abroad by officials of various government departments have been numerous. Many of these officers have been in residence overseas for considerable periods. Some of them may have married overseas, and it is natural to assume that in furnishing their homes they would have acquired a large quantity of personal belongings which they would bring to this country upon their return. I am sure that, no honor' able .member would refuse them that right. that, nor do I make any charges in regard to that aspect of the matter. ; what the honourable member has been referring to. official who has been overseas 'for some years would hardly be expected to come home with only a pair of scanties. However, I shall be glad to confer with the Minister of Trade and Customs and to ascertain whether in view of the additional information that the honourable member has supplied, further light can be thrown on this matter. I rather resent the honourable member's imputation that the Minister for Trade and Customs in answering his questions adopted the attitude that he would call the honourable member's bluff. I assure the honourable member that every charge that has been made in this Parliament during the administration of this Government has been investigated fully with the object of sheeting home the blame to those who may have been implicated.

In the determination of rates of duty, due consideration must be given to a number of factors, including the kind or class of commodity under notice. In some cases a fixed rate is suitable and in others an ad valorem rate. Many rates provided in the Tariff Schedule are composite; that is, they comprise both a fixed rate and an ad valorem rate. Other rates are alternative; that is, a fixed rate or an ad valorem rate, whichever yield; the higher or lower duty.
