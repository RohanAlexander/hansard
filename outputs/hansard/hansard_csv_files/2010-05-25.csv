That was a rally in support of a Rosebud aquatic centre, a southern peninsula aquatic centre. It is a project to which the local community has been committed for some years. It is a project which is a personal passion, a commitment, a goal and something which will be achieved. The benefits of this project are very clear. It will, firstly, provide health benefits, whether it is for local youth, whether it is for families, whether it is in terms of safety and teaching young children to swim in a safe environment so as to equip them for a coastal environment. In particular, in what is demographically the oldest electorate in Victoria with the highest concentration of seniors along that stretch of the Mornington Peninsulawhich is Dromana, McCrae, Rosebud, Tootgarook and Rye-it will provide hydrotherapy and services which are desperately needed by senior citizens. So the benefits, firstly, in health are clear. Secondly, there are the economic benefits to the community of having an aquatic centre which will help with tourism throughout winter and which will help ensure that the peninsula is an all-year-round destination for families. Thirdly, it is about the amenity, the quality of life, for the southern peninsula. So those benefits are clear and real and desirable. The challenge is the delay in support from the Victorian government. For some years now the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment has been aware of and has stood in the way of this project. This project is wanted on the foreshore by the overwhelming majority of local residents-I say ‘by the overwhelming majority’ because there are a small number who take a different view, and I deeply respect their views and their right to those views. But the overwhelming majority want to use land which is already built upon, or land which is already disturbed. Indeed, the old pool was on the foreshore. It was not immediately on the foreshore. It is a deep foreshore. It was back about 50 to 70 metres from the foreshore. That same strip of land remains available, whether it is there or whether it is further towards the village centre. Either way, that land has been disturbed for many years. It is not pristine. It awaits some sort of community benefit. I urge the Victorian Premier to step in and say, ‘We recognise that the community have been disadvantaged, that they deserve the aquatic centre,’ and that the state government will no longer stand in the way of the efforts of the local community to take control of their own future, to establish an aquatic centre and to give themselves a healthy future. Lidcombe Car Bombing Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (4.12 pm)-I was appalled to see recent TV images of an attack on the Sydney offices of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union. I know the secretary of the union personally and many who work in their building at Lidcombe, and I appreciate at a personal level the seriousness of the crime committed. Interestingly, specific threats were made before this unprecedented firebombing of a union’s premises. The attack occurred around 10.30 pm on a weeknight, when a stolen car packed with drums of petrol was MAIN COMMITTEE",112,Adjournment Financially Unfit At The Beginning Of This Year

210,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (4.09 Pm),"Just over a year ago I attended a rally on the Rosebudrammed through the front door of the offices. The foyer area of the building was soaked in petrol before being set alight. That evening I saw footage of emergency workers putting themselves at great risk, unaware of the petrol drums in the car. It was indeed a miracle that no-one was killed. Two community groups had left the building less than an hour before and among the participants were children. On any day, as I know, there would have been dozens of people at risk in that building. These kinds of attacks are totally unacceptable in our democratic society. Unions are but one of the many groups in our community who stand up for the rights of people and against those who have the power to inflict injustice on them. The perpetrators of this well-organised and well-planned attack need to be brought to justice swiftly. We need organisations like unions, churches and migrant advocacy groups to be able to do their work free from the threats of violence and criminal behaviour. All people must respect the rule of law and appreciate the inherent values of our democratic system. I wholeheartedly support the call of Unions NSW for a special police task force to investigate the bombing-hopefully one that has the resources to catch the criminals. I am pleased to read that this request for the police task force was backed by the Master Builders Association, the employer body, and by members of the Maori, Jewish, Arab, migrant and Christian communities that regularly use the building for community events. The condemnation of this unprecedented and vicious attack transcends politics. It is an attack on the very fabric of our society. This is a frightening situation. The mere allegations of wrongdoing get an immediate response from the ABCC when those allegations are directed at unions and their officials. But when violence is perpetrated by opponents of unions we hear not a murmur of disquiet from the ABCC. That is clearly unacceptable. In addition to the police investigation of criminal matters, I believe it is incumbent upon the people who work at the ABCC to conduct a thorough investigation at the earliest possible opportunity. It is totally unacceptable in our society for any employer to intimidate, harass or threaten union officials or their staff for carrying out their responsibilities on behalf of working people. Swan Electorate: Solar Flagships Program disappointment that has come from the Rudd government. In another blow to my state Western Australia and my electorate, the Rudd government has not short-listed one WA project as part of the $1.5 billion Solar Flagships Program. Eight worthwhile projects were submitted from WA, with some support from the Western Australian state government, yet all of them have been ignored at the expense of Eastern States’ projects. Members will not be surprised to hear that five projects from Queensland have been short-listed but none from WA. This is becoming an all-too-familiar pattern for Western Australia from one of the most eastern-centric federal governments in history. Under Rudd, Western Australia is getting a scandalously low proportion of GST-68c in the dollar-and is being ignored on issue after issue, from aircraft noise to river wall infrastructure and roads. And now, after announcing plans to introduce a resource rent tax that has sent WA superannuation accounts tumbling and threatens the jobs of Australians, Kevin Rudd has ignored eight decent submissions, any one of which would have created jobs for local people in Western Australia and in my electorate of Swan. What makes this decision more difficult to understand is the commentary from experts suggesting that Western Australia is one of the best spots in the country for solar projects. MAIN COMMITTEE",114,Constituency Statements
211,Mr Irons (Swan) (4.15 Pm),"I wish to raise with the House the latest renewable energyKyle Jackson, who visited my office earlier in the month, is an architect for the Perenjori Solar Thermal Project, which was not short-listed. He is quoted as saying: … solar radiation in WA is at least 10 per cent better than in Queensland, and the higher pool price for energy in WA, along with capacity credits, means they would also have had a cost advantage over rival offers. Yet five projects have been short-listed for Queensland and, again, none for Western Australia. The Solar Flagships Program has been a poorly executed scheme from the start. Yesterday, the Australian Financial Review noted the lack of preparatory work done by the government. It stated: Having announced solar flagships in the budget, the government then paid the Boston Consulting Group more than $1 million to work out how the program should operate in practice. After hearing concerns from the industry and state governments that the $1.5 billion committed would be insufficient to support the development of 1,000MW of solar power, BCG proposed major revisions, most of which watered down the ambition of the Government’s original vision. It has been run in a similar vein to the recently rushed announcement of the renewable energy future fund. The Australian newspaper summed up the typical reaction to this program as, ‘We don’t know what it is but we’re aiming to get a slice of it.’ Does that sound familiar? Concerns about this scheme have been raised directly with my office. I am troubled by the federal government’s poor overall approach and commitment to renewable energy. Almost $3 billion was spent on the failed pink batts scheme, a scheme that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a fractional amount. I urge the government to consider our long-term energy needs and condemn the government for again ignoring Western Australia to the benefit of Queensland. Hindmarsh Electorate: On the Same Wave Program done by Surf Life Saving clubs in my electorate of Hindmarsh, and the importance of the new Surf Central project to Surf Life Saving clubs right around South Australia. Hindmarsh is home to six different surf life saving clubs, which work all year round to provide beach patrols, rescue, first aid, fitness and fun to a wide section of the community and beach goers. Many of the clubs in my electorate participate in the On the Same Wave program, a fantastic joint initiative of Surf Life Saving Australia and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. The program encourages children from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds as well as from Indigenous backgrounds to get involved with surf life saving. Semaphore Surf Life Saving Club at the northern end of my electorate recently held a day-long program as part of On the Same Wave, which gave kids who might not otherwise have been confident enough to have a go the chance to do so in a supportive environment. At Grange Surf Life Saving Club they are currently in the third year of running a disability program, working with Interchange, an organisation that provides community based recreational respite care for kids with disabilities. It is great to hear that two of the kids who participated under the Interchange program have now joined the club and have made the transition to becoming nippers. An incident at Henley Beach at the end of last year catapulted four nippers from Henley Beach Surf Life Saving Club into the limelight. The boys, who were all aged about nine or 10 at the time, helped rescue a woman they saw drowning off Henley Beach. Even though they had not yet officially started learning surf life saving skills, the boys thought quickly and three MAIN COMMITTEE",115,Constituency Statements

The woman was saved and the story was featured everywhere from ABC Television to the Sydney Morning Herald, the Adelaide Advertiser and the local Messenger newspaper. It is exactly this type of story that reinforces the importance of surf life savers and the importance of providing support for the organisations that dedicate themselves to it. West Beach Surf Life Saving Club has been working with the Service to Youth Council to train at-risk youths for their Bronze Medallion. Last week the Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club hosted all the surf life saving Senior State Championship events, including sprints, flags and relays, at Glenelg Beach on a Friday night. I am delighted to hear that it was deemed so successful it will be done again in 2011. Finally, at the southern end of my electorate, Somerton Surf Life Saving Club hosted the Junior State Championships, which had more than 950 competitors and thousands of spectators over the two days of competition. The contribution of surf life savers is enormous. That is why I have recently been working with Surf Life Saving South Australia to secure funding for their Surf Central project, which will provide much-needed administrative training and infrastructure support to surf life saving clubs all around South Australia. I have recently written to the Minister for Sport, Kate Ellis, regarding the importance of the project, and I look forward to hearing back from her soon regarding funding opportunities for Surf Life Saving South Australia so that they are able to continue their, quite literally, life saving work. I also hope that all Australians will continue to support surf life saving activities, as the clubs truly are the lifeblood of our coastal communities. Congratulations to all the surf life saving clubs in Hindmarsh. I wish them all a successful winter season in the lead-up to next summer. Rudd Government ises, the one that most reaches into the pockets of every Australian is the Prime Minister’s failure to put downward pressure on the cost of living. At the 2007 election Mr Rudd led Australians to believe that he could lower the price of groceries and that the cost of petrol would be lower because of his leadership. Well, Prime Minister, I am not sure if you were speaking in the heat of the moment, but I do know that you are not speaking the gospel truth to any ordinary Australians. In the eyes of many North Coast residents your failure to deliver on the cost-of-living promise is one of the greatest ‘immoral’ challenges of our time. Your ETS was set to drive up the cost of living and the cost of everything we buy, and force pensioners and low-income earners to go without the basic necessities of life. It was the greatest moral challenge of our time, you said. You quickly abandoned that promise when people started to wise up to the impacts of your ETS. Federal and state Labor governments wanted to increase the price of electricity by 64 per cent over the next three years, largely as a result of your ETS. Fortunately, the Prime Minister has temporarily shelved that ETS. But the voters are not silly. They are all too aware that this great big new tax is just on hold-a great big new tax that will drive up the cost of everything you buy. So next time the Prime Minister visits the North Coast of New South Wales he should reject the compulsion to pose for a photo opportunity. He should get down on the street and see how increases in the cost of living are affecting everyday Australians and how it is putting pressure on household budgets. He should MAIN COMMITTEE",116,Constituency Statements
213,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (4.21 Pm),"Of all the Rudd government’s broken promspeak to low-income earners and pensioners and see the impact his policies and his failure to act on his promises is having on them. The government has insulted pensioners who have participated in the solar roofs program. We have seen the government penny-pinching in this regard by reducing their pension if they are paid any money for electricity generated as a result of the installation of solar panels. The government encouraged people to install solar panels and then treated them with contempt by reducing their pension if they received any financial benefit through cash payments as a result of this program. It is absolutely outrageous that local pensioners should be hit by the government-a government that promised to put downward pressure on the cost of living, a government whose promises now seem to be all too hollow. It is absolutely outrageous that a pensioner who receives a cash payment as a result of a very substantial investment in our green future should be penalised. It is an absolutely outrageous situation and just shows that this Prime Minister cannot be trusted. Lindsay Electorate: Mr Kevin Dwyer OAM the official naming of Kevin Dwyer Park at Roper Road in Colyton. Kevin Dwyer OAM was one of the fathers of modern Penrith City. He passed away on 15 December 2004. The naming of this park was an important occasion, not only for the family of Kevin Dwyer but for the entire St Marys and Penrith community. Kevin served as an independent alderman and councillor for 22 years on the Penrith City Council, between 1977 and 1999. Over those two decades, Kevin was elected mayor three times and deputy mayor 12 times-a record of service that is arguably one of the most impressive in Penrith’s history. Kevin’s history in our area went back further than just his time on council. He was a descendant of James McCarthy, who settled in what is now known as Cranebrook in the late 1700s. As an East Ward councillor, Kevin was passionate about growing and supporting the community and building a sense of belonging. He was part and parcel of the St Marys community. Moving there with his wife Margaret in 1968, Kevin went on to become a member of many of the great community institutions that have come to form the fabric of St Marys: the St Marys Band Club, the historical society, the Lions Club, the St Marys Development Committee and Our Lady of the Rosary Parish. In 1995, Kevin was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for his service to local government, and in 2001 he was awarded a Centenary Medal. Even after his career in local government concluded, Kevin continued to be an integral part of many of the organisations he had helped build. As my election to Penrith Council came in 1999, at the end of Kevin’s period in office, I did not have the opportunity to serve on council with him. I did, however, benefit greatly from Kevin’s wisdom, advice and wealth of contacts as he mentored me in my early days as a councillor. It should be pointed out that Kevin’s wife Margaret not only supported him throughout his local government career but played an important role in many of the community groups in our community, and continues to do so today. I would also like to acknowledge Kevin’s daughter, Ann, and her children, Bradley, JD, Justine and Simone, for keeping the Dwyer family legacy alive and for continuing to represent the values that Kevin epitomised.

One of the greatest legacies of Kevin’s contribution to our community stands on Mamre Road, in the wonderful facility that is the Don Bosco Centre. Without Kevin’s assistance this facility would never have been built. WheneverI take my children down to the centre, I point to the picture of Kevin-that hangs in what is known as ‘ Sir Kev’s corner’-and reflect upon his efforts. In the same way, Kevin Dwyer’s contribution will live on in the park that now carries his name. Paterson Electorate: Oyster Cove week’s announcement that Defence will halve the planned use of the Joint Strike Fighter at the Salt Ash Air Weapons Range. Defence’s decision to alter the proposed ANEF 2025 noise contour maps to exclude the village of Oyster Cove has been a welcome decision for residents. An increasingly large number of local residents have contacted me about the proposed JSF noise contours, which reflects the growing number of residents that would have been adversely affected by aircraft noise once the JSF is introduced into service at RAAF Williamtown. The issue has gained momentum in the local community in the past months. As soon as this issue was raised with me I began meeting with affected residents. I met the residents of Oyster Cove during their very first collective meeting on the issue at the Tillman residence, and then I attended the Williamtown consultative forum, where I forced an action item that would see Defence review the mapping and/or compensate affected residents. I have also personally represented every single resident that has approached me-without response from the Minister for Defence, I must say, who instead chose to delegate all correspondence regarding the issue to his parliamentary secretary, Mike Kelly. I am absolutely delighted with Deputy Air Force Chief Geoff Brown’s announcement. This is a win for common sense and an example of what can be achieved when members of a community stand side by side to fight for a fair go. I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of the member for Port Stephens, Mr Craig Baumann and the Mayor of Port Stephens, Councillor Bruce MacKenzie, for working cooperatively with me to fight for the rights of the Oyster Cove community at the Williamtown consultative forums. This week the community of Oyster Cove should take some time to reflect on this achievement. They deserve to be proud of one another and the constructive, intelligent, focused approach they took to resolve the problem. From the moment I stepped into the meeting at the Tillman residence back in early March, I knew that this was a community that would fight for its rights. As their federal representative it was an honour and privilege to stand alongside this community and fight for a fair go. I always enjoy going into bat for my constituents, but the most rewarding aspect of my job by far is the achievement of an outcome that at the outset seemed an insurmountable challenge. Together we have achieved this outcome today, and I will continue to work hard to represent those residents of Oyster Cove, Medowie, Salt Ash and Swan Bay who are facing possible decreases in their property values. I will also continue to keep the community informed as more information comes to hand. MAIN COMMITTEE",118,Constituency Statements

The Kings Hill development would involve the council and the NSW state government approving re-zoning and a residential development directly under a flight path on rural land. It is obscene to do that. It only creates downstream problems. I am calling on Defence to up the action with the council and with the NSW state government to make sure that development directly under the flight path is ruled out. It can be ruled out quite simply by the Department of Defence acquiring the rural farmland so that it cannot be converted to residential development. Mr Israel Ben Chayle Herzog AO Ms Ann Zablud towering figure in the Jewish community and business in Melbourne, Mr Israel Ben Chayle Herzog AO. He is a man renowned for his modesty and charity. He is extremely ill at the moment, and his family are reciting psalms for him and for his recovery. I recite chapter 130 of the Tehillim psalms: A song of ascents. From the depths I have called You, O Lord. O Lord, hearken to my voice; may Your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. O God, if You keep [a record of] iniquities, O Lord, who will stand? For forgiveness is with You, in order that You be feared. I hoped, O Lord; yea, my soul hoped, and I wait for His word. My soul is to the Lord among those who await the morning … Israel, hope to the Lord, for kindness is with the Lord and much redemption is with Him. And He will redeem Israel from all iniquities. I also want to speak about my dear friend Ann Zablud whose 90th birthday coincided with the 90th anniversary of WIZO Victoria, and she celebrated her birthday on the weekend at a major lunch in her honour. I am used to being surrounded by strong women-including my late mother Margaret, my aunt Cipa and my wife Amanda-but Anne is a particular mentor, and I praise her along with her late husband Bob. They came from the legendary Brest-Litovsk in Poland to arrive in Australia on Black Friday 1939. One of their great beliefs was in a gentleman called Jabotinsky who wrote a famous book called A Land on Fire, and they arrived in Australia at Geelong with-to their amazement-the whole country afire. It was particularly appropriate, given the fact that they were coming from a continent that was literally burning to the ground, that they were coming to Australia, which appeared to be burning to the ground. Bob and Ann’s broad understanding of the European traditions of Jewish community organisations meant that when they came to Australia on the cusp of the war they immediately engaged with significant existing community organisations, ensuring that the post-war wave of refugees-mothers, fathers and grandparents of many us who met on the weekend-found organisations that understood them, their traditions and their needs. Fortunately, these organisations were able to immediately engage the vast numbers of war-ravaged refugees. This is the unrecognized and incredible legacy of Ann and Bob Zablud.

I met this amazing group of people-and I mean a really amazing group of peopledrawn from all facets of life, who come together to sing once a week. They were energetic, disciplined and had wonderful timing and good humour. They were clearly social supports for each other. I heard them sing Georgia on my mind, and they were kind enough to ask me to speak to them for a few minutes. Those of you who know me a little bit better than others will know that I have a history in this area. I discussed with them what I looked like in my twenties, when I wore the white stretch-cotton jumpsuit, the navy stretch-cotton jumpsuit or the outfits that flowed, and the fact that when I performed I had some 12 changes of clothing each night. We discussed these things. It got better than that. We were fairly frank with one another. Nobody in this room has suffered four federal defeats, as I have. I told them that part of my reconstruction, being brought back into public life, was the fact that I was cajoled into playing the part of the priest in the local production of Les Miserables. I explained to them that that is why I can still say to people today that I am a former priest. After we spoke, one lovely lady said, ‘When I look in the paper and see a picture of you now, Russell, I’ll have a totally different view of my local politician!’ This organisation apparently came out of stress money, drought money, from the federal government. It grew out of that and now it is all over Australia. I congratulate them on what they do. I love the way that they are supporting one another when many of them have obviously been through life’s difficulties-whatever they were-and yet there they were, freezing cold, in the place and ready to sing for the night. I did not stay for The girl from Ipanema because it means a bit too much to me, especially when they go: ‘A-a-ah.’ I knew they would do that very well, so I snuck out before then.

The Parliamentary Secretary for Employment, the Hon. Jason Clare, was present together with the member for Oxley, Bernie Ripoll, and me. We congratulated all the jobseekers who found employment at the jobs expo. Unemployment in the western corridor, from South-West Brisbane through to Ipswich and the rural areas beyond, is approximately 7.2 per cent-above the national average of about 5.4 per cent. That is why the jobs expo was so important. Also, youth unemployment is 1.5 per cent higher than the national average. About 80 businesses and organisations set up stalls and there were about 500 jobs on offer. I congratulate the Queensland Times newspaper and River 949 radio station for their extensive publicity and their support of the Keep Australia Working jobs expo in Ipswich. I also thank Samantha Wilson, the local employment coordinator. There were great employers present, such as Queensland Rail, Woolworths, Busy Beat, Ipswich City Council and others. I particularly want to thank the wonderful ambassadors, Tommy Raudonikis, Centrelink Jobs Expo Ambassador, and Artie Beetson, Centrelink Indigenous Ambassador, who kept the whole audience transfixed with stories about their own personal experiences and life testimonies.

220,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (4.40 Pm),"I rise today to speak on the Defence Legislationaccess the support afforded by this program; and, lastly, to make changes to the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 to enable the appointment of chief petty officers and flight sergeants as discipline officers. I will now speak on each of these amendments in more detail. The first measure contained within this bill seeks to amend the Defence Act 1903 and establishes the honours and awards tribunal as a statutory body. The tribunal was established in 2008 to inquire into and make recommendations on Defence honours and awards matters relating to issues referred to it by the government. However, the tribunal was only established as an administrative body and, even though the government has undertaken to be bound by the tribunal’s recommendations, the tribunal lacked the authority to make separate decisions or to independently review defence decisions, particularly those concerning eligibility for Defence honours and awards. Importantly, the proposed changes will provide past and present Australian Defence Force members, next of kin and other individuals with the right to appeal directly to the honours and awards tribunal regarding eligibility for Defence honours and awards. However, it should be noted that the tribunal will not review the eligibility for honours or awards that were made before 3 September 1939. As such, any application made regarding service rendered before this date will also not be considered by the tribunal. I welcome this measure but remain highly sceptical of Parliamentary Secretary Kelly’s statements that these measures will provide a more transparent and accountable process. It must be remembered that this is a government that provided only 1½ pages of costings in the 2009 defence white paper. This is a government that completely blacked out pages upon pages of text within the Pappas review regarding Defence base closures. This is a government that, most recently, failed to make the public aware of the grounding of the entire MRH90 helicopter fleet, which suffered a catastrophic engine failure, for one whole month. So, in light of the above, you will excuse my cynicism regarding this government’s intentions to create a more transparent and accountable defence department. Additionally, I find it astonishing that, given Parliamentary Secretary Kelly’s supposed enthusiasm with regard to Defence honours and awards, he has remained altogether silent on the issue of James Montgomery. For those unaware of James Montgomery’s infamy, he is an alleged military fraudster who, according to recent media reports, was exposed some weeks ago as having created false military identity cards and a false military service history, which included making himself a former member of the SAS and the recipient of the Victoria Cross. Dr Kelly’s spokesperson confirmed in media reports almost four weeks ago that Dr Kelly would review this case, which would be entirely appropriate seeing he is directly responsible for Defence honours and awards. However, he has failed to take any action on this matter. I therefore take this opportunity to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that it is his responsibility to investigate such matters and that he should do so immediately, not only because he said he would but because fraudsters like James Montgomery denigrate those who have earned their medals and who have earned the right to wear those medals. The next measure in the bill seeks to amend the Defence Act 1903 in order to ensure there is procedural fairness when a member is discharged following the return of a positive test for a prohibited substance. This amendment has been put forward as a result of recommendations made by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which recommended the organisational separation between the initiating officer and the decision maker for MAIN COMMITTEE all cases that involve the termination and discharge process. The current provisions, under part VIIIA of the Defence Act 1903, do not provide for this level of separation or procedural fairness. This amendment simply seeks to rectify this section of the Defence Act. The next measure is purely administrative and seeks to ensure that 58B determinations relating to remuneration and allowances are subject to tabling and disallowance. This amendment will ensure that 58B determinations are in accordance with the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. The next measure in the bill seeks to amend the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme Act 2008 to ensure that all eligible members of the reserves, regardless of how they became a reservist, receive assistance under this scheme. This is a minor amendment that will ensure that, in particular, those permanent members of the ADF who have transferred to the reserves are eligible to receive the assistance provided under this scheme. However, I am at a loss to understand why Parliamentary Secretary Kelly would introduce the aforementioned amendment without considering another long-time bugbear of the reservist community when it comes to accessing the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme. Currently reservists who wish to claim DHOAS assistance need to have completed at least eight years of effective service-that is, they need to have completed at least 20 days of reserve service each financial year over eight years. However, reservists may also be able to fast track their qualifying period if they undertake more than six months continuous full time service in one financial year. Under regulation 8(4), a reservist who completes a period of continuous full time service of six months or greater within a service year-a financial year-is considered to have rendered two years effective service when applying for benefits under the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme. Unfortunately, reservists who undertake a deployment that falls across two financial years miss out on this benefit, as their time served is effectively halved across the two financial years. The result is that some reservists receive Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme benefits while others miss out simply because their service straddled two financial years. For example, in 2008-09 reserve members who deployed as part of Rotation 15 of Operation Anode and who were still working towards their eight years of effective service missed out as their rotation was deployed from March 2008 to September 2008. Conversely, members of Rotation 16 of Operation Anode received a full credit for their continuous full-time service, as their deployment was from July 2008 to January 2009. The current policy is unfair and is obviously an unintended consequence of the legislation. The question then is why Dr Kelly has chosen to ignore this issue. I know Dr Kelly is aware of this issue, as he has received the same letters from the reservists as I have. In fact, the letters have even noted that Dr Kelly was a recipient. This bill provided Dr Kelly with an opportunity to correct the unintended consequences of the existing legislation, but he has deliberately chosen not to. He has chosen not to because the proposed changes do not affect him directly as a current reservist. Parliamentary Secretary Kelly has simply lost touch with defence personnel, yet he has come into this parliament as a distinguished serving officer. The last measure contained in this bill will enable the appointment of chief petty officers and flight sergeants as discipline officers. This measure will amend the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 to clarify the jurisdiction of discipline officers and align the meaning of discipline officers and available punishments across the three services. This amendment also seeks MAIN COMMITTEE to clarify the definition of ‘junior officer’ as it pertains to the Defence Force Discipline Act. The current legislation expressly excludes midshipmen in the Navy, but not an officer cadet in the Army or Air Force, as midshipmen are classified as officers even though they are still officers under training. This amendment will align the definition across the services, changing the terminology from ‘junior officer’ to ‘other than a person who holds the rank of officer cadet’. These changes will ensure that the officer cadets of all these three services will be subject to the jurisdiction of a discipline officer and the appropriate punishments as listed under section 169F of the Defence Force Discipline Act. I support the measures contained in this bill. They are non-controversial and simply seek to amend some administrative and legislative inconsistencies within current defence legislation. However, as I have noted, throughout this bill the parliamentary secretary could have done more and should have done more particularly with regard to rectifying those unintended consequences of the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme legislation that affect reservists. Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2010. I want to speak on three aspects of this bill, the first dealing with the Defence Honours and Awards Appeal Tribunal, the second as to procedural fairness in relation to the termination and discharge process, the need for natural justice and the separation of prosecutorial power and decision making and the third in relation to the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme, which is so relevant to and important in my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland, which contains RAAF Base Amberley. I have often been a delegate to the national conference of the ALP. On numerous occasions we have come out strongly, in our policy and platform, in support of the Australian Defence Force, particularly supporting the independence of defence and honouring its role in our community. The areas in relation to awards and medals are certainly difficult. How medals are handed out is often irregular and very complex. Sometimes there is suspicion that it is not necessarily appropriate to hand out medals to a certain person given the duration of service or the area of service. Sometimes there is some suggestion that politics can be involved in the decision making. That is why I think the commitment that we made in the 2007 election campaign to effectively take politics out of the medals policy is so important. I do not accept the criticisms of the previous speaker in relation to the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support. We have established an independent Defence Honours and Awards Tribunal. It was established in July 2008 and that was done in an administrative capacity. What particular role and what function that tribunal has are problematic without statutory authority. There is no doubt about that. This is always a difficult area, whether it be an administrative or a judicial tribunal given what the Constitution has to say, whether there is a legal basis for establishing such a tribunal and whether it be about the powers and functions and responsibilities of the tribunal and its members. How a person is appointed to the tribunal is also problematic from time to time. So there needs to be statutory authority for that to happen. The current tribunal really does not have any authority to make separate decisions or to independently review defence decisions concerning the eligibility of military personnel for defence honours and awards. That really should be rectified, and that is what this legislation is doing. It is setting out the functions of the tribunal, its decision making, who can apply for review, the referral of general defence honours and awards issues for inquiry and advice, the MAIN COMMITTEE",122,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2010
221,Mr Neumann (Blair) (4.51 Pm),"I speak in support of the Defence Legislationconstitution and the method of appointment of members and many other transitional provisions which make this tribunal more sound legally and provide a basis at law. I think this is an appropriate way to go. The parliamentary secretary has acted appropriately. I think this will certainly clarify some of the anomalies with respect to the issuing of medals to military personnel. SoI applaud the parliamentary secretary for what he has done in this regard. The second aspect is a very difficult issue. It concerns the termination of employment of a Defence Force person who may test positive for a prohibited substance. This is always a difficult thing because, if that is the case, that person loses their livelihood, perhaps their financial security, their esteem, and they go down in the eyes of their peers and in the community generally. So it is absolutely vital that natural justice be afforded to that particular person. There needs to be a separation between the person who gives that person notice to show cause and the person who terminates their service. It is extraordinary that currently that is not the case. We need to be fair. It does not mean to say that we should not stamp on the use of prohibited substances. If someone-for example, military personnel at RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland-used a prohibited substance and it was an offence under the Queensland Drugs Misuse Act, of course we should show zero tolerance. But we need to make sure, where these things involve many years of service-and perhaps that person can in fact discharge their duties in a way that is respected in the military-where you are talking about a person’s employment, that there is procedural fairness. I applaud the government for what they have done in this regard. It is the right thing to do and it accords with the basic principles of natural justice. The third aspect of this bill which I wish to talk about deals with amendments in relation to the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme as it applies to reservists. The current situation needs to be changed. We will make amendments which will ensure that section 5 of the act applies to all reserve members and clarify that section 5 applies to a member who has become a reserve member as a result of a transfer from the permanent forces. I have had many friends who I have known through sport, community organisations and in church communities in the Ipswich area who have been permanent members of the Royal Australian Air Force who have then left to pursue other careers but have gone back to work as reservists. To clarify the situation is the right thing. This scheme has been one of the best initiatives we have undertaken with respect to the military. This has really made it more attractive for people to be recruited and to be retained in the military. I have been to the RAAF base on numerous occasions and have spoken to many, many people about this issue in Ipswich. The feedback I have received is that this scheme is well received. They see this as part of a broad set of initiatives by the government with respect to defence personnel, encouraging them to stay in the service. It is important that we provide higher home loan subsidies to permanent members and also to reservists. The legislation sets up that scheme and outlines the number of years a person needs to serve if they are a permanent member of the military and also if they are a reservist. This is a good and important initiative. It is something that defence families have advocated for for a long time. With respect to the home loan providers-there is reference in previous legislation to this-I have been approached by Bendigo Bank locally to see if they can get a handle on being involved in this process. I am lobbying hard to see whether it can be expanded to see Bendigo Bank included. I have had some discussions with the regional manager, Michael List, in relation to this issue. Michael is also the President of the Ipswich Chamber of Commerce, MAIN COMMITTEE and I have had some discussions about whether the Bendigo Bank can be involved in the scheme. I would hope the government, at some stage, would look at that. With respect to defence housing in the Ipswich area, for a long time, sadly-under governments of both persuasions, but particularly under coalition governments-it was neglected and some of the homes in which defence personnel spent their time were inadequate. I have been to many of them in suburbs such as Leichhardt and One Mile, where there was plenty of defence housing. It must have been tough on families-on children and on spouses and partners-to have to come and live in inadequate facilities and homes away from their loved ones interstate or intrastate. But we are investing a lot of money in my electorate in defence housing, and this correlates with the initiatives we are undertaking with respect to the legislation and particularly the schedule under the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2010, which we are debating here. We are building 111 defence houses in Ipswich over the next few years. This is injecting $36 million into our economy. It has created 35 jobs in the Ipswich community and indirectly benefited many more. I have visited many of these houses, particularly in the suburb of Flinders View, where I live. In fact, many of the houses are in the estate just up the hill from where I live, and the housing is of very high quality. The housing is very well received. They are four-bedroom brick homes with wonderful views as well. It is also not just part of the usual defence housing that we are constructing in Ipswich but part of the nation-building stimulus plan. Currently across Australia DHA manages about 17,300 properties, worth about $7.6 billion. Shortly, under the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan, I am to officially open another 20 homes in Raceview, which is the neighbouring suburb to Flinders View on the south side of Ipswich. I want to congratulate the government for taking that initiative. The quality of that housing, I am sure, will be every bit as good as the quality of the housing at Flinders View. Honouring our military personnel by way of medals but also providing practical support for them in terms of housing is crucial. But, finally, providing procedural fairness for those people facing the possibility of losing their employment is also particularly important. And that is why this initiative in this legislation is so important for my community in Ipswich in South East Queensland, where the RAAF base at Amberley is based. Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2010. The bill will address five separate measures, notably the following: firstly, establishing the Defence Honours and Awards Appeal Tribunal by legislation; secondly, ensuring there is procedural fairness in the discharge and termination process which relates to a person who has returned a positive test result for a prohibited substance; thirdly, ensuring that section 58B determinations, relating to remuneration and allowances, are subject to tabling and disallowance; fourthly, amending the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme Act 2008 to ensure that it covers all members of the reserves; and, fifthly, amending the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 to enable the appointment of chief petty officers and flight sergeants as discipline officers. The coalition supports all five schedules, but I wish to restrict my remarks just to schedule 1. I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support, Mike Kelly, for his and his office and department’s assistance in coming to grips with the key areas of what the bill proposes. MAIN COMMITTEE",125,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2010
222,Mr Robert (Fadden) (5.01 Pm),"I rise to lend the coalition’s support to the DefenceThe principal intent of schedule 1 of the bill is to insert a new part into the Defence Act 1903 to formally establish the Defence Honours and Awards Appeal Tribunal by legislation. I note that this is the fulfilment of a Labor 2007 election policy that stated: A Rudd Labor Government will form a permanent independent tribunal to oversight Defence honours and awards, to take the politics out of medal policy. Accordingly, in 2008 the government established the Defence Honours and Awards Appeal Tribunal-let us call it the DHAAT-to consider long standing defence honours and awards issues. At the time, of course, this tribunal was not supported by legislation-hence the bill now. Thus the Department of Defence issued a directive outlining the roles and responsibilities of the tribunal. Notwithstanding that the authority for this directive is unknown-and, perhaps, a little dubious at best-the government, to the parliamentary secretary’s credit, stated that they would abide by the tribunal’s ruling, and there does not appear to have been any infraction of that. It appears that the government has indeed abided by the rulings of the tribunal. Prior to the establishment of the current tribunal, there was no avenue of appeal open to Australian Defence Force members, ex-serving members, next of kin or others who had applied for medals and had their application declined, short of a ministerial application. There was also no permanent body that could independently consider broader recognition issues relating to defence service. The limitations of the current unlegislated tribunal are that it can only inquire into and make recommendations relating to issues referred to it by the government and clearly has no authority to make separate decisions or to independently review defence decisions concerning eligibility for defence honours and awards. The establishment of this tribunal as a statutory body under the Defence Act 1903 will clearly legislate the current tribunal and will, in my opinion, strengthen the current tribunal’s independence, which I think will actually assist in making the Defence honours and awards decision making process more transparent. I think it provides a clear and simple process for people seeking some degree of redress to go to a tribunal to seek that redress. People will still be able to appeal a decision of the tribunal through the Federal Court under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, as they should be able to. To date the tribunal has ruled on a range of awards: the criteria for the Australian Defence Medal; the claims of the Merchant Navy, including the US Army Small Ships Section; 4RAR Malaysia; and the Battle of Long Tan inquiry. AndI can say the tribunal has dealt with those four in a highly professional manner, producing a set of recommendations that I think meet the high standards of community awareness and concern. The tribunal is also currently inquiring into recognition of contributions made by officers and instructors in the Australian cadet forces; recognition of unattached Australian entertainers in the Vietnam conflict; recognition of Australian Defence Force service for SAS counterterrorism and special recovery duties; recognition of service in Somalia; recognition for members of the ADF for service in Papua New Guinea after 16 September 1975; and of course recognition for Defence Force personnel who served as peacekeepers from 1947 to the present. I note the tribunal will rule on all military medals, including Mention in Dispatches, Imperial awards and foreign awards, which I think is a fairly inclusive way of looking at it. The procedural rules will come down via legislative instruments. MAIN COMMITTEE The Defence Honours and Awards Appeal Tribunal is a sensible move forward. The only thing I would add, considering the parliamentary secretary is in the room, is that we still have no area for appeals for those who are outside the military. For example, if an AusAID worker was working somewhere in Cambodia and missed out on the humanitarian medal, there is nowhere they could go to seek appeal. There is also nowhere the Federal Police could go to seek appeal or redress for those types of awards and honours. There may be room in the future for the Defence Honours and Awards Appeal Tribunal to be expanded to include a whole range of other awards and honours, including humanitarian, police and other sectors that seek to serve. I offer that constructively. Otherwise, I lend my full support to schedule 1 and the establishment of a Defence Honours and Awards Appeal Tribunal. tion Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2010. The proposed bill will address five separate areas but will include the establishment of the Defence Honours and Awards Appeal Tribunal, ensure that there is procedural fairness in the determination or charges being processed for defence members who test positive to prohibited substances and make it absolutely clear that section 58B determinations for non-salary conditions of service are subject to tabling and disallowance. The bill will also amend the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme 2008. It will ensure that section 5 of the act applies to Reserve members. To clarify, section 5 applies to all members who become reservists-they are subject to eligibility whether they transfer from the permanent services or not. That, quite frankly, is very important, as I understand it, to a number of people in my electorate who have lobbied long and hard for that particular provision. Finally, the bill will amend the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 to enable the appointment of chief petty officers, together with flight sergeants, as discipline officers. Warrant officers of the Army are already included. The bill will align the punishments available to be imposed in respect of certain ranks. The government remains totally committed to ensure the security of Australia. There can be no greater responsibility of any government than to ensure national security. To this end we are committed to building a Defence Force that is combat focused, better equipped, more mobile, more capable and certainly operationally ready. To help achieve this we must support our Defence Force through targeted legislation. That is exactly what this piece of legislation is. Only last month I had the unique opportunity, as the parliamentary secretary is aware, to attend-with, I think, six other members-the Defence Force Parliamentary Program. We spent 10 days in the joint service facility at Al Minhad, which is a staging ground for many of those who are going on to serve our country in Afghanistan. The point of the story is to say that we had those 10 days to actually sit down and spend a great deal of time just with the ordinary men and women of the Australian Defence Force. You cannot help but be touched by their professionalism, their dedication to task and certainly their commitment to their objectives which are defined by the Australian government in terms of their operation. One of the major things that was discussed with us over there, one of the major things about increasing the retention of the service, was their position in terms of home ownership. That was one of the big things that members of all ranks discussed with us, which is a bipartisan grouping as to one of their decisions to remain in the service. It is no doubt an attraction and certainly important to the retention rates of the ADF, which are very important. After inMAIN COMMITTEE",127,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2010
223,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (5.07 Pm),"I rise also to lend my support to the Defence Legislavesting in the building up of their skills and their capability, the last thing we want to do is lose those to private enterprise, because those skill sets which they have built up are very sought after. The people that we have built up are in fact sought after. Hence we have attracted to our side of politics the good doctor here, the member for Eden-Monaro. Being a colonel, he has made a major contribution to the government, particularly in honing our focus on how we look after men and women who serve us so bravely in the Australian uniform. Also very important for many of those people-and I have them nearby to my electorate, particularly in Holsworthy-is the overall pride in the uniform, the pride in being a member of an organisation, and also knowing full well that it is an organisation that has command, control and very clear lines of discipline. Those areas of discipline must be clearly spelt out. The changes that have been brought as a result of this act do much to ensure not only the continuation of discipline but also something that we take for granted, and that is procedural fairness. Before coming here I did a number of things, but I represented people industrially for a good part of my working life. One of the big things that was always a challenge was to ensure people had procedural fairness shown to them when there was serious action being taken that could curtail someone’s employment. This piece of legislation now does enshrine that. Those military personnel will be given the same degree of procedural fairness as we would expect for our own sons and daughters working in civil occupations. It is also important to appreciate the position in terms of the processing of honours and setting up the tribunal to make sure it is at arm’s length and fully independent from government. Many members have veterans associations in their electorates. I compliment them on the services they do in respect of veterans and members of the armed service. One of the areas of particular activity for the people in the service groups in my electorate was to focus on the issue of the battle of Long Tan. I know that matter has now been before the tribunal. Veterans in my electorate, because some were participants, were very supportive of the stance taken by Colonel Harry Smith in his standing up for Delta Company 6RAR and ensuring that there be just recognition of the commitment of Australian soldiers in that particular battle. It is one in which Australia, as I understand it, was outnumbered 10 to one. It is one in which, tragically, 18 Australian lives were lost and another 23 people were wounded. As it has been recounted to me, particularly by my local veterans, this was when they were standing up against an emerging force of a North Vietnamese regiment and members of the Vietcong. As the battle finally concluded and after relief had been provided to the Australian soldiers, it was found that more than 1½ thousand of the enemy had either been killed or died subsequently of wounds. That was an extremely courageous, heroic stand by 6RAR and I think it is one that is going to live long in the memory of all those who honour the name and the reputation of the 18 servicemen who died on that occasion. Putting it at arm’s length takes some of the emotion out of it and a lot of the perceived stance of senior officers’ recommendations. It allows for a tribunal to entertain evidence based upon fact and make clear and concise recommendations. There is now an appeal mechanism. In terms of the value we place on military service-the value I know the service puts on its medals and its recognition-let me tell you that these people do not go into these occupations to make money. They go in there to serve the country and they deserve to have full recognition for what they bring to bear on our behalf. I think this will go a long way to satisfy that MAIN COMMITTEE desire, not only for existing members of the ADF but also for those who look after retired members who have served this country well. This is a way of showing continued loyalty to the men and women of the ADF. I commend this legislation to the House. Dr KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (5.17 pm)-in reply-In summing up the debate on Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2010 I would like to thank all those members who made genuine contributions to this debate today. In particular, I would like to pay tribute to the member for Fadden who engaged diligently and genuinely with us in the process of explaining this legislation, and I welcome the constructive comments he made in the chamber today. I would also like to acknowledge the interest in defence matters the members for Werriwa and Blair have shown in the conduct of my duties over the course of these last couple of years. They are very genuinely concerned about the welfare of members in their electorates. I will, however, comment separately in relation to the comments made by the member for Paterson, which I place in an entirely different category, but I will address those at the conclusion of these remarks. The proposed bill provides for five separate measures. The first is that it amends the Defence Act 1903 to establish the Defence Honours and Awards Appeal Tribunal by legislation, inserting a new part 8C in the Defence Act 1903, to establish the Defence Honours and Awards Appeal Tribunal. The amendment sets out the functions of the new tribunal, what decisions are reviewable by the new tribunal, who may apply for review-including a power for the minister to refer general defence honours and awards issues for inquiry and advice, general provisions relating to the operation of the new tribunal, the constitution of it and appointment of members and transitional provisions for the continuation of business of the current administrative tribunal and the automatic appointment of current members to this new tribunal. Second, it amends the Defence Act to ensure that there is procedural fairness in the determination and discharge process where a defence member has tested positive for a prohibited substance. Third, it amends the Defence Act to make it absolutely clear that section 58B determinations made under the Defence Act are subject to tabling and disallowance and are able to operate with certainty and transparency. Prior to the commencement of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, determinations made under section 58B of the Defence Act were subject to tabling and disallowance. With the introduction of the Legislative Instruments Act, determinations made under section 58B of the Defence Act were expressly exempted by the Legislative Instruments Act from being subject to the new legislative insurance regime. It was always the intention that the tabling and disallowance regime continue in accordance with section 46B of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. Fourth, it amends the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme Act 2008 to ensure that it covers all members of the Reserves regardless of the way they became members of the Reserves. It was the original policy intent that section 5 of the act should cover all members of the Reserves, including those engaged by transfer. The scheme has been administered consistent with this intent. Fifth, it amends the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 to enable the appointment of chief petty officers and flight sergeants as ‘discipline officers’ to clarify the jurisdiction of discipline officers and to align the punishments available to be imposed in respect of certain ranks. MAIN COMMITTEE There were further comments made by the member for Paterson, as I referred to earlier, in relation to an incident involving an individual who is alleged to have worn decorations and awards to which he was not entitled. This matter was first raised with me by an AAP journalist and I requested the department to provide advice to me on 6 May. That advice was received in my office last Friday, so I do now have information concerning this individual. The Defence Department was not aware of those circumstances prior to my request for further information. I advise the member for Paterson that I am not a police officer and therefore have no responsibility for prosecutions of violations of the provisions of the Defence Act which relate to this incident. Any person who had information concerning this individual had open to them the option of referring the matter to the appropriate authorities, in which case it would have been dealt with in accordance with those provisions. I have no jurisdiction to act as an independent prosecutor or authority in relation to allegations of that nature, so I am uncertain as to what aspect of my duties the member for Paterson was referring to in relation to the matter. The second matter to which the member for Paterson referred relates to the operation of the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme. He referred to the operation in relation to certain aspects of its application to the Reserves. This matter, he stated, was an aspect of my responsibility. However, I should clarify for the chamber that that is not the case; it is the responsibility of the minister who has the carriage of personnel matters-formerly Minister Combet and currently Minister Griffin. I can advise the chamber that the matters raised by the member for Paterson are currently being investigated by the department, which was requested to do so by Minister Combet. This bill is not the appropriate mechanism for these issues to be resolved because the regulations are available for those aspects of adjustment that were raised by the member-if they are warranted, and that is yet to be established. So at this stage we are waiting upon a report from the department to the minister. I have to say also that I resent greatly the member’s implied slur with regard to the way the scheme is operating. He commented that the scheme was in some way designed to benefit me personally. In my second reading speech, in which I introduced this bill into the House, I specifically made statements indicating that I was not attempting to draw upon the anomaly that was highlighted in this legislation and to which this amendment is addressed. HadI taken advantage of that to which I was actually legally entitled, it would have meant that I could have obtained a sum upwards of $128,000. I have deliberately, clearly and publicly stated that I intend not to take advantage of that loophole and that I have discounted myself from that scheme and made no application whatsoever in relation to that scheme to pursue those entitlements. That statement of mine was absolutely clear and I resent entirely the slur from the member for Paterson. I think it reflects more upon him than it does upon me. I would have to say that he reveals himself-through his incompetent comments in relation to this legislation and through his behaviour in terms of his slurs against me and others-as not an appropriate person ever to carry responsibility for the members of this Defence Force. He also claimed that I had lost touch with members of the Defence Force. I can assure him that as a reservist and as a person with portfolio responsibilities, I take great pleasure and pride in my daily contact with Defence personnel. I was recently up in Darwin at Robertson Barracks and HMAS Coonawarra, and regularly have contact with these members. I underMAIN COMMITTEE stand deeply the nature of their service and the difficulties and challenges that they face. I do my very best to represent their interests in this portfolio, and resent and reject entirely the implications of his comments. I thank members who made genuine contributions to this debate and I look forward to the further operation of the Defence Honours and Awards Tribunal, in particular, which has made great progress in clearing up a backlog of many decades of issues which, in some cases had quite shamefully been left neglected. They have made very many people very happy in relation to the outcomes they have achieved so far under the operation of the tribunal. Once again, I thank the member for Fadden, also, for his comments and for his constructive engagement in this process. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Cognate bills: Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment Bill 2010. I think it is worthwhile that this House recall that as we debate this bill today, in numerous places around the world members of Australia’s armed forces, the Australian Federal Police, and officers of Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, are undertaking dangerous and difficult tasks in pursuit of Australia’s national security. The tasks that they are performing are difficult but necessary. Equally important to Australia’s national security are our anti-terrorist intelligence operations. In the post 9/11 world, Australia has expanded its counterterrorism capacity through the state police forces and the Australian Federal Police, through ASIO and through ASIS. The fact that there has been no terrorist attack on Australian soil testifies to our success, and in this vital area it is imperative that the Rudd government continues to build on the good work of the previous coalition government. The former coalition government understood that keeping the Australian people safe is the most basic duty of government. One important facet of Australia’s national security where this Labor government has failed dismally is in border security. Since August 2008, when the government dismantled our effective border protection system, there have been 128 illegal boat arrivals, carrying 5,932 people. This year alone there have been 60 illegal boat arrivals carrying 2,961 people. The Prime Minister’s failed immigration and border protection policies are now bringing illegal boats in record numbers but unlike the coalition the Prime Minister is unwilling to take the necessary action to fix the chaos that has been created by his own inability to leave well enough alone, when he came to office. Instead, we now find Labor asking churches to take asylum seekers as the Christmas Island detention centre overflows and onshore detention centres swell under the weight of Labor’s MAIN COMMITTEE",129,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2010

Labor’s failed border protection policies have cost taxpayers an extra $1 billion over four years, according to figures announced in the recent budget. The government is chasing its tail with these costs. It is doing nothing to stop these costs from skyrocketing. Its answer is just to keep shovelling money to pay for these blow-outs, which have now contributed to this ridiculous and unnecessary $1 billion blow-out-money that the Australian taxpayer would never have been required to spend in these areas if Kevin Rudd and the Labor Party had just been able to contain themselves and not mess with the successful border protection system that we had in place. This $1 billion blow-out could just be the beginning. It may well go higher, and it will go higher if the government is not changed and if they are the ones who keep ineptly managing our borders. People smuggling is an insidious trade that takes advantage of those in the most vulnerable situations. This Labor government needs to recognise this fact and take action towards stopping the boats from leaving in the first place rather than luring them with a Christmas Island reception centre. I will just move to some of the detail of the proposals within this bill. The bill proposes amendments to legislation in four principal areas: treason, sedition and terrorism offences; powers to investigate terrorism and serious crime; the listing and proscription of terrorist organisations; and the protection of national security information and court proceedings. I want to talk about the first part-the treason, sedition and terrorism offences. The bill proposes that the offence of treason in the Criminal Code be amended by confining the offence to those who owe allegiance to Australia or who voluntarily place themselves under Australia’s protection, and clarifies that the offence of assisting the enemy refers to material assistance. The offence of sedition is proposed to be renamed ‘urging violence’ and includes urging the overthrow of the Constitution or the government and urging interference in parliamentary elections. These provisions will require an intention that force or violence would be used. A new offence is also proposed of urging the use of force or violence against a group distinguished by race, religion, nationality, national origin or political opinion. There is a lesser offence if the force does not threaten the peace, order and good governance of the Commonwealth. The defence of ‘acts done in good faith’ is clarified by making it relevant that acts were done in the context of artistic work, in genuine academic or scientific discourse or in the dissemination of news or current affairs. It is proposed to repeal the offences relating to unlawful associations. These are claimed to be outdated and subsumed by the terrorist organisation laws. Amendments to the definition of a terrorist act propose to include the United Nations as a target of the act. The definition of the harm intended to be caused by a terrorist act is extended to include psychological harm. The new offence of committing a terrorist hoax is proposed, with a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. The offence of advocating the doing of a terrorist act will be amended to provide that the prosecution must establish that there is a substantial risk that it could lead another person to commit a terrorist act. This is consistent with the concept of risk elsewhere in the Criminal Code. The offence of providing support to a terrorist organisation is clarified to mean material support. I would like to acknowledge at this point the very substanMAIN COMMITTEE tial contribution of the former Attorney-General, the member for Berowra, who was very proactive in dealing with these issues. I will go to section 2, powers to investigate terrorism and serious crime. Amendments are proposed to the Crimes Act which are said to arise from recent operational experience. The division relating to powers of detention will be separated into two subdivisions to deal with terrorism and terrorism offences. In the case of terrorism offences, the maximum length of time that a person can be detained during an investigation period is proposed to be seven days and 20 hours. The provisions relating to re-entry under an existing search warrant will be amended to permit re-entry within one hour in normal circumstances and 12 hours in an emergency situation. In addition, it is proposed that entry without a warrant be permitted in emergency situations when investigating terrorism. It is proposed that there be a right of appeal both to prosecutors and defendants against bail decisions if there are exceptional circumstances. Moving to the third area of amendments, the listing and proscription of terrorist organisations, minor amendments are proposed to provide for listing if the minister is satisfied of the proscribed matters on reasonable grounds. Listings are to be reviewed every three years. As stated in the bill’s explanatory memorandum: Currently under subsection 102.1(3) of the Criminal Code, the listing of an organisation ceases to have effect two years after its commencement, or if the Attorney-General ceases to be satisfied that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act, whichever occurs first. The purpose of the automatic expiration is to ensure that if the Government wishes to continue the proscription, the Attorney-General has considered afresh all the relevant information and is satisfied that there is a sufficient factual basis to justify the proscription for a further period. The proposed amendments … will provide that a regulation proscribing an entity as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code will automatically expire on the third anniversary of the day on which it took effect. This is consistent with a recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security… in its Inquiry into the Proscription of ‘terrorist organisations’ under the Australian Criminal Code (September 2007). The Committee, which is responsible for reviewing all listings of terrorist organisations … concluded that extending the period of a listing regulation from two to three years would offer an adequate level of oversight. The fourth area consists of amendments to the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004. The purpose of the act is to protect information from disclosure in federal criminal proceedings and civil court proceedings where the disclosure would be likely to prejudice Australia’s national security. The act has been invoked some 38 times, and the experience informs some relatively minor amendments, principally to clarify that notification should be made to a party’s legal representatives and to streamline the definition of situations in which disclosure would be permitted. In some situations, answers to questions in court may be made in writing. I turn now to the concurrent bill, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement Bill 2010. The establishment of the committee was a proposal of the discussion paper on proposed reforms to counterterrorism and national security legislation. The proposed committee will replace and extend the functions of the current Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, of which I am privileged to be a member. The principal extension is the inclusion of the Australian Federal Police. The committee will be asked to examine MAIN COMMITTEE trends and changes in criminal activities, practices and methods, and to report on any desirable changes to the functions, structures, powers and procedures of the ACC or AFP. It will also inquire into any question in connection with its functions that is referred to it by either house of parliament. Unregulated and increasingly voluminous people movements are testing this Labor government’s border security policies; and, as we know, Australia has essentially become a magnet for this insidious trade peddled by people smugglers. It was my privilege very recently to visit Christmas Island. I met some of the brave Australian service personnel-in this instance, serving on HMAS Albany-who engage with Border Protection Command in patrolling our northern waters to intercept illegal boat arrivals. The crew were called Attack4 division and they were led by Lieutenant Commander Paul Garai as part of Operation Resolute, the ADF’s contribution to protecting Australia’s borders. They obviously work alongside personnel from Customs and other agencies. Up to 400 ADF personnel are assigned to Operation Resolute. It is the largest ADF operation outside Afghanistan. I think it is very important that we in this House acknowledge that there are grave dangers for our personnel who are involved in Operation Resolute. Indeed, going back to the incidents surrounding the SIEV36, it is possible that Australian service personnel on the intercepting patrol boat could have been injured or killed. So it is very important, I think, that we knowledge that the work they are doing is vital to Australia’s security and also involves some personal danger to themselves. When I visited Christmas IslandI had the chance to meet with Customs and Australian Federal Police officers, who are doing an excellent job of performing the policing and customs functions on the island, as well as dealing with illegal boat arrivals. All Australian government personnel deal compassionately yet firmly with the range of people seeking entry to Australia. I salute the professionalism which Customs, AFP and our armed forces apply when performing this very important task. We, the Australian parliament, expect a great deal of them and they have a right to know that the Australian people are fully behind them. It is worth noting that the bill, together with the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement Bill, has been referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 15 June. The coalition reserves its right to move amendments in the Senate, pending the committee’s recommendations. The coalition strongly believes that governments have a responsibility to do everything within their power to improve national security and to deal with all potential threats that face Australia. Waiting for a terrorist attack to occur is unacceptable. It is integral that this package of reforms delivers strong laws that protect our safety while at the same time it preserves democratic rights to protect our freedoms. Therefore, the opposition supports the thrust of both the bills. Amendment Bill 2010. I thank my colleague for his assistance. Back in 2006, when I was serving as Attorney General in the state of New South Wales, I made a speech that did not meet with universal approval within my own party. I was at the time particularly concerned about the sedition provisions of the new national security legislation and I complained also of the ferocious hostility then being directed by the right-wing media commentariat against any suggestion that human rights considerations were of serious relevance in the response to terrorism. I suggested, indeed, that human rights had been taking a battering from two forces: from terrorist activity and from terrorism laws. I believe I was correct to have had those conMAIN COMMITTEE",133,Parliamentary Joint Committee On Law Enforcement Bill 2010
226,Mr Debus (Macquarie) (5.41 Pm),"I rise to support the National Security Legislationcerns in 2006 and that a proportionate response to threats to national security was not always achieved at that time. However, the attacks on New York and Washington in September 2001, and the later attacks in Jakarta, Bali, Madrid, London and, more lately, Mumbai, absolutely require the Commonwealth to maintain and improve the legal framework for our national security. On the other hand, if in our resistance to terrorism we abandon the rule of law as it has been understood in the common-law world, then the terrorists have in significant degree won. I believe absolutely that our culture of equality before the law and freedom of speech is by far the best defence that we have against terrorism. I do not intend to quote myself more than one more time, but I have also turned up a speech that I made introducing terrorism legislation into the New South Wales parliament. I generally justified the law, which complemented the Commonwealth law, by pointing out that in profound ways terrorism was quite unlike general criminal activity. I said: General criminal activity has never aimed to perpetrate the mass taking of life, the widespread destruction of property, or the wholesale disruption of society in the way that terrorism does. The national security legislation developed after 9-11 and after the London bombings of 2005 was passed, obviously, in the shadow of quite momentous events, but it was nevertheless passed, bearing in mind that gravity, with extraordinary haste. Technical errors requiring later correction were inevitable. The laws were also, as has since been demonstrated, sometimes careless of their impact on individual rights-that is on the one hand. But they were sometimes insufficiently precise about the exercise of powers absolutely needed by police and intelligence agencies to effectively constrain terrorist activity. It was very hard in the atmosphere of the time to keep an appropriate balance, from the perspective from which I was working anyway. I have already mentioned the commentators who were prepared to treat any reference to human rights as some sort of affront to our national values. One was aware, too, that Prime Minister Howard was on the lookout always for an opportunity to wedge the Labor Party with the suggestion that it was soft on terrorism. He was no more capable of genuine bipartisanship than the present Leader of the Opposition in this respect. Fortunately the Senate did operate as something of a brake on the attempts of the then government to force headlong passage of terrorism legislation and managed some important amendments. Still, it has taken a number of independent reviews-they were mentioned by the Attorney in his second reading speech-to bring together the balancing amendments contained in the bill before us now. I do, by the way, particularly commend the work of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and its chair, the member for Brisbane, in this respect. The need for balance is well described by Lynch and Williams in their book, What price security?: Making a sufficient response to this uncertain threat involves creating offences that recognise the seriousness of the crime of terrorism and granting our intelligence and law enforcement agencies the powers they need to protect us. But this must not be the only approach if we are to win the ‘war on terror’. We also have to ensure that we preserve our way of life-and particularly the basic freedoms and access to justice that are consistent with our position as one of the world’s oldest continuous democracies. The authors go on to deliver a low blow-they quote Robert Gordon Menzies introducing the national security legislation on the eve of World War II, our biggest ever security threat. Menzies said: MAIN COMMITTEE Whatever may be the extent of power that may be taken to govern, to direct and to control by regulation, there must be as little interference with individual rights as is consistent with concerted national effort … the greatest tragedy that could overcome a country would be for it to fight a successful war in defence of liberty and to lose its own liberty in the process. I am grateful to Robert Gordon Menzies for so precisely nailing the point. I wish particularly to draw attention to the measures in this bill which deal with sedition and treason offences, and also those which implement recommendations of the inquiry by John Clarke QC into the famous case of Dr Mohamed Haneef. It is exactly to help ensure the quality of balance I have been speaking of that Clarke recommended the appointment of an independent reviewer who will be able, where necessary, to conduct a robust investigation of an intelligence or security matter within any agency of government. The bill extends the present role of Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security so that may occur. At the same time, this bill extends the role of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission to include the Australian Federal Police. The new committee will be called the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, and I am certainly among those who welcome its extended oversight. The joint committee will be responsible for providing broad parliamentary oversight of the AFP and the Australian Crime Commission. The functions of the committee will include monitoring and reporting to parliament on the performance by the Australian Crime Commission of its functions, monitoring and reporting to parliament on the performance by the AFP of its functions, and examining trends and changes in criminal activities, practices and methods and reporting on any desirable changes to the function, structure, powers and procedures of the Crime Commission or AFP. The establishment of this committee implements the government’s election commitment to improve oversight of the AFP. I held responsibility for both the Crime Commission and the Australian Federal Police from November 2007 until June 2009-that is to say, well after the events investigated by Mr Clarke but during the time when he actually brought down his report. Unlike many journalistic commentators, I have drawn the conclusion that Clarke got the role and situation of the AFP about right. At the same time, he accurately identified problems in the procedures for the conduct of a terrorist investigation set out in the Crimes Act, which had been introduced in 2006. Clarke says that one officer became too close to that case, and he says that the Director of Public Prosecutions should never have advised AFP to charge Haneef. He nevertheless goes out of his way to describe the senior AFP officers involved in the investigation as dedicated, impressive people of high capacity. I wish to say that I identify with those remarks; I precisely agree with him. Real people in situations like this one can face quite extraordinary stress and, in the Attorney-General’s words, they need procedures to administer that are precise and appropriately tailored. It is worth quoting from the Clarke report: Unfortunately, the investigation has been presented, somewhat unfairly, as a complete bungle. That is because it took a long time and in the end Dr Haneef was wrongly charged. Should it have taken so long? I think not … In my view, the ‘extension of time’ provisions in the Crimes Act-which failed to provide a cap or limit on the detention period-removed, or diminished, the sense of urgency that should have been brought to the task of determining whether to charge or release. MAIN COMMITTEE That is what Clarke said. He said the investigators, who were dealing with an entirely new kind of crisis, needed clearer, more precise procedural guidance. The amendments in the present bill to part 1C of the Crimes Act have the purpose of clarifying the intent of the terrorism investigation process. They clarify the definition of the word ‘arrested’. Part 1C powers apply only if a person has been validly arrested. They set a seven-day limit as the maximum period that can be specified by a magistrate and disregarded from the investigation period. They clarify how the investigation period and the time that may be disregarded from it are calculated. They clarify procedures by which investigators may apply for a period of disregarded time and they insert a number of proper safeguards. A senior officer must oversee the preparation of an application to the magistrate in this circumstance. The arrested person or their legal representative is entitled to make representations to the magistrate. That is to say, the overall purpose of this amendment, a quite critical one, is to clarify the policy extent of the terrorism powers and to improve their practical application. I turn now to the law of sedition. It has archaic roots in the Star Chamber of the early 17th century. It was used against Gandhi. It was used against the shearers in the great strike of 1891. It was last used in the infamous case against the communist leader Sharkey in 1949. It is by definition imprecise, subject to arbitrary application. It may be used to punish a defendant severely not for what they have done but for what they have said. The sedition law had fallen into disuse at both federal and state levels; however, sedition offences in the Commonwealth Criminal Code, lying there dormant, were resurrected and included, admittedly in somewhat modified form, in the 2005 terrorism legislation. There were not a few people on both sides of this House who were deeply troubled by that development. In the atmosphere of the time, the revival of the sedition provisions was a clear and present threat to Australian freedom of speech-not only a direct threat but an indirect threat insofar as provisions of that nature frighten people into restraining their words for fear of possible prosecution. The compromise offered by the Howard government in 2005 was a review by the Australian Law Reform Commission. I am profoundly relieved that in the bill before the House the government is essentially accepting the recommendations of the ALRC. The sedition and treason offences in the Criminal Code will be clarified and the odious words themselves abandoned. The name of the sedition offence will be changed to the precise and accurate term ‘urging violence’. An offence to intentionally urge violence against a group on the basis of race, religion, nationality or political opinion already exists, at least where that action would threaten the peace and good government of the Commonwealth. This bill will expand the offence to include urging violence on the basis of ethnic or national origin. Also, it will expand the offence to include urging violence against an individual and it will cover the use of violence even when the peace and good government of the Commonwealth is not threatened. That will be a lesser offence. This is a tough law but it is not any longer a law that threatens free speech. In the same spirit the treason offence-properly called ‘providing assistance to the enemy’-will be amended to make it clear that the offence must involve assistance to the enemy that is real or concrete. FinallyI should mention that the measures in this bill were developed in close consultation with the community. The Attorney-General released a discussion paper in 2009 and there was a good level of public participation and submissions received in response to the discussion MAIN COMMITTEE paper. Indeed, the process exemplifies the level of consistent well-focused community consultation and responsive participation that will ensure that our counterterrorism legislation is properly understood, is appropriately targeted and does meet community needs and community expectations. Some of the measures that were included in the discussion paper, I should mention, are not in this bill. Those are measures that will require the states to amend their legislation which refer power to the Commonwealth. I understand that the government will continue to work closely with the states to progress those measures. I commend the bill to the Main Committee. Amendment Bill 2010 and the cognate bill, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement Bill 2010. First of all I congratulate the government and the Attorney-General for establishing the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, which succeeds the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission. The major change in this is that the Australian Federal Police will now fall under the parliamentary joint committee, which I think is a really good idea. It is going to give members of parliament a greater insight into the Australian Federal Police in that they will find out precisely what is happening with the police and look at how legislation can improve law enforcement in this country. However, in saying that, I now have to give the government a bit of a whack, as the Australian Federal Police in 2008-09 had their efficiency dividend increased by one or two per cent, which basically meant $24 million off the AFP’s operating budget. This seemed quite crazy at the time, because you had President Obama in the US doing all he could to ensure law enforcement actually received further funding. But over here, under Prime Minister Rudd, we were seeing budget cuts. In the 2009-10 budget the Australian Federal Police budget was cut by $8.1 million and its counterterrorism program was cut by $1.4 million. I have raised before the issue of the AFP’s counterterrorism branch in Sydney. They suffered severe cutbacks. This year, again, in the 2010-11 budget $23.5 million in savings was imposed on the AFP-or maybe this has been diverted to other programs. We see that the AFP had an increase of funding for border protection. I would rather see that money, if there were no policy change, going to the Australian Federal Police. When we look at the Australian Crime Commission, we see that it has been gutted so badly by the Rudd government. The Australian Crime Commission was set up to have both state and territory police and the Australian Federal Police seconded to work at a national level together to take on serious and organised crime. And yet we have seen the Rudd government make cutbacks in the 2008-09 and 2009-10 budgets. In total, about 22 per cent of staff were cut. In fact we have had the ability for the state police to work with the AFP pretty much dismantled, because the Rudd government would not pay the bills of the seconded police members. When it comes to law enforcement, the best approach to take on the most serious criminals and gangs in this country is to have police forces working together. Elite criminals do not just work in one state; they work interstate and internationally. The Australian Crime Commission, with all the law enforcement agencies working together, was the perfect weapon of choice to go after serious and organised crime. We have a major gang problem in this country. Sadly, we had the incident at Sydney Airport, where an outlaw motorcycle gang member was actually killed in front of the public. This generated a response from the Prime Minister that he would do everything he could to take on MAIN COMMITTEE",136,Parliamentary Joint Committee On Law Enforcement Bill 2010
227,Mr Wood (La Trobe) (5.55 Pm),"I wish to speak on the National Security Legislationthe gangs. But nothing has happened. Because we do not have anti-association laws in my home state of Victoria, we are now seeing outlaw motorcycle gang members from all over the country making Victoria the place to be if you are a bikie. Even the Australian Crime Commission estimates that outlaw motorcycle gangs account for anywhere up to 15 per cent of drug movements around this country. The first thing we need to do is set up a national gangs database. This is absolutely crucial. We need to work out the number of gangs in this country, whether it be street gangs, outlaw motorcycle gangs or, as we recently saw on the front page of the Age in Victoria, Asian gangs. My background is that I was a member of the Victoria Police organised crime squad. On the 15th floor of the St Kilda Road Police Complex we had the Asian gangs squad. They were brilliant. They could tell you anything about Asian crime and gang members. Sadly, the Asian gangs squad and the organised crime squad were closed down. Under the previous government, CrimTrac was established. This is a vehicle for police and law-enforcement agencies all over the country to undertake searches to find out if there are warrants out on offenders. It is also used to store details about missing persons and firearms licences. This would be the perfect place to hold a national gangs database. We should remember that prisons are the place where terrorists are most likely to be recruited and brainwashed. Especially in the UK and America, there are so many people detained for terrorist offences that they actually have their own gangs in the jails. A lot of people are joining the extremist Muslim gangs for protection. They can join a number of prison gangs. This is an issue for New South Wales in particular, where more people are apprehended and detained in custody. Australia really needs to place great emphasis on ensuring that prisons are not a breeding ground for terrorists. Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, was recruited in a UK prison. That is of great concern. So the first thing the government needs to do is establish a national gangs database where all the law enforcement agencies can go. Secondly, as I said before, Kevin Rudd promised to be tough on crime but he has not been tough at all. This is very sad. I know that members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission on both sides of the chamber have been very disappointed in the cutbacks to the secondment of members. Anyone who has had dealings with police would realise that the secondment of members and investigators working hand-in-hand right across the country is the weapon of choice against organised crime. As a former detective, I can tell you that elite criminals move from state to state and there is no better way of tracking them than by having a task force that works right across the country to exchange ideas and intelligence and follow the criminals from state to state. I congratulate the government on the amendments relating to treason, sedition and changes to the offence of ‘urging violence’. I made a speech on 28 November 2005 in which I expressed concern about the sedition laws. I mentioned in that speech that trying to work out whether these offences could be used or not used was going to get police investigators into a lot of difficulty. This is the right decision and it has been a long time coming. I will give credit where credit is due. I know it was based on the UK model, and it is the right way forward. When it comes to other aspects, I am still greatly concerned about the preventative detention legislation and cutbacks, under part 1C of the Crimes Act, from 14 days to seven days. To me you need to give the investigators all the powers and tools they can have. Australia has been, in some cases, very lucky; but in other cases it has been brilliant detective work. I know, MAIN COMMITTEE through my colleagues back in the Victorian Police, where you may have a homicide investigation into the murder of four or five people it takes up a lot of time and resources. Can you imagine if we had an incident, God forbid, in this country where we had a large number of people killed at the one time? As we saw in the UK, they were seizing so many computers, checking mobile phones-it became an absolute nightmare. That is why their detention times have been a lot longer. With our preventative detention, the investigators still do not have the ability to put any allegation at all to a suspect in custody; they have to be released or arrested under part 1C of the Crimes Act. When we were in government I was critical of that decision, and I have not changed my position on it. In recent times I put it to the Victorian Police: would they use the Commonwealth offence powers or use their own? In actual fact they said they would use their own, which is ‘reasonable time’. I honestly believe that that is what it should be, to give the investigators all the time in the world they need. Sadly, the only way this is ever going to come to light is when, tragically, some incident does take place. I believe that with the Haneef case, and my recollection of Four Corners and listening to the Australian Federal Police, they did not use preventative detention legislation. I believe it was because they knew they could not ask any questions and they basically ran out of time. They did not use ‘reasonable time’. I believe at that time they had a 48-hour limit. Again, that is something I highlight to the government. I raised that with the Attorney-General in the consideration in detail stage of the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010. I put that question to him and he said that he would not be making legal comment. We really need to ensure that these issues are addressed, because it is crucial that our investigators have all the powers in the world to do the job they need to do. I will leave it there. There are some good aspects in the bill-as I said, like the changing of ‘sedition’ to ‘the urging of terrorism’-that make a lot of sense. But, again, the government really must get back on the game and fund the Australian Federal Police the way they should be. They are wasting a lot of money on border protection because they have changed the policies, and again with the Australian Crime Commission. To me that is the key to taking on serious and organised crime in this country, and the government is definitely failing on that. tion Amendment Bill 2010 and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement Bill 2010-two bills which I strongly support. I am really happy to follow my friend the member for La Trobe. I do agree with him on a number of things, but sometimes he has to let that political bias just slip off his collar. I do pay respect to the occupation he came from. I know he was a detective in the Victorian Police, a group of people I have had the honour to represent on numerous occasions before coming into this parliament. We are very much in a rapidly changing world when it comes to issues of terrorism-and, as my friend would no doubt hasten to point out, the nature of organised crime. As a national government we have a responsibility to protect all our citizens. Indeed, it is probably the single-most central position of government to ensure national security. In doing so, our laws will not stay static. We need to make sure our laws actually are capable of protecting citizens by giving the levels of threat and the natures of those threats. The proposed amendments included in this package of reforms are designed to give the Australian community confidence that our counterterrorism laws are precisely that, and that they are precise and appropriately tailored, and that our law enforcement agencies and our security agenMAIN COMMITTEE",140,Parliamentary Joint Committee On Law Enforcement Bill 2010
228,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (6.08 Pm),"I rise today to speak on the National Security Legislacies have the necessary investigative tools they need to combat and counter terrorism as it applies. Additionally, the purpose for the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement Bill is to establish the new Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement that will replace the former Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission. It will broaden that committee so it applies not only to the Australia Crime Commission but also to the Australian Federal Police. This is a matter which has been subject to considerable input over a long period of time. It is certainly something that we undertook to do to at the last election. I particularly thank for their submissions-obviously they were made to the government at that stage, who did not act on it; but the submissions also made it to the opposition, which is what we were prior to the election of November 2007-the Police Federation of Australia, also a body which I had the opportunity to work for for a prolonged period of time and to consult to, and its CEO, Mark Burgess, as well as Jon Hunt Sharman, who is the president of the Australian Federal Police Association. Both of those bodies were very strong in their lobbying to ensure that a similar oversight that we provided to the Australian Crime Commission would be provided to the AFP. The basis of that came about, indeed, from the Clarke review of the Haneef case. In that inquiry a number of things were looked at, a number of things were addressed and a number of recommendations were made. One of the things that always stood out to me-because this is a change which has been agitated for by the Australian Federal Police Association-was, ‘Why would they want to put themselves under greater scrutiny?’ The fact is that they have a regard for their professionalism, their commitment and operating to the letter of the law. Also, the fact is that they want to make sure we will not get ourselves into another situation where a policing activity became, as it did, a political football. The way that developed was a low point for Australian politics. One way to correct that for the future is to provide a degree of oversight of the activities of the AFP. I know that I had discussions at the time with various people in the leadership positions of the AFP, and I know that at one period of time these changes would have been resisted. They thought that it was inappropriate to have government oversight of a law enforcement agency of the nature of the AFP. However, the AFP has seen first-hand-because they have been part of the inquiries conducted by the joint parliamentary committee into the ACC-what that oversight is. This is not interference; this is oversight provided by the elected government and committee which also includes, on a bipartisan basis, members of the opposition from both houses. This is something that was not resisted by the rank-and-file members of the police force. It is something that they sought to have added to their role and to actually give a more transparent acceptance of the grave professionalism that was being discharged by their officers. When you think about it, the role and functions of this committee are quite similar. The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Law Enforcement will be responsible for providing broad parliamentary oversight on the AFP as well as the Australian Crime Commission, as I mentioned. The functions of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement will include monitoring and reporting to parliament on the performance of the ACC and its functions; the same in respect to the AFP and its functions; examining trends and changes-and this is the MAIN COMMITTEE important part-in criminal activities, practices and methods; and reporting on the desirable changes to the functions, structures, powers and procedures of both the ACC and the AFP. Unfortunately, my colleague the member for La Trobe has left, but I know he has been a very significant contributor to the joint parliamentary committee on the ACC and has been part of many of its recommendations. Oddly enough, this is one of the committees I can honestly say operates on a bipartisan basis. To date, I do not think there has been a minority position taken on that. The members of that committee certainly approach it on the basis of what is needed-what are the tools that our law enforcement agencies need to do the job that we expect them to do, which is to protect our communities. If that same approach is taken in our monitoring of the AFP, which it will be, this can only be of benefit, not only to the members of the AFP but to the AFP itself. That is one of the strong things that comes out of this. The other thing that is important is examining the trends and changes in criminal activity in the Australian law enforcement field. One of the things that is certainly pretty clear to me is that there has been a change in serious and organised crime in this country. That is one of the reasons-and by the way it emanated from the recommendation of the Australian Crime Commission Committee or the PJC oversighting the Australian Crime Commission-why we introduced laws late last year on unexplained wealth. One of the things that was pretty clear in our examination of trends in Australia and overseas-particularly in Ireland and a number of the European states-was the need to address the act of criminality and to cause people under suspicion to explain their unexplained wealth. I know my colleague from La Trobe went some distance to explain the issue about bikies and having a gang register or something of that nature. I think in a modern police force what we really need, and we have recommended and will probably continue to recommend, is a national police management system. One of the things that probably does not help us is having six different jurisdictions and a Commonwealth having different police management systems, where people might cross the borders and do something else. You then do not know precisely what they have been doing elsewhere. One of the things that strikes me is it was clear to us, in the evidence given to our committee by the Australian Crime Commission, that we needed to do more-and we did. We brought down that legislation and regrettably, I note to the embarrassment of the member for La Trobe, it was watered down a little in its passage through the Senate. That might be something that needs to be revisited, in due course. We are trying to be vibrant, as vibrant as the criminal element is, not only in this country but also internationally. We see that crime is not something that recognises geographic boundaries. It certainly does not recognise state or federal constitutions, nor does it limit itself in the way it applies itself to-ing and fro-ing overseas. One of the things we need to look at is best practice and how we provide the necessary tools to empower our law enforcement agencies to do what they need to do, which is protect our community, to address issues of organised crime and, importantly, in the raft of bills before us today, to provide counterterrorism. As the member for Macquarie is currently in the chamber, I should mention that he has played an extraordinary role in shaping law enforcement legislation not only in this parliament but also in the New South Wales parliament. Particularly when it came to sedition laws, he took a very strong view-a politically less popular view than his Premier might have liked at that stage! I have known the member for Macquarie to be forthright throughout his time in public life. He has made a significant contribution to the development of the New South MAIN COMMITTEE Wales government’s approach to law enforcement and he has also made a significant contribution to the development of the Rudd Labor government’s approach to law enforcement and counterterrorism. We are in extraordinary times. Going back before 9/11, I do not think we were thinking the same way about counterterrorism as we do today. There is no point in simply saying that we are working our way through these things. We will continue to have reviews of terrorism based legislation. Every piece of counterterrorism legislation we put through this House winds back people’s liberties. There is no question about that. The member for Denison is in the chamber. He is a person who champions civil rights and he does so quite responsibly. He acknowledges that everything we do in this regard winds back someone’s rights. So we should not necessarily wind back those rights unless it is evidence based and needs to be done to ensure the protection of our community. That is the framework we should be operating in and that is how we should continue to develop laws in this place. We have had to act upon a number of recommendations from the Clarke inquiry into the Haneef case and I would like to mention a couple of them. But I would firstly like to say that this bill will amend the Criminal Code Act 1995, the Crimes Act 1914, the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945, the National Security Information (Criminal And Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986. In terms of schedule 1 of the proposed amendments to the treason and sedition offences that are currently outlined in division 80 of the Criminal Code, the government accepts the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission, which include removing the term ‘sedition’ and replacing it with the phrase ‘urging violence’ and clarifying and modernising the elements of that particular offence. Once again, I pay credit to the member for Macquarie in respect of this amendment. Schedule1 of the bill will also extend the offence to cover the urging of violence to stop a group or individuals on the basis of national or ethnic origin, race, religion or political opinion-even in relation to the political system itself. That certainly streamlines the provision and gives greater definition of what it is that we are seeking to outlaw in that respect. Schedule2 of the bill includes the proposed amendment to division 102 of the Criminal Code. This division of the code contains the definition of ‘terrorist organisation’, the process of proscribing terrorist organisations and the terrorist organisation offences. This will amend the definition of ‘advocates’ to clarify that ‘an organisation advocates the doing of a terrorist act if the organisation directly praises the doing of a terrorist act in circumstances where there is a substantial risk that such praise might have the effect of leading a person to engage in a terrorist act.’ When proscribing organisations, it also became necessary to look at the time that those organisations would remain proscribed. Importantly, in this act that time is going to be extended for a period of 12 months; it will extend the current listing of a terrorist organisation from two years to three years. There are many other amendments which relate to the definitional provisions to implement the government’s policy to ensure that various matters are consistent throughout Commonwealth legislation. I understand, particularly in terms of same-sex partnerships, that these matters must be agreed to by the states. However, I am advised that states and territories have already indicated their approval for these matters to proceed. MAIN COMMITTEE In the Clarke review it was also indicated that there should be certain changes, particularly to the exercising of search and detain powers by the police-in particular, the powers of stop, search and question in relation to terrorist acts. Division 3A of the Crimes Act 1914 was inserted into the Crimes Act by the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005 to provide police with specific powers in relation to terrorist acts in addition to the existing police powers. However, division 3A does not provide police with the power to enter without a warrant premises where there is material that may pose a risk to the health or safety of the public in emergency circumstances relating to terrorism offences. What is being proposed here is that where there is such a risk to the public-it may be through the making of explosives or something of that nature-police will have the power under schedule 4 to enter those premises without a warrant to address that emergency circumstance. As I understand it, that does not relate to entering premises with a view primarily to collecting evidence, but rather it relates to protecting the public. Schedule5 proposes that the amendments will modify the search warrant provisions of part 1AA of the Crimes Act so that in emergency situations the time available for law enforcement officers to re-enter those premises will be extended by another 12 hours or where the issuing authority addresses the exceptional circumstances and prescribes a longer time. Again, those amendments are based on public safety-ensuring that the public are protected from harm. There are many other issues that I would like to address, but I am out of time. I just say that we are committed to looking after the men and women of the Australian Federal Police, who do such a sterling job in protecting our community. I praise their professionalism, commitment and dedication to their uniform and the way they do their jobs. One of the things that we must do in this place is ensure that they have the appropriate tools and skill sets to do the job that we ask of them-and that job is to protect our community. I commend these bills to the House. tional Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2010, the cognate bill and the formation of the joint committee but to once again put on the record a defence of liberty through the rule of law. I also once again wish to make some points about our role in the process of developing precise and appropriate laws for various operational and strategic agencies to implement. Where it is necessary to put in place special circumstances for exemptions to those processes, we need to do it in a precise and clearly defined manner. Whilst this legislation is, in a broad sense, a step forward on that front, there is more work to be done. I hope that attorneysgeneral and both federal and state executives continue to be vigilant in appreciating and enhancing the rule of law through the development of transparency and accountability in our law, because we are stronger if those broad principles are put in place. I concur with the member for Werriwa about the role that both the member for Macquarie and the member for Denison have played over a long period of time as fellow travellers on both liberty and rule of law in what has been a swing of the pendulum over the last decade towards the wants and needs of the state-at times at the expense of citizens’ liberties, both individual and community. I wish them both well-if this is indeed the last sitting! Whether it is being active in the form of writing letters to the editor or whether it is taking higher office all the way through to secretaries-general of the United Nations, I wish you well in your travels and look forward to staying in touch. MAIN COMMITTEE",142,Parliamentary Joint Committee On Law Enforcement Bill 2010
229,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (6.29 Pm),"I rise this evening certainly not to oppose the Nalation, I will also be a little bit wide-ranging. I will start with some broad principles and then try to come back, in the time. I have, to the individual. The broad principles that I have just been talking about are my first point. Democracy is at its strongest if the rule of law is our safe port. Both in the context of shield and sword, when we need to attack and when we need to defend, it is critical for public policymakers in the citizens house to understand that when it gets tough, when questions of community safety are put upon us, the consistent safe port is in the processes, established over hundreds of years, attached to natural justice and rule of law principles. I have a weird habit of reading more than one book at a time, and the two books I am reading at the moment are My Life with the Taliban and a book about the role that John Hatton played, called The Stench in this Parliament. I did not think the books were connected until I started to think about this speech, but in that role of sword and shield, attacking and defending with respect to upholding the rule of law, the Hatton story is very good with regard to whether we are comfortable as community and citizenry in handing over complete power to our own agencies. Hatton’s great crusade was royal commissions into police in New South Wales. Therein lies an example and a cautionary tale for all of us when we are thinking about those crazy, brave moments when the easiest policy decision is just to hand over the issue to the police, or hand it over to the military and say, ‘Go your hardest, clean it up and sort it out,’ and walk away as upholders of the process of the rule of law. That is in a defensive and a shield sense with regard to the rule of law. My Life with the Taliban is a story that I would recommend to everyone to read in relation to what we, over the last decade, have clearly defined as ‘terrorists’-which we have used everything in our power to hunt down, lock up and try to stamp out in what is proving over time to be a somewhat futile exercise as we find ourselves still deeply entrenched in conflict. Whilst the member for Macquarie was probably a lot wiser than me in quoting former Prime Minister Menzies with regard to wanting to protect liberties at all times but not doing it at the expense of one’s own liberties, I would like to make the same point but by quoting someone who was held at Guantanamo Bay for seven years and released without any charges-an Afghani local who just ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. He made a similar point in a poem he wrote whilst being held. He wrote: This ‘freedom’ put a proud people in chains And turned free men into slaves … … … This is “democracy” by the whip And the fear of chains With a whirlwind at its core Whilst it is exactly the same point that the member for Macquarie was making when quoting a former Prime Minister, we see that point being made by a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay in the form of a poem. He was released without charge after seven years in a process that I would hope over time is reflected on as one that was questionable in its delivery of the rule of law MAIN COMMITTEE",146,Parliamentary Joint Committee On Law Enforcement Bill 2010
230,Mr Debus,I believe the member for Denison is going to become a chief justice!,147,Parliamentary Joint Committee On Law Enforcement Bill 2010
231,Mr Oakeshott,"ThenI am glad that I said what I said! As this is wide-ranging legisand questionable in its ability to achieve the outcomes that it intended to achieve when first established. I am a strong defender-in case you had not noticed-of the principles behind natural justice and the rule of law. The very foundations of being a member of parliament and a believer in parliamentary processes should be an example of that for all of us. Therefore, the brave, the strong and the macho position, in my view, is to be vigilant in the defence of those rule of law principles. That is why I am pleased to see some greater precision around some of the issues in this package, including the change to sedition laws and the change to language defined as ‘urging violence’, including the urging of violence against an individual and the urging of violence which does not involve the state or Commonwealth. I think they are sensible steps forward for the law in this country. The fact that we are seeing better definitions attached is good and sensible. Likewise, the formation of the joint committee for law enforcement-and including the AFP in that-and oversight as part of the process certainly sit comfortably with the principles that I have just talked about. I think it is as much in the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission’s best interests to have that oversight as it is in the community’s best interests to have that oversight and for there to be a meeting place in this building of a joint committee that allows for, in a sense, a clearing house of any of the issues in and around the processes of the rule of law. So it is certainly a welcome move. I do, however, continue to raise concerns around some of these broader questions. The word ‘enemy’ has appeared in the language in some of this legislation. If we are being precise and are keen to define what we are talking about-and without me being cute in raising a concern-we should ask: what is our enemy and who is our enemy? That would be a worthy exercise in trying to be precise and trying to define. Likewise, there is an issue with the language around terrorism itself. What is a terrorist? Who are the terrorists? Following on from the Clarke inquiry, if we are going to use this sort of language, and use it as if everyone knows what it actually means, it would be nice to have some clear definitions and some precise boundaries around exactly what is a terrorist today when compared to a common criminal, compared to a freedom fighter and compared to the many other types of definitions we could potentially throw under that same banner of ‘terrorist’ if we wanted to. Likewise, there are the definitions around an emergency situation. That language has crept into this legislation. Whilst it is hard to predict the future and where such a situation would arise, if we are being true to our intent-and I give government credit for trying to be precise-it would be good to be very clear in the language around what is an emergency situation and when and how such powers would and could be used into the future. They are my broad points. Basically I have no opposition. Essentially it is a step forward. But I certainly do not see it as the end of the road. Hopefully, we will see further action in the quest for precision. I hope the Attorney-General is a flag-bearer in upholding these principles around the rule of law so we can get the best form of freedom and the best form of democracy that we can. Taking the broad and turning it into the defined in all of this, to achieve the best form of freedom and the best form of democracy there must be an obligation on every single citizen to know the law, to understand the law and to understand rights and responsibilities. To use some of the former Prime Minister’s language about personal education, it is about being alert, aware and also safe. If individuals take on that responsibility as part of a broader citiMAIN COMMITTEE zenry and a broader community then we will build the strongest society and the strongest democracy that we can. Whilst the Attorney-General is in the chamber, I want to put an issue to him that we have had several discussions about. He very kindly visited the mid-North Coast to meet with many of the community service providers on the issue of community legal centres. We have a gaping hole on the mid-North Coast when it comes to the delivery of community legal services. People on the mid-North Coast are expected to get in contact with services that are four to five hours drive away. After 15 years of public service, I know that community legal services on the mid-North Coast are simply non-existent; access is just not happening. I know we have had lots of discussions about it. There is great anticipation about any potential announcements. I once again look to the Attorney-General to provide us with some wonderful news! I certainly hope he can do that, and we will support his claim for Chief Justice if he delivers! This is a good package. It is a step forward. I hope every individual in their daily life considers the role they have in knowing and understanding the law. I think there are things that attorneys-general and I can do in helping in that regard-that is, in the context of community legal centres. Once again, I urge everyone in this place not just to pass the ball to the operational or strategic agencies on some of those broad principles but to be macho in holding on to them, defending them and working hard to make sure the agencies do what we as representatives want them to do in both defending and attacking when it comes to issues around the rule of law. bate, the member for Macquarie for their thoughtful contributions on the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 and related bill before the parliament. It is true, as all speakers have observed, that we are not immune from the passions of our day and, when a society is fearful, it is a natural first reaction to respond vigorously and to take measures necessary for that society’s protection. In the course of doing that there is need for reflection to ensure that the remedy is not worse than the malady against which it is directed. I have been in this parliament as a member of the House of Representatives standing committee on legal and constitutional affairs, however named, or as the minister responsible for law and justice, however named, for more than 20 years and I have seen the ebb and flow of debate in relation to these enormously consequential matters. CanI say in respect of the legislation in front of us: this is good and incremental legislation. It reflects a thoughtful balance that has been informed by considerable independent input but also by the long work of many parliamentarians. I think it was nine years ago, when Labor was in opposition and I was the shadow minister for justice and customs, that I introduced into the parliament a bill to establish a joint standing committee of this parliament to do precisely what the bill now envisages-that is, to establish an oversight of the Australian Federal Police. At the time, that was not recommended, but it does show that work that is done by parliamentarians in this place builds a foundation upon which later reflection can be had and that work we sometimes see as having been a failure at its time is not necessarily so-that is, that those of us who work to argue and to advance a coherent and logical position in respect of these issues can have successes many years after we felt the first sting of failure. MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Parliamentary Joint Committee On Law Enforcement Bill 2010
232,Mr Kerr (Denison) (6.45 Pm),"I thank the member for Lyne and, previously in this deThese measures are important because they are in areas where this parliament is always going to be confronted by the very real necessity to take strong action to deal with threats that come either from organised criminal gangs or from terrorist organisations, and there is, of necessity, no public sympathy for those who threaten us. But, just as the Athenians sent out a fleet to destroy a city that had offended them and, after being persuaded the next day by Pericles to have second thoughts, sent out another trireme to chase down the fleet, sometimes we in this parliament have to be the assembly that has the opportunity for calmer reflection to ensure that we do not go too far. Much of the work that is done in that regard is done behind closed doors in private. It has been recognised, I think, by the member for La Trobe, who comes from the other side of the chamber, that it is rare that there is anything other than constructive debate within those committees; that we do not break up into partisan differences when we come privately to discuss these great challenges. Jason Wood, the member I referred to, has a history as a former policeman. I served on committees of which he was also a member, and the differences we bring and the perspectives we offer by way of different starting points are enormously valuable to inform the work of this parliament and, through that, change the outcomes in legislation. I want to reflect on the anti-terrorism aspect of the legislation that we are passing. The work of the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security, previously the Joint Standing Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, was absolutely critical to ensuring that there was a significant response within the parliament so that the measures that were taken in the heat of the events after September 11 did not overreach. People will argue that, nonetheless, those measures in some estimations went further than they would have wished. Equally, others would say that there was an imperative case that this parliament act to ensure the safety and security of its citizens. Both starting perspectives have a very significant element of validity. It is only in the privacy of a room where you can sit down and look at those strategic, lawenforcement and security issues in a rather bipartisan way that you can create a reporting document that goes to your colleagues and can inform a debate that actually leads to changed outcomes. That was very successful and it also involved some people of courage. I note the tributes that have already been paid to the member for Macquarie in his former role as attorney. There was also the former Chief Minister of the ACT who took a position which was contentious and, I thought, courageous at different stages. Without people in this parliament who are prepared to be contentious and courageous from time to time this assembly does not do any good work. But that is not the only thing that works. It is also the work that is done by the joint committees acting responsibly, often without anyone sighting their discussions. For quite obvious reasons-if you are discussing the strategic orientation of intelligence services or law enforcement, these are not matters necessarily that will be discussed in public-many of their hearings are in camera. It is in those calm meetings, without the flourish of public attention, that much good work is also done, and the balance has come out well. I congratulate the attorney, who is with us today, on continuing to be receptive to hearing the concerns of his colleagues on all sides of the chamber. This is a set of issues that concerns not merely those with Labor and Liberal allegiances but also Independents, Greens and all those others who make up this rather healthy and ferocious democracy of ours. MAIN COMMITTEE I should not take any greater time because, in a sense, we are all agreed and there is no necessity to repeat much of the debate that has already been had on this set of legislative measures, but I do hope that at some stage we also take the opportunity to look at an overall assessment of the number of parliamentary committees and whether it might be time for some serious strategic attempt perhaps to reduce the number of those committees but also to strengthen the resources available to them so that they can do the focus work that they need to undertake. This is a really important area of parliamentary oversight that we have now added, that of the Australian Federal Police, but it is a large one. When the Keating government was in office they established an organisation called the Office of Strategic Crime Assessments which had a relatively short life and I think published only two reports. The idea of that was to look at the strategic forward settings for where our law enforcement efforts should be most focused. At that time it was looking at over the horizon threats from Russian organised crime and various other anticipated threats that we might be subject to. The issues of our present day, which we are perhaps not sufficiently focusing on, are economic crimes. There is a conference to be held in Lisbon in about four weeks’ time under the auspices of the International Society for the Reform of Criminal Law, focusing on the threat to the nation state of economic crime. That might be a very important area for this committee to look at in terms of the policy settings and resourcing of the Australian Federal Police. But if those committees are not properly resourced and if members of parliament belong to too many committees such that they cannot undertake their appropriate supervisory work with the rigour and support that is required, then these processes really will become lip service rather than truly effective. I do think it is time. I understand that each area of policy calls on the establishment of a committee, and the like, but the number of parliamentary committees has grown enormously and the resources for each committee-by way of secretarial and research assistance-have diminished accordingly. The resources have not increased. To make this sort of committee work you need parliamentarians who are prepared to devote a significant amount of their parliamentary service to it, as they do always on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. As a member of that committee for a number of years, I witnessed the very intense and careful work of members because they knew that it was a crucial committee that needed very significant attention. People who came onto that committee took it terribly seriously, as did those who came before them. Equally, this committee will not work unless people give it the same kind of significant attention. I think it is perhaps something for future parliaments, as I get ready to transform from a rooster to a feather duster in some months’ time-certainly before April next year-when the next election is held. I suppose as a parting comment to those who will be ongoing, as the member for Lyne will be, it is worth considering whether the number and resources of committees have been become such that the truly important work of these committees in their supervisory and oversight roles cannot be adequately resourced. With those remarks, I commend the Attorney for this legislation and I commend all members who have participated in such a constructive way. I acknowledge that the heartbeat of this House is often not seen by the community. The heartbeat of this House is the work that is MAIN COMMITTEE done quite often unseen and which results in improved outcomes through the collaborative work of these committees. I thank the chamber. ourable members for their contributions to the debate on the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 and also the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement Bill 2010. BeforeI make my concluding remarks regarding the bill, I will just address some comments that have been raised during the course of what was overall a very constructive debate. The member for Stirling referred to changes to the definition of a terrorist act and the creation of a terrorist hoax offence in the Criminal Code. The honourable member is correct that these proposals were included in the discussion paper released last year for consultation. However, I should clarify that while the government is still pursuing these amendments they are not included in the bill due to required changes to state and territory referral legislation that are being considered by the states. The process is ongoing and we will look to introduce these amendments in a separate piece of legislation in due course. The member for La Trobe made some comments about criminal gangs and suggested that the Prime Minister had not been tough on crime. MightI draw the honourable member’s attention to the criminal association offences recently introduced by the government in the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill 2010 and Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill (No. 2) 2010 and, indeed, the range of measures in those bills which are now acts of parliament. Also, the member, with respect, should note the Commonwealth Organised Crime Strategic Framework, which I launched last year. I indicate that Australia, together with attorneys from the United States, Great Britain, Canada and New Zealand, is progressing the fight against organised crime at an international level. The government takes the threat of serious and organised crime very seriously. In addition to those measures, some $14 million has been allocated in this budget to the establishment of a new criminal fusion centre together with $23 million to improve the resources that are available to AUSTRAC to assist in the fight against organised crime. More broadly addressing issues raised in the debate, I remind the House that the government provided in this current budget $1.1 billion over four years to strengthen Australia’s national security. That is part of a broader package of $4.3 billion in addition to funding incorporating national security, border protection, aviation security and measures in support of Australia’s Defence Force. The member for Lyne raised more generally that any response to national security must be consistent with and, indeed, underpin the rule of law. In turn, of course, the rule of law is a hollow concept if it is not accessible. That lack of accessibility to redress grievances can itself be a source or cause of alienation of some sectors and individuals in the community, which in turn can be the start of the process of radicalisation. I do not think it is drawing too far a bow to say that the involvement of the government in providing legal services to communities is at the heart of an effective legal system and, indeed, one on which the rule of law is based. In that respect, the federal budget included $154 million for legal assistance services. I am informed that this is the largest and most significant injection of new funding into the legal assistance sector in well over a decade. I am pleased to report to the member for Lyne that the government will be allocating $200,000 per annum over the next three years to assist with the establishment of a community legal centre in the mid-North Coast region. MAIN COMMITTEE",149,Parliamentary Joint Committee On Law Enforcement Bill 2010
233,Mr Mcclelland (Barton,"Attorney-General) (6.58 pm)-in reply-I also thank honof the recent mid-North Coast legal needs analysis report, which was drawn to my attention by the member for Lyne. It found that the mid-North Coast region has one of the highest levels of social disadvantage in New South Wales. The population well and truly exceeds, by comparison, the population of the ACT or, indeed, the Northern Territory or, for that matter, for the member for Denison, Tasmania, where there are far more extensive services. In each of those three other locations there are far more extensive resources available for legal assistance. I commend the member for Lyne for being such a vigorous and effective advocate on behalf of his constituents for greater access to community legal services to improve access to justice on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. It was certainly an argument that was well put and well advocated but also deserving. In concluding my remarks, these two bills comprise a package of reforms to Australia’s national security and counterterrorism legislation aimed at ensuring our laws are appropriately targeted and accountable in their operation. The National Security Legislation Amendment Bill will implement the government’s responses to several independent and bipartisan parliamentary committee reviews of Australian national security and counterterrorism legislation, which were tabled in parliament on 23 December 2008. I join with the member for Denison in commending the work of these committees. The legislative amendments are designed to clarify and improve the operation of the treason and sedition offences in the Criminal Code; enhance and clarify law enforcement powers to investigate terrorism under the Crimes Act 1914; to provide for regular review of organisations listed under the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945; to improve the processes for protecting national security information in court proceedings under the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004; and also to extend the role of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to inquire into intelligence or security matters relating to any Commonwealth department or agency. As I indicated in the second reading speech, these measures will be in addition to, and operate alongside of, the government’s decision to appoint a reviewer of national security legislation. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement Bill will establish the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement which will replace the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission. This new committee will be responsible for oversight of the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Federal Police. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the importance of the role of the parliamentary committees, as I have mentioned and as the member for Denison has, and in particular note the valuable work conducted by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which is responsible for reviewing particular aspects of our national security agencies and other matters referred for review by the responsible minister. The PJCIS played a significant role in the legislation we have considered today by virtue of having recommended a number of changes in two reviews, which included the Inquiry into the proscription of ‘terrorist organisations’ under the Australian Criminal Code which reported in September 2007 and the Review of security and counter terrorism legislation which reported in December 2006. The establishment of the new Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement will not detract from the valuable work conducted by the Parliamentary MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Parliamentary Joint Committee On Law Enforcement Bill 2010

235,Mr Mcclelland,"I note that interjection. In allocating the funding, I note the findingsJoint Committee on Intelligence and Security. I look forward to that committee’s continued contribution to Australia’s national security. As members would be aware, both the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill and Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement Bill have been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry. I understand the committee is due to report on the bills on 15 June 2010 and I will closely consider any recommendations made by the committee in due course. The government is confident that the reforms contained in both of the bills that have been debated today deliver strong laws that protect our safety while preserving democratic rights and protecting our freedoms, consistent with the principle of the rule of law-which was the subject of my opening discussion. These measures will help prepare us for the complex national security challenges of the future. This government’s concerted efforts to continually review and refine our counterterrorism laws will ensure that the legislation is effective. It is bolstered by strong safeguards and accountability mechanisms, and it is responsive to community needs, expectations and values. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 May, on motion by Mr Albanese: That this bill be now read a second time. Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2010. The bill was introduced into the House on 12 May and is designed to ensure that owners of heavy vehicles registered under the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme, FIRS, will not pay a higher registration charge next financial year than owners of trucks registered under state or territory registration schemes. There are about 20,500 heavy vehicles registered under FIRS, a scheme designed for operators running heavy vehicles engaged in interstate operations. The scheme was established as an alternative to state based registration for heavy vehicles weighing more than 4.5 tonnes. It is designed to provide uniform charges and operating conditions for heavy vehicles engaged in interstate operations. Registration charges for such vehicles are imposed by the provisions of the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985 and are contained in the Interstate Road Transport Charge Regulations 2009. These regulations apply a formula based on a calculation MAIN COMMITTEE",153,Parliamentary Joint Committee On Law Enforcement Bill 2010
236,"Debate Resumed From 18 March, On Motion By Mr Mcclelland:",,154,Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2010
237,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Leader of the Nationals) (7.10 pm)-I rise tonight to discuss thedeveloped by the National Transport Commission, the NTC. These calculations are endorsed by Australia’s transport ministers via the Australian Transport Council. The National Transport Commission is responsible for reviewing national heavy vehicle charges and calculating an annual adjustment. These calculations, designed to capture the cost of heavy vehicles on Australian roads, were last prepared by the NTC in its 2007 Heavy Vehicle Charges Determination. These charges are applied to heavy vehicle registration charges and the road user charge, or the amount taken from the rebate that heavy vehicle operators may claim from the fuel excise. The new adjustment figure was established by the NTC in its 2010 Heavy Vehicle Road User Charge Annual Adjustment, which was agreed to by the Australian Transport Council on 30 April 2010. The opposition accepts that it is appropriate that the NTC regularly review the means by which it calculates the cost of trucks on our roads, particularly given that the mix of heavy vehicles using the road system has changed. The new adjustment rate is 4.2 per cent. Unfortunately, it seems that there are administrative complexities that mean this new rate cannot be applied without this legislation. The Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985 stipulates that regulations made under this act take effect not from when they are tabled but 15 parliamentary sitting days from when the new regulations are made. This means that a new regulation made under the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985, applying the lower rate, would not take effect until late September 2010-and even that assumes that there will be no election called by that time. As a consequence, at least 1,000 FIRS owners will be charged, under the old formula, a 9.7 per cent increase. By repealing subsection 5(6) of the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985, this legislation permits a subsequent regulation made under this act to apply immediately. The new regulation, stipulating a 4.5 per cent annual increase, could apply from 1 July 2010. It will still be a disallowable instrument and consistent with the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. If this amendment is not passed, owners of FIRS registered heavy vehicles will receive a renewal registration notice which will charge the rate as stipulated by the regulation in force-the regulation applying the old formula. This old formula would impose a charge increase of 9.7 per cent-clearly, unacceptably high. Under a 9.7 per cent increase, the owner of a typical B-double would pay an additional $808 in registration-and that is too much. Of course, it needs to be remembered that, because of changes and a phase-in of new registration arrangements for various sizes of vehicles, the 4.2 per cent will not be the figure that will apply automatically to all registration increases. Some will pay more as a result of the phasingin of newer charges. The coalition understands that state governments are now applying the 4.2 per cent increase to over 400,000 heavy vehicles registered in their jurisdiction. Obviously, if FIRS heavy vehicles remain under the old charging formula, the scheme would simply collapse. People would migrate to the place where the registration charges are the lowest. The coalition has been assured that there is no non-legislative option for remedying this problem. The Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985 does not have refund provisions, so it is not possible for the government to collect the higher registration charges calculated on the basis of the existing formula and then refund the money in excess of 4.2 per cent to the affected operators. Therefore, the coalition does not oppose the legislation. MAIN COMMITTEE I take the opportunity that this legislation provides to raise a number of other issues which I have been bringing to the attention of this committee and also to the House on occasions when legislation altering road transport charges has been before the parliament. The Rudd government raises a considerable amount of money from the heavy vehicle sector. The main source of this revenue is the road user charge or the amount taken from the rebate heavy vehicle operators may claim from the fuel excise. Currently the road user charge is levied at 21.7c per litre. This charge raises for the federal government approximately $1.4 billion every year from the heavy vehicle sector to cover the costs to our road system inflicted by trucks. There are some around who do not appreciate just what a significant contribution the road transport industry is making towards the cost of our road network and, indeed, the impact of its operations on road. Too often people in the rail transport sector, for instance, like to suggest that road transport is undercharged and that is therefore an excuse as to why rail performs poorly in competition. However, the people who make those claims do not acknowledge, it seems, that just the road user charge alone collects $1.4 billion every year from the road transport sector. That is a significant contribution, indeed, towards maintaining and upgrading roads. I think that it is time that the government committed more of the tax revenue that it receives to deal with one of the key issues our truckies on Australia’s road system face, and that is the problem of the lack of adequate roadside stops. This is a long-running issue that has been made more urgent as a result of the introduction by the Queensland, New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian governments of the fatigue management laws on 29 September 2008. These laws reduce the number of hours that truck drivers can work before they must take a break. The problem is that there are not enough rest areas where truck drivers can stop. This problem will only get worse as the number of trucks on our highways continues to increase. The problem is becoming so urgent that we are now seeing the absurd situation where drivers are unable to comply with the mandatory breaks stipulated by the fatigue management laws because there is nowhere for them to stop. It is really almost dishonest of a legislature to pass laws which require vehicles to stop but then not provide places where that can happen. In some states, it is not even a defence against fatigue management laws that there was simply no place available to stop. SoI think there needs to be greater sensitivity to the impracticality of actually abiding by some of these laws when there are inadequate places provided for roadside rest facilities. After undertaking a study of the state of Australia’s roadside rest stops, the National Transport Commission in November 2005 issued its National Guidelines for the Provision of Rest Area Facilities. This report sets out where rest areas should be built in order to comply with various road agency guidelines and cater for the needs of heavy vehicle drivers. An independent government research agency, Austroads, then audited Australia’s major highways against those guidelines. Their report showed that none of the audited routes met the national guidelines-none of them. There were particular problems in Queensland and the Northern Territory and in New South Wales. Only about half of the major rest areas on the Hume and Pacific Highways in New South Wales meet the spacing requirements of the guidelines. In fact, according to the industry, there needs to be another 900 rest areas on the 22,500 kilometres of MAIN COMMITTEE the national highway network to bring it into compliance with the national rest area guidelines. The guidelines also apply to state roads. With many of the state roads, the situation is even worse than it is on the national highways. That is why, during a parliamentary debate earlier in the government’s term, the opposition moved a series of legislative amendments to require the government to commit to the construction of 500 rest areas over the next 10 years. We are satisfied that this number of rest stops would at least bring Australia’s road network into broad compliance with the rest area guidelines. Unfortunately, the government rejected this sensible compromise that would have done much to make our roads safer. Instead, the government is pressing ahead with its so called Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. This program will provide $70 million out to 2011-12 to fund a number of rest stops. I understand that the first round of projects, with funding worth $30 million, is now fully allocated and that the second round, worth $40 million, will be allocated fairly soon. Looking through the first round of projects, I am amazed to find how few of these projects actually involve the construction of new rest areas. In fact, for New South Wales, only six new rest areas are being constructed. In the Northern Territory, three new rest areas are being built; in Queensland, seven; in South Australia, 13; and in Victoria, just one-a trailer exchange on the Western Highway in Nhill. While I commend many of the other projects, such as bridge strengthening for higher productivity vehicles, it is obvious that the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program is woefully inadequate. I want to emphasise that when the opposition raised these issues with the government we said that our future support for increases in the road user charge would be conditional on fair and reasonable progress being made on achieving the objective of providing rest stops broadly in accordance with the Australian standards. With only 30 having been constructed so far, the government is clearly falling behind its obligations in this regard. I repeat the statement that I made at that time: the government cannot count on the opposition continuing to support increases in road user charges if in fact fair and reasonable progress is not made on delivering roadside rest stops for the trucking industry, which is obliged to stop under the new fatigue regulations. Frankly, 30 or perhaps 40 or 50 over the period between now and 2011-12 is not good enough. SoI serve notice on the government once more that they will need to do very much better in that regard. I call on the government to use some of the road user charge revenue to fix this problem, and I also call on the government to stop its wasteful and reckless spending in so many other areas, which would enable resources to be allocated to an infrastructure project of economic significance such as this one. How much better would Australia have been if the government had not thrown away so much money on cash handouts worth $23 billion that disappeared without trace? What could have been done with the over $2 billion that was squandered on the Home Insulation Program? What about the $1.7 billion of taxpayers’ money that has been wasted in funding overpriced school halls? And now we have an interest bill rising to $8 billion per year. That would be enough to complete the duplication of the Pacific Highway and have some change left over. Had so much money not been wasted we could have done so much more to upgrade the national road system and to ensure that these rest areas are built. MAIN COMMITTEE These are important issues, also, for the trucking industry. RecentlyI had the pleasure of visiting the federal electorate of Dawson with the new LNP candidate for Dawson, Councillor George Christensen, whom the government was kind enough to mention in dispatches this afternoon. He is an excellent young candidate who will make an outstanding representative in this parliament. We travelled around a number of the areas of major road concern in the Mackay area and we also met with the Mackay Road Accident Action Group, which has done a fantastic job to heighten awareness in the road transport industry of the importance of safety, and developing a culture of safety within the industry. They have also identified a number of significant areas where the road conditions are contributing to safety concerns. We visited the Nebo Range, for instance. It is sometimes impossible for heavy trucks to climb up the range because the surface is so slippery. Those sorts of things are dangerous, and it is no fault of the truck driver if the truck starts to roll backwards when it should be going up, because there is not an adequate grip on the road surface. Also in those meetings, concerns about the quality, quantity and adequacy of the various truck roadside stops was raised with us very strongly indeed. The roadside stops there are often dirty and not properly maintained. Some of them do not have adequate facilities. There are women truck drivers; they are making up an increasing proportion of the drivers around the country, even in the heaviest rigs. In fact, they are prized because of their carefulness as drivers. But I was informed that at one roadside rest area the women truck drivers who pull up have to walk two kilometres to get to the ladies toilet and then walk back. That is hardly satisfactory. I notice that the member for Capricornia wandered briefly through the room a moment or so ago. This particular rest area is in her electorate. I am disappointed that she allows this sort of circumstance to continue to fester. That is only one example. There is also an issue where tourists and others choose to camp in the roadside truck stops. The tourist industry is very important, and there are lots of grey nomads who move up and down the coast, particularly at this time of year. We need to provide adequate places for them to park rather than to have them using the truck roadside stops, which are specifically designed and essentially funded by road transport operators to meet their obligations under the new fatigue management laws. So we need to have many more of these roadside stops. They need to be properly maintained. There needs to be a system of maintenance. The quality of the facilities that are provided needs to be suitable for people who are going to spend quite a number of hours there. Drivers are not stopping for five minutes under the fatigue management laws; they might be spending the whole night there, so the facilities that are provided need to be adequate for that purpose. I think it is important that the government devote sufficient funding to upgrade our national road system so that the road transport sector is able to operate efficiently. The truckers certainly contribute significantly to government revenue. They provide a vital service to our nation to move freight and goods to market and to stock the stores right around the country. Things have changed dramatically. With central warehouses and with just-in-time manufacturing techniques, the road transport sector is being required to play an increasingly important role in moving goods around the nation. So there are wider economic benefits to be gained from providing the facilities that are so important to make that sector work well. MAIN COMMITTEE It is regrettable that the government has not spent more of the stimulus money on key, productive infrastructure such as roadside stops. Far less money would have been required and it would have resulted in safer and more productive roads if the government had in fact invested in these stops much earlier. The coalition will support this legislation, but as it does so it calls upon the government to stop wasteful spending and focus instead on dealing with the sorts of infrastructure issues that I have just raised. support of bills that affect the transport industry, and today’s debate on the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2010 affords me another such opportunity. The trucking industry is the most deadly industry in this country, with five times more fatalities than its closest rival. What a dreadful statistic that is. Australia is facing a massive growth in the demand for freight transport services, with the total freight estimated to almost double by 2020. Currently, heavy vehicles operate across our country from state to state, transporting almost two million tonnes of freight. In fact, 75 per cent of that freight is carried by road. In urban areas, with their shops, warehouses and distribution centres, 90 per cent of all freight is moved by heavy vehicles. As many as 370,000 heavy vehicles operate in Australia, and in my electorate, which has the Hume Highway running through it, we see a significant portion of the heavy transport that operates between Sydney and Melbourne. The Hume Highway is the main road corridor, and a significant proportion of freight is moved between Sydney and Melbourne via the Hume Highway. It is certainly one of our busiest interstate corridors. It is estimated that 20 million tonnes of freight are moved via the Hume Highway each year. On the corridor of the Hume Highway that lies within the bounds of my electorate of Werriwa there are 6,000 heavy transport movements per day-I happen to know the statistics because we had some discussions with the previous, coalition government about getting funding approved to widen the Hume Highway in my electorate-and it is for this reason that it is so critical that the Hume Highway be widened, particularly with the bottlenecks that occur between Ingleburn and Campbelltown. I have urged this House to widen the Hume Highway on many occasions and took every opportunity when in opposition to raise the matter with the then Minister for Transport and Regional Affairs. I tried to get undertakings not for political reasons but because of the need; however, the undertakings were not forthcoming. SoI was very happy when I was able to make the case to and persuade those holding the purse strings of the Labor Party as we entered the 2007 election. They saw merit in this $140 million project. They committed to the undertaking of that project and that is precisely what has occurred. The federal government has committed $112 million, I think it is, to the widening of the Hume Highway in the very sensitive section of the highway in and about my electorate. It is fascinating that, every time. I drive down it, work is proceeding. It is about six months ahead of schedule. It is one of those things that I think is very much a success story both for the trucking and heavy transport industry and for the other road users. This is a commitment that has been delivered upon. It was not matched by the other side of politics, but it will leave a long-term, positive legacy for our transport routes. MAIN COMMITTEE",154,Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2010
238,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (7.30 Pm),"I have always taken the opportunity to speak out inI would like to pay credit to George Kypreos, Managing Director of NACE Civil Engineering, which is a local company based at Prestons-again, in my electorate. His company won the contract for widening the road. His workers are out there working on that. They are working for a local company, doing the engineering, construction and asphalting of that road. The company is also employing many local people in a range of trades. Whilst that was not provided to us as part of the stimulus package, I know what the work that is being undertaken there is injecting into my local economy. I am confident that once this project is completed it will bring considerable benefits to our community and very significant benefits to all road users. Sadly, the latest road fatality statistics are in. As I said, the trucking industry is the most dangerous industry. Twenty per cent of workplace deaths occur in the trucking industry. Horrifically, four to six people on average lose their lives in trucking related incidents each week in this country. That is in the vicinity of 280 to 300 people each year. That is someone’s son, daughter, brother, sister, mother or father ripped away in sudden, dramatic and tragic circumstances. It is not just the workers driving the trucks; it is the carnage that occurs as a consequence of those accidents. Those figures are extraordinary. Apart from the pain, suffering, loss and grief burdened by the family members concerned, I also have feelings for members of the emergency services-the ambos and the police-who have to attend those horrific accidents. Bear in mind, there is also a very real and significant economic cost as a consequence. I know that truck driving is pretty punishing work. As the member for Werriwa, I am aware of a large southern-bound truck stop on the Hume Highway-oddly enough, called Uncle Leo’s. I have been encouraged to drop in there, which I do, and talk to the drivers between 5.30 in the morning until eight o’clock at night. I know how punishing the work is, because they take the time to talk to me about it. For the ones who do not, you can still see the apprehension and the anxiety in their body language. Fatigue in that instance really does its own talking. The shadow transport minister talked about developments in trucking. To that extent he was right, and there will be a lot more. He mentioned logistics and on-time delivery. That is something that has occurred and it has changed the face of trucking in this country. When I talk to the fellows at Uncle Leo’s in the mornings, they talk to me about the ‘just on-time delivery’. They are parked there not because they are resting but because they have been given slot times, like at an airport. They have been given slot times as to when they can arrive at their destination and offload. They are, on an unpaid basis, manning these mobile storage facilities. There is a lot of frustration for those people. Particularly the owner-drivers do not like the system where they and their vehicles are being used in such a way. They are not just complying with the regulatory requirements in terms of rest breaks; this is added on top of thatwhen they can go, stop et cetera. That is one of the frustrations that these people have. It is no wonder that some of that plays out on their physical and mental condition when they are driving these heavy vehicles on our roads. When I go out there, I am normally in the company of people from the Transport Workers Union. I have to say-and this is probably not the right place for it because this is not a debate on workplace relations-that as an organisation they have been tireless in making a positive contribution to the development of health and safety in their industry, and that should not go unrecognised. In particular I would like to acknowledge Tony Sheldon, the national secretary MAIN COMMITTEE of the union, who on many of those occasions, because he actually lives not far from me, has turned up at those meetings at that truck stop. I see what they do and I see the efforts they put in to ensure that drivers see their work as professional, do not take shortcuts, and put health and safety first and foremost when they go about their business. I commend the efforts of Tony and the Transport Workers Union in leading the way in that respect in their industry. This commitment to prevent road fatalities and serious injury is obviously shared by everybody. By way of background, the Council of Australian Governments agreed in February 2008 that heavy vehicle charges should be adjusted to maintain cost recovery. This links in to the standard of our roads, which has a direct correlation to the accidents involving heavy vehicles, and the resulting fatalities that occur. In raw terms, it is about ensuring that there is an appropriate charge applied against every heavy vehicle movement and is aimed at recovery against infrastructure with respect to our roads. Essentially, it is about ensuring that heavy vehicles pay their fair share for the impact they have on our roads. This agreement that was struck with COAG was given effect through an automatic adjustment formula in the Interstate Road Transport Charge Regulations 2009 and adjustments in the heavy vehicle registration charge. They are highly dependent on the changes in the levels of spending on roads, bridges and the entire infrastructure associated with our main transport corridors. The previous speaker, Warren Truss, expressed a view that the government should spend more, but I get really irked when I hear that coming from people who were in government for 12 long years and failed to spend the money and give the matter the necessary priority when they had the opportunity. You cannot keep putting this down to the 13th year. They stand up and lecture us-‘You should do more’-but the truth of the matter is that we have done a lot. I have seen what has been done in my own electorate and the spending that is going into roads. On a broader scale, the spending that is taking place on the upgrading of our roads, bridgework and transport infrastructure is making our roads safer and, as a consequence, having an effect on the charges occurring in the heavy transport industry. The purpose of the bill before us today is to amend the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985, which imposes registration charges on 20,500 vehicles registered under the Australian government’s Federal Interstate Registration Scheme. The passage of this bill will ensure that from 1 July 2010 owners of trucks and trailers registered under the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme will pay a registration increase of only 4.2 per cent as opposed to the pre-adjusted figure, which was 9.7 per cent. As I stated, the adjustments to the heavy vehicle registration charge are highly dependent on changes in the levels of spending on and usage of the roads, bridgework and transport based infrastructure which heavy vehicles traverse. It is only fair to make this adjustment, given that spending across all levels of government has increased significantly in recent years and that an unexpected and substantial growth in the number of large vehicles would result in a potential over-recovery of $116 million in the 2010-11 period if this adjustment was not made. It should be known that all governments have agreed through their transport ministers to amend their respective charges and regulations to modify the annual adjustment formula to maintain cost recovery and therefore enable the 4.2 per cent adjustment to be made for 201011. It is only fair that the charges reflect these changes. It is a sound decision and, whilst I know the industry acknowledge the need to pay their fair share for road usage, this adjustment is a preferable outcome. What we want to see, with our roads being further improved, is a MAIN COMMITTEE consequent adjustment in the safety of heavy transport fleets as they operate across this country. I commend the bill to the House. Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (7.45 pm)-The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2010 amends the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985 and in doing so ensures that heavy vehicle owners who operate under the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme are charged with a lower registration fee from 1 July 2010 than would otherwise be the case. Those owners will not be unfairly levied in comparison with vehicle owners who are registered in the state and territory systems. The bill does this by deleting subsection 5(6) of the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985. The Federal Interstate Registration Scheme applies to those heavy vehicles engaged solely in interstate operations. FIRS provides for uniform charges and operating conditions for those vehicles rather than requiring owners to comply with a number of different state regimes relevant to the states they travel through. Those vehicles registered under FIRS are subject to registration charges set out in the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985. Those registration fees are intended to cover the fair costs arising from road usage by these heavy vehicles. COAG has previously agreed that heavy vehicle charges should be adjusted annually to maintain cost recovery. In February 2008 the Australian Transport Council, made up of all the transport ministers, adopted the 2007 Heavy Vehicle Charges Determination. This ensures that the road user charges and heavy vehicle registration charges achieve cost recovery from the heavy vehicle industry for its fair share of road infrastructure and maintenance costs incurred by governments in Australia. In 2009 an agreed automatic adjustment formula was included in the Commonwealth Interstate Road Transport Charge Regulations for that year for application to the 20,500 heavy vehicles registered under the FIRS. That automatic annual adjustment to heavy vehicle registration charges applies from July of every year. Adjustment to the heavy vehicle registration charges depend heavily on changes to the level of spending on roads and bridges and on changes in road usage by heavy vehicles. When factors such as the increased expenditure on roads and growth in the number of higher productivity heavy vehicles on those roads were fed into that automatic adjustment formula, the result showed a higher than necessary increase to the registration charge to apply from 1 July 2010. If no adjustment was made the automatic annual adjustment formula would result in a registration charge increase of 9.7 per cent for the coming financial year. The federal government would be therefore recovering more money than was necessary in the current conditions from heavy vehicle owners registered under the FIRS. It was estimated that the potential national over-recovery through the registration increase would amount to $116 million in 2010-11. When this became apparent all transport ministers agreed to amend their respective charges legislation to ensure fair treatment for the trucking industry and to avoid a situation where the industry was being effectively overcharged in a way that was contrary to the original intent of the Heavy Vehicle Charges Determination. Amendments have been made to relevant legislation to ensure that the formula neither undernor overcharges the trucking industry and that this should be put into effect from July 2010. This of course is something that will be welcomed by the trucking industry as it is those owners and operators who will benefit from the reduced registration increase now calculated under the adjustment formula.The adjusted figure has been calculated by the National TransMAIN COMMITTEE port Commission and reflects the changes in the heavy vehicle mix on our roads that in turn changes the demands on our road network and the cost recovery equation. As it turns out, the adjusted registration increase is only 4.2 per cent for the next financial year as opposed to the original 9.7 per cent increase. This is good news for the trucking industry. All governments have agreed to an amended calculation of a 4.2 per cent annual adjustment to take effect from 1 July this year. The states and territories are set to implement that change for the vehicle owners registered under their respective systems. The problem for the federal government and those owners with vehicles registered under the FIRS is section 5(6) of the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act. That subsection specifies that any regulation made for the purpose of section 5-and section 5 deals with the amount of charge-must not take effect earlier than the first day after the end of the disallowance period. The operation of section 5(6) means that it prevents amended regulations that would lower the annual registration charges adjustment, from a 9.7 per cent increase to a 4.2 per cent increase, from coming into effect from 1 July 2010. The reference in the subsection to the first day after the end of the disallowance period means that it would be late September before regulations putting in place the lower registration amount could come into effect for the benefit of FIRS registered owners. Clearly, that section seeks to give protection to vehicle owners by providing that changes to the relevant registration charge must not happen without due parliamentary scrutiny. In this instance, however, the change will have the effect of reducing the registration fee, and the operation of section 5(6) will have the perverse outcome of leaving those registered under FIRS paying a 9.7 per cent increase in their registration while owners of vehicles registered under state systems can pay the lesser adjustment of 4.2 per cent immediately from 1 July. If left unchanged this would affect over 1,000 FIRS vehicle owners who would be charged the higher 9.7 per cent registration increase, rather than the proposed 4.2 per cent increase, because the adjusted charge would not come into effect until late September. It is very important to note that the current act has no refund authority. There is no mechanism by which the government could return to the vehicle owners the overpayment of registration they would effectively be making for the period from 1 July 2010 till late September 2010. That is why the government has proposed this bill, to deal with the situation and ensure that heavy vehicle road users pay their fair share towards the cost of maintaining and improving our roads and that they are not hit unfairly by an over-recovery. The bill will allow the new regulation to take effect from 1 July 2010 and will see FIRS owners paying the lower 4.2 per cent annual adjustment from that time. I am sure we have the support of the opposition for this fair and sensible amendment. This area of heavy vehicle registration charges illustrates the level of agreement and cooperation between the different levels of government as we try to streamline the regulation and administration of our road transport sector. Governments recognise the importance to industry of uniform standards and legislation to make life easier and more productive for heavy vehicle drivers and owners who currently have to understand and comply with multiple sets of rules and regulations at various levels of government. Under the Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Road, Rail and Intermodal Transport, the National Transport Commission has been given the job of producing model legislation for state and federal governments and for overseeing the implementation of agreed reforms. The owners MAIN COMMITTEE and drivers of Australia desperately need greater national consistency in road transport laws in areas such as heavy vehicle registration charges, carriage of dangerous goods and road rules more generally. I am pleased to see that COAG has agreed that by the end of 2012 Australia will have a single national heavy vehicle regulator with responsibility for regulating all vehicles over the weight of 4.5 tonnes. That regulator will administer national heavy vehicle laws and the registration scheme. One area that we absolutely must get right in both the content of regulation and its enforcement is fatigue management. This was brought to my attention just last week in a meeting with representatives from Kalari, Peter Renton and Margi Keyworth. Kalari is a major operator in the transport business and their trucks are a familiar sight on Central Queensland roads as they provide a vital service to the mining operations in our region, especially when it comes to transporting explosives. Peter and Margi came to see me last week to make me aware of some trouble that they have had with the operation of the Transport Operations (Road Use Management-Fatigue Management) Regulation 2008. This is of course a Queensland government regulation but it is based on the model regulations produced by the National Transport Commission. One of the key requirements of the regulation is for drivers to maintain and have in their possession when they are driving a work diary that records relevant work activities that contribute to fatigue. Those work activities include things like driving a fatigue regulated heavy vehicle; instructing or supervising another person to drive a fatigue regulated heavy vehicle; perform another task, such as loading things onto or unloading from the vehicle; inspect, service or repair the heavy vehicle; clean or refuel the heavy vehicle. The list in the regulations of what amounts to work for the purposes of the law is pretty broad and comprehensive. Peter and Margi are very supportive of this kind of regulation and see fatigue management and proper supervision and care for their drivers’ safety as an important part of their role within Kalari. The problem for them has been in the interpretation and enforcement of the regulations. At the end of last year one of their drivers was pulled up by an officer from Queensland Transport and he was asked to present his work diary. It is part of the management policy of Kalari that drivers record work activities beyond those listed specifically in the regulation, because those managers are of the belief that managing their drivers means being aware of all the things in their day that might cause them to be fatigued when they get behind the wheel of their truck. When their drivers are hauling loads of explosives, who could blame them for being super cautious and going beyond the minimum required when it comes to recording activities in the work diary? One section of the regulations talk about work, including performing another task relating to the operation of a fatigue regulated heavy vehicle. It goes on to list some examples. Kalari chooses to interpret that section very broadly as part of fully managing fatigue in their drivers. It means that their drivers record things like-and I will paraphrase from an email I got from Margi-travel in a company vehicle for about 30 minutes from where they are staying out to a mine site before they start their shift, arrival at the mine site, before they get into a heavy vehicle, and attendance at a start-up meeting, which can be up to one hour long. Kalari has taken the view that those sorts of things should be recorded in the work diary. The problem is that the Kalari driver who was pulled over last year was warned that he was in breach of the regulations for having those sorts of things in his work diary and that the enMAIN COMMITTEE try in his work diary actually amounted to an infringement of the regulations. Queensland Transport informed Kalari it was an offence under section 105. This was understandably very distressing to the driver, who after all needs to stay on the road to earn his living, and Kalari want to know why he and they should be under threat of penalties for going beyond the minimum requirements of the regulations when they judge that to be part of fulfilling their duty of care to their drivers and other motorists. The message from Peter and Margi was that, as we move towards uniform national regulation of things like fatigue management, those regulations should be seen as minimum standards, and transport operators should be encouraged to go beyond those minimum standards when it comes to managing their drivers. It is also important that the eventual national laws are interpreted consistently and enforced consistently from state to state or place to place around Australia. I hope that this point of difference between Kalari and Queensland Transport can be worked out quite easily, and I will certainly be helping Kalari to have those discussions with Queensland Transport, but I guess it is a message to us that governments need to do everything we can to remove the complexity that is currently in the regulation of this important industry. That is what this bill does in its small way, and I commend it to the House. for Capricornia in relation to what she was talking about in her contribution about the safety of drivers, particularly interstate owner-drivers. It is something I know the Transport Workers Union and Tony Sheldon have been campaigning on for a long, long time. They have been particularly concerned about the pressure, from not so much the owners of the trucking companies but the suppliers, on owner-drivers in particular to meet the sorts of time lines that they are often expected to meet. Sometimes, looking at the sorts of trips they take and the times that are set out there, it is simply impossible for a driver to get adequate rest. The member for Capricornia also raised these issues in an example from her electorate. These are important issues that we need to make sure we address. Two weeks ago I was at a ceremony at Ourimbah, commemorating workers who had passed away in the past year. Unfortunately, the largest group was truck drivers. It is an occupational hazard and one that we need to be working on. People should be able to go to work in safety. We need to always be mindful of what we expect truck drivers to do. I commend the Transport Workers Union, who for many years have put a lot of pressure on in relation to these issues and they are slowly making some progress. Tony Sheldon should be commended for that campaign. The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2010, which I rise to support today, will ensure that heavy vehicle owners who operate under the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme are not unfairly levied with higher registration charge increases next financial year compared with vehicle owners who are registered in state or territory systems. The bill will ensure that from 1 July 2010 heavy vehicle owners of trucks and trailers registered under the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme will pay a registration increase of only 4.2 per cent instead of the 9.7 per cent that was planned. The bill proposes a minor technical amendment to delete subsection 5(6) of the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985.

239,Mr Craig Thomson (Dobell) (7.59 Pm),"It is a great pleasure to follow the memberInterstate Registration Scheme to recover the cost of road usage by heavy vehicles. Subsection 5(6) of the act specifies that any regulation made for the purpose of section 5-amount of charge-must not take effect earlier than the first day after the end of the disallowance period. The effect of subsection 5(6) is that it prevents amended regulations that would lower the annual registration charges adjustment from a 9.7 per cent increase in registration charges to a 4.2 per cent increase from coming into effect on 1 July 2010. Instead, the adjusted lower charge would come into effect after 15 parliamentary sitting days from when the new regulations are made, which would not be until late September 2010. This would affect over 1,000 vehicle owners who would be charged the higher 9.7 per cent registration increase determined automatically under the current regulations rather than the proposed 4.2 per cent increase, because the adjusted charge would not come into effect until late September. There is no administrative option available to deal with this issue. The act does not provide a refund power that would enable vehicle owners charged the 9.7 per cent increase to have the difference returned to them. Deleting subsection 5(6) will not in any way remove parliamentary scrutiny. The provisions of part 5 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 that facilitate scrutiny by parliament will still apply to amendments to the regulations. Those provisions would still operate to disallow an amendment to the regulations that came into effect on 1 July 2010. The bill will help implement the agreements by COAG that heavy vehicle charges should be adjusted annually to maintain cost recovery. In February 2008 the Australian Transport Council adopted the 2007 Heavy Vehicle Charge Determination, which ensures that the road user charge and the heavy vehicle registration charge achieve cost recovery from heavy vehicle industries for their fair share of the infrastructure and maintenance costs incurred by governments in Australia. In 2009, an agreed automatic adjustment formula was included in the Commonwealth Interstate Road Transport Charge Regulation 2009 for application to the 20,500 heavy vehicles registered under the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme. The automatic annual adjustment to heavy vehicle registration charges applies from 1 July each year. Adjustments to the heavy vehicle registration charge depends heavily on changes in the level of spending on roads and bridges and on changes in road usage by heavy vehicles. Road expenditure across all levels of government has increased significantly in recent years. At the same time there has been substantial growth in the number of higher productivity heavy vehicles using the road network. The effect of these factors in the current automatic annual adjustment formula results in a registration charge increase of 9.7 per cent and in a potential national over-recovery of $116 million from heavy vehicle owners and operators in 2010-11. All transport ministers agreed to address this over-recovery at their meeting of 30 April 2010 by amending their respective charges legislation to ensure that the formula neither undernor overcharges the trucking industry. They also agreed that the industry should benefit from this low adjustment from 1 July 2010. State and territory governments will implement the adjusted 4.2 per cent registration charge increase from 1 July 2010. The adjusted 4.2 per cent figure has been calculated by the National Transport Commission following appropriate adjustments to the current charges formula to address any over-recovery resulting from changes in the heavy vehicle fleet mix. The National Transport Commission undertook public consultation on the proposed charges MAIN COMMITTEE adjustment, consistent with requirements under the relevant legislation. It would be fair to say that the industry acknowledges it needs to pay its fair share for road usage and that the 4.2 per cent adjustment is a preferable outcome for it rather than the adjustment of 9.7 per cent. The legislative action will leave up to $800 per vehicle in the pockets of operators at a time when our economy is recovering from the worse global recession in 75 years. Heavy vehicle registration fees are adjusted annually in accordance with a formula contained in the regulation we are now seeking to replace. The new regulation, with an amended formula, will make sure the trucking industry continues to pay its fair share of the costs associated with maintaining and upgrading the nation’s road network, and not a cent more. The existing formula underestimated the growth in the number of B-doubles that has occurred since it was first developed. As well as restoring the fair share principle, the reforms implemented by the Rudd government in 2008 slashed registration charges for the owners of smaller trucks, which constitute a fifth of the nation’s almost 375,000 heavy vehicles. It is worth noting that even after the subsequent annual increases the owners of these trucks are still paying less today than they were in 2007. In the years ahead, all operators in the trucking industry will benefit from our decision to more than double the federal road budget, an investment that will deliver safer, less congested highways and major arterial roads. The principle of cost recovery has been broadly agreed by all governments and industry, and the charges aim to recover, not overrecover or under-recover, the heavy vehicle industry’s share of aggregated government road expenditure. I mentioned earlier that many thousands of heavy vehicles pass through my electorate on the New South Wales Central Coast, where we have a major highway-the F3. It is important that we keep these trucks moving as efficiently as possible. On many occasions I have been to the truck stop just off Sparks Road to talk to truck drivers about their experiences and how they are coping with the costs that they have in keeping their rigs on the road. This sort of legislation is important to make sure that they pay their fair share, but not more than that. The government also recognises the need for balance between road and rail freight. Like so many of our other major highways and national roads, the F3 is shared by commuting motorists in their private or company vehicles and the large heavy vehicles that we are talking about today in this bill. There have been many incidents on our major road link, and most recently we again heard the collection of frustrating stories from motorists trying to get home to the Central Coast in peak hour but stuck on the freeway because of an accident involving a heavy vehicle. On the last occasion they were stuck for more than nine hours. The government has committed funding to improve the Sydney to Brisbane rail link. Improving rail links on this major freight corridor will make rail more competitive for moving freight and it will take some of the pressure off our major roads. The government has already spent $15 million to accelerate planning and design work on its $840 million investment on a new dedicated freight line between North Strathfield and Gosford. A dedicated freight line will mean a number of things: more room for passenger trains on the existing line and more freight services on the dedicated line, bringing with it increased capacity and therefore more competition with road freight. Of course, if there is less road freight because there are more rail freight services it means there will be less heavy vehicle traffic on major links like the F3. MAIN COMMITTEE In the meantime, governments have been spending more on roads. More and heavier vehicles have been using roads. The charges need to reflect these factors. This government is working successfully through COAG with all states and territories to deliver national streamlined heavy vehicle regulation that will provide an even, certain and transparent playing field for the heavy vehicle industry. We need to be sure that this extends to all areas of industry operations, including registration charges. The passage of this bill is necessary to ensure that federally registered vehicles will not be differently and unfairly charged compared to vehicles registered under state or territory law. The bill will ensure that heavy vehicle owners who operate under the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme are charged with a lower registration charge-4.2 per cent-from 1 July 2010 and this has been made possible thanks to all of the transport ministers agreeing to address the potential over-recovery at their meeting of 30 April 2010. As mentioned, they have amended their respective charges legislation to ensure the formula neither undercharges nor overcharges the trucking industry. It is great to see that all states and territories working together with the federal authorities have been able to achieve this outcome. I commend the bill to the House. pm)-I rise to speak on the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2010. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985, which imposes registration charges for heavy vehicles registered under the Australian government’s Federal Interstate Registration Scheme, by deleting subsection 5(6). Subsection 5(6) prevents regulations from coming into effect earlier than the first day after the end of the disallowance period. Deleting this provision will enable subsequent regulation amendments that reduce the 2010-11 annual automatic charge adjustment from 9.7 per cent to 4.2 per cent to take effect from 1 July 2010. I thank members for participating in this debate. In particular I thank the Leader of the Nationals for his observations. Unfortunately, in the process of his observations he left it necessary for me to make some substantial corrections. He claimed that the New South Wales and Queensland state governments have let truckies down by mishandling fatigue laws and have not provided enough rest stops. That is true. The model fatigue legislation was agreed to by transport ministers at a meeting in February 2007, which was chaired by the then minister for transport, Mark Vaile. However, the Howard government, which sponsored those laws, put no money into rest stops. Once again the Leader of the Nationals has tried to rewrite history and airbrush the neglect and failings of the Howard government from our memory. The Leader of the National Party’s empty rhetoric is again exposed when it comes to road safety. The coalition opposed our $70 million heavy vehicle safety and productivity package-$70 million more than was spent by the Howard government over 12 years. They opposed our additional $150 million to improve safety at rail level crossings as part of the economic stimulus package. They opposed our additional $150 million to the black spots program to fix dangerous sections of the road network. The Rudd government has doubled road funding under the Nation Building Program to improve the road network and make up for 12 years of underinvestment by the former government. The story continues. The opposition had promised 500 rest stops over a 10-year period. Those 500 rest stops, we are now told, have been discontinued as part of cost-saving measures announced last week. MAIN COMMITTEE",165,Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2010
240,Mr Gray (Brand,"Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia) (8.10SoI thank members for participating in this debate. Heavy vehicles should pay their fair share of road infrastructure and maintenance costs incurred by governments. This is a principle that has widespread support including from industry and from unions, otherwise they get an unfair advantage over other transport businesses. Transport ministers agreed in February 2008 that heavy vehicle charges should be adjusted annually to maintain cost recovery and to keep the size of adjustment adjustments manageable. Under the current charging formula contained in the regulations, increased road spending and substantial growth in the number of higher productivity vehicles would result in an annual adjustment to heavy vehicle charges of 9.7 per cent. However, this over-recovers by $116 million. Transport ministers agreed to address this by implementing an adjusted annual increase of 4.2 per cent from 1 July 2010. This adjusted increase will be contained in new regulations to be made shortly. However, subsection 5(6) of the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act prevents this lower charge from coming into effect until the end of the parliamentary disallowance period, which is late September. This affects over a thousand heavy vehicle operators who would continue to be charged the higher rate. The bill will delete subsection 5(6). This will enable the regulation to lower the charges to take effect from 1 July 2010. The bill does not remove the scrutiny of parliament; an amended regulation that comes into effect on 1 July can still be disallowed. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 March, on motion by Mr Bowen: That this bill be now read a second time. surance Contracts Amendment Bill 2010. The coalition supports these amendments to the Insurance Contracts Act. The amendments arose from a process started by the former government-the Howard coalition government-and will aid the efficiency and coverage of insurance laws in Australia. In government, the coalition held a review into the operation of the Insurance Contracts Act in 2004, which concluded that the act continues to operate effectively as an instrument regulating the formation and operation of insurance contracts. However, the review did recommend some minor changes which would be beneficial, given the passage of time since the act was originally enacted, developments in the insurance market since that time, and judicial interpretation of the act’s provisions. The coalition released a draft exposure of amendments to the Insurance Contracts Act in February 2007 with the intention of working with the industry to refine the legislation. To the current government’s credit, it upheld this process and has brought forward a bill that has been accepted by those in the industry and consumer groups as comprising important amendments to insurance laws. MAIN COMMITTEE",168,Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2010
241,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (8.15 Pm),"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the InThe bill makes changes to rules regarding third party beneficiaries, the duty of good faith, bundled insurance contracts, the duty of disclosure, and remedies, each of which I will discuss in turn. The bill also makes some minor amendments to laws regarding subrogation, and the electronic communication of insurance contracts and contractual obligations. Firstly, new definitions will be inserted into the Insurance Contracts Act to ensure that individuals who have rights under a contract of insurance, but who are not the insured, have access to particular rights and obligations currently held by insureds. This includes giving third parties the right to claim against the insurer where the third party has a claim of damages against the insured, who cannot be found or who has died. ASIC will now have powers to bring representative actions on behalf of third-party beneficiaries, and will have the power to commence or continue representative action on behalf of an insured where that party has suffered damage or there has been a breach of the Insurance Contracts Act. Remedies for misrepresentation and non-disclosure will be available in relation to contracts of life insurance offered as part of a group scheme and unrelated to superannuation. In terms of the duty of utmost good faith in insurance contracts, the act will be amended to ensure that a failure to comply with the duty is a clear breach of the act. This duty is also extended to third-party beneficiaries where the contract has already been entered into by the respective parties. The bill will allow bundled insurance contracts that include insurance cover for compulsory workers’ compensation purposes and cover for liability to employees at common law arising from employment-related personal injury exempt from ambit of the Insurance Contracts Act. However, bundled contracts will be ‘unbundled’ so that a contract of insurance that includes elements of cover exempt from the Insurance Contracts Act as well as cover that falls under the Insurance Contracts Act is treated as exempt from the act only in respect of the exempt elements. The bill also makes a number of changes to the duty of disclosure obligation placed on insurers. For instance, the mixed objective-subjective test in section 21 for whether an insurer has breached a duty is clarified by including a non-exclusive factor to which the court may have regard when determining whether a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to know a matter was relevant to the decision of the insurer. This factor involves the nature and extent of the insurance cover under the contract. Insurers will be prevented from asking ‘catch-all’ questions relating to the risk of the contract as a means of avoiding the duty, and must ask specific questions with relation to each aspect of the risk involved in the contract. This must occur both on formation and renewal. With regard to remedies, the bill makes a number of minor changes. These include having the insurer change the expiry date of a life insurance contract where that date has been incorrectly stated by the insured and extending the framework for the cancellation of general insurance contracts to include life insurance contracts. Finally, an insurer will be able to avoid a contract to which these remedies apply on the basis of non-disclosure or misrepresentation only if the insurer would not have entered that particular contract on any terms. I commend these amendments to the Insurance Contracts Act, but I also question the government’s commitment to reform of red tape and taxation treatment affecting the insurance industry sector. We all know that the Rudd government loves tax. Tax allows them to spend all the taxpayer money they want and to win votes, and when the money runs out they simply MAIN COMMITTEE introduce new taxes. Is it any wonder that the recommendation in the Henry review, which offered real reform of taxation treatment afforded to various entities in Australia, were ignored? It is recognised by most involved with the industry that taxation collected on insurance contracts involved too much of a regulatory burden on insurers, and this is preventing Australians from accessing much needed levels of insurance. I have mentioned many times that insurance is a positive product, the purchase of which we should be encouraging. It is not like smoking, for instance, where it could be argued that there is a community good in discouraging it. Insurance is a product-a service-which we should be encouraging the consumption of. It is quite a ridiculous situation where effectively we are levying extremely high rates of taxation on insurance, which is really counterproductive. We should be encouraging the community to have a greater take-up of insurance, not putting roadblocks in the way. We have a situation where effectively we are charging higher rates of tax on insurance products compared with similar services out in the market. We are effectively taxing the seatbelts at a higher rate than we are taxing the car, and everyone would agree that the installation of seatbelts in a car is something we would encourage. We should not be having that effect on insurance-actually discouraging people to take it up. Indeed, these very high levels of taxation and the high cost of insurance are a major deterrent to the take-up of this very important service. But, unfortunately, our state governments are very, very dependent on the cash flows that are provided by insurance. For example, in Victoria 10.1 per cent of all state taxes collected in 2006-07 were taxes on insurance. In New South Wales that figure was 6.9 per cent. The coalition introduced the GST, with the states agreeing that inefficient state taxes would be abolished. Unfortunately, many inefficient state taxes, such as insurance taxes, remain, and they continue to push up the price of premiums. It is absolutely amazing to see what this has done to the cost of premiums. For homeowners in New South Wales, for instance, the price has inflated by some 43 per cent as a result of insurance taxes. Business premiums have increased by 65 per cent as a result of taxation. Ken Henry followed a trend of many reviews of taxation at both Commonwealth and state levels by making recommendation 79 in his report, which states: All specific taxes on insurance products, including the fire services levy, should be abolished. Insurance products should be treated like most other services consumed within Australia and be subject only to broad-based consumption tax on consumption. But, as with 136 of Mr Henry’s recommendations, we have no idea what the Rudd government thinks, because they have decided to shirk any real tax reform and continue with more populist policies rather than address the very difficult issues of genuine reform within the taxation system. We have a situation where the recommendation in the Henry review was not adopted in the review and the very important issue of taxation on insurance was not addressed. Insurance companies are involved in the financial future of Australia and encouraging people to consume insurance is absolutely vital. The government’s plan for the mining tax first appeared in the press on 13 April, and since that date resources stocks have plummeted in value. We have seen resource stocks collapse by over 20 per cent in value since the mining tax was leaked to the press. This is over $90 billion being ripped out of the savings of Australians’ superannuation accounts. The government has been out there blaming the performance of MAIN COMMITTEE Australian shares on the situation in Greece, but this ignores the fact that in recent times the share market has acted as a safe haven for foreign investors, who are now staying away because of the perceived sovereign risk that the Rudd government has placed on the market. The Rudd government is also attacking foreign investors. How ironic is it that the government has finally responded to the Johnson review about turning Australia into a financial hub and encouraging foreign investment whilst at the same time it is effectively telling foreign investors in New York and London that Australia does not want them here; that we are going to impose this massive great big new mining tax, and that that mining tax will be effective retrospectively? It will have a massive impact on our sovereign risk. He is way off the bill. It is getting late; could you return to the bill before us. investment for a very large part of their income stream. And that return on investment is a factor in determining their ability to service premiums and so on. So the potential adverse impacts of that tax which I referred to previously, on investment returns for insurance companies, is an element that is relevant to insurance. CanI say, in conclusion, that we certainly concur with the legislation that has been put before the House. Would you like me to continue talking? cut you off at 8.30. has the support of the coalition. It is important, as with all legislation, that it be reviewed from time to time to ensure that it is up to date with the needs of the industry. We live in a very dynamic time for financial markets and it is important that our insurance products meet the needs of a modern society. So it is with great pleasure that I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Dreyfus) adjourned.

attendances do not include Practice Nurse items. Only health services receiving a Medicare benefit rebate appear in Medicare data sets. Where a postcode boundary overlaps different electorate boundaries, the postcode data is allocated to the respective electorates using a postcode to CED concordance file, built by the Department of Health and Ageing, using Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) population data. This assumes that Medicare postcode data is geographically distributed in the same proportions as the population was distributed for these split postcodes. This may result in some postcode-based service and funding data being allocated to an electorate different to that of the address of the service provider or user. Where possible, PO Box postcodes have been allocated to an electorate using geospatial programs and a PO Box/delivery area postcode file from Australia Post. Electorate data should not be aggregated to produce state and national totals as some postcode data cannot be allocated to electorate.. It is important to note that some people would receive assistance from services outside this electorate, and similarly services located in this electorate may provide assistance to people living in other electorates.

(formerly the Health Insurance Commission) and may not be the same as the year in which the patient received the service. These statistics relate to non-referred (general practitioner) attendances that were rendered on a fee-for-service basis for which benefits were processed by Medicare Australia. Excluded are details of non-referred GP attendances to public patients in hospital, to Department of Veterans’ Affairs patients and some compensation cases. Electorate level data should be considered as estimates only. Allocations of services are based on the reported postal address postcodes of patients. Therefore some data will not accurately reflect the address of where the patient actually resides. Where a postcode overlapped electoral boundaries, the statistics were allocated to electorate using a concordance file derived from Population Census data. This can result in some data being erroneously allocated to an adjoining electorate. Data have also been excluded if postcodes were not present on the concordance file. Postcode data recorded using a post office box or private mailbag are excluded from electorate reporting in the cases where they cannot be accurately allocated. This is notable in the electorates of Lingiari and Solomon in the Northern Territory, where approximately 25% of bulk billed nonreferred GP attendances were claimed against post office boxes or private mailbag addresses. It is important to note that some people would receive assistance from services outside this electorate, and similarly services located in this electorate may provide assistance to people living in other electorates.",172,Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2010
