WAR SITUATION. -SECRET MEETING OF SENATORS ANn Minister) [3.1] -by leave I move That a joint meeting of members of the Senate and of the House of Bepresentatives be convened for 4 p.m. this day, for the purpose nf discussing in secret the present war, and hearing confidential reports io relation thereto. In anticipation of that motion being carried a regulation has been gazetted providing that there shall be complete observance of the obligation of secrecy upon both the country and members of the legislature. That regulation reads1. The proceedings at any meeting of the Senate and of the House of Representative* convened by the Prime Minister, the President of the Senate, or the Speaker of the House of Representatives, or by any or all of thoBS persons, for the purpose of discussing iu secret the present war and hearing confidential reports in relation thereto, shall be kept secret. 2. A person shall not divulge any information made known at any such meeting, or publish or cause to be published any report being or purporting to be a report of any such proceedings, or of any portion thereoi, except a report made officially by the Prime Minister. This regulation shall not apply to any Joint meeting of members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives unless each House has curried a resolution that a joint meeting of members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives be convened for the purpose of discussing in secret the present war and hearing confidential reports in relation thereto. I put it to the House that it ia utterly impossible, having regard to the requirements of security, for all of the circumstances in relation to the present position of the war to be discussed openly in public places. That necessarily includes this chamber and another place, because of the publicity which inevitably is given to the proceedings in Parliament. less than a f u l l and frank debate, would be, in the circumstances, a travesty of what the country requires. Whatever we may do subsequently, it is at least the duty of this Parliament to know all that 1942. (Hon. W. M . Nairn) read (Fremantle-Prime Anything",8,Appropriation Act No 2 1941 42 No 30 Of 1942

2,Mr Cubtin,"can be known, and to express itself freely in respect of what is known, so that what has been, is heing, and may be done, may be reviewed, and such wisdom as may be deducible from all of it may be applied to the requirements, which are very great and involve the security of Australia. I have only to add that the trusteeship which devolves upon all of us has never previously in the history of our country been so exacting. I feel the position very deeply, but no more, I am sure, than does any other honourable member of this Eouse. I submit that the motion is a proper one, and that the procedure proposed is a necessary preliminary to any other discussions that we may have. MT. MENZIES.'-This will not exclude future public discussion? i.= carried, I propose merely to ask the House to suspend the sitting. of the Opposition) [3.2] -The Opposition wholeheartedly supports the motion. Tf it be carried, members of this House and of the Senate wall be given the opportunity to hear a frank and free disclosure of whatever information is available in relation to the war, particularly as it affects Australia; and whatever information is given will be kept in the secrecy stipulated by the regulation that the Prime Minister has read. 13.3] -It is quite true, as the Prime Minister has said, that a very heavy responsibility devolves on this Parliament to-day. But it is not a responsibility that ( Mr Hughes) has said so many times, of we have acquired' since the war with Japan began. On the contrary, it is one that goes back a long way further than that point. According to the press, it is regarded as necessary that there shall be no post-mortems in this place as to why we are in the position that we occupy. I make the pronouncement early, and I hope frankly, that I do not agree with that view. I do not concede that the busihold-up of industry"". We are entitled ness of this country, in the crisis with which we are faced to-day, can be satisfactorily settled at a secret meeting. According to the regulation, the only statement that will be permitted to issue from a secret meeting of senators and members will be such as the Prime Minister may care to make to the press. One of these days, King Compromise will cease to rule in this Parliament. When that happens, it will be necessary for the view of the Opposition to be put by the Leader of the Opposition. Therefore, I take this early opportunity of impressing upon the Leader of the Government the necessity for making some provision to enable the accredited leader of this side of the House to say to the country, after a secret meeting, those things which the Opposition considers the country ought to be told. I have never been an admirer of secret meetings. In my view, they were very important in the past for what they failed to produce rather than for the good that they did in the Parliament. .The urgent necessity today is, not that we shall go into a secret meeting, but that certain very important matters shall be discussed by this Parliament in the light of day. In order that that may be done, one or two honourable gentlemen in this place will have to go in for a little surgery, and one or two post-mortems will have to be conducted in order to discover how the patient died, whether it was by the knife, by poisoning, or in some other way. However, let me say this: there are certain vital things which it is necessary to do in this country to-day, and whilst I am not in any sense derogating from what the Government is trying to do, I say that those things have not yet been done. There is no sign of their being done, It is no longer a case, as the right honourable member for North Sydney the enemy hammering at the gates. The enemy is bombing the back door. Whilst we have seen quite a lot in the way of giving effect to certain financial proposals -som e of which we shall discuss at a later stage-w e do not hear the Government saying to the man-power of this country: ""Get to work; there are too many coal-mines idle; there is too much to demand, in view of the prospect facing us to-day, that obstructions of this kind shall not be allowed to continue. members of the Government say that they will do these things, but do not give effect to their promises.",11,Members

The sooner the House gets into open session, the sooner the people of this country are given a clear indication of what we are doing, and the sooner the Government shows that it is prepared to take necessary and vital steps, the better it will be for the defence of the country. We cannot plead, as I have heard it pleaded so many times before, that there is no enemy to worry about, or that Russia or some other country is going to fight our battles for us. We must now realize that we have to fight this battle with our ownfistsand our own brains, standing on our own big, fiat feet. Question resolved in the affirmative.

My hearing is good. What went over the air was a statement that no further cables to members of the Australian Imperial Force should be lodged at post offices. I heard no qualification as to the destination of such cables. According to a statement which the Postmaster-General (Senator Ashley) showed to me just now, there was supposed to be a qualification in respect of Malaya or Singapore. The whole thing is too stupid for words. These things should not be broadcast. If people are not to send cables to members of the Australian Imperial Force overseas, the place to stop them is at the post office: we should not give to other nations tlie idea that our cable service i . c all upset. In the present situation, any man with sense must know that Time and time again I have referred to the nature of some of our broadcasts and the gabbling that takes place. If this body was put up against the wall. Men's lives are lost, or placed in jeopardy, cast a message on the air. It is time that this matter was taken up seriously. I listened to to-night's broadcast in had too much experience as a former Postmaster-General not to know that announcers do not always give over the air the precise statement which is handed is not to take any risk. The right place to stop cables is at the post office. It would be easy to have notices there intimating that cables for certain places will not be accepted. I rose, not with any desire to create difficulties, but simply because I do know the seriousness of this sort of thing. Recently, a broadcast state-",12,Members
