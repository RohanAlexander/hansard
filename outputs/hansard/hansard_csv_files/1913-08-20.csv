Prime Minister And Minister For Home Affairs) [2.31]","The Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly is paying us a visit, and I should like to move, with the permission of the House, that he be shown the courtesy of a seat on the floor of the Chamber. By leave, I therefore move That a seat be provided on the floor of the House for the Honourable Sir Frank Madden, the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria. The alteration there made is considerable. gladly support the motion. pleased to have the honour of the visit. Question resolved in the aflirmative. Mr J. H . CATTS -As a matter of privilege, I desire to call attention to the revision of the Hansard record of an occurence in this Chamber in which I was interested last week. A number of questions were asked by me, and replied to by you, Mr Speaker, but the alteration of the proof report of your remarks has put mine out of gear, so to speak. Considerable alteration has been made in the report of your rulings. tion of privilege ? Mr J. H . CATTS -That apparently you, sir, have revised the Hansard record of the debate, and, as it was in the nature of a dialogue, questions being asked by me to whioh you replied, and further questions put based on your replies, my remarks have, in some degree, lost their seuse. I ask whether my privileges, aa a member, are not infringed by an alteration of the records of the House which causes them to convey a wrong impression. Speaker corrected the proof of his rulings? Mr J. H . CATTS -That I shall proceed to show. On page 113 is to be found a ruling, the original report of which read as followsable member to attempt to raise this question again. I have already given one or two warnings; and if another honourable member offends against my ruling I shall ask the Prime Minister to take the ordinary course. Honourable members must understand that they will not be allowed to go beyond or question the authority of the Chair, except in a regular way. If any attempt is made to defy the Chair-whic h is being done at the present timeI shall very reluctantly have to proceed to other measures. In the published report that passage, reduced to about one-third, appears as followsreferring to a matter just dealt with, I shall not allow him to attempt to evade my ruling. I have already given one or two warnings, and if an honourable member persists in flouting the Chair, I shall ask the Prime Minister lo take the ordinary course. Another ruling, according to the original We are report, was in these wordsMelbourne Ports offends again, I shall have to name him. 1 have ruled lhat he was not in order in referring to the mace. The published report on page 114 readsMelbourne Ports offends again, I shall have to name him. I have already more than once cautioned him. The reference to the mace has been cut out, and another sentence introduced. The original report of another ruling was thiswould be in order in asking a question relating to the expenditure of money by the Department over which, as Speaker, I have control; but he must not touch upon those matters which 1 have ruled must not be referred to. That appears in the number in this waywould be in order in asking a question relating to the expenditure of monev by the Department over which, as Speaker, I have control; but he must do so in a regular and proper manner. Dealing with a further ruling by Mr Speaker, I asked whether I was entitled to place on the notice-paper a question addressed to the Speaker. The original report of the reply wasNo, but the honourable member may make into any such expenditure. The published report of the ruling isber may make inquiries from the Ministers of the House in regard to any such expenditure.",12,Setup

I have not in my possession information as to all such items. them, he had better address his question to the Treasurer. If that report is read as it appears in Hansard, as you, Mr Speaker, have apparently corrected it , my questions do not have that relevancy to the matter under discussion that they would have had if the report had not been interfered with in that way. If you had desired that the matter should be put in the permanent record in a different way from what actually occurred, I should have raised no objection had I also had the opportunity of correspondingly altering my questions so as to make some of them not irrelevant to the issues being considered. honourable member's question, I would point out that the right of revision of Hansard proofs is conceded to every member, to set right matters which, owing to various causes, sometimes interruptions, and momentary confusion arisbefore the adjournment, the honourable ing therefrom, have altered the sense member for Kalgoorlie drew my attention of what was in an honourable memto a telegram he had received from Westber's mind at the time he spoke. ern Australia with reference to a doctor Of course, the Speaker has to be paron board an Orient mail steamer.

44,Mr Poynton,"It may be a coinciabout time that the cant and humbug in reference to the pledge of the Labour party was dropped, since the Liberal party has practically copied our method. During the speeches which we have heard from the other side, certain memories have been brought to my mind. Reminiscences of old times, when there were no Labour agitators, and practically nothing was done to help those who were down-trodden, have beeu revived. I u those days there were no paid agitators to take up the cudgels on behalf of the working men of this country. There was no Australian Workers Union or rural workers' organizations then. They were grand times indeed . I speak of some forty odd years ago. I have had experience, and, perhaps, a little of my experience would be interesting to some of our friends opposite, and might throw a new light upon their ideas. In those grand old days in the Eumeralla district in the western part of Victoria, the squatters used to get their shearing done for 10s. per hundred. I have myself shorn sheep for 12s. 6d. per 100. The law of tbe survival of the fittest was in force in those good old times, as it would be now if some persons could bring it into operation again. It was my misfortune to have to go out into the world and battle for a living under the conditions prevailing in those times. father met with an accident which left him crippled for the remainder of his life, and. as the eldest of the family, I was obliged, with the brother next me, lo go out and seek for work. I refer to those good old times again when Graham Berry -h e was not Sir Graham Berry thenwas trying to bring about some reform of Eocial conditions in Victoria. A f t e r travelreduce the Tariff duties on harvesters, for ling hundreds of miles with my swag, seeking honestly and earnestly for work, I discovered that there was a conspiracy on foot to prevent the employment of any but those whose services could not actually be done without. Throughout the different districts of the State, the municipal and shire councils, who were dominated by the squatting interests of those days, had shut down on every class of work that could be avoided or postponed. I was told, not once, but quite a number of times, "" G o to Berry and get work "" and I was even told to go to Berry and get a feed. I remember that when I came to Carramballac station, owned by Mr Chirnside, he wanted a carriage-drive made. A f t e r meting out to my brother and myself our evening supply, consisting of a flap of raw mutton and a pannikin of flour, Mr Chirnside asked us whether we had any knowledge of roadconstruction. It so happened that we had, and he then said, "" I want some one to make a carriage-drive into the place."" We got to work, and can honourable members say how much a week we got for our labour? We received 10s. a week. Those were the wages given in those grand old times. I can remember also travelling later when there was some rising of country workers, and I called at one very large station which employed something like sixty shearers. I discovered that at this station there was not a bunk provided for a man to lie on. There were no mattresses, and the men had to lis on the flagged floor. If a man took a woolpack-and honourable members may know that a woolpack is not a very soft bed to lie upon-o r a dried sheep's pelt to lie upon, he was fined 2s. 6d. In those grand old times the manager of this station flashed a gold watch before a number of men and said, "" I got this out of fines last year."" Judging from some of the speeches to which we have listened, there are some persons who would like to get back to those good old times, but let My me tell them that they are living now in a different age. As some of our honourable friends seem anxious to know where I am on this amendment, I may say, in order to relieve their anxiety, that, despite the reference to the revision of the Tariff, I am going to vote for it . I shall be glad to have an opportunity to revise the Tariff. I should like very much to instance, and on some other classes of agricultural machinery. I should like an opportunity to assist in placing upon the free list quite a number of items of raw material, the duties now imposed upon which hinder and hamper the manufacturer. I should also like an opportunity to revise the duties now imposed upon many of the requirements of the people. When the honourable member for Darling referred to the Harvester Commission, the prices he quoted were questioned, but I have bere the report of the Commission, and let me tell honourable members that, at the time the Commission sat, harvesters were being sold in Melbourne at from £ 7 0 to £ 7 3 ; in Adelaide up to £ 8 1 ; in Brisbane at £ 8 0 ; in Sydney at from £ 7 3 to £ 7 4 ; and in Perth at £ 8 2 . The Commission secured an examination of these machines by no less an authority than Mr Woodroffe, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Newport Workshops. As some honourable members may be aware, we secured some of these machines, which were taken to pieces, and the cost of manufacture and value of each piece carefully worked out. stripper harvesters, one of Deering's, and one of the International Harvester Company's. d r ill , and a locally-made d r ill . We asked from customers who purchased agriculMr Woodroffe to give us the prices at which these instruments could be turned out at the Newport Workshops. plain that. We submitted two propositions to Mr Woodroffe. We asked that he should give us the prices, allowing for the wages then paid by the manufacturers, and the prices allowing for wages on the scale which had, just prior to that time, been drawn up by Mr Justice Higgins. Allowing for wages in accordance with roffe estimated the cost of a Sunshine harvester at £ 4 5 , and for the imported machine £ 3 5 . The cost of manufacture of seed drills, based on the award of Mr Justice Higgins, was £ 1 8 6s. for the International and £ 2 0 4s. for the Mitchell. duty ? sent the cost at which these implements could be manufactured. being charged for them ranged up to £ 3 9 in the case of seed drills, and from £ 7 0 to £ 8 5 in the case of harvesters. alternative cost of production in the case of harvesters, based on the award of the Wages Board, was £ 4 2 15s. l i d . for the Sunshine machine, and £ 3 3 9s. 7d. for the International Harvester Company, whereas that of seed drills was £ 1 7 6s. 7d. and £ 1 9 3s. l i d . respectively. MrW . H . IRVINE -Wer e they subject to patent rights ? rights had long expired. wil l recognise that those prices are independent of the factory burden, which is estimated at 23$ per cent. burden ? set down the factory burden at 10 per cent. The Comniission inquired into the exorbitant interest charges levied by implement manufacturers upon goods sold under the time-payment system. In the case of the International Harvester Company these charges ranged from 15J to 23 per cent.; in that of the Massey-Harris Comof the Sunshine Harvester Works, from 16 to 23 per cent. In some of the States as We also secured an imported much as 53 per cent, interest was exacted tural implements on the time-payment system. I understand that since that report was presented the price of harvesters has been increased. To-day one of these machines cannot be purchased for £ 7 0 . Prices have been increased all round. Yeti t is a notorious fact that at the time the Commission made its investigations wages were very low indeed. The members of that body found it absolutely necessary to protect the good employer by recommending the adoption of some uniform method of dealing with implements which were exported to other States, because there was a margin between the wages paid in some of the States of no less than 37 per ceut. We recommended an alteration of the Constitution in order that the honest employer who was willing to extend f a i r treatment to his employees might be protected. During the course of this debate we have heard a good deal about responsible government. A t the close of the recent election there was great jubilation The prices then amongst the ranks of the Liberals, avowedly because they had been successful in restoring to this country responsible The government. We were told that for the first time in the history of the Federation we had obtained responsible government. But have we? One of the first acts of a responsible Government is to elect its own officers in Parliament. Have the Government done that? What was the position in the Senate, where the Liberal seven are supposed to exist? There the Government sat back, whilst the Labour No. The patent party elected its own officers. What is the positiou in this Chamber? The Government have submitted a printed paper setting out what they are pleased to call their policy. It is about time that they had a policy.

They cannot pass a single measure in this House without the assistance of Mr Speaker's vote.

Sir was not a party man, I suppose. casion not a great many years ago when one of the present Ministers declared publicly that lie had eaten sufficient dirt, and that he would eat no more. deserted a sick colleague, and under the pretence of being a friend, he sat in the Opposition corner, and harassed that Government until the day of its death. Yet he is not above occupying a seat on the Ministerial benches and eating dirt now. He will continue to eat d i r t until the end of the term of office of the present Ministry. I repeat that it is the obvious duty of Ministers to appeal to the country. They know perfectly well that they cannot carry one of their proposals. We are accused of wasting time by discussing this no-confidence motion. able member want to go to the country ? know well enough that they can_ do nothing with their programme, excepting, perhaps, the proposed creation of a Federal Bureau of Agriculture, in which my young friend, the Minister of Trade upon it by the Attorneyand Customs, finds so much consolation for the farmer.

But they have thrown down the gauntlet. They have foreshadowed legislation which will be in troduced clearly with the object of securThe Bulletin is responsible for ing its rejection. And yet they accuse us of wasting the time of the House. I wish now to refer to the methods of the Liberal party during the recent election camThe obvious and patriotic paign. The policy they pursued may well be described as that of the tar brush. They charged us with every crime in the Decalogue. We were subjected to slander, vituperation, and calumny by their hirelings on every platform in the Commonwealth. Our very wives and daughters were not free from their abuse. Over the signature of the Secretary of the Liberal Union of South Australia there was published, i u March last, a pamphlet entitled the Liberal Record, and in it in sults were hurled at every woman attached to us. The policy of the muckrake-the policy of the sewer-wa s resorted to. They scoured the country with which might be used against us, and they I remember an ocat last discovered what they desired in a book entitled A Week and a Day. In quoting from that work, they were not even honest in their treatment of the author. The quotation was given as "" A Woman's Views,"" and was published then under the general heading of "" Socialism."" As a matter of fact, in this quotation the writer was referring to an Atheists' Socialistic club, but these men of liberty-thes e men who profess to be fair-eliminate d the words "" A t h e is t "" and "" Club,"" and published the paragraph as pure Socialism. The press branded the Labour party as Socialists, and filthy quotations were printed with the idea that the mud thus thrown would stick to us. They spoke of our mothers and daughters as mere breeding cows. They declared that we had for them no other use than to make them breeding COOK -Does the honorcows, and that our desire was to father their offspring on to the State, instead of on to the animals who bred them. These were the tactics of members of the Liberal party. The people were told that in talking with Socialists one was astounded to find the low estimation which they placed on tlieir women folk, and they accused us",17,Governor General S Speech Address In Repl Y

61,Mr Poynton,"Yes, I do. Ministersof having done more to dishonour women than any other class had done. These were the lines they followed. Statements of this character were issued by the secretary of the Liberal organization of South Australia. They were printed in the office of the president, and circulated among all the branches. I repeat that not even our wives and daughters could be left free from insult by these gentlemen who talk of chivalry and fair play. Then, again, they accused the Labour Government of having spent every penny of Commonwealth revenue. organizers, as well as their press sup.porters, asserted that we had not left a penny in the Treasury, and that if the Liberal party were returned to office it would find empty coffers because we had spent all the revenue. Let me show how the press have treated us in this respect. It is little more than a week ago since we had from the Treasury bench a straight-out acknowledgment that when the Labour party went out of office they left a surplus of £2,500,000, in addition to £291,000 accumulated interest on the notes fund. The Argus reported the Leader of the Opposition as followsnow, before the people of Australia, that there was not an actual surplus of ^500,000, and an accumulated surplus of ^291,000? The Age did not refer to any particular amount. Its report was as followsMr Fisher said that in the Government statement there was not a single reference to the nnances, notwithstanding the attacks that had been made on the financing of the Labour Government. The Prime Minister had said many times that the Labour Government was in debt instead of having a surplus, and many people believed the Prime Minister, because he had the reputation for veracity. The Labour Government had not, as was alleged, "" spent every penny it could lay hands on."" It had, in the first_ instance, paid off the indebtedness of the previous Fusion Government. Whatever were the faults of the Labour Government, it paid its way. These newspapers told their readers, during the election campaign, that we had spent every penny on which we could lay our hands. cidence that in reporting the Leader of the Opposition's correction of that allegation one newspaper understated by £2,000,000 the surplus actually left by the Labour Government, whilst the other made no reference whatever to the amount? This is another illustration of the boasted fairness of the press. These newspapers did not like to acknowledge that the Labour Government had left a Mr Poynton. surplus, hence they sent out these mutilated reports of the debate in this House. Any outsider reading the Argus report would say, ""This is all bunkum, about Fisher's £2,500,000 surplus. The truth is that he left a surplus of only £500,000."" honourable member wish to draw from that statement ? no good. Their paid is trying to infer that which he is not prepared to say straight out, namely, that the Prime Minister made these statements to the press. to what was said by the paid organizers of the Liberal party. Some of them were candidates for the representation of South Australia in the Senate. My own opponent was a paid organizer of the Liberal party, and stated throughout the electorate that we had not only spent all the revenue, bnt had actually expended the gold received for Commonwealth notes. Is that true? Another statement made by the Liberal party was -that we had made money dearer. Sometimes they spoke with two voices, and one of their arguments destroyed the other. It was said that the Labour Government had made money scarcer and dearer by building up so large a gold reserve on the note issue. This is somewhat amusing in view of the fact that the Liberal Government propose to prevent any reduction of the gold reserve. The Labour Government never held less than 40 or 41 per cent, of gold, whereas the Act provides for only 25 per cent.; and it would appear, according to the Government programme, that it is proposed to alter the Act so as to keep more gold out of circulation, thus making it even scarcer and dearer. The Labour Government werealso accused of wholesale extravagance. This charge was made in connection with the Northern Territory; yet the other day Is it not a strange cointhe present Minister of External Affairs, when he was asked whether he thought the number of officers there was in excessof requirements, replied that he did not think so, if due regard were paid toa progressive development policy. Then it was said that at the Port Augusta works there were more bosses than mennot that there were as many bosses as men, but more.

66,Mr Poynton,"I have no doubt asreported in tlie public press; and the only loop-hole he left for himself was that whatever faults there might be were those of the Federal Parliament, for which he accepted a portion of the blame; he did not say that the works were overmanned. On this point, I have had a comparison made with the practice of the Melbourne Stevedore Company, which is regarded as one of the best balanced in Australia; and I find that thero are fewer bosses at Port Augusta than there are in the employ of that company, in proportion to the men. During the election campaign, the Labour party were regarded by the Liberal side as being social lepers, and to such an extent was that idea carried that Liberal supporters were not allowed to attend the labour meetings. It was evidently held to be a disgrace to mix with labour people, who are, as I say, social outcasts in the eyes of those who now occupy the Treasury bench. policy but a policy of abuse. after the elections, they singled out the Boothby, Ballarat, Fremantle, and Oxley constituencies, and made charges of fraud, corruption, and double voting. A Minister of the Crown, who occupies a seat in another place, in a speech he delivered, saidThey have even resurrected the dead to vote. of cases of duplicate voting. (Laughter.) The Ministry was trying to get to the bottom of it , but it was found that, while the parties who passed the Electoral Act, and were responsible for the conduct of the elections, had left as manv doors open as possible for wrong-doing, they had practically shut every door which would enable the mischief to be traced to its source. Now they were saying that they were nil anxious for an examination, and desirous of putting down wrong-doing. well, it would be seen a little later on whether these people would help an investigation. Well, there was an investigation for which the Government made their own arrangements. party, that investigation had to be carried out by the present Government. Had it been by the Labour Government, it would certainly have been described by the Liberals as a partisan affair. What was the result of the investigation? The Attorney-General, in consequence of the questions that were asked, got the Chief Electoral Officer to furnish a report, in directed at constituencies where Labour which it is statedA review of the Ballarat lists disclosed that the recent examination, I have a list of many names which had been marked twice were those persons who are supposed to have followed on the rolls by identical or similar duplicated their votes in the electorate of names, which had not been marked. There was Grey. I do not propose to mention any reasonable ground in cases of this kind for assuming that there had been errors in marking. In divisions in which the elections had been keenly contested and the polling was exceptionally heavy, it might be expected, Mr Oldham continued, that more names would be inadvertently marked in error than in other divisions, but much would, of course, depend upon the care with which individual officers performed their duties. While a margin of between two and three errors per thousand voters would not appear to be excessive, having regard to the number of similar names appearing on the rolls, it could not, of course, be assumed that where the average was either above or below fraud either had or had not entered into the elections. In some divisions, the report concluded, the whole of the apparent duplications could probably be cleared up without disclosing any fraud. In other cases, a prolonged investigation, involving the tracing of the movements on polling day of the persons concerned, would be necessary before an official pronouncement could be made. The Chief Electoral Officer here says quite clearly that a margin of between two and three errors per 1,000 voters does not appear to be excessive, and also that there was an average of less than three per 1,000 of apparent discrepancies. The The Liberal party have no Treasurer, however, never waited for eviDirectly dence; and it must be observed that all these allegations were directd against Labour seats-no t a word was said about wholesale constituencies where the Liberals were, in a majority by thousands.

When I glance down the list I find the name of a lady who is supposed to have voted at Hergott Springs, and then made her way up to Murnepowie, a distance of about 100 miles. In another case the voter is supposed to have voted in Adelaide on election day as an absent elector, and, forsooth, he is accused of having voted at Turn by Bay on the same day. I ask the honourable member for Wakefield if that was possible? have voted at the two places on the same day unless he had a flying machine. Sir body else voted for him. In this case I have no hesitation in using the gentleman's name. He is a retired farmer who lives in Adelaide, and came over about a month before the date of tiie election. elector in Adelaide, and his nephew, with .exactly the same namea farmer who lives at White's River-vote d at.Tumby Bay. one of them was marked off on the roll.

The delegates made certain reing to this document one of them is accused of having voted twice. inatter of fact, one of them voted as an absent elector at Petersburg, and the other voted farther out. The checkers mixed up the two names. They checked off one name instead of checking off the two names. You can go right through the list and find similar cases. There is the case of a man who is supposed to Iiave voted at Iron Knob, and then to have passed two polling places, and gone to a place IOD miles distant, and voted tliere too. I do not think thab in this list there is one case of personation or duplicate voting. On many occasions I have acted as a scrutineer, aud know that he is a smart man indeed who can check off names the whole of the day without making a mistake in the process. and very often it is not the f a u lt of a scrutineer that an error occurs. Take, for instance, one of the subdivisions in the Grey electorate. On the roll there appear the names of sixteen Dalwoods. There are no fewer than tluee Georges, one being George, junior, and two Alexanders, one being Alexander J . If Alexander J. Dalwood goes into a polling booth and, when he is asked his name, says it is Alexander Dalwood, the papers are handed to him, and the name of Alexander Dalwood which appears on the roll is marked off. But the real Alexander Dalwood may go into another polling booth and get his papers there. When the scrutineers' roll, or the polling clerk's roll, is examined, it will be found that JOHN FORREST -No doubt someAlexander Dalwood has voted twice, and that Alexander J . Dalwood has not voted at all. Soi t is right through the list. My complaint is that Ministers did not wait t ill they had a chance to make an inquiry, but rushed straight into p r i nt and accused us, as they have done in He voted as an absent recent speeches, of corruption and other offences.

It is right for them to have organizations to fleece the public with high prices, but it is a crime for the workers to organize.

If all the influences of these institutions had been withdrawn from honourable members would be very small indeed. If we had had oue decent straight-out daily newspaper circulating throughout the length andbreadth of Australia the result of the last election would have been very different. We had a Labour paper on our side in South Australia called the Htrald, but unfortunately it reached only the already converted, since it is boycotted by persons on the other side. In all the States the position was the same, and the great morning dailies published in all the States supported the present Government party. If we had had the support of the big daily newspapers, as our friends opposite had at the last election, they would have been swept clean out of existence; there would not have been one of them left. Colonel RYBIE Honourable members opposite will have to put forward a different policy before they can induce any respectable or intelligent newspaper to support them. people to support us.

150,Sir Robert Best,"I suppose thereI wish to refer is this: friend showed much boldness and courage in saying, "" Let us go to the country."" But the honourable member, and all honourable members opposite, must have heard the challenge made by the Prime Minister when he said, ' ' Are you prepared to go to the country? "" I venture to repeat tlie Prime Minister's statement, and to ask the Opposition again, "" Are you prepared to go to the country?"" friend says "" Yes"" ; but he and his party want us to go to the country with our hands tied. The position is very simple. There are thirty-seven members sitting on each side of this House. that, as obstruction is determined upon by the Opposition, the conduct of business is impossible. That is obvious. they have declared their intention to obstruct. struction is obvious in the present condition generally recognised in the ordinary daily transaction of business than that, when two men find it impossible to work any longer together, arbitrament should be resorted to. This party-the Liberal party-havin g regard to the existing condition of affairs, is anxious to secure the arbitrament of ihe people, but the other side say, "" Let this Chamber go to the country, and then we sliall see what we shall see."" Suppose we did go to the country-and the Labour party avow thab they have already in existence a majority in the Senate who took no risks. But, suppose on the other hand-wha t is most likely-that the present Government were returned with a majority, how much further should we be politically than we are now? There would, of course, be a moral influence behind the victory of the Government, but that is all. If my honourable friends opposite are not afraid to go to the country, they will assist this side iu securing a double dissolution. Then parliamentary machinery which is at present unworkable would probably be made completely workable. point out that the modest proposal of the Opposition is one of "" heads I generous it is of them! dissolution-and then, if we were returned with a majority , they, with their majority My honourable in the Senate, would still be able to defeat every effort -of legislation made by the existing Government! That is the kind of invitation to go to the people to secure their arbitrament that is suggested. My honourable friends opposite are afraid of the people. We on this side want to go to the people as long as we can secure finality from their decision; and finality can only be secured by the people being free to re-elect the whole Parliament, to re-model the whole constitutional machinery of Parliament. By that process, and by that only, I venture to say, can finality be secured. Buti t is not finality that honourable members opposite want. Therefore, I say that I quite admit the assertion of the other side that they are prepared to trust the people is mere hollow pretence and humbug. They make all sorts of pretence about And being in touch with the people, about being representatives of the Democracy, but when they are challenged to let the people put the constitutional machinery in working order that is a horse of quits of affairs.

I hope that we shall hear nothing more from my honourable friends to the effect that they are prepared to go to the country. Sir ROBE RT BEST -Oh, no. My honourable friend, who is a good sport, would never enter upon any undertaking on the basis of ""heads I w in , lails you lose.""

156,Mr Mathews,"S o we are.unwelcome to honourable members upon this side of the Chamber, because it practically connotes a censure on the administration and legislation of the late Government. From that stand-point I should be very glad indeed of an opportunity to discuss it . There is nothing but weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth amongst honourable members opposite. During my long experience in Parliament, I cannot recall an occasion when a greater agitation existed in the ranks of the Opposition than has been disclosed during the present session. They have made an acrid and splenetic attack upon the Government. Even the magnificent imperturbability of the ex-Prime Minister himself was seriously disturbed, and he descended upon us with some of those platform efforts which had won admiration for him in various parts throughout Australia. But they were received here by honourable members, who know better, with "" a 'deafening silence."" They did not appeal to us, because we recognised that they were merely the platform tricks of the Labour party. In addition to that, we heard the exAttorney-General, who, in his utterances upon this motion, was not at all happy. But all that was duly made up for by the honourable member for Adelaide in his vitriolic outburst. Of all the attempts at splenetic utterances I have ever heard, none has approached ths savage deliverance of the honourable member. He realizes that my honourable friends are on the broad road to destruction; hence the weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth. I cannot blame them-havin g regard to the atmosphere of agitation which exists on the other side of the House-for clutching with such avidity at straws, and in the utterance of the honourable member for Yarra we had an indication of how eager they are to secure something upon which they can misrepresent the Liberal party. The honourable member spoke hastily, and without due consideration of the matter which he brought forward yesterday. Had he occupied the place which is now filled by the honourable member for Darling Downs, under the same circumstances, he would have done exactly what that honourable gentleman did. Several OPPOSITION MEMBEBS -Abso lutely no. authority, he dare not do anything else. Tf Tie were clothed with responsibility, he dare not have made the speech which he delivered yesterday. knows different from that. that is why I am speaking in this fashion. As a matter of fact the proposed action of the Government will protect the Treasury, and the loss of a solitary pound to the public revenue of the Commonwealth will not result. A deliberate attempt has been made to saddle the Ministry with such neglect of duty as would involve the country in a loss of revenue amounting to about £150,000. There is not the shadow of foundation for any such suggestion. I have given the matter as close consideration as I could,, and that is the view at which I have arrived. The character of the agreement entered into between the Queensland Government and the late Government of the Commonwealth cannot be denied. That agreement clearly shows that subject to the Queensland Government passing certain Acts, and doing certain things, the Commonwealth Government were bound to issue the proclamation repealing the Sugar Bounty and the Sugar Excise Acts. As soon as the Queensland Government performed their part the Commonwealth Government were to perform their part. I do not wish to weary the House by repeating quotations from speeches bearing on this matter, which were referred to by the Minister of Trade and Customs yesterday; but I do propose to cite one or two extracts for the purpose of driving home to the minds of honourable members what was the nature of the compact. The honourable member for Yarra, in speaking upon the Sugar Excise Repeal Bill, as will be seen by reference to Hansard, page 7060', saidThe Government will withhold proclaiming the Act until the conditions laid down have been given effect to. On. page 7062 of Hansard, the honourable member for Richmond saidHe trusted the Parliament of Queensland would take the opportunity of passing this promised legislation. Mr Tudor interjected, "" After that the Bill will be proclaimed."" Then the present Leader of the Opposition himself, in his policy speech, referring, first of all, to Mr Denham's telegram of 5th September, 1912, saidMy reply to that was that we should, on the I2th of the month, introduce Bills to abolish the Excise and bounty in terms of the undertaking",27,Robert Best Th E Ex Speaker The Object Of Obtaining Filthy Quotations
157,Sir Robert Best,Clothed with,28,Robert Best Th E Ex Speaker The Object Of Obtaining Filthy Quotations

159,Sir Robert Best,"I do not; andham, had duly accented. The Bills were introduced and passed by the Federal Parliament. When Mr Denham carries out his agreement with me in the matter, proclamation will issue. I think that makes it absolutely clear that the compact between the Queensland Government and the late Government of the Commonwealth was that as soon as the necessary Acts were passed by the State Parliament, those passed by the Federal Parliament would be proclaimed-that the proclamations should issue forthwith as a matter of fact. that it should be done. The State Government carried out its part of the compact.

In other words, between the opening of the season and the date of do the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs proclamation of the repeal Acts, the an injustice, and I shall be glad if the growers were to be entitled, roughly honourable member for Brisbane will speaking, to something like 2s. 2d. per ton supply me w i th the exact words used by on their cane.

Only three refiners had to be consulted, and I find, after making inquiries, that when the proclamation was issued, bringing into operation the repealing Acts, the Department communicated with each mill-owner in New South Wales and Queensland in the following terms: Am directed lo ask for favour of prompt statement as to what method you propose to adopt in recouping the growers in the amount of the Excise on sugar the produce of cane deBills were passed. livered to the mills this season prior to abolition of bounty ancl Excise.

It is most important that ray honourable friends opposite should realize the condirealize that a fundamental feature of the arrangement was that the growers, whom we were all anxious to assist, should reap the benefit of the difference between the Excise and bounty, amounting to £ 1 per ton. The sugar in bond at the time of the issue of the proclamation would, of course, be subject to the Excise when entered for home consumption, but the Excise could not fairly be continued without the continuance of the bounty. All that had to take place was and this was the crux of the agreement-that the mill-owners and the Government combined should allow the grower the benefit of this 2s. 2d. per ton on his cane. Let us see how the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs, in his somewhat reckless speech yesterday, proposed to deal with this matter.

The position was that the grower was entitled to 2s. 2d. per ton under an honourable arrangement, and every effort was made by the Government to have that arrangement carried out by the mill-owner. What the Government now seek to do is, not to introduce retrospective legislation, but to clothe by law the arrangement made by the parties, the general effect of which was to give the grower the benefit of what has been promised to him by the mill-owner. I have pointed out that the ex-Minister's suggestion would have amounted to repudiation, Queensland having performed its share of the contract, and that the I dispute the clamour throughout the State would have prevented him taking such action.

The difficulty arose by reason of the hasty and defective legislation of the last Government, and, therefore, it is most audacious on the part of my honourable friend oppositeI admit that he acted hastily and without f u l l consideration-to saddle its shortcomings upon the existing Government. It only shows the straits to which the Opposition are pushed in their attempt to discredit the Government. straws at which they will grasp to damage a Liberal Government placed in office by the people. That is the galling aspect of the situation. One or two other matters of a bogy character have been introduced here. The ex-Prime Minister and the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs laid themselves out specially to deal with postal voting. It has been clearly indicated by the present Government that its intention is to bring about electoral reform, and one aspect of that reform will be the restoration of the postal voting system. a corrupt system, and I w ill vote with you.

We in Victoria had been accustomed to vote by post, and because 1,20Q electors in Kooyong had committed the crime of taking advantage of the electoral law, we were subjected to contumely and aspersions from the other side. My honourable friends opposite have been particularly sensitve about so-called imaginary charges that have been made in connection with absent voting; but I venture tp say that I do not think for every abuse of postal voting that can be proved the probability is that twenty There or fifty cases of abuse could be proved so far as absent voting is concerned. I challenged the ex-Prime Minister to state what he really meant to convey when he picked out electors in Kooyong for taking advantage of the postal vote. I asked him if he charged them with dishonesty. Both the ex-Prime Minister and the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs could have had no other object in referring to this matter as they did, than to reflect It only shows the upon those electors of Kooyong who voted by post.

The proper course to pursue was to increase the safeguards agaiust abuse. There was never the least justification for the abolition of postal voting. If abuses were known of, Ministers should have prosecuted those guilty of them. The mere statement that there were abuses, or bhat the system was liable to abuse, did not justify its abolition. The present Government is to be commended for proposing to increase voting facilities.

Honourable members opposite t r y to make it appear that we on this side wish to destroy whereas from tlie beginning the efforts made to establish legitimate industrial unionism have been made by the Liberal party. The whole of the legislation for improving the position of trade unions, and increasing their liberties, has emanated from the Liberal party. The new Protection policy was the creation of the Liberal party, from which proceeded many reforms before the Labour party was even heard of. lation of any value has come from the Liberal party. vernment programme is redolent of the great Liberalism-humanitarianism , of opportunity, and Democracy. Honourable members opposite are afraid to let us go to the country on those principles. Among the proposals in the Ministerial programme is the abolition of preference to unionists. An unforbunate state of affairs has brought about the capture of the trade unions by Socialists, who have introduced political unionism of a most militant character. Political unionism is synonymous with tyranny, coercion, violence, and boycotting, and it is those things that the Liberal party wish to prevent. Honourable members cannot close their eyes to what is taking place. Political unionism has tyrannous conduct of a kind hitherto unknown. made by the honourable meinber who has just resumed his seat, I would point out that bhe arbitration law establishing t r i bunals for the peaceful solution of industrial differences has been the work of the Liberal party. The Liberals made provision for a system of judicial preference, to be exercised at the discretion of the Judge engaged in hearing a dispute, but the granting of that preference was surrounded by safeguards. The first of these was the provision that none of the funds of the unions should be diverted or appropriated to political purposes. The fullest and widest interpretation was given to that provision. The application of these funds for the improvement of factories and sanitary legislation and the like was not interfered with. The next There is no justification for the safeguard was that a majority of those engaged in the industry concerned should desire the granting of preference, and the thir d safeguard was the requiring of adlegitimate industrial unionism, vertising in the Government Gazette calling all parties concerned before the Judge, so that they might state their opinions. There was also a provision for the suspension of preference to unionists in the event of pressure or tyranny being exercised by the unions. Should the unions prevent the admission of would be members or adopt burdensome and oppressive rules preventing members from remaining in them, it was competent for bhe Judge to suspend preference. What did the Labour Government do in regard bo bhis mabter? It swept away the safeguards that I have mentioned. Nothing would suit the Labour party but undiluted preference to unionists, which has come to mean tyranny, violence, and coercion. The turmoil of the last three fundamental principles of years, and the flouting of our tribunals equality by political unionists, has been due to the fact that reliance has been placed on the sympathy of the Labour Government. It was known that law and order would not be upheld by the Government as strictly as by a Liberal Government. we did was to remove the restrictions placed on the Judge? able friend's Government did was to remove all safeguards contained in the Arbitration B ill to which I have referred, and that brought about undiluted preresulted in ference to unionists, and the next stage of degeneration was a reign of tyranny, In reply to a remark violence, and boycott.",32,Robert Best Th E Ex Speaker The Object Of Obtaining Filthy Quotations

It is by reason of the degeneration of this exercise of preference to unionists that the Liberals are bound, in the in terests of freedom, and in the interests of the workers, to insist on its abolition in the terms of the policy statement. The ex-Attorney-General made an extraordinary statement in the House, which is entitled to some attention. He was dealing with Wages Boards. I regret the effort so frequently made by some of my honourable friends opposite to discredit the system of Wages Boards.

Therefore, I say that the effort on the part of my honourable friends opposite to discredit Wages Boards is unwarranted, and, at thc same time, grossly unfair.

The data I am careful furnished in this report in respect, firstly, to cost of living index-numbers, and, secondly, relative I wish I could percentages unemployed, afford the material by means of which the necessary adjustments can be effected with considerable precision.

A t The figures given page 55 of this issue of statistics, he supplies a' table which indicates the relative cost in each of thirty towns (including four, five, and six roomed houses, and all houses), compared with the weighted average cost for all towns, for groceries, food, and rent. By reference to the table, my honourable friends will see that Mr. Knibbs takes the weighted average at 1,000 from the sources to which he refers, and, while he gives particular figures for the cost of groceries, food, and rent for four, five, and six roomed houses in detail, he summarizes the figures in one column covering groceries, I do not know food, and rent for all houses. Taking the weighted average as 1,000, he puts the I could quote a numcost of living in New South Wales at 1,082, in Victoria 969, in Queensland 899, in South Australia 1,062, in Western Australia 1060, and in Tasmania 957. It will be observed that the cost of living for groceries, food, and rent, including houses having four, five, and six rooms, is cheaper in Victoria than in any of the other States with the exception of Tasmania. I have shown that, according to the figures for 1913, there is a difference Yes ; blocked by the of only l i d . per week between the rate of wages in New South Wales and Victoria, and I have shown also that the cost of living is substantially less in Victoria than in New South Wales. In the circumstances, the effort made by our honourable friends opposite to discredit the Wages Board system of Victoria must be held to have signally failed.

The Attorney General dealt so effectively with that indictment that I need not occupy further time in referring to it . The third indictment is that we have failed to realize the urgent necessity of an immediate revision of the Tariff. This is a most laughable suggestion, and a fine piece of humour, coming . from a party that determined, in conference assembled, in 1912, against effective Protection, and from those who were members of a Government that deliberately refused for a period of three years to propose any revision of the Tariff or any increase of Protection. According to our honourable friends opposite, it would be a crime to increase the old Protection unless there was an alteration of the Constitution permitting of the establishment of what they call the new Protection. It is a travesty of parliamentary proceedings for honourable members opposite to seek to descredit this side on such a ground, when they are themselves at fault from beginning to end, and are solely culpable in this connection. They have availed themselves of every opportunity to throw gibes at this side on the subject of the "" Fusion."" It is well known that, speaking generally, Liberals on this side were divided on one subject only, and that was the fiscal issue. But an honourable agreement was come to, and published in the light of day. I ask honourable members opposite, amongst whom a similar fusion exists on the fiscal issue, if they have had the honesty to come to a similar honourable agreement on this question, free from the political motive which is the basis of the reference to the Tariff in the present censure motion ? On the fiscal issue there is no shadow of a jusavailable for us the necessary information tification for the gibes of the otlier side. In 1909, the honourable arrangement arrived at by honourable members on this side was that there should be no interference with the Protectionist policy of the present Customs Tariff, or in rectifying anomalies. That honourable agreement was repeated in January last, and now the same policy is repeated by the Government in the policy statement which has been circulated amongst honourable members. What we have done on this side has been done in the light of day. We have made an honourable arrangement, which has not been come to by any sordid or improper motives, and although the same fiscal differences between members of the party exist on the other side, they have never yet arrived at any honourable understanding or agreement, except it be from the base motive of a political move, such as that represented by this censure motion. In order to carry out the agreement we entered into on this side, we submitted the Inter-State Commission Bill, which I had the honour to introduce in another place, and we inserted this special clause. another place. tunity of passing it in the other placeWhen so required by the Minister, the Commission shall consider anv additions to, modifications of, or simplifications of any Tariff or Customs or Excise Act expedient in order to remove anomalies and to develop preferential trade with the United Kingdom and British Possessions, and shall make to the Afinister such recommendations in regard thereto as the Commission may think fit. This clause was deliberately deleted by niy honourable friends opposite when they introduced the Inter-State Commission Bill. I do not suggest for a moment that the power is not contained in the present Inter-State Commission Act to take the Tariff into review, but what I am emphasizing is that we on this side sought to carry out the honourable arrangement made, so as to enable Parliament to revise the Tariff in the light of information. Having regard to the charge now made against this side of our neglect in this connection, I point out that when the Inter-State Commission Bill was before us last session, I urged strongly on the Government that the Tariff might at once be remitted to the Commission which was about to be constituted, so that when we met in the present session there would be to enable us to act in revising the Tariff. before we get a chance of revising the Tariff on a report from the Commission 1 ray advice had been accepted by the Government of the day we should by this time have had a progress report, which would have permitted us to deal with the Tariff at the beginning of this session.

264,Sir Robert Best,"The Governmentpretend to believe in-that they are prepared to trust the country-the y have the fullest opportunity of doing so now. Let us go to the country by means of a double dissolution. Let them assist us to achieve that end. Then we shall secure the verdict of the country in a way that will provide the constitutional machinery for efficiently carrying out the public business of Australia. I desire to offer a few criticisms on the administration of the present Government. A t the outset I wish to pay a compliment to the Postmaster-General. When the late Government were in office they were told that the whole Postal Service was in a state of chaos; that there was seething discontent; that the letter-carriers urgently demanded reforms, and were almost at the point of striking; whilst the letter-sorters were up in arms against the system of broken shifts. We had complaints from all over the country that the late Government had failed to provide people in the rural areas with adequate postal and telephonic facilities. All this alleged discontent has now disappeared, and we have to congratulate the Prime Minister upon having secured as Postmaster-General a gentleman who has brought about complete harmony in the postal service. What are the reforms which have been achieved by this distinguished individual? He conceived the brilliant idea of altering the design of our postage stamp-of replacing the image of the kangaroo with that of the head of the K in g. The proposal was a strikingly original one, and when he propounded it to his colleagues they were so delighted that they fell over him, and acclaimed him as the man who could save the situation. The result has been a great increase in the revenue of the Department. Hundreds of letters were received by the Postmaster-General congratulating him on his great achievement. The telegraph wires were kept f u l l y occupied in conveying the thanks of a grateful community to him, and the' telephone service was simply disorganized by reason of the number of subscribers who rang up to inform him that he had given them the very reform for which they had been thirsting for years. read in the daily newspapers any statements alleging seething discontent in the Post Office. Why? Because the letter carriers are no longer called upon to hawk round letters to which are attached stamps on which are printed the image of the kangaroo. This magnificent result has been brought about simply because Ministers were prepared to lick the back of the King's head rather than the back of the kangaroo. I venture to think that there is now no need for the appointment of three Commissioners to administer the affairs of the Postal Department. The trouble has been solved by the Postmaster General, and I heartily congratulate him upon his brilliant conception in regard to altering the design of our postage stamps. I have no doubt that the commercial comniunity will now receive their letters more promptly than they have done hitherto. I come now to another matter. I am sorry that the Minister of Trade and Customs is absent from the chamber, but I presume that he has gone to get a nerve tonic. That honourable gentleman was scarcely seated in his office when he gave his sanction to an act which constitutes one of the blackest deeds which could be perpetrated in the Commonwealth. I am pleased that the honourable member for Werriwa is in his place, because I know that he will back up my statements in this connection. When a rash was discovered upon some of the people of Sydney certain medical men affirmed that it was small-pox, while others declared that it was chicken-pox. A f t e r five days' consultation they decided to err on the side of security by diagnosing it as small-pox. They threw upon the Government the onus of determining whether they would give effect to their recommendations. They asked the M i nister of Trade and Customs to proclaim an area within a radius of 15 miles of the. Sydney General Post Office an in fected area-that is an area from which no person could travel to another State without first being successfully vaccinated. On ray return to that city at the week-end, I am continually being interviewed by business persons, who say that their businesses have been absolutely ruined by this action on the part of the Minister. In my district hotels, which formerly employed twenty-five persons, are now almost empty. Their proprietors are losing money every day Clothing factories which employed a large number of hands are not working half time.

An of the presence of small-pox? administration of the Cook Government. WhatI say can be substantiated by every honourable member who has occasion to visit Sydney. Business is dislocated, and the end is not yet in sight. I ask honourable members to compare the action taken by the late Sir William Lyne, when bubonic plague appeared in that city, with the action initiated by the present Minister of Trade and Customs upon the outbreak of small-pox there. The plague, it will be admitted, was much more dangerous to the community than is this so called small-pox. How did the late Sir William Lyne deal w it h it? When a case was discovered in one block of buildings he immediately isolated that block, erected a barricade around it , and paid those within it to remain there. He sent a squad of men into the various buildings comprising the block to thoroughly cleanse them and to destroy the rats. In that way he was able to eradicate the disease. But what did the Minister of Trade and Customs do when he became aware of an outbreak of small-pox? plicitly on the reports of certain medical men. question from a party stand-point, because the position is altogether too serious to admit of that. But the procedure which has been followed convinces me that there is no master-mind in the Cabinet. I m mediately the presence of small-pox was detected in Sydney, the Government could have entered into negotiations with the Government of New South Wales, and have said to them, "" We will grant you the use of our quarantine station; and we will be prepared to pay the expense of stamping out this disease."" Something might then have been accomplished. In stead of doing that, they merely proclaimed the country within a radius of 15 miles of the General Post Office an in fected area. The result is that the people living' within that area are at liberty to carry the disease all through New South Wales, and right up to the borders of other States. I venture to say that there are a dozen honourable members upon the opposite side of the chamber, who, if they had occupied the position of Minister of Trade and Customs, would have grappled with this difficulty in a masterly manner. If a vote were taken upon the question amongst the vernment would be doomed. I have been informed that more than £1,000,000 has been lost by the business and working men of that city as the result of the action taken by the Government. What have the Government done ? What are they going to do ? So far as I can see, relief can be secured only by defeating them, and placing on the Treasury bench more capable men who will be able to deal with the matter. I therefore welcome the opportunity to cast a vote to put them out of power. capable men ? as capable men in the waxworks. think so. honourable member's electorate made a mistake, that does not follow. good for nothing; and the honourable member for Calare belongs to the latter class.

Paton and other medical men say, "" Here is an example of the efficacy of vaccination. The man who contracted the disease was the only person in the house who had not been vaccinated."" The fact is, however, that the man has contracted, not small-pox, but cow-pox, which has been injected into the blood of the other members of the household, and as loug as the doctors keep on vaccinating the people of Sydney cases of the kin d will occur. contagion. honourable members ever heard of any other civilized couutry where small-pox has occurred, and where, although 500",38,Robert Best Th E Ex Speaker The Object Of Obtaining Filthy Quotations

The Naval Board, which is continually with the manager, consists of the who is a seafaring man without any knowledge of engineering indeed, he is not supposed to know anything of them-the Defence, who is a journalist, pose, a grazier, also without any knowledge of ship-building or engineering; Captain Clarkson, who is an engineer, but who has been for twenty years on the Protector. I am not finding fault with Captain Clarkson as an but, as I say, he was for twenty years on one steamer, and has no practical ledge of the working of a large ing establishment.

That fact was known to Senator Pearce, and was no news to the different Naval Board; and .my complaint is that Captain Clarkson should so deceive the There is another matter present Government as to allow Mr. have Julius' report to go to them, and, by blundered.

As to the three engineers referred to, one of them was a draftsman from Melbourne, about whose abilities I kuow nothing, and the other two, though seafaring men and engineers, were not boilermakers or boiler experts, while all were in the employ of the Commonwealth Government. If the manager of the dockyard is to be condemned, why were experts outside the service not appointed to make the examination? could easily have been secured in Sydney, but the Government selected three men directly under Captain Clarkson, who has made up his mind, so far as the Fitzroy Dockyard is concerned, to blot it out. He has said that Cockatoo Island is not a suitable place to build warships, seeing that there is not available either organization, experience, or machinery. matter of fact 75 per cent, of the machinery is new, and the latest that any country in the world can produce. to the generating plant that is condemned, the present Minister of Defence is reported in an article of one column and a quarter in the Age to have described its acquisition as a bad bargain for the late Government, and a great mistake and blunder on their part. rating plant cost £6,000, and that price could be obtained for it any day in the week. Everything on the island on behalf of the Commonwealth Government was valued by Mr Christie, one of the finest valuers in Sydney, and not a Labour man. The State Government in this transaction were also represented by an expert, and for any defects there may be, the experts, and not the late Government, are to be blamed. To say that the Federal Government made a great blunder in taking over dockyard Captain Clarkson has said that the Fitzroy Dock is not at all suitable for ship-building. my own way. Mr Cutler is a man who deWerei t not for the existence of the Fitzroy Dock our great battleship, which has cost the country over a million pounds, and is fitted with splendid machinery, could not be docked in Australia. Stilli t is said by certain persons that the purchase of the dock was a bad bargain. How did Admiral Henderson report on the state of the dock ? He recommended that it should be taken over from New South Wales by the Commonwealth. When we find the Minister of Defence occupying a whole column of a newspaper [13]2 in an effort to blame the late Government, it is our duty to speak plainly here. I prefer to take the report of Admiral Henderson to that of Captain Clarkson. BeforeI read the report of the test of the boilers, let me show how biased Captain Clarkson is. He was sent to the Old Country, I think by the Prime Minister, when he was Minister of Defence, to supervise the construction of the destroyers. him at all . Captain Clarkson was sent Home to supervise the construction of the destroyers Yarra and Parramatta. On the way out to Australia the destroyers came together, and on some days the Parramatta had to slow up four times to allow the Yarra to As a come along, on account of the latter's defective machinery and bad steering gear. On the arrival of the destroyers here, the As defective machinery on the Yarra was complained of, and Mr Cutler, the superintendent at the Fitzroy Dock, was sent down here to make a report. He condemned certain defects in the machinery. He did not frame his report with the view to in j u r in g Captain Clarkson. He was That genecalled upon to report on the state of the steering gear and the machinery of the Yarra, because it was common report that in these respects her condition was not satisfactory.

He obtained the consent of the New South Wales Government to tender for the construction of the power plant for the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, and he was successful in his competition against private employers.

The Ministers pointed out to the former that the contractor for the American machinery which was being installed at the factory had three months in which to make it r u n smoothly, and that the Department would not take it over t ill the expiration of that period. Captain Clarkson was informed a similar opportunity would be given in the case of the power plant in the Fitzroy Dock.

I am very pleased to know that the honourable gentleman is prepared to save human life, and we all give him credit for having that desire. what are the facts in this case ? For two days the men whom the Government appointed to test the boilers at the dock could find no defect, and then they gave the order to put in the fittings as everything was all right. Afterwards, the defects in the boilers were pointed out by some one who knew of them, and next morning an officer went back and put his finger on the vital points. this! ber will institute an inquiry, he will get the same information. A f t e r the defects were pointed out, it was stated that there had nearly been an explosion. Now, during the last ten years, there has been no explosion of a boiler or in j u r y to a man on Cockatoo Island. The man who controls this particular work knows the defective part of the boilers. It is not where the The Small steam is generated, because that portion is perfectly sound and able to do its work, but it is in another part, and it is immaterial whether the plate is thick or t h in. Both the manager and the men at the works knew about the defective part. The authors of the report I have quoted These are facts which I have were simply "" pulling the l e g "" of the Minister of Defence. I regret very much the attitude of the Government in this matter.

The honourable I hope soj and I trust member for Calare has asked what the age of the boilers was. Some of the boilers are old, but some of our mail steamers have boilers which are at least twenty-five years old. One of the boilers has been tested up to a pressure of 330 lbs., although worked at a pressure of only 110 lbs. A boiler which can stand a pressure three times as great as that which it is called upon to stand in its ordinary But working is surely not dangerous.

The manager of the works has the boilers examined every Christmas, when they are thoroughly overhauled. The state of the boilers was known to the Naval Board when the dock was taken over by the Commonwealth. The late Government paid for second-hand boilers, but tnese boilers, as I have stated, are quite safe at the pressure at which they are being worked. Some of those that have been condemned could have been repaired at a cost of £5 or £6. Ministers are trying to blacken the reputation of the Fisher Government for taking over the Fitzroy Dock. Captain Clarkson reported that the dock was not a suitable place for the building of warships, because it had neither the organization nor the machinery. But I have pointed out that 75 per cent, of the machinery is new and up to-date, and the rest capable of doing its work well, because some of the old machines can do as good work as new machinery. The Fisher Government took over the dock to have a place in which to overhaul and repair the battleship Australia, which is now in African waters, and our large cruisers. There is no other dock in the Commonwealth which could take the Australia. After the statement of the Naval Board that the acquirement of the dock was a bad bargain, I give little credit to what its members say. If anything went wrong with the Australia the Fitzroy Dock would be the only place in the Commonwealth where it could be repaired. years to build another dock. would have been unworthy of its position had it not acquired a dock which would admit the Australia.

Was that not an action intended to delay the work of building these ships? The Honorary Minister laughs at the idea of some hundreds of men being sent home out of work. If he had ever been unemployed he would not laugh. His laughter shows his callous disposition. I quite understand why he laughs at men getting sacked. But I venture to say this is another blunder of the Government's. Any one with business capacity who had received a report from an expert that the boilers were dangerous, would surely have consulted the manager of the works, which could have been done by telephoning to the dock. The manager could have been told that a report of a damaging character had been received, and asked what was the best thing to do; but the Government ignored the manager, and sent along a telegram to draw the fires at once, in the",43,Honourable Membeb O N Account People Of Sydney To Day The Cook Go

I cannot understand men of any capacity for governing adopting such an extraordinary attitude, and I ask the Government to appoint a Committee to inquire into this matter to see who is at fault. member serve on that Committee? certaiu attitude, and I would rather you got outside men. You need experts on this matter. The men appointed to test these boilers are not outside men; one is a draughtsman from the Melbourne oflice. Fancy a draughtsman offering an opinion on boilers! I think the time has arrived when the Government should give way to another more competent Ministry. It must be quite clear to supporters of the present Government that they have cn the Treasury bench men who do not know how to govern the country. I am sure the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs agrees with me that the Government have shown their inability to carry on the works of the country. Panic and chaos reign with regard to the quarantining of Sydney. business people of Sydney, and the honourable member who represents the next electorate to mine has taken no interest in seeing that the quarantine is removed. He is laughing at the people of Sydneyi n their dilemma, but the time will come when he will not laugh. my electorate desire to have their lives protected. honourable member for Dalley, well up in the engineering world, who is prepared to follow any honourable member put up to reply to my statements. analogy between .the day-labour system and the contract system produced to the House by the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs to justify a paragraph in the Prime Minister's manifesto to the effect that the Government are prepared to do away with the day-labour system and substitute the contract system. It is one of the old cries of the Conservative party, the cry of contract system against day labour, and I am not surprised at the party on the Government side taking up the cudgels for the contractors. The contractors support them and finance them. I repeat, it is the old cry that has been going on for over twenty years. The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs told us that cottages had been built at Jervis Bay and at Duntroon, at the Federal Capital. The Jervis Bay cottages contain one room less than the cottages at Duntroon. We were told that the cottages at Jervis Bay were built by contract, and W o u l d the honourable that those at the Federal Capital were built by day labour, but the Minister forN o . 1 have taken up a got to tell us that the man who contracted for the cottages at Jervis Bay went in solvent. money on the contract and threw it up, and the Government finished the work.

We may build a sixroomed weatherboard house, unlined, in the one place, and elsewhere we may build a cottage lathed and plastered inside. We may finish with redwood architraves and skirting-boards, and we may finish with I believe the people of cedar. It is not always a question of the number of rooms; it is a question of the finish of the article and the design I have on my left the of the house. I have a catalogue from Hudson and Sons, timber merchants, Sydney, who build houses practically by machinery; the cheapest way possible. I We had an have a design of one cottage of six rooms to cost £ 5 7 5. On the next page is another design of a six-roomed cottage at £350, a difference of over £220 on the same number of rooms. My honourable friend must admit there may be a difference in the foundations of a cottage at Duntroon as compared with the foundations of a cottage at Jervis Bay. He has given us no details.

Yet, on this case, the Government decide to do away with day labour and go back to the contract system. before I sit down to show the inconsistency of the Government, and especially of the Prime Minister, in deciding in favour of the contract system. years ago, when Mr Reid was Premier of New South Wales, the present Prime Minister was Postmaster-Generali n that State, and he initiated the day-labour system for the construction of a telephone tunnel. tion of the work, and owing to the cost per cubic foot for that section the present Prime Minister decided to continue the work with day labour.

As the honourable gentleman claims that he is a man who does not change his opinion, it is dimcult to understand how his present environment has induced Nearly twenty him to alter his mind in connection with this matter. A further reason why the day-labour system is preferred to the concract system in New South Wales is found in the experience gained in that State of the litigation arising out of works carA contract was let for one secried out by contract. I remember a case which was known as the "" McSharry Case."" Upon the construction of a railThe late Sir the completion of his contract, put in a claim for £250,000 for "" extras.'; The matter was referred to arbitration for settlement, and for thiee years the arbitrators heard evidence upon the claim.

I might refer honourable members to two other illustrations of what may occur under the contract system. A contract was let for the basement and foundations of the Sydney town hall, which is one of the finest buildings in the city of Sydney. When the contract was completed it was rumoured that the work had been slummed, and upon inquiry it was discovered that rough stones had been tumbled in anyhow, and smeared over with cement, and the whole of the work had to be done over again. that? names, but that case is known in New South Wales as the "" TownH a l l Scandal."" known as "" the Bare Island Fort Scandal."" fortifications protect guns and gunners. quiry was held in that case also, and the scandalous work of the contractors exposed. Case after case of this kind having been brought under notice the Government of New South Wales were compelled to abandon the contract system and substitute for it the day labour system. I might mention a number of cases of the kind, but I need not pursue the matter further. I come now to deal with our friends, the rural workers, and I am sorry that some honourable members who have recently entered this House for the first time have gone out of their way to inform us that they have come here to fight in the in terests of the farmers, and that they are up against the rural workers' log. Surely that is not a very courageous position for them to take up.

They said that the shop assistants were perfectly satisfied with their conditions, and that only the union secretary and the union officials had agitated to bring the case before the Court. A t first it was ruled that we had no jurisdiction, but eventually these people got their case before the Court. Some of the employers went into the box, and swore that they had done all that they possibly could to make the condition of their employees comfortable, and that their business would not stand any increase. A fte r the case had been heard in public we took other evidence in camera, as we had power to do. We spent four weeks in going through the books of some of the largest firms in Sydney. ascertained their profits we gave an award which increased the wages of the shop assistants to the extent of £70,000 a year. We found cases of young women who had been working in the shops of Sydney for ten or twelve years in the employment of some of the largest firms, and who were receiving only 12s. 6d. per week. How could they live decently aud comfortably on such a wage as that? the profits of the employers were exceedingly handsome. We found that one firm was making £100,000 a year clear profit.

Throughout the history of that Court the employers, and their hirelings the lawyers, took advantage of every opportunity to break down the system. Since the Wages Board system has been established we have had plenty of strikes in New South Wales, and we are likely to have plenty more. an Arbitration Court and a Wages Board? Under the Arbitration Court system the members of the Court can claim to inspect all the necessary books in connection with a business which is the subject of investigation. They can consider in camera the profits made by a firm. The members of the Court are sworn to secrecy. If an employer says that he cannot pay a living wage, the Court can, by inspecting his books, obtain f u l l possession of the facts. It can ascertain the profits he is making, and come to a conclusion whether it is justified in granting an increase. The Court knows what the industry can pay. But under the Wages Board system the members of a Board cannot ascertain the profits made in the industry. An omployer can object to show his books. There are not the same means of getting A f t e r we had at the truth , and very often the Board has to come to a decision which is entirely against the facts If , as is sometimes said, we were Anarchists, we should not desire to bring workmen before a Court. I cannot understand the position of the Opposition in objecting to employees seeking the aid of the Arbitration Court! We brought the Court into existence for the express purpose of settling disputes. But Nevertheless, the Ministerial party do not want the rural workers to get to the Court. The employers do not even want to meet them in conference. If they really want a strike, they are going the right way to bring one about. We believe in arbitration. We believe in preventing strikes, which are detrimental to the best interests of the country, and destructive of industry. Consequently, we believe in invoking the Federal Arbitration Courti n disputes that extend beyond any one The Arbitration Court State, and desire to induce people to go I remind the to the Court in order to bring about peace, harmony, and good-will throughout the country.

Having put that question, let me now turn to the personnel of the present Ministry, to whom reference has just been made by the honourable member for South Sydney. In the first instance we have the Prime Minister, who, like the Leader of the Opposition, is an imported man. has the Treasurer, Sir John Forrest, for the advancement of Australia? It was he who explored the West, and made it what it is to-day. small-minded men opposite decrying a man with such a record.

The point that I wish to make is that, taking the members of this House one by one, it will be found that we have on our side more thoroughbred Australians than are to be found in the ranks of the Opposition. New members on this side of the House have been scornfully referred to by the Opposition as ""farmers.""

What do they know of that which the pioneers have had to endure? Opposition decry the work done by men who have achieved far more for Australia than have those who can see no further than the unions, union rules, and the trades halls, and who now invite the public to make a comparison of the personnel of the two parties. I hope that the public will do so. We could ask for nothing better.

And, after all, we are proud of the fact that we are. Have not the farmers made the country? The pioneers, who first of all carved out the way, and their sons who followed them, have helped to make Australia what it is to-day.

370,Mr Fleming,"Honorabl e membersfarmers, I should like to call attention to one fact. I know that honourable members opposite pretend at all times to decry to laugh. the teachings of history; but there is cne farmer who stands out in the annals of Home as giving that city the greatest warning it ever received. Cato, whenever he addressed the Forum, ended his speech with the words "" Carthage must be destroyed""; and it is time that some farmer in this House at the end of his speech should warn us that we ought to keep our eyes on those hungry yellow races to the north. We who know.the great empty spaces of Australia, and who have followed the teachings of history, know that we cannot hope to hold those empty spaces for ever. nations to the north are on the move; and, as was said by an honourable member last night, they have faced the exact posiGeneral in my electorate, and which gave tion that we are facing to-day. We have here members claiming to represent Australia, who scorn the teachings of history, and who are driving strongly towards Socialism; and 900 years ago China adopted Socialism in exactly the same way that it is being adopted here. ber calls it rubbish, but perhaps he has not gone into the question; like most of his colleagues, he pretends to scorn history. All readers must recognise the fact that we are now seeking to adopt that which China is shedding. Tf Socialism has failed with China, the most virile nation on the face of the earth, with the most productive part of the earth, what will it do in our case ? The irony of the position is that we are adopting Socialism just when the great nation of China is casting it overboard. The policy of the Government may be brought under two headings -the destructive and the constructive. Just as it is necessary for the farmer to plough out the weeds in order to grow corn for the people, it is necessary for this Government to root up some of the pests and weeds planted by the Opposition when they were in power, and to produce something to the advantage of Australia. In the first place, it is proposed to do away with preference to unionists. The honourable member for West Sydney has told us much about the advantages of unionism; he has told us that unionism has done more for the people than ever Parliament has. But what made trade unions possible? Why, Parliament. It is all very fine for honourable members opposite from ? honourable members' attention to one point. In my electorate, the honourable member for West Sydney delivered seven addresses, owing to the fact that he was imprisoned there by a flood; and I think that each of those addresses was worth fully 100 votes to me, especially the last one. Trade unionism is just like that flooded river; kept within bounds it is undoubtedly valuable, but when it overflows and fills, up our houses with mud aud Those great slime it is time it was put back to its original position. It was a flood of that kind which imprisoned the ex-Attorneyhim the opportunity to degrade his official position by threatening me, a poor, unknown candidate for the Opposition, that if I did not withdraw certain statements taken from his own pamphlet, entitled Labour in Power, he would use his position as Attorney-General to prosecute so if the honourable member did not stop his lies. occupying the high position of Attorney General trying to frighten his political opponent off the field by virtue of his high office. Speaker, that these remarks are in order ? member take exception to the remarks? them. actly the position as it was in my electorate, and I see nothing to withdraw. A telegram was sent to two newspapers in the electorate, saying that if I did not withdraw and apologize within a certain time, and, if necessary, have a special issue of the newspapers to do so, I should be prosecuted. I went on the platform, and told the ex-Attorney-General to go ahead. did not tell me to go ahead. gentleman's supporters so.

If a man strikes a bad time in the west or the north -and again I speak as one with experience-unles s he has a freehold of his land, or holds it by some method of security, he cannot raise money to restock. What is the result of this system ? Men are turned off their land every day, simply because they have no security to offer when, after a bad time, it is necessary to re-stock. The Northern Territory is, to my mind, the greatest menace which exists in Australia to-day. I am one of those who believe that the watchword of Australia should be to fill our empty north.

This talk about the danger of trusts and combines should cease.

Honourable members will be astounded when they hear what these professed friends of the farmers proposed. The president, and nearly every member of the committee of the association, pay the Commonwealth land tax in Tasmania, or are members of the Legislative Council of the State. The president is Frederick Burbury, Esq., J.P., who owns about 60,000 acres in the State, the vice-presidents being the Hon. A . W . Loone, M . L . C . , and A . E . Mansell, Esq., J.P. Mr Mansell is also a large landed proprietor, who goes in for the breeding of pure sheep, often sending stock to Sydney, where he has obtained some of the highest prizes at the Royal Agricultural Society's shows. the society are Norman Nicolson, Esq., J.P., and the Hon.

It was known that I am a large land-owner, which I admit I am, and this circular was sent to me on that account. I am given to understand that nearly every farmer and land-holder in Tasmania received one of these circulars. Let us analyze it and see the motives of the Farmers and Stockowners Association of Tasmania, which is part and parcel of similar associations throughout Australia, in regard to this Parliament and the workers of Australia in the future, and what they would do if they could do it This circular saysDear Sir,-On looking through the register of membership of the association, I regret to find your name is not amongst those who organized to protect the interests of those connected with the land. Therefore, I desire to avail myself of this opportunity of bringing under your favorable notice the objects of the association, with the It was adhope that you will submit your name to me for enrolment. The association was originally formed in rgoS without any political object, and merely for the purpose of enabling farmers, stock-owners, orehardists, and land-holders to combine for dealing with questions in which they were immediatelv concerned, namely, quarantine, railway freights, branding, stock losses, stock sales, markets, slaughtering, and all other subjects relative to agriculture generally. On these subjects the association has always kept a watchful eye, and has exerted a persistent, influencePersistent influence, mind you!and in many instances obtained favorable hearings from Ministers and Parliament and the public; and this part of the work will not be neglected in the future. The document admits it was formed not for political purposes in 1908, but in March, 1913, it became a political organization, as honourable members will see. The circular proceedsThe trustees of Can it be necessary to remind you of the continuous increase in taxes and wages, & c , and all other expenses which f a l l upon land-holders and all producers from the soil, and the many thousands whom the country man employs directly or indirectly are now combined in strong well organized bodies for their own individual and collective advancement?

I was stating that there had been an The immense increase in the expenditure of the funds intrusted to the Treasurer's Department, and an expenditure of £50,000 in creating a new Department, the necessity for which I do not realize. Was the Department a necessity to the Government of this country ? Or, was it a fact that, notwithstanding the great increase in the expenditure of public money in equipping the Departments, the Auditor-General had complained from year to year that the Treasurer's statemerit of accounts had reached his hands months after it was due? This Mr. Callinan, whom no doubt honourable members opposite are very pleased to welcome No ; such a paper to their fold, sets out that I said that the late Treasurer locked the doors of It is not a Labour his Department. The statement is really too ridiculous for consideration. As a H o w does the honmatter of fact, notwithstanding that the The honourable whole of the Departments had been put on a more effective footing, we find that the Auditor-General, writing on the 30th June, 1911, says that the Treasurer's statement of accounts for the year 1909-10 was received by him on 10th March, 1911, or many months after it was Allow me to say that I never due. That is what I was referring to, It is and does any honourable member on the other side deny that it was a fact? Y e t in this summary the writer leads people to think that I was attempting to mislead the electors of Gippsland, and trying to capture a seat by misrepresentations, such as honourable members on the other side are continually facing us with. Nothing has been more lamentable in this debate, in my opinion, than the statements which have emanated from honourable members opposite, who have not hesitated at every possible point to misrepresent honourable gentlemen on this side, particularly the Ministers. We had, the other afternoon, the spectacle of the honourable member for Adelaide accusing the Attorney-General of having made certain statements in reference to trusts and combines, and attempting to lead the House to believe that the honourable and It must be rememlearned gentleman was referring to Australia when he was speaking, whereas it was proved, to the shame and the dishonour of the Opposition, that he was not referring to Australia at a l l .

They do not affect me in any way, because they are statements which I never made. I venture to think that the more the honourable member abuses and accuses me in the House, the more votes I shall get when I next go to Swan Reach. the honourable member comes to Swan Reach, he will be treated with that courtesy and consideration from my supporters, to which every member of the House is welcome. We are not ashamed or afraid to hear tlie policy of the Opposition placed before the country, particularly in the constituency I represent. The more they talk, the more votes we get. Following up this matter, I find that as time went on the improvements suggested by the Auditor-General were not effected, as one would naturally expect them to be. From his last report, I learn that the Treasurer's statement of accounts for the year 1910-11 came into his hands on the 20th December, 1912the last day on which the previous Parliament met to transact the business of the country. Of what use was the report at that time ? It was a waste of time and public money to present the report to Parliament when it had no opportunity to discuss its contents. quickly you get your own audit down. does not get the report down in time honourable members will not be able to say that it was owing to his fault. The Departments, as I pointed out a few minutes ago, were placed in a certain position by the late Government, and it is quite impossible for a new set of Ministers to correct at once the whole of their maladministration. Honourable members on the other side have, apparently, not had anything to do with large concerns which require a considerable amount of time and attention to put in order. We have had evidence of that over and over again. I trust that the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs will allow the matter dealt with in this contribution to get out of the way. matter, because it is not worthy of consideration. it? ments which were made by honourable gentlemen opposite.

It contains the policy and principles which we so successfully advocated during tlie electoral campaign. The measures which are proposed are those in favour of which the people of Australia haye given their verdict, and no one can blame us for bringing them forward. The result of the popular verdict was that honourable members opposite admitted their inability to administer the affairs of the country, and resigned their offices, leaving it to other men to take up their work.

Without a shadow of reason, the Argus, in a leading article, publishes the following statementLight is thrown upon Mr Tudor's sense of political probity by the whole incident. He wns responsible for the grave omission by which a large g if t to the manufacturers and refiners at run the Department, he would have been the expense of the taxpayers was made possible. He became aware of the flaw subsequently, and instead of acting in the interests of the public and giving a friendly warning to his successor in order that his own wrong might have been righted, he lay low and watched developments in the hope of making political capital out of the public loss. No statement that has been made by me here or elsewhere bears the interpretation that I knew, or that I know, of any flaw in the Act empowering the Government to repeal the sugar legislation. I have here a proof of the Hansard report of my speech of yesterday afternoon, in which I have not made a single alteration. WhatI then said wasI f I may .judge from the Commonwealth Gazette of the 26th Julv, which contains an announcement of the repeal of the Sugar Excise Act, I venture to say that they have lost to the Commonwealth and handed over to the rich Colonial Sugar Refining Company many thousands of pounds.

Every honourable member opposite must admit that this -Excise should have been paid, seeing is the that we had already paid bounty upon each ton of this sugar.

I saidMinistry had been guilty of this act of gross negligence until I heard the Minister's answer.

And furtherAs soon as I heard the Minister's reply to the question put by the honourable member for Wide Bay, I compared the revenue returns for July of last year with those for July of the present year, and knew that unless at least ,£100,000 more was paid up this vear they were going to the bad. Nothing in my speech justifies the wilfully malicious and misleading statements of the Argus. It is said that what I did was done for political purposes; but I take it that had I gone to the Minister and tried to advise him as to how to justified in saying that he knew what to do without my advice. lawyers, it would not have been taken as a compliment. about that, but I am concerned about my political honour. I shall be prepared to leave this matter to honourable members opposite. I expected fairer play from the Argus. I know that it is on the other side, and I am prepared to fight it or any other rag that descends to such tactics. I do not mind being attacked; but when arguments that I have never used are put into my mouth, I say that the Argus is descending to some of the low-down tricks of the gutter press of America.

It had no right to misrepresent remarks made fairly and honestly in the House. not going to occupy much time, but I desire from the Ministry some information. I applied to the Minister of Defence a week or two ago for information as to the report of Mr Julius on the Fitzroy Dock, and since that time. I have applied twice in bhe House for similar information, but have not received it. I have also applied to the Acting Minister of Home Affairs, and have received no information; yet I see that at the same time that the information is refused to me as a member of the House, and refused to the House, it can be given in sections to the public press of the whole of the Commonwealth. I respectfully submit there is something radically wrong in such procedure. If any member who may have occasion to speak, as I am seeking to speak, on this question, cannot have a reporb placed on the table of the House or the Library, why should the information be given outside? Who has given this information away? I am waiting for this report, I wish to speak on it , I wish to see what is the full value of the report, and I am kept without it, while statements are going round the country emanating from the lips of the Prime Minister. Procedure such as this is most undesirable, and I ask that some reform should be made in connection with the placing of reports on the table for the use of the House, before these reports, or aspects of them, are given to the public press. appealed to the Minister of Defence, and he absolutely refused to give me the information, and yet it is given to the public reports be made available at the earliest press. AmI not entitled to the information if I want it? The establishment reported on is in my electorate, and if I am not entibled bo the information, why should the press have it? I enter my protest against such procedure. I will not condemn the whole of the Administration, but I must certainly say thab some of bhe Minisbers should have before now placed on the table the information necessary for me to put up such argument as I desire. I wish to enter another protest. I know bhat it is the practice that no questions are replied to, and no requests to lay papers on the table are entertained while a no-confidence niotion is pending, but I notice that the Attorney-General introduced a deputation to the Postmaster General from his constituency, and received a promise from the Postmaster General that the request of the deputation would be taken into consideration. Also in respect to questions put to the Postmaster-General, especially on the adjournment, the Minister has been exceptionally courteous, and has replied to questions from both sides of the House. My complaint is that for several days there has been an abbreviated report, or what is supposed to be the report, of the Land Tax Commissioner in the press, and I have been trying to get a copy of that report, but have not been able to obtain it. table. it has been laid on the table, but in courtesy to members when they make a request for a printed reporb-and I dare say there are printed copies of this report lying at the Printing Office-the y should be supplied. But members cannot obtain copies when they ask for them. report is printed. Land Tax Commissioner is looked for from year to year, and I hope members of the House will be placed on the same footing as the press. That is a moderate request. Certainly, Ministers are entitled to first hand information, and a report of this kind, or of any obher kind, should be in is the excuse 1 their hands; but second to Ministers members of the House should come before the press or any one outside. I ask the Treasurer, or whoever is to blame, that these possible moment. Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [10.42] 1 agree entirely with my honourable friend. These matters should be presented to Parliament at the earliest possible moment. But just why the honourable member should begin to trounce this Government so early in its career, for following meekly and at a long distance in the steps of the previous Government, I do not know.
