The interest due is £1,960,000 sterling or in Australian currency, including exchange, £2,450,000. Under a previous agreement with the British Government, sinking fund payments under the Funding Agreement were suspended for the two financial years 193.1-32 and 1932-33, the saving in this respect amounting to £1,628,000 sterling per annum.

10,Mr Latham (Kooyong,"Attorneynot extend to matters relevant only to a possible amendment of the Constitution. The ease then went to the Privy Council. It was considered to raise a question affecting the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and the States. Such a question can reach the Privy Council only if the High Court gives a certificate that it is one which ought to be determined .by the Privy Council. Many honourable members must be aware of the constitutional controversies upon that subject that arose at the out3et of federation. The question submitted to the Privy Council was a limited one. HadI had warning that this matter would be raised, I should have been able to state precisely the question submitted to the Privy Council. That body examined exhaustively the validity of our act, and decided that it was ultra vires the Commonwealth Constitution. Eor many years, however, there has been a difference of opinion among lawyers, yet unsolved, as to the true effect of this decision of the Privy Council. Ordinarily, the High Court is bound by a decision of the superior tribunal, but in this instance there is a. good deal to be said for the proposition that the decision of the Privy Council is binding upon tbe High Court only in relation to the matter which it had jurisdiction to determine by virtue of the certificate, and 'that, even though the Privy Council held in express terms that the act is ultra vires, it is still open to the High Court to hold that it is ndt ultra vires. The position is, therefore, remarkable from the legal and constitutional point of view, and, as Attorney-General of tbe Commonwealth, I should -be glad if it were authoritatively determined. It certainly is the opinion of many lawyers of standing that the decision of the Privy Council has not, in this matter, the authority that it ordinarily would have. Any defect that may exist, in the act is a constitutional one. I do not say that in all other respects the act is perfect; but it is important to understand that, if there is a defect in the act of the nature indicated by the decision of the Privy Council, then this Parliament cannot remedy it. beyond the power of this Parliament to remedy, and accordingly an amendment of the act would not meet the position. The Commonwealth Government has to bear this position in mind when authorizing inquiries under a royal commission. If in the present instance the procedure of a royal commission is adoptedand it will be adopted unless those concerned are prepared to make the fullest information freely availableevery effort will be made to associate the inquiry with the undoubted legislative powers possessed by the Commonwealth in respect of taxation, including income tax, customs and excise, and its trade and commerce powers. In that way every effort will be made to avoid any weakness that is avoidable. If objection should be taken by those concerned, and it should appear that long and expensive litigation is ic prospect, an application will be made to an appropriate State government to confer powers, under State laws, upon the royal commissioners, in order that there shall be the fullest inquiry. If that is done, all legal difficulties should be avoided. It is along such lines that the matter is being handled. only one State to confer powers? point of view, that would meet the case. The Government hopes that any State Government would he willing to assist. I might add that the Government is informed that the companies are reconsidering whether they will give an undertaking upon the only basis on which the Commonwealth Government is prepared to proceed with a more or less informal inquiry. The Government has informed the companies that it expects an immediate reply from them, and does not propose to hold the matter over indefinitely. NEW ZEALAND.

As such a retrograde step would render useless costly dictaphones that are already installed, and add to the cost and difficulty of providing news in the country, resulting in a curtailment of the information supplied to country residents, w ill the Minister sympathetically consider continuing the existing system, which was originated at the suggestion of his department? I'Rl This subject was considered by the previous Government, and also by my immediate predecessor in office. The use of dictaphones is being permitted until the 30th June next. The honourable member's question raises a number of considerations; but I must correct a misapprehension which apparently exists in tbe mind of the person who has inspired his inquiry, and also in the minds of other newspaper proprietors, namely, that there Some is a proposal to l i m it the use of the teleIncapacitated and phone. There is no such proposal. The Association made only proposal is that there shall be a limitation of tbe use of machines for the reception of newsat the end of the telephone. The actual position is that, by the use of these machines, newspaper proprietors are able to obtain their news for approximately 30 per cent, less than the concession telephone charges prescribed by legislation for press purposes.' This is on account of the high speed of the machines. the efficiency of their operators. honourable member may put it that way if In view of the imhe likes. The use of these machines is not permitted in any other country in the world. The nearest approach to them is tbe teleprinter, which operates much more slowly than a dictaphone, and for the use of which a charge of £65 per annum is made. The real point, at issue is whether the Government can concede a privilege to a section of the community which, if permitted, w ill involve the department, in aloss of revenue of about ""£100,000 per annum at a time when every effort is being made to manage the Postal Department in such a way that a reduc1 tion of charges may be made not to one section, but to every section of the people. If the department had this additional income of £100,000 per annum available it could make a reduction of. roughly £1 a year to each telephone subscriber. A deputation is being arranged for the middle of A p r i l in regard to the matter, when the whole subject will be reviewed. In the meantime every effort is being made -by the department to ascertain if there is a way to meet the users of these machines.

My reason for this motion is to enable the item to be submitted to the Tariff Boardf o r investigation and report as to whether the duties are necessary during such time as the exchange rate remains a>t 20 per cent., or over. duty on barbed wire of 68s. a ton British, and 180s. a ton general, has been in operation for a number of years. It was in 1920, when the Massy Greene tariff was adopted, that the duty was increased from 10 per cent. British to a fixed rate of 683. a ton. I have always considered this duty on barbed wire to be an anomaly, iu view of the fact that British wire netting was admitted free, and that, until the imposition of the (Temporary) -Statutory Scullin duties, plain fencing wire was also admitted free from Britain. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr. White) argued the other day that, because I had moved an amendment to reduce duties on certain British goods ( NO . 4 ) : PRIMAGE DUTIE S to the level at which they stood in the Pratten tariff, when increases had been made without reference to the Tariff Board, I had committed myself to support every duty which had been in existence during the Pratten regime. I submit that a very little reflection by the Minister will enable him to realize that that, is nn unreasonable assumption. Even though one accepted that as a (vide page 1167) general principle, one might deviate from it in regard to specific items. Farms are fallin g into disrepair all over the country to-day because their owners are unable to keep their fences in order, and this is largely due to the high price of fencing material. Barbed wire is essential to the pastoralists. If a man kept only sheep, he might be able to gut along with plain wire and wire netting; but practically every one who runs sheep has to keep a certain number of cattle to eat down the coarse feed, and horses are usually run as well. Where large stock are run, it isnecessary to have barbed wire on the top of the fences. If plain wire alone were used, under which the rates the fences would soon be leaning over at an angle of 45 degrees. Just as wire netting is free now, and as plain wire by the last Government, so barbed wire should be free, British, and 112s. a ton, general. That would still preserve the existing difference between British and foreign rates. We were told by the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) the otbor da.v that the position had changed during the last few The years, the implication being that it had changed in such a way that it was necessary not only to retain duties, but also, in some cases, to increase them. I admit that the situation has changed, but it hrs changed to the detriment of the primary producers, and to the advantage of the manufacturers. When this duty on barbed wire was imposed, the primary producers were receiving much higher prices for their produce than they",18,Papers

These are excellent reasons why the duty on barbed wire should be reviewed. In the circumstances I might well have moved that these rates be struck out, and that there be substituted for them "" free, British; 112s., foreign."" But I do not ask the Government to take that stride all at once; I merely urge it to submit this item to the Tariff Board, and ask it to inquire whether these duties are necesone point of view, exchange is the measary while the exchange rate remains at 20 per cent, or over. General) [3.52] -The duty of 68s. per ton on importations of barbed wire from Great Britain has remained unchanged since 1920. On an ad valorem basis, it represents from 17 per cent, to 19 per cent., and nobody, I think, would describe that as a particularly high rate in these days. of the prices of primary products, and the fact that the fall in the prices of secondary products has not corresponded with the fall in the prices of of this case as a tribute to Australian primary products might furnish an argument to be addressed to the committee if there had been a recent change in the tariff; but since this particular duty has not been altered since 1920, an unfortunate example has been selected as a case for an alteration. A careful comparison has been made of the costs of English and Australian barbed wire, and the figures have been worked out in relation to various gauges. The cost of Australian barbed wire landed into store-it is landed at the same price in all the capital in Australia at a lower price than that of cities, the price being the same in Perth as in Sydney-is less than the cost at which English barbed wire can be landed into store, irrespective of duty. unnecessary. interjection that I anticipated. As it is said that the duty is unnecessary, the argument must be this: where there is ,a duty, and an Australian article is produced and sold more cheaply than a similar article from abroad, the duty is To-day the primary unnecessary, and should not be retained. are much poorer than If , on the other hand, the Australian article is produced and sold at a higher price than that at which the British article can be imported, that should not be permitted, and in that case, also, there should be no duty. This would lead us directly to free trade in all cases. I suggest that one of the objects of a protective tariff is to provide on fair terms-term s fair to the community as a wholea market for our own manufacturers. In this case, at a given moment, it may be that the duty is commercially unnecessary. The honourable member for Gippsland has referred to the subject of exchange. Erom sure of the depreciation of currency. The world's commerce is unstable at the present time. Reference has been made to the surplus of products to be found in many countries, and these countries are ready to jump iu if our door is left open, for a moment-whe n there might be sales at knockout prices for a limited period. That, the Australian product is selling ait a price below that The lowness of the foreign product does not show that it would be safe in the interests of either the industry or the community as a whole to take off the duty. I regard the facts industry. It is the sort of thing that 1 like to see, and since nobody is able to suggest that the community is being exploited at all industry. industry that uses this commodity, nor any other section of the community. When nobody can suggest that there is any exploitation of the community at all, and when we can buy a good article made the imported product, even if no duty is paid, there is every justification for maintaining a degree of protection which has helped to bring, about that result. We know where we are under this duty. The primary industry and the other industries know where they are, and everybody can see the advantage to the community. It does not by any means follow that if there had never been a duty, this industry would have been so successfully",19,Tariff 1932 Special

I submit that on the facts this duty is entirely jusbe greater competition in those industries tifiable, and I could wish that ail the duties in the tariff had been so successful in their operation. iimondment cannot be proposed in the form in which the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) said he would move it. He embodied in it words which amounted to a direction to the Government. TheseI cannot accept, although the honourable member is entitled to use them in his argument. The question before the Chair, is "" that the consideration of the item be postponed "". port the amendment. The Attorney General( Mr Latham) tried to create the impression that the cost of barbed wire is not greater in Australia than in England. I have not the figures with me, but I am confident that the price of barbed wire in England is 30 per cent', less than the Australian price. The Acting Leader of the Country party ( Mr Minister by a manufacturer of wire Paterson) referred to the declining income of the users of barbed wire in this country. Their plight is so serious that this committee should devote its energies to reducing their costs in every direction possible. gentleman say that I stated that barbed wire could be bought as cheaply in Australia as in England? pression the right honourable gentleman's remarks conveyed to the committee. understood, although I can scarcely conceive that to be possible. sary for the manufacture of barbed wire should be obtainable cheaply in Australia, and if the manufactured article were as cheap as it is in other parts of the world, the industry which manufactures it would render a great service to this country. Australian users of barbed wire should be able to obtain their requirements .more cheaply than they do now. The removal of the high duty would induce Australian manufacturers to improve their methods, or, perhaps, to be content with lower profits from the sale of barbed wire to those in industries which are showing losses. There should which are not essential to the progress of this country. duties on barbed wire imported from foreign countries were not imposed iu 1920, as has been stated, but in 1927. At that time, we were getting very little barbed wire from England; most of our requirements came from the United States of America and Canada. When these duties were imposed, barbed wire sold for about £12 a ton in New York. A duty of £9 a ton, together with freight and other charges amounting to about £3 a ton, brought the price of imported barbed wire to £24 a ton. The Australian article was selling for £23 10s. a ton at the time. Yet the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) says that there has been no exploitation of the users of this commodity. I remind the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) of a letter forwarded to a previous nails and barbed wire in Melbourne. There being an embargo on the importation of wire, this manufacturer had to obtain his supplies of raw materials from the drawers of wire in Australia who were also manufacturers of barbed wire and nails. He complained that these manufacturers from whom he was forced to obtain his supplies were selling barbed wire at the price which he had to pay for his raw materials, and that they would not reduce their price to him unless he undertook not to sell in New South Wales or Queensland the commodity he manufactured, and agreed to raise by £B a ton the price at which he sold barbed wire in Victoria. Does the Attorney General think that there was no exploitation there? The then Minister promised that he would refer the matter to the Tariff Board in order to ascertain whether or not the action of the manufacturers of wire amounted to a restraint of trade. He did so; but later the matter was withdrawn from that body, and no inquiry has been made. Were it not for these high duties, Australian' users of barbed",20,Tariff 1932 Special

Is it right that those who supply the raw material for the manufacture of barbed wire should be able to dictate the price at which the article made therefrom shall be sold? Surely it is the duty of this Parliament to protect those who are endeavouring to open up new country. They are already seriously handicapped by the exchange rate. I hope that the amendment, will be agreed to. One gets tired of listening to the honorI commend it to honourable members' able member for Swan( Mr Gregory) on the subject of the duty on barbed wire. The honourable gentleman should know that so far as the exchange rate is considerably. During the last few years, cerned, this item is not different from other items. .His amendment that duties should be fixed according to the exchange rate having been defeated, the Acting Leader of the Country party ( Mr a more equitable deal to the primary proPaterson) now endeavours to achieve the same result in respect of this item. amendment. modity included with those which may be classed as light iron products in connection with which there is no monopoly, it surely is barbed wire. To my own knowledge, wire is drawn in two places in New South Wales, and also in Victoria. Victoria. Australian manufacturers did not take advantage of the embargo on the importation of wire to raise prices. On the contrary, they have reduced prices since 1931. Only a little while ago, the manufacturers j n New South Wales made further reductions of prices in respect of large orders in order to assist the primary producers. I cannot understand the attitude of the members of the country party who wish to whittle away the protection given to this industry in order to permit the entry into Australia of the manufactures of the United States of America, a country which buys nothing from us. In the last two or three years, the price of barbed wire has been frequently reduced. Yet the representatives of the Country party contend that the manufacturers have a monopoly, aud are taking advantage of the primary producers. They should be ashamed to advocate the sale in this country of foreign cheap labour products in preference to Australian products. I support the amendment of the honorsou). During the last federal election, the party to which I belong promised that if put into office, it would bring about an early revision of the tariff, and refer all items to the Tariff Board for investigation and report. I therefore see nothing wrong with the amendment, and generally. This duty has not been altered since 1920, although, at the same time, conditions in Australia have changed conthis duty has conferred a considerable advantage on the manufacturers. They should now be well established, and able to meet overseas competition, and to give ducers. The duty under item 159Bwire, iron and steel for use in the manufacture of barbed wire and wire netting as prescribed by departmental by-lawis f>2s. a ton, British preferential. It seems to me that the imposition. of this duty is likely to bring about monopolies in Australia. Any company which manufactures barbed wire from imported raw material, would be heavily penalized by this duty. By imposing a duty which will enable the local manufacturers, to charge whatever price they like, we are simply playing into tbe hands of combines. Excessive duties discourage competition, and are entirely unfair to the primary producers. support the amendment of the honourable member for Gippsland.

83,Mr Nock,"The Minister's admissionthe Government have compared the prices of imported -lines delivered in this country, with local prices. I contend that the comparison should be between the prico at the English factory and that at the Australian factory, due allowance being made for the additional cost of producing the article . in this country. If tiuit were done we should lino that the prices here and in England were far apart. take into account the fact that, under the protectionist policy, we havepractically established a monopoly in the trade, and that, therefore, the manufacturers are under an obligation to treat the people of Australia fairly. To-day the price of barbed wire is praotically the same as it was at the beginning of 1932. to-day ? During the last two years wages and interest rates huve boou reduced. Therefore those persons who have invested cHpital in this industry must recognize that they cnunot expect, the same return to-day a« they received a few years ago. In view of the monopoly that has been conferred upon the manufacturers, and in view of the fact that they are not standing up to their obligations, I su;> port .the amendment for the postponement of the item pending the report of the Tariff Board. The honourable member for Franklin( Mr Blaoklow) expressed the whole matter in a nutshell when he stated that the policy of the United Australian Party, us clearly announced at the elections, was the revision of the tariff* and the reference of all items to the Tariff Board for investigation and report. . During the recent discussion of the position of the wool industry, I suggested that items such as harlied wire should have bwsn umong the first to be referred to the Tariff Board for report. The .tariff policy of the Government, arising out of the Ottawa trade agreement, is based on competitive rates of duty;. The. last report of the Tariff Board on.barbed wire was framed, under a policy utterly different from that'oporating to-day. The Attorjicy-Goneral( Mr Latham),, speaking'on the tariff, stressed the difference between the conditions existing to-day, and those which existed previously. The Minister just now admitted that, in 1926, when the Tariff Board made its report, the price of wheat wag 6$. a bushel, whereas to-day it is 2s. I d . Notwithstanding that fact, the price of barbed wire is much about the same as it was in 1926. During the last two or We must also three years the conditions of every primary aud secondary industry in Australia have entirely altered. Wages and other costs have been-reduced. In some instances the earning power of efficient secondary industries is now based on the writing dowu of capital. The time is therefore ripe for a review of the duty on barbed wire. This item is of considerable importance to the primary prois tbe price ducers, particularly those in the west of New South Wales and towards the centre of Western Australia. Those settlers huve to cope with many pests, particularly the dingo in Western Australia, and barbed wire plays an important part in the erection of vermin-proof fences. Therefore any unwarranted excess cost in respect of that commodity mitigates largely against the successful settlement of the interior of Australia. I . urge the Minister to give the amendment serious consideration. As its : acceptance would not mean a departure from the policy of the Government as announced at the last election,.the honourable gentleman should be Hole to agree to it. test which several honourable members have urged should be applied in the determination of the duty that should be imposed on this commodity, 'is the prices that are being received for primary products, to-day compared with those that were received up to 1930,' To my mind,that is not the vital factor. By treaty arrangement with Great Britain, the whole of this tariff schedule is subordinate to the articles' contained in the Ottawa agreement ; consequently, the test that should be applied is, what is required by article 10 of that agreement; in otherwords, whether the duty does, in fact, give . effect to the provisions of that, article.

The Attorney General( Mr Latham), in justification of the continuance of the duties that have been in existence for some years, urged that the Australian industry had reduced prices, and that it was not exploiting the primary producer. Although that may be so, it is beside the point, just as is the price of wheat and of wool. I am not convinced that article 10 is being implemented in this particular item; therefore, I consider that the matter should be referred to the Tariff Board. As it has been agreed that no duty shall be fixed without referring the matter to that tribunal, thore should bo no objectiou to that course being followed opposed to the amendment. This item involves one of the greatest industries in Australia, an industry which provides employment for a considerable number of persons not only directly at the Newcastle Steel Works, but also in the obtaining of the iron ore and other things necessary for the manufacture of wire and other steel products. Tho Ottawa agreement is not involved, because Great. Britain is not a competitor of Australia in barbed wire, the imports of which would come principally from the United States of America. Figures that have been supplied by Lysaght Bros., in a comtained supplies of barbed wire. WhilstI munication dated the 20th March, 1933, show that the price current at the 1st January, 1930, was £22 10s. a ton, plus a bounty of £2 12s. a ton, and that the present price is £22 a ton, a reduction of tation from countries other than the £3 2s. a ton. price. Country party has been treated fairly, not compete in the Australian market. At only by this, but also by previous Governany rate, Uie margin of preference which ments. The attitude of that party towards the duties on galvanized iron, wire netting, fencing wire, and barbed wive, would lead one to suppose' that tbe primary producers are the sole users of those commodities, and that they are obliged to purchase fresh supplies of them every year. I would remind honourable members, however, that thousands of tons of The Attorney-General( Mr Latham} iron and fencing wire are used in the consaid feat the present adverse exchange struction of homes, and for other purmember may not discuss galvanized iron on this item. out that this taxation is borne by those who live in metropolitan areas. Many tons of wire have been purchased for fencing purposes around the Lakeside reserve and along the shores of Lake Macquarie. The persons who make those purchases do not squeal about these duties, as the farmers continually do. I u my opinion, therefore the argument is onesided, and should not be needed. port the amendment. Barbed wire is peculiar, in that it is used practically exclusively by the agricultural and pastoral industries; consequently, the genera] community does not pay this tax. The wire generally used is 14 x 3 gauge, and according to a price list that I havo from Lysaght Limited the present price to the consumer, in Sydney is £25 5s. a ton. On the 15th July, 1914, the price of that gauge was £17 10s. a ton. Thus there has been an increase of 44 per cent. The Attorney-General has rightly said that even if no duty were imposed, we would not be importing this commodity from the United Kingdom at the present, time. But there are other countries from which, in pre-war times, Australia obwould do nothing contrary to the spirit of the Ottawa agreement, I suggest that that arrangement does not contemplate a virtual prohibition by Australia of imporUnited Kingdom. We export OUT own products to all parts of the world, and in order that we may negotiate trade agreements with other countries, it is essential that we allow them an opportunity to Great Britain is entitled to receive isspecified in the Ottawa agreement, and in the ligfht of that, the position of barbed wire should be investigated by the Tariff Board whose report would be a valuable guide to this Parliament.",23,Tariff 1932 Special

94,Mr Paterson (Gippsland) [4.32],"was not necessarily permanent, and, therefore, a reduction of the duty on barbed wire would be a mistake. I specifically mentioned that I desired that the item be referred to the Tariff Boardf o r investigation as to whether, the present duties are necessary while the exchange rate is at 20 per cent, or over. right honourable gentleman also treated the amendment as if I had proposed an actual reduction of duty. I have proposed merely a reference to the Tariff Board, and in view of the fact that the duty has been in operation for many years during which no inquiry has been held, there is sound reason for an expert investigation of it now. The Attorney General, in defence of the Government's attitude, stated that the manufacturers of barbed wire in Australia were selling at a price which showed that they were able to compete with the British product without making use of this duty. If that is so, the retention of the duty of 6Ss. on British barbed wire is a breach of article 10 of the Ottawa agreement. That article provides that the protective duty shall not exceed such a level as w ill give the manufacturers of the United Kingdomf u l l opportunity of reasonable competition on the basis of the relative cost of economical and efficient production. It is clear from what the Attorney General has said that without this duty the Australian manufacturers would be on a reasonably competitive basis. Therefore, the right honourable gentleman has, unwittingly, declared that his government, by retaining the duty of 68s. on barbed wire, from the United Kingdom, is guilty of a breach of article 10. Some time ago the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) referred to an industry in which wool entered a machine at one end and came out woven and labelled goods at the other end. barbed wire is in the same category. I have seen a barbed wire factory in operation, and the machinery continuing to produce coils of wire in the absence of any attendant. This industry employs no labour; therefore, the protection of it cannot be justified as being in the interests of the workers. On the other hand, it is a direct burden on those who. arc developing new country. port the amendment. The rate of duty ia not the only matter to be considered by the Government. The principal manufacturers of barbed wire in New South Wales belong to one of the tightest combines in the Commonwealth, and to preThe vent competition are adopting tactics as unscrupulous as are adopted by any combine in other parts of the world. I challenge Lysaghts, Rylands, and other manufacturers to deny that statement. I could supply to the committee information regarding the manufacture of barbed wire which would show that, under the cloak of protection, a watertight combine has been formed which is penalizing the consumers. I hope that the committee will agree to the amendment, if for no otlier purpose than to afford the otlier parties interested an opportunity to place their facts before the Tariff Board. An endeavour is being made to bolster up the price of barbed wire by charging to the manufacturers an unnecessarily high price for plain wire. I am at a loss to understand the reluctance of the Government to accept the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson). The mere fact that there is a pronounced difference of opinion in the committee regarding this duty is, to my thinking, sufficient reason why the matter should be made the subject of an expert investigar tion. Having listened to the arguments pro and con, I am unable to express an opinion on the merits of this duty. There is no question that since it was imposed, conditions have materially changed, and in respect to it , we should avail ourselves of the valuableassistance of the T a r if f Board.

That agreement prevented the Minister for Trade and Customs going on with the matter. So that the honourable member for Swan has told us nothing new. We merely find that certain people, who could have gone to the Tariff Board, decided that they would not do so. Of course, if they were hostile, they could not be made to give evidence. I have proved that the existing duty is not a charge on the primary producer, Australian wire being cheaper than the imported article. That affords a good reason for keeping the duty as it is. I have also explained why there was no necessity to refer the matter immediately to the Tariff Board. figures quoted by the Minister are better really than those in my possession, for mine show that the landed cost of 13 gauge wire, without duty, was 14s. a ton more than the Australian price. The figures quoted by. the Minister indicate that the local article is £2 T7s. a ton cheaper than the imported commodity. 14 gauge wire. of the Country party ( Mr Paterson) and the honourable member for Denison( Mr the wire! Hutchin), contend that as the company is not using the duty, there is no need for it ; that if there is no need for the duty our manufacturers would be on a reasonably competitive basis without it, and article 10 of the Ottawa agreement would then come into operation. admit that article 10 overshadows the whole discussion, but, while there may be logic in such an argument, it displays no -justice to Australian manufacturers. It would be outrageous if we were to penalize our manufacturers because they did not take advantage of the tariff. Again, I warn honourable members of the Country party that if we have an industry in Australia that is supplying a commodity more cheaply than it can be imported from Great Britain, without the addition of duty, that industry should be fostered. An industry is not brought down to a competitive basis by removing a duty. As soon as the duty was reduced there would I gave the honourable be an influx of commodities, with resultant decrease in the output of Australian factories and an increase in price. Any one who knows anything about business is aware that when a manufacturer is assured that a duty will be constant, and that his output will not be interfered with, he can work accordingly and produce efficiently. But let that duty be reduced, even by a small percentage, and trouble will begin. I suggest that to leave well alone is a sound proposition. By way of interjection, the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) referred to the high rate of duty on the foreign commodity. What does he want? Honourable members ask for a reasonable basis of duty for British commodities, and that we should give effect to the Ottawa agreement. The honourable member for Swan wants a reduction of the foreign rate to enable foreign commodities to come in and start nibbling at the market now held by Australians. with the rate, but with the price of the article.

I can see no justification for referring this item to the board, in view of the fact that the charging less for barbed wire than the price for which it could be imported, even if there were no duty at all. If the British article is allowed into Australia under conditions laid down in article 10 of the Ottawa agreement, the purchasers of this wire w ill soon be paying more for it than they are paying to-day. the foreign duty was imposed on barbed wire when the Canadian article was selling in the country of origin at £12 a ton. At that time the duty was £9 a ton. We were then paying £24 a ton. That was in 1926. I have not looked up the figures recently. Certain remarks by the Minister and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) require some comment. I have pointed out that, although there is an embargo on the importation of this wire, certain drawers of the wire threatened a Melbourne firm that if it did. not increase its price by £6 a ton, goods would be dumped against them to the detriment of their business. Surely we are entitled to expect more freedom in our trade than that. When threats of that kind are made, it is' time for the Minister to act. not be allowed to impose this kind of restraint upon trade. that the Minister should admit that he approves of the adoption of such a practice.

But such is the unfairness of extreme protectionists that it was not long before the government of the day introduced and passed the Industries Preservation Act, under which a dumping duty was imposed on imported wire netting. The suggestion of the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) that the sample of wire netting which tbe honourable ""member for Swan produced, when giving evidence before the Tariff Board, was not manufactured in Australia, was merely a ruse to mislead the committee. members to understand f u l l y the need for cheaper wire netting in Australia. About 60 years ago rabbits and foxes were introduced from the Mother Country. They increased so rapidly that our farmers and graziers, in self-protection, were soon obliged to wire-net, their properties against these pests, and it is essential that thoy should be able to obtain this necessary commodity as cheaply as possible. Tho Minister for Lands in Western Australia informed me, when the Industries Preservation. Act became operative, that it deprived eight settlers in my Stare from obtaining wire netting. Thei n j u r y done to our primary producers by means of these tariff penalties, is among the reasons why the people of Western Australia are dissatisfied with this Parliament, nnd now desire to have complete control of their own affairs. [5.20] I am unable to follow the arguments of the honourable members for Swan( Mr Gregory) and Forrest( Mr Prowse). They have just been complaining of an item which is free, under the British tariff. If their complaints mean anything, they mean that they desire the free importation of all commodities. But this item is really better than that, because the British tariff, being free, and the .general tariff heavy, it prevents large landed cost of goods is less than the Ausimportations of wire netting fro m countralian price. t r i fs like the United States of America, which does not purchase any' of our prifree, under the British preferential tariff mary products.

He admitted that the tie-wire lasted longer. He explained that this was because it was of heavier gauge, and was not in contact with the ground. It has been suggested that a bounty would be preferable to the existing duties, but it has been shown that, when the bounty was payable on this class of goods, the expenditure more than equalled the total cost of wages paid in the industry. I am conversant with the uses of wire netting. My great State is absolutely enclosed, from the Gulf of Carpentaria down to the Tweed, for the purpose of keeping out vermin fro m the adjoining States.* I should like honourable Wire netting is essential for protection against rabbits, marsupials, dingoes, and other vermin. Particularly is its use necessary in the earlier stages of land development, so that the item, being free British, is a concession of great value to our primary producers.

As to the prices per mile of British and Australian wire netting, I draw the attention of the committee to the following figures:Australian Manufacturers' Nut C.I.F. Australian C.I.F.E. Prices.

148,Mr White,"And what did the boardknow anything about it ; has the board reported yet? question. Why is the honourable member becoming hot about it? is that the durability of wire netting, whether made in this country or elsewhere, depends to a great extent upon the locality in which it is used. If it is used on a fence that crosses a salt marsh, it will corrode quickly. The same thing, of course, applies to galvanized iron which,if used to roof a foundry, will rust through in a very short time. The honourable mem'beT is not acquainted with the facts, and does not know, apparently, that the process of manufacture in Australia is exactly the same as in Great Britain. I am also assured that, if anything, the quality of the steel and zinc used in the locally-made product is even higher than that used in England. Seeing that there is no duty on imported English netting, and that we are paying a bounty to enable the primary producers 'to obtain this commodity at as low a price as possible, I cannot see any reason why the item should not be agreed to. not understand why there should be such a disparity between the present price for wire netting, and that prevailing in pre-war times. Despite what the Minister has said about the efficiency of the local industry, and its effect in reducing prices, the fact remains that Australian-made netting, 42 x 1-J x IS, is selling at £31 a ton, as against £18 5s. for netting of exactly the same description in 1914. proportionately. products which have fallen in price. I agree that anything which can be done to cheapen the cost of this commodity to the primary producer should receive our consideration. honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr of the anti-dumping proclamation, no Corser) made some stupid comments on my remarks this afternoon. remind him that I made no mention of foreign duties at all, and I still controvert duty.' the statement that British wire netting is admitted duty free.

If the Minister said that, he was wrong. According to the act, if netting is landed in this country at a price less than that which the Australian manufacturers are charging, the dumping duty may be imposed. I ask the Minister to expedite the presentation of the Tariff Board's report on this subject, and also to obtain information, if possible, regarding the complaint that galvanized iron goods are being made from steel supplied by the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, instead of from iron, as was formerly the case. We know that fencing wire made out of iron has lasted without serious deterioration for 70 or 80 years. [5.36] I have no desire to misrepresent the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), but I must insist that the dumping duty of which he complains is imposed only to prevent damaging and unfair competition with Australian industries. Honourable members must understand that if wire netting or any other commodity is to be produced with reasonable efficiency in Australia, it must be assured of a market, and the dumping duty is designed to prevent unfair competition by established manufacturers in other countries.

The honourable member for Swan advocated a return to the old bounty system. dumping proclamation be withdrawn. orable member for Swan has been such a staunch opponent of the payment of bounties, that I cannot understand his favoring a return to that system in the case of wire netting. In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with the present, system. The British manufacturers have free access to our market, and there is a reasonable tariff against the importation of wire netting from the United States of America and other foreign countries. In comparison with tbe price which Britain charges for wire netting in other countries, the Australian price is reasonable, and we cannot have Australia made a dumping place for Britain's surplus production.

This amendment is in conformity with the declared policy of the present Governthan overseas.

I fail to see any good reason why the Government should refuse to refer this, and tbe other items which I have mentioned, to the Tariff Board for reports aud recomprice that they can afford to pay. My mendations upon them. It is generally conceded throughout Australia that the cost of primary production must be. reduced to. enable the primary industries to export in competition with other countries. This is possible only if those ingood winter feed for their stock. dustries are placed on a fair competitive basis. If the primary producers have to pay up to 100 per cent, more for their materials than is paid by their competitors, they will be placed in an impossible position. cultural machinery for which the Australian producers pay 100 per ceut. more than is paid by their competitors. simple matter. It, is not merely the cost of agricultural machinery that seriously affects the operating costs of the man on the land. The Minister has said that 96-J per cent, of the exports of this country consist of primary products, and I poiut out that we depend upon our exports to bring new money into Australia to enable us to meet our commitments overseas. Every increase in the cost of living in Australia naturally has a serious effect on those who produce the wealth which enables the secondary industries to exist. Therefore, we should not hobble the primary industries. Although tbe Government made two promises at the last election-on e to the Country party and the other to the manufacturers-it certainly made it clear that alterations to the tariff would be made only upon the recommendation of the Tariff Board. Would it be permissible for me to discuss, in conjunction with this item, the related items referred to by the honourable or a 76 per cent, increase on the original member''for Forrest? of the committee there could be no objection to that. asked if one line of agricultural machinery could be mentioned which is about 100 per cent, dearer in Australia horse mowers, which are covered by item 171 (c). I have a letter before me from a man who writes on behalf of small farmers, dairymen and others, who wish to cut a certain quantity of grass hay if they can obtain a one-horse mower at a correspondent statesThe smaller farmers, of which there are many thousands throughout Australasia, require a machine of this description to cut. grass which, in good seasons, would make very This especially applies to dairy farmers where they have to feed through the winter, and having a small machine of this description would save them very considerably in the matter of fodder.

Now if this machine could be landed for about £2! it would be of great benefit to this large class of the farming community. The price they are charging here for a local machine is £27 10s. This puts the machine outside the possibility of the smaller farmers. Then the writer proceeds to give costs, aud shows that, under present conditions, the cost of landing the English machine without any profit would represent, a. 76 per cent, increase on the English. f.o.b. price. The British preferential duty on one-horse mowers is £2 8s. each, or 30 per eent. ad valorem. Let us take the cost of a 3-ft. 6-in. mower in Great Britain' at £13 10s. The statutory 10 per cent, of the. f.o.b. cost, which must be added to obtain the ""value for duty"", amounts to £1 7s., which makes the value for duty £14 17s. The 30 per cent, duty amounts to £4 9s. 2d. My correspondent sets down the freight and landing charges at £1 10s. and 19s. respectively, which seems to me a moderate amount. He puts down nothing for tbe duty ou the packing case. The exchange at 25 per cent, on £13 10s. is £3 7s. 6d., which brings the total cost of tbe imported machine to £23 15s. 8d., f.o.b. cost.

In no justification for decrying these British order to be as certain as possible with regard to the price of locallymade mowers, I wrote only three days ago for the present price of a 3-ft. 6-in. locally made one-horse mower, and the price given was £27 10s.

Where labour conditions are 'comparable, it is fair to use as a measuring stick the cost of manua Minister, done what I could; indeed, factures in both countries. I do not suggest that labour conditions in Great Britain are quite comparable with those in Australia; a fairer comparison would be between the costs of machinery manufactured in this country and in Canada. The Minister asked for one instance of a machine in which the difference between the English and Australian prices is about 100 per cent. I have answered him by quoting a one-horse mower, costing £13 10s. f.o.b. English ports, and an Australian machine of similar capacity costing £27 10s. machines, and know that they are not comparable. machine in each case. I have sat on a British machine which had been working for 25 years, and was still in good order. There appears to me to be machines. I do not say that they compare exactly with the Australian-made article, but I know that they do the work well, and at a much smaller outlay. The raw materials for these machines are obtainable in Australia, where there is also a good market for them, so that mass production methods can be employed in their manufacture. The difference in cost is not justified. It is a good argument in favour of the amendment of the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse), that this item be referred to the Tariff Board for investigation and report as to the necessity for the continuance of duties which enable such immense differences between British f.o.b. prices and our own prices to be maintained. I approach the consideration of this subThe only similar ject with an open mind, for I am not concerned for oue section alone: I consider myself to be the representative of the primary producers as much as of those, engaged in secondary industry. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) seeks to attach to Government supporters a stigma which I resent. Unlike him, I cannot claim direct association with the man on the land; but, to the extent that opportunity has offered, I have, both as a private member and as I claim to have done as much for him as any other. We are told that the tariff hampers the man on the land, and the honourable member has cited an instance in which, he says, the farmer, because of the tariff, pays 100 per cent, more for an Australian one-horse mower than the implement costs in England. To bring in this example, the committee was asked to discuss a number of items as a group instead df dealing with them one by one. We were, however, given to understand that there are other equally objectionable cases. From the honourable gentleman's remarks, one gathers that, if the man on the land could get this 3-ft. 6-in. onehorse mower at a lower price, he would, like a giant refreshed; drive in triumph over all competition.

For many years, the honourable gentleman has championed the cause of the Australian dairymen, and therefore he cannot plead ignorance of their conditions. He has rendered them yeoman service, and for that I give him credit. Yet, during the years that he was a Minister, he did not take off the duty on these mowers.

The comparison quoted by the honourable gentleman, is not a fair one, for the prices he mentioned-£2 7 10s. for an Australian machine, and £13 10s. for u British machine. the English machine expressed in terms of Australian ' currency would be about £17. By adding £3 14s., representing the profit of the man who sells the machine in Australia, we arrive at a total of £20 14s. To that we must add freight and insurance. On that basis, we see that the Australian machine, instead of costing 100 per cent, more than the British, costs only 20 per cent. more. I shall not attempt to follow the honourable member in his excursion to Canada, where, he says, things are sold more cheaply than in Australia; for I know nothing about conditions there. members in the corner, however, there seems to be a disposition to decry Australian manufactures. that opinion. prices charged. ber for Swan( Mr Gregory), making a comparison in disparagement of the Australian article, told us that he had torn apart with his fingers a. piece of wire netting which he said was made in Australia.

The Acting Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson), when examining the list of farming implements, found one item relating to horse-drawn mowers, and, as one honourable member reminded him, he compared like with unlike. He compared an inferior Euglish article with a vastly superior Australian article. His contention was based mostly on presumption. In comparing the English price with the Australian price, he failed to take into consideration the cost of freight from England to Australia, and the difference between sterling and Australian currency.

In 1924, a similar position still existed, at least in those classes of implements, the manufacture of which was firmly established in Australia, and the information before the Tariff Hoard is that in that year imported ploughs, harrows, cultivators, and small kerosene engines were on an average about 7$ per cent, dearer in New Zealand than identically similar imported goods in Australia. That was a very intelligent Tariff Board, comprising,'as it. did, such men as Herbert Brookes, George Hudson, David Masterton, and Walter Leitch. It was a board with a protectionist outlook, and I am certain that the agricultural implements industry would have nothing to fear from a close and careful investigation of its affairs by a board of similar calibre to-day.

The prices of Australian-made implements have been regularly and consistently reduced since the protective tariff of -1920-21 was introduced. There is no need to import dutiable agri-cultural implements. The'Australian farmer has the advantage of efficient service from factories "" on the spot"". Australian implement makers are not charging excessive prices, neither are they making excessive profits. The effect of the tariff on agricultural implements is not detrimental to the best interests of the primary producer. What is the reason for all the present commotion, and the demand that, the matter be again referred to the Taritf Board for investigation and report? According to outside organizations, for the last three months interested parties have been acquainted with the position, and an inquiry is being held in response to the application of tlie Hon. II . Gregory, M.P. Is the Country party not. cognizant of that fact, or is it rushing will-nilly into an attack on the tariff in the hope that it may convey the impression that it alone can save the country, when in reality it would deprive the primary producers of Australia of a local market, which from one end of the world to the other is recognized as the best possible market that can be procured? honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Eorde) has founded his speech on the brief that has been supplied to h i m by the manufacturers of agricultural implements. I admit at the outset that very great credit is due to those masters of in excessive profits. dustry, the McKays', for the magnificent works that they have established; but one cannot help wondering why this excessive protection is required by them. honourable member for Capricornia has supplied the committee with figures showing the prices that are charged for agricultural implements in New Zealand, SouthA f r i c a , and the Argentine. How is it that, with all the wonderful resources that Australia possesses, including everything that is essential to the manufacture of these implements, there has been no exploring by Australian agricultural implement makers of the market in New Zealand, SouthA f r i c a , and the Argentine, where this machinery is being sold at much higher prices than those that rule in Australia? It would appear that there is hero presented a splendid opportunity to got r i d of our adverse trade balance. A t one time Australia did a very fine trade with the Argentine, but lost it during the war. the owners of the Sunshine Harvester Works have sent to Canada Australian engineers and Australian capital, with orders to commence the manufacture there of agricultural implements, with a view to an endeavour being made to capture the Argentine trade? Canada, we must remember, is a country which has to import most, of its pig iron and coal, and in which the factory wages are higher than those that are paid in Australia. these circumstances it would be interesting to learn why the Canadian farmer is able to purchase a reaper and binder at nearly half the price that is charged in Australia. A few years ago a number of reapers and binders were sent from Australia to New Zealand to compete on that market, but in the following year we exported only a few pounds weight of parts. farmer be mulcted in these extra charges? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to the report of the Tariff Boardi n connection with this matter, but did not read the whole of its epitome. It also saidIf a farmer insists on using an imported machine, it is not unfair to expect him to pay the duty. Australian implement makers are not charging excessive prices, neither are they making Tracing the history and setting out the position of T. Robinson and Company, the report statesThe This was followed hy five years of steady progress, in which each year a dividend of 10 per cent, was paid. In 1923, the dividend paid was 15 per cent., and in 1924, 20 per cent. In 1924, this company, in addition, distributed £60,000 in bonus shares, raising their capital issue from 40,000 to ' 100,000 out of the reserves that had been accumulated over a period of seven years. The very pronounced success of this company during the last two years has been, in the main, due to the improvements made in their stripper-harvester, which gave them something of a preponderance of this business, and enabled them to mass produce. During the last four years they have made reductions in the price of this machine. In the light of that quotation, can it be -said that excessive profits were not -made ? In both the United States of America and Canada the wages are higher than those that are paid in Australia, and the difficulties that have to be overcome are equally as great. In view of the marWhy is it that vellous success of the industry in Australia, and the profits that are made, a further inquiry should be held to determine whether the proposed duties are necessary.

Such firms perform the services of banking institutions by extending long credits on hire-and-purchase agreements, which arc of stupendous importance to the primary producers, and, furthermore, are involved in heavy annual expenditure in the maintenance of expert staffs who educate the primary producer in the use and care of modern agricultural implements. Having considered all these facts, including the profits that were made by the company mentioned, the board arrived at the following conclusions :1. The effect of the tariff on agricultural implements is not detrimental to the best interests of the primary producer. 2.

It is estimated that, measured in terms of bushels of wheat, the burden of increased costs is equal to .292 of a penny per bushel of wheat produced. . . . I agree that any increase of costs is a matter for consideration. It has to be remembered, however, that the agricultural implements industry has been responsible for very valuable and remarkable inventions, which have been of great assistance to the Australian producer. admit that. to note the establishment in Australia of so successful an industry. Let us assume that the burden on the wheat producer is .292 of a penny a bushel of wheat produced. Considering the benefit to the comnmnity as a whole, of having such an industry established in Australia because of the large quantity of Australian materials that it uses, and the tremendous volume of employment that it provides, I venture to suggest that any burden imposed by it is amply compensated for by many other provisions that are made by the community as a whole, and particularly by the governments of the States out of general revenue, in support of the wheat producer and the wheat-producing areas of Australia. Honourable members who have read the report of the committee of five economists which inquired into the tariff will remember that that committee workedout the extent of the benefit conferred on the primary producer by various legislative measures of one kind and another. I feel sure that that benefit far outweighs the burden of .292 of a penny a bushel. economists reported that the additional cost that the tariff laid on the export industries amounted to 9 per cent. however, pointed out that were it not for the development of secondary industries under the protection of the tariff, it would not be possible to support as many persons at the same standard of comfort as in fact obtains in Australia. whole, and all considerations must be the committee was this: That but for the efforts that had been made towards the stimulation of both primary and secondary industries, we would have been unable to support an equivalent number of people at the standard of comfort which, in fact, obtains. It must be remembered that very nearly all industries in Australia are in. receipt of artificial assistance of one kind and another.

These classes have no protection of any characI am very glad indeed ter; they are in the competitive world.

Since it was made, the conditions of industry have changed, and, to-day, very much higher prices are paid for machinery in comparison with the prices received for agricultural produce. These facts justify the Government in referring the duties on agricultural imsideration on account of the excessive plements to the Tariff Board. The Minister stated a few days ago that he had submitted an item to the Tariff Board, and asked that body whether the duties npon it were necessary. I suggest that the Minister should ask the Tariff Board to deal urgently with agricultural implements, and to advise whether the present extieme duties need be continued, whether they are 'advisable as well as necessary. Opposition ( Mr Forde) referred to the use of strippers in days gone by, and to the economy in wheat harvesting which followed the introduction of the header. We admit that economies have been effected, but if we aggregate all the economies and savings which are alleged to have resulted from the introduction of the header, the combine, and other new machinery, it would appear that the farmer should be able to produce wheat for nothing. All that the man on the land wants is fair treatment. I am satishaving removed it.

The farm machinery makers are entitled to conprices they have to pay for the raw materials from which they produce their implements and machinery.

During the last few months the Tariff Board has twice inquired into the glass industry, and twice into the duties on piping. Within the last twelve months, there have been two inquiries into galvanized iron. Yet nearly eight years have elapsed since the duties on agricultural machinery were reviewed. If the Minister w ill undertake to ask the Tariff Board to deal with this matter expeditiously the members of the Country party will not press this amendment. an assurance, we must take the amendment to a division. In regard to the criticism of imported machinery by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, L know that the English mowers and binders are good machines, and have rendered satisfactory service, both before and since the advent of the Australian articles. also that the prices of the Australian machines had been consistently reduced since 1921. Having regard to the reductions of \wiges, interest, and other overhead charges, we. were looking for a further decline of prices, but the net price this year is not less than that of last year. This matter should be immediately in vestigated by the Tariff Board, so that Parliament may deal with the duties in the light of an up-to-date report and recommendation by an expert body. the board mentioned the for further price reductions, aud, in view of the decline of the price of wheat since that report was drafted, production costs must be lowered wherever possible. We believe in Australian secondary industries, and appreciate the quality of the machinery that the local manufacturer has produced. All we ask is that the man on the land be given a f a i r deal: he has to compete against the rest of the world, and should not be required to pay unduly high prices for the implements he needs for production. Trade and Customs) [8.44] -The honorson) said that English mowers could be bought, in Great Britain at £13 10s., and by this figure he endeavoured to provethe contention, of the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) that'the price of the Australian article is 100 per cent, greater. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) rightly pointed out the unfairness of comparing a price quoted in sterling with a price in Australian currency. Apartf r o m exchange, freight and other charges have to be added to the English price. If the machine were landed here free of duty, it would cost, £19. 14s.: with duty added the price would be £24 2s.; but the machine would not be sold for that amount. He states that the Australian I u the absence of such mower costs £27 10s. It must be obvious from these figures that the local machine is competitive in price. I shall quote some figures to show the difference between the prices of Australian and other mowers. In 1928-29, when 45 machines were imported into the Commonwealth, the price was £24 each, and in 1930-31, The honourable member said when 21 machines were imported, the price was £21 . According to the latest report of the Tariff Board, the price of the imported machine was £30.

I direct the attention of honourable members to the following extract from the report of the Tariff Board on this subject:In concluding this report, the Tariff Board would mention that for some considerable time now the agricultural implement makers in Australia seem to have been made the chief target of attack by those who are critical of the protectionist system which has been adopted by the people of Australia. The Tariff Board considers, in view of its exhaustive investigation and report, this industry might be permitted to perform its useful functions to the community without being made the main objective of such attack. Every phase of this matter has now been examined by the board the investigation is wholly favorable to the local industry, and the Tariff Board unanimously agrees that the protective duties should not"" be disturbed. seven years ago.

217,Mr Patjskson,"That report was madeAlthough the report of the Tariff Board was made in 1925-26, it still stands good. But I remind the committee that the whole subject is again before the board. As honourable members are aware, the board is working very strenuously to discharge the duties placed upon it under the terms of the Ottawa agreement; but I give an assurance that, if a reduction of duties is recommended, the recommendation will be acted upon, either in this chamber or in another place. In all the circumstances, it can be confidently declared that there has been no exploitation of the farmers, and that the price of these machines is quite reasonable. manifest from the remarks of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White), the Attorney-General( Mr Latham), and tbe Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde), that not one of these gentlemen is an agriculturist, nor has any one of them any expert knowledge of our agricultural industries. These honourable gentlemen have quoted figures which have been supplied to them for a certain purpose. buy agricultural machinery during the last four decades know that many of the statements made during this debate are incorrect. Opposition ( Mr Forde) read a statement prepared for him by the representatives of the machinery manufacturers to the effect that prices were continually falling. prepared by the representatives of the manufacturers. Trade and Customs also assured us that the price of the reaper and binder had dropped continuously. Let us look dispassionately at the history of the price of these machines. Prior to the war, when there was no protection on such machinery, a reaper and binder could be bought for £38 cash, or for £40 with a little credit. shipping was dislocated and business arrangements generally were abnormal, the price rose to over £100. It is with this peak period that comparisons are made with the object of showing that prices have fallen. At that time, H . V . McKay Proprietary Limited decided to undertake the manufacture of these machines. The firm appealed for and obtained protection, and subsequently sold their machines for about £90, which was more than 100 per cent, above the pre-war price of the imported machines. Their machines are now priced at £77. But I ask honourable members to compare the purchasing capacity of the farmers now with what it was in 1914. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition tells us that there has been a progressive reduction of prices, we should remember that it is a progressive reduction since the impossible war prices, but that the price is still nearly 100 per cent, above what it was in 1914."" made in Australia in 1914. General, in the course of his speech, quoted from a report by five economists who offered their services voluntarily to the Bruce-Page Government. That committee indicated clearly that the development of secondary industries in this country had laid a handicap of 9 per cent, on our exporting primary industries. UnThose of us who have had to fortunately, instead of trying to offset that handicap on such important industries, the Bruce-Page Government, by means of the Pratten tariff, actually inThe Deputy Leader of the creased it. Following the Pratten tariff, we had the Scullin, or Forde tariff. I am told that since this came into operation, Professor Copland has estimated that the handicap which our secondary not industries has placed upon our exporting primary industries has been increased to 16 per cent. There is not an agriculturist on the treasury bench, and unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has no knowledge of agriculture. Consequently, the full effect of this 16 per cent, handicap on our exporting primary industries is not realized. Unless our primary industries can operate successfully, it will be impossible for our secondary industries to make any proDuring the war, when gress. Only to the extent that our primary industries can market their products can our factories do business. Let us look at present prices for a moment.

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition told us any number of times, while he was Minister -for Trade and Customs, that the tariff schedules which he had tabled would increase employment. that one man lost his job for every four minutes he held office. In these circumstances, it is useless for honourable members to talk as they have been talking about the good effect of high tariffs. The only solution of our economic problem is to bring the prices of primary and secondary products into some degree of equality. Of course, it is useless to talk of putting the primary producer on the same footing as the secondary producer, beeause the primary producer has to sell his products on the markets of the world; but we should go as far as possible in this direction. primary producers in order to serve the workers in other industries. High tariffs will never save the country. gentlemen have talked for years about the necessity to establish secondary industries in order to populate the country; but the fiscal policy which has dominated Australia for the last two decades has been absolutely ineffective in increasing the population of this country. The money which we should be spending in developmental works is being spent on doles for the unemployed. The time is ripe for giving our primary producers an even break witb our secondary producers. The machinery which the primary producers need is much too costly. If it were as cheap as the Minister says it is our agricultural machinery would be able to build up an export trade; but they cannot do so.

But the fact is member, must confine his remarks to the items under consideration. six comprehensive items, and I have been pointing out that it is impossible for the primary producers of Australia to continue to pay the prices demanded for these implements. Of course, if the primary producers were in a position to ,buy them, all would be well; but, unfortunately, they have lost their purchasing power, and our secondary industries are also in difficulties. If our farmers could obtain their requirements at prices more in harmony with the prices of their It is unfair to burden the own products, there would be more men working in our factories, and more men in profitable^ employment on the land. * Certain The great disparity between the two sets of prices is the cause of all our troubles, and I regret to say that this Government is not giving full effect to the election promises of its leader.

The honourable member knows that. He also must know that, in their earlier years, our secondary industries had to overcome extraordinary difficulties. I recall the time when the firm of H . V. McKay, now the largest agricultural implement making firm iu Australia, and one of the largest in the world, had to suspend payment of wages to its employees in Ballarat, where the works were first established. In those days it was not an uncommon experience for employees in such industries to work, very often for weeks, without wages, because of the parlous condition of the industry. Such was the condition of the agricultural implement, industry before the duties were imposed, so when honourable members talk about these works being established before the imposition of protective duties, they are misleading the committee, because they are not giving the facts. The Tariff Board report has been sneered at so often during this debate because it was made about seven and a half years ago. Oue honourable member erred in saying that it was nine years old. My reply to that gibe is that it was tbe result of one of tbe most, thorough investigations ever made into the industry, and that, although it may not be up to date in some respects, the principle upon which it was based still stands. Let me make one or two quotations from itIiii])Ortecl implements are sold cheaper in Australia than in Argentine. Argentine, I remind the committee, is a free trade country. doing well? pay more for their agricultural machinery than is charged to our farmers under protection, and, as I have just shown, they are not so well off. May not we deduce from this statement by the Tariff Board that the establishment of successful secondary industries in Ausfl->] tralia under a system of protection has been responsible for healthy local competition, thus enabling our farmers to obtain their machinery at prices lower than are charged to farmers in free trade Argentine? The Tariff Board also statedThe Australian-invented implements have made it possible to produce wheat in the Commonwealth at a lower cost than any other country in the world, and 30 per cent, cheaper than in the United States of America. He r e is another q u o t a t i o n lit the opinion of the Tariff Board the prices of agricultural implements are, in all probability, much lower in Australia with protection and local manufacture than they would beunder free trade had no local manufacture existed. Thus we may conclude that all statements made by honourable members of the Country party that, if duties ware reduced, so much would be taken off the cost, are merely so much make-believe. May I remind them that, when my Government imposed an embargo on the importation of a number of commodities, the immediate result, was a reduction by 5 per cent, of the prices charged by Australian manufacturers for their output. prices by 6 per cent. honourable member for Corangamite has made that very misleading statement over and over again. He knows, of course, that the addition of 6 per ceut. to the selling price of Australian-made commodities was due to the operation of the sales tax, and had nothing whatever to do with manufacturing costs. I should add that this 6 per cent, sales tax applied equally to the sales of imported agricultural machines, and that it did not go to the manufacturers or importers, but to Commonwealth revenue to balance the budget. I urged a greater reduction than 5 per cent., but it was pointed out at that time the manufacturers had probably more than £2,000,000 of credit outstanding which they could not collect from the farmers. I am not holding a brief for those machinery firms that made big profits at the expense of our primary producers, but, I do not believe that they are making them now. I would also remind the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), who , quoted so freely from the Tariff Board's",46,Prices Of Agricultural Implements

Surely this is sufficient evidence of reductions of prices under protection. A ll these items should be examined fairly. This' cannot be done if we are constantly being met with an interjection like that made just now by the honourable member when the embargo was imposed prices were raised by 6 per cent. What is the inference to be drawn from such a statement? I remind the honourable member and also the Acting Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson), that they were members of a government when these duties were in operation, so they are not new. were. a Minister, the honourable gentleman did not attack them on the floor of the House. It is true that, he conveyed the impression that, he made his protest in Cabinet, but when challenged on this point, he said he did not intend to divulge Cabinet secrets. Had not he. already done so? The Postmaster-General( Mr £27 10s., but .only in this way: I said Parkhill) in respect of another matter, took up the same attitude, and when he was attacked by the Acting Leader of the Country party, he offered the same defence-"" I am only one member of the Cabinet."" I object to the way in which these honourable gentlemen now shelter themselves when a charge of inconsistency is levelled against them. Although this Tariff Board report is seven and a half years old, it was made subsequent to the imposition of the existing duties. This is. the point which I would impress on honourable members in the Country party when they talk about these "" high duties "". I have shown that at least two Country party members were members of a government that operated them, yet did nothing to have them reduced. I am satisfied with the assurance of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) that the Tariff Board will be asked to report upon these items very shortly. We were aware that this question had been submitted to the board, and the object of the amendment was to obtain from the Minister a promise that that body would be asked, at an early date, to make the inquiries. We are now satisfied on that point. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) did me rather less than justice when he suggested that I attempted directly to compare the British price of £13 10s. with the Australian price of £27 10s. for a 3-ft. 6-in. mower. I made it quite clear that £13 10s. was the British f.o.b. price-no t the price to the British farmer-and I quoted from letters which showed that, with exchange, the Australian price would be increased to about £17. I then went on to say that if machines of that kind, or better still, if Australian machines, could be sold retail at about not say they £21, many small farmers would be able to buy them, but that they could not afford to pay £27 10s., the price quoted to me in Sydney. price is £26 6s. concluding my remarks, I made a comparison between the British f.o.b. price of £13 10s. and the Australian price of that the margin between £13 10s. f.o.b. and the Australian manufacturers' price of £27 10s. was too great, even allowing for exchange and all other costs, and that if was the best evidence we could wish to get of the necessity for an immediate investigation by the Tariff Board.

255,[9.35]:,"Mr WHITE (Balaclava-Minister f o rmatter is now before the Tariff Board, and I shall ask it to give consideration to the request that has been made. Item agreed i.o. Items 169 ( AI ) ( B ) ( C 2 ) , 171 and 175 agreed to. Item 176, sub-items ( E ) ( G ) ( M in i ng machinery, n.e.i.J. This item looks innocent, because it does not take up much space in the schedule; but in reality it is one of the major items in the tariff, and it should receive careful consideration. In agreeing to item 169, the committee has provided for a free British preferential tariff, and a 10 per cent, general tariff on monoline typecomposing machines; yet on mining machinery we are a3ked to impose a British preferential rate of 40 per cent, ad valorem, and a general duty of 55 per cent, ad valorem. It is beyond my comprehension to understand why a great primary industry like the mining industry should be saddled with such high duties on machinery required by it for the production of wealth, when printing machinery is either free or carries merely a 10 per cent. duty. The only reason I can ascribe for this apparent anomaly is that there may be some revenue consideration ; but this invidious distinction seems to be quite unfair and unsound. various principles have been enunciated in this chamber from time to time regarding the duties on agricultural machinery, mining machinery is in quite a different, category, because the heavy machinery used in mining operations cannot, be efficiently made in Australia, cannot be contended that its importation would cause unfair competition with local manufacturers. Mr ScTii.Lnv -Much of it comes in ' under by-law. that. In vain I have looked through the schedule with the object of noting in what respect the importation of mining machinery might injure local manufacturers, and, unless the Minister can demonstrate to me that the position is not as I conceive it to be, I 3hall not be satisfied on this matter. It was stated that 3,000 or 4,000 persons were employed in the manufacture in Australia of agricultural machinery; but I point out that. 60,000 or 70,000 men are employed in the mining industry, the ramifications of which extend throughout the Commonwealth. This is one of our major industries, and it is of extreme importance to us at the present time that it should be fostered in every possible way. We hope that it will become of even greater importance as development proceeds, particularly on that side of it which is concerned with the production of gold and base metals. The industry is traditionally a heavy employer of labour, and, since the problem of unemployment is the most serious one that faces the community, anything and everything that can be done to encourage mining should receive our close attention. Every addition to the capital cost of mining machinery cramps initiative and prevents the opening up and development of new fields. It is safe to say that in recent years the major miniug companies of Australia have had to pay in duty hundreds of thousands of pounds because of their attempt to win new wealth from the earth. The Wiluna gold-field is a case in point. Considerable expense was incurred in the installation of new machinery there, on which heavy duties had to be paid. by-law. Companyi n Tasmania has spent £500,000 during the last six years in i m proving its equipment and installing up to-date machinery with the object of keeping down production costs, in order and consequently it that the company may compete with competitors in other parts of the world. In order to meet the depressed prices for lead, zinc, and silver, the BrokenH ill mining companies have gone in for a complete reorganization. They have installed a large power plant, sunk new shafts, and erected new winding engines of a powerful and expensive type. Notwith: standing any favours granted by various Ministers for Trade and Customs, the fact remains that these industries have had to pay out large sums by way of customs, duty.

It may be that mining will again help Australia to emerge from her lean period. We have not yet exhausted our metals. There are many the honourable willing to search for them, and to develop a field when found, if only they can be assured of the sympathy and assistance of the Government. Trade' and Customs) [9.51] -It may save time if I make a statement at this I am in touch with stage. The importations under this item during 1931-32 were valued at £894. No amendment of the sub-item is proposed; the rates are the same as provided by the 1921-30 tariff. Other mining machinery is provided for under item 170 ( B ) to 170 ( E ) in group 2. The duties under item 170 ( E ) , which covers coal-cutting machines, and item 170 ( F ) , which includes rotary and percussive rock drills, are free, if of British manufacture, and 15 per cent, under the general tariff. Rotary and percussive rock drills form a large portion of the mining machinery imported. During 1929-30 the importations of these drills were valued at over £66,000, and last year at over £34,000. In all cases these drills were admitted free if of British manufacture. Another item covering a large quantity of mining machinery, is 170 ( B ) , in group That is a matter of 2, which includes ore-dressing machinery and appliances n.e.i. and accessories. The importations for 1931-32 were valued at £21,026, of which amount £5,887 represented machinery and appliances which were admitted under departmental by-law, free, if of British, and 10 per cent, if of foreign origin. The duties under the item now being discussed were imposed in 1926 on the recommendation of the Tariff Board, in order to bring the cost of Australian machinery in line with overseas machines.

Sub-item 1 8 1 ( B ) deals with telegraph and telephone cables. Lead covered telephone cables contain, at times, as many as 600 pairs of wires. Smaller cables may contain 100 pairs, or even only 10 pairs of wires. There is only one manufacturer of this kind of cable in Australia, and only one buyer, so that there is an absolute monopoly. When I was Postmaster-General, this matter came before me in connection with Metal Manufactures Limited, a subsidiary company to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. between the two companies. Limited have a monopoly of the manufacture of these cables in Australia. Today, the Postmaster-General Parkhill) stated that there was a possibility of telephone charges being reduced by £1 for each subscriber. In 1928, when I was Postmaster-General, tenders were invited throughout the world for the supply of telephone cable. At that time there was a tremendous expansion of telephonic facilities. The Australian tender was £226,000, compared with a tender of £116,000 from a German firm for cable landed in Australiaa difference of £110,000. of its cable compare with that of the Australian article? same departmental tests, which are severe. to be said. tory, which cost a lot of money to establish, exists merely to manufacture cable for the Government.

( factures for industrial concerns as well. ground cable is practically confined to the Government. various classes of material --paper insulated by machinery, and the labour cost is less than 8 per cent, of the total cost of manufacture. Since 1929, there has been a falling off of telephone extensions, with the result that during the last two years the output of the factory was valued at only £25,000. The huge plant is practically idle. I foresee that when tenders are again called for cable the overhead expenses will be charged to the telephone users. In 192S, when those tenders to which I have referred were received, I sent for the manager of Metal Manufactures, and told him that the Government could not accept his company's tender, because it was so much higher than the German tender. I added, however, that if he. would agree to reduce his quotation by £38,000 it would be accepted. He did so, and the Government gave the contract to the Australian company. It seems to me that this industry should come under article. 9 ( Mr of the Ottawa agreement, which states that tariff protection shall bis afforded only those industries which are reasonably secured of sound opportunities for success. This industry has been established to supply the Government, and practically no one else, with cable. That means that it cannot manufacture all the year round, because the annual requirements of Australia can be manufactured within a few months. Taking into consideration the tariff protection afforded to local manufacturers of appliances conquality nected with the telephone system, the total added cost to the department is £700,000. It seems to me that these industries are not essential. The whole of the material supplied by them could have been purchased from Great Britain, and a huge saving made by the department. It would be a friendly gesture to that country if the Government reduced the duty from 30 per cent, to 5 per cent., thus enabling us to avoid excessive prices for telephone material.

The Tariff Board has stated that the existing duty is satisthat is the people of this country. We factory, and, no doubt, it will give consideration to this item later. -The Minister has endeavoured to justify the existence of duties by stating that, the amount of revenue collected during a period of twelve months was only small. In connection with this item, he said that the value of the imports had been a little over £1,000. The amount of revenue collected is really no criteriou as to what the duty should be. Tbe duty may be so tremendously high that nothing could be imported, and yet the burden on industry might be terrific because of the high prices charged by the local manufacturer. It is no argument to say that the value of the imports was only £1,000, or that the amount of revenue received was small, and that therefore the duty was harmless. instance the duty was highly effective, in view of the fact that the imports were few. If the Minister wishes to justify duties, he should use a better argument than the one which he has used to-night. I have been somewhat mystified by the remarks of the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson). I was much struck with his argument, and, for the moment, I thought that he was referring to something that I had done, because I remember encouraging a company to start copper wire drawing at Port Kembla: but it appears that his remarks had nothing to do with anything for which I can be held responsible. The honourable member endeavoured to show that the Commonwealth, in protecting local manufacturers, had been loaded with additional costs amounting to £700,000, but according to the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) the honourable member, when Postmaster-General, could have imported the material without having to pay any duty at all. I fail to understand the honourable member's point. The answer to the point taken by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Had the Paterson), as to the small quantity of imports, is to be found in the remarks of the honourable member for Corangamite, who said that the value of the output of the Australian factories in two years-was £25,000. There is only one buyer, and buy it and, as has been pointed out, we need not pay any duty on imported wire. There was no need for us to buy from the local manufacturers, unless we had made some arrangement with them to that effect, but if any arrangements were made they must have been made at the time the honourable member was Postmaster-General. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) seems to think that the Government should hand out money freely, and should not be liable for the payment of duties. He has had ministerial experience, and he knows as well as I do that every tender is submitted to the. Tender Board, and that that body, in considering them, must take the duty into consideration. The duty must Evidently, in this be credited to the local manufacturer before any decision as to the tenders can be arrived at. Further than that, certain departmental preference must be given. I cannot at the moment say what that preference was when I was Postmaster-General, but the right honourable member for North Sydney knows what it was dnring his term of office. No doubt tbe Minister for Trade and Customs knows the extent of the departmental preference given by this Government.

' Mr 8r,ULi.iK -I s the Government, bound by any statute to accept the decision of the Tender Board? ment is in duty bound to accept tbe decision of the Tender Board after it had taken every aspect, into consideration. I am surprised at the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson) iu making his complaint at this late stage. When I was Postmaster-General, I was not at all satisfied with the way in which inn iters were conducted in regard to tenders for the supply of telephone cables, and I think that the departmental documents will show' that not one tender but two tenders were accepted-on e local and one overseas. .1 believe the position in respect of the requirements of the department is being investigated at the present time. understand that some years ago, when the Government was short of telephone material, it encouraged certain manufacturers to start this industry in Australia. The Commonwealth Government has, from time to time, purchased, material from the company, and I presume that it is in duty bound to give it considerable support. In recent, years the cable requirements of the Postal Department have fallen to zero, and consequently there is little opportunity for local manufacture or for the importation of materials. The honourable member for Corangamite stated that during his term of office, the local tender was £226,000, and the German tender £116,000. When I was Postmaster-General, there were three tenders-local , foreign and British, but there was not nearly the difference between the British and the Australian tenders as there was between the foreign and t.he Australian tenders. If the matter were inquired into, I believe it would be found that some government gave considerable encouragement to local production. Every one knows that immediately after the war millions of pounds were spent by the Postal Department, and much of that, I believe I am safe in saying, was devoted to the carry-ing out of telephonic extensions, which raised our telephone branch to a very high state of efficiency. From a rumour that I heard to-day, I understand that the matter is being inquired into further, and that the local company is asking for more patronage from the Government. During my term of office, I was uot satisfied with some of the explanations that were made; consequently, the tender was divided, a certain quantity of material being brought in from outside, and the remainder being purchased locally.

It has been asserted in some quarters that the Government has consented to a restriction on the export of butter to Great Britain, and that this alleged fact shows that Australia is submitting to dictation from abroad.

Indeed, it has been allegedI am reading from a well-known Melbourne newspaper-that our primary industries are being dragooned by Great Britain or by the Commonwealth Government into export restrictions. At the outset, I want to make it quite the Australian Government, that is the clear that the question of the restriction of butter exports to the United Kingdom was raised, not by Great Britain, but by the Dominion of New Zealand. It is only just to the Government of Great Britain, in view of comments that have been based upon misunderstanding, that that fact should be made quite clear. On the 19th January last, the British Government received from the High Commissioner for New Zealand a letter asking that, as a . matter of urgency, a meeting should be arranged with a view to discussing the position that had been created by the fall of the price of butter in Great Britain to a level which could only be described as disastrous to exporting counof the Dairy Produce Export Control tries. That is the first point: That the question was raised by New Zealand, and that the British Government did no more than ask New Zealand and Australia to meet its representatives for the purpose of discussing the position. The next point that I wish to make is this: As is well-known, the Ottawa agreement provides for' tlie free entry of Australian and other dominion butter into Great Britain during a period of three years. does not ask that that provision be amended or altered in any respect. The Commonwealth Government is able to insist upon the observance of the terms of the Ottawa agreement. such insistence is required. Unless the Commonwealth Government agrees, no change can be made in the terms of the Ottawa agreement. The position, therefore, is that, if the dominions wish to maintain the Ottawa position, and to have no restriction in respect of butter, they can do so. No doubt has ever been raised as to that being the true position. British Government does not urge the imposition of any restrictions. there are no restrictions, it is quite certhe wishes of the Australian board, and tain that negotiations which are now pending for the making of trade agreeMr Jjalhnm. ments between the United Kingdom aud Denmark and other countries, will be greatly facilitated. The British Government, therefore, does not ask that any restriction be adopted. Tho question has to be considered in Australia simply from the point of view of the interests of the Australian industry. By the common consent of the British Government and only point of view which is being taken, or which if is necessary to take. The question under consideration relates to a dominion restriction, with a foreign restriction of double the percentage that might ultimately be adopted by agreement in the case of any dominion, together with the maintenance of the 15s. per cwt. preference in respect of dominion butter. Accordingly, if ultimately a restriction were accepted, it would mean that double. that restriction would apply to foreign butter on a percentage basis, and that the 15s. per cwt. in favour of dominion butter would bs retained. The Government has sought the advice Board, which is representative of tbe dairying industry. That board is now due for re-election; in fact, nominations have just closed. An election will be held in only one State, the sitting members in all the other States having been re-elected without a contest. It is reasonable, therefore, to suppose that the board possesses the confidence of the industry. If the board recommends that no restriction be imposed, the Government will The British Government have no hesitation in adopting that course. At the present time, the board does not, upon consideration of the facts recently placed before it, feel justified iu recommending that no restriction be Indeed, no imposed. It has been in communication with the Government, and this afternoon resolvedThe Australian .Dairy Produce Export Control Board resolves that the Commonwealth Government be requested to defer final determination of the question of restriction of the export of butter until the board has had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the representatives of the New Zealand Dairy The Board, who will visit Australia within the next few weeks. But if The Government is prepared to accede to therefore does not propose to take auy action at present. I have not iu this statement entered into the controversial subject of the probable effect of restriction. I have lfbt referred to the undue increase of imports into the British market, and the great reduction of price that has recently taken place, nor have I speculated as to the possibility that a restriction of exports might raise prices to an extent that would more than offset any disadvantage suffered through abstention from exporting a proportion of our butter. Leaving all these matters out of account, I have sought only to make clear that there has been no dragooning on the part of the British Government. The proposal to restrict exports was made first by the New Zealand Government to the British Government, which afforded an opportunity for a discussion of the subject, and submitted the issue to the Commonwealth Government for consideration. foundation for the suggestion promulgated in certain quarters that the Commonwealth Government is dictating to the industry, and imposing restrictions upon it. for the resolution of the board this afterthat has been felt lately, if no request for noon? been consulting the board in order to the Commonwealth Government to defer obtain its opinion.

B ut it should not agree to a restriction of exports, because if the season should prove more favorable than at present appears likely, our surplus stocks can be shifted abroad. There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that more than one communication on this subject was"" received by the Commonwealth Government from the Resident Minister in London, and that the British Government was insistent upon a restriction of exports, to which the board would not agree without conditions as to legislation which the Government was not prepared to accept. Now the determination of the matter is being deferred, and there is an attempt to camouflage, whicli is not fair to honourable members. -The Attorney-General( Mr Latham) has just made a carefully-prepared statement, and, when honourable members sought further information, took great pains not to depart from it in the slightest degree. myself ten minutes ago. gentleman was careful to make no departure from his prepared statement to enlighten honourable members more f u l l y regarding certain portions of it .

Why should the necessity arise for rushing these members to Canberra after they had reached a decision, unless some direction had been given to the Government from the other side of the world? There is more in tlii!S than a mere matter of correspondence with the New Zealand and British Governments, or the activities of the Control Board itself. ters that if they could get the New Zealand Government to agree, they would restrict exports. by the Prime Minister in reply to a question by the honourable member' for Richmond( Mr R.

309,Mr Beasley,"The point I amown on the matter quite apart from the board altogether. This subject cannot be glossed over as the Attorney-General is attempting to gloss it over to-night. There is too big a background to the problem. Too much knowledge of it is abroad for it to be handled in this way. It appears that the timely action of the honourable member for ""Wide Bay( Mr Corser) last week in focussing public attention on what is being done, and in bringing Ministers to their feet on this subject, was thoroughly justified. in New Zealand will succeed in arriving It is clear now that there is confusion within the Cabinet on this subject. Seeing that the board desires action deferred it is clear that some instructions must have been received from the other side of the world. Something definite has been asked of this Government. It is all very well to say that the Ottawa agreement cannot be varied unless the Commonwealth Government agrees to it. Of course it can be varied with such a willstatement about, the Government acting ing . government as is in power today. In view of the readiness of the representatives of this Government at Ottawa to fall in with the wishes of the British Government, and the readiness of the Government itself, a thousand times more marked to-day, to do everything that is requested of it from overseas, the agreement can doubtless be easily varied! The only conclusion we can reach is that pressure has been brought to bear upon it. Instructions have mean that the Government is prepared to been given, and it is useless for the Go-do whatever the board says, which is quite vernment to indulge in ""stunts "" with the Control Board. Perhaps the fact that nominations closed only yesterday made it desirable last week for the board to fall in with the wishes of the Government. Now there will be a little more sparring and a little more make-believe. But why cannot the Government be honest with the people, and tell them where it stands? -Perhaps it will be admitted now that the Minister for Commerce( Mr would accept the advice of the board whatStewart) took a little too much for granted last week in his endeavour to interpret the mind of the Control Board. I , for one, am pleased to have the assurment published in the most invenance of the A.ttorney-General( Mr tive section of the Australian pressLatham) that, for the'time being, the Government proposes to accept the advice of the board. correctly interpreted the right honourable gentleman's remarks. man has interpreted them with complete accuracy. that the Government will continue to be guided by the board, and that, the composite wisdom of our board and the board at, some agreement, which the Government will adopt. General) [10.3S] -The honourable member for West Sydney.( Mr Beasley) is very disappointed at the disappearance of a mare's nest into thin air-if that is where mare's nests go! We all know from where the honourable member got the idea on whioh he based his remarkable on directions from abroad. He received it from the daily journal which, I presume, is his main source of information. It was thought, desirable to make a plain statement of indisputable facts in relation to this subject. That, statement concluded with two definite observations. The first of these was that if the representatives of the industry desired any restrictions the Government would be prepared to accept its advice. That does not a different thing. I rose mainly for the purpose of making that plain. Suppose, for example, the board were to advise the Government' that it, was prepared to accept, restrictions, but that it recommended the acceptance of the restrictions on the conditions that the Government found a very large sum of money out of Consolidated Revenue. Then a very different question would arise. I made my statement in order to prevent any misunderstanding such as might be created by the suggestion that the Government ever it, was. That was exactly what I was careful not 'to say. My other observation was that, after . the statethat the Government had accepted dictation from a board, and would restrict",58,Adjournment Exports Op Butter To Great Britain

The question of air transport services has been comprehensively investigated recently by an inter-departmental committee, comprising responsible officers of the Civil Aviation Branch of the Defence Department, Commonwealth Railways, Postmaster-General's Department, and Treasury. So far as I am aware, the Auditor^General has not at any time suggested that there has been any malpractice in the administration of civil aviation, and the Government does not consider that there is any justification whatsoever for the appointment of a commission to investigate aviation activities in Australia. honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) asked the following questions, npon notice:1.
