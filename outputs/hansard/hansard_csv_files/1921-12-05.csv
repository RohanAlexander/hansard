0,". House Of Representatives. Monday, 5 December, 1921. Took The Chair At 3 P.m.,","and read prayers. I rise to a question of privilege. wish to refer to statements made in this House in Friday last by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney), which reflect on the Chairman and members of the Public Accounts Committee. about half-past 4 p.m on Friday, referred to the recommendation of the Committee in reference to a timber option on Vanikoro Island, which was alleged to have been secured by a Mr plenty of opportunity, if he so desired, of Caldwell. 'The (honourable member saidI must say that I found the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee .prepared to throw every obstacle in the way of my obtaining information, even though the evidence to which reference is made was takenpublicly, and in bhe presence of representatives of the press. Three legal gentlemen desired to obtain certain parts of the evidence, and I , as member for Melbourne, made a request for it on their behalf, but because one of those three gentlemen is not a persona grata with the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, the request was refused. was acting a l l through under the instructions of the Public Accounts Committee. I am instructed by -the Public Accounts Committee, of which body I am ViceChairman, to say, in reply to that statement, that in response to requests to be supplied with copies of the evidence for distribution, the honourable member for Melbourne was told, by direction of the Committee, that, as the Committee had notreported to Parliament on this particular matter 'at the time the requests were made, he could not be so supplied; but he was advised that there was no objection to his perusing the evidence at the Committee's-office. This offer, however, was not accepted. A copy of the evidence affecting Mr Caldwell was, however, forwarded to that witness as it was received from the printer. After the Committee had presented its report to Parliament the honourable member for Melbourne was supplied with copies of all .the evidence given in public in connection with this inquiry. 'The honourable member for Melbourne stated further, in regard to a letter written by Mr J. Woolf, thatAlthough this correspondence was official he ( Mr Fowler) has* to say that there was nothing in the letters which he considered worth placing on record. This official correspondence ought not to have been suppressed.* I * * # * * To that ithe Committee's reply is that tihe papers referred to were in no sense Dr. Maloney, speaking "" official"" documents, nor were they placed before 'the Ciommittee as evidence by Mr Caldwell. The papers consisted merely of copies of letters written to various persons by Mr Caldwell, who had producing these letters to the Committee whilst under examination, and of having them incorporated in his evidence. There was no suppression of any documents, well was given every opportunity to state his case in his own way. The correspondence referred' to was subsequently obtained from the honourable member for Corio. Referring to a statement by the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee about Senator E. D. Millen, the honourable member for Melbourne saidHe( Mr Fowler) states "" that the action of the honourable ge'ntlcman (Senator >E. .D. Millen) was correct and honourable in every regard."" This is an* opinion, although stated as a fact, not 'founded on any evidence or any statements made on oath by the individual concerned.* * # # * # He( Mr Fowler) states "" t h a t if he (the Minister) erred at all, it was, in his opinion, in showing undue consideration to the, person * Passages offensive to an honourable member deleted by direction of Mr Speaker.",19,Setup

4,Nor Were Any Facts Concealed'. Mr Cald,"who tried to inveigle the War Service Home3 Commissioner into a transaction in regard to property over which the would be vendor has J acquired no rights whatever.* # To that the Committee's reply is that the statement was made by the Chairman by direction of the Committee, and is shown in Hansard, page 13206.* The honourable member for Melbourne said of. a letter that had been writtenI consider that the letter is quite pertinent to this 'debate on the operations of the War Service Homes (Commission. It refers to tlie case of a man who has been deeply wronged by what I consider a conspiracy, and in connection with whose case iperjury has been committed, and the honourable member for Perth was in the chair when the perjury was committed. To that I am instructed by the Committee to reply 4/hat it has been repeatedly alleged that perjury has been committed by Lieut -Colonel Walker while under examination by the Committee. But the Solicitor-General, to whom the matter wa3 referred by the Committee, is of an entirely different opinion. He states thatThere is, however, in my opinion, nothing in the report to show that the statement was made with the knowledge that it was incorrect. Unless such knowledge can ibe shown there is no ground for a prosecution for perjury on proceedings under section G of the Committee of Public Accounts Act 1913. The honourable member for Melbourne said furtherI will prove the above facts and conclusions before a High Court Judge,* * To that the Committee reply that throughout the proceedings of the Committee the Chairman acts as its mouthpiece, and, although the reports bear only the signature of the Chairman, the Committee as a whole takes the responsibility for them. The quotations made by the 'honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) from a speech which I delivered on. Friday are, no doubt, correct, but a letter which I read is not privileged, its statePassages offensive to an honourable member deleted by direction of Mr Speaker. ments are those of the writer, and the writer of that letter challenges Parliament, the Government, or any citizen to disprove his statements. I believe that per# * # * jury was committed. I read from a previous examination, and I have to thank, as .the public has to thank, Senator John D. Millen, .of Tasmania, for proving that the man concerned told. untruths. I do not wish to follow that man further, because if it is true, as has been stated here through the lips of the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford), that he had been offered a bribe of £50,000, I will help him so far as I can to discover who the bribers are, and it is the duty of the Government to take the matter up. If a bribe tas been offered we should punish those who offered it. I have attacked Lieut -Colonel Walker, but there are mitigating circumstances, and I prefer to believe the word of Mr Gilbert, formerly Comptroller of the Repatriation Department, who supported the statement by Lieut -Colonel Walker, rather than of the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. Mullen). The charges I have menworth, but they are still unanswered. The public press reeks with this matter. I still maintain that the Public Accounts Committee had no right to suppress letters from Mr Caldwell. Does any honourable member think that if letters were tendered as 'evidence to the Supreme Courl the Judge would be content with the opinion of the Clerk of Courts as to their admissibility. Although many members of the Public Accounts Committee are my personal friends, I do not know #* * * # that any one of them is acquainted with the law of evidence. I have made personal inquiries in the Islands where the timber lands in question are situated, and I did not discover .one Government officer or private individual who, knowing Mr Caldwell, did not speak well of him and considered him an ill-used man. Whether he be right or wrong, the fact remains that he asked for an inquiry, not by the Public Accounts Committee, but by a Royal Commission presided over by a Judge. £50,000, why does he not take his case into the Court and prove it ?",19,Privilege Cjiaeges Against Public Accounts Committee

7,Mr Charlton,"If he has. a claim for .means cannot afford to go to the Law Courts. this man are not of limited means. High Commissioner for the Pacific proves that Caldwell had not a tittle of claim to those lands. perhaps four times Mr Caldwell's signature to a letter was sworn to before the Public Accounts Committee. But tlie witness when challenged by Senator John D. Millen, of Tasmania, admitted that the letter had not been signed by Mr Caldwell. The signature must have been a forgery. A witness swore in evidence that tbe letter was signed in the presence of three individuals, one of whom Mr Caldwell has never seen. I ask the Government if that document which was proved to be false has since been supplied to the officer representing the High Commissioner for the Pacific? member .to confine his remarks to a personal explanation. ments the honourable member is making are correct, Caldwell still had no claim to those Pacific lands, for Fairley, Rigby, and Company had a prior claim. Courts iare still open to Mr Caldwell, but, after my experience of the High Court, I would not advise any man of limited means to go before it. In behalf of a man whom I consider has been deeply wronged, I demand the appointment of a Royal Commission presided over by a High Court Judge to inquire into this matter. If that is done we shall have none of those "" fiddling"" methods by which the chairman consults his secretary, and the latter says that the language in a letter tendered as evidence does not please him. I withdraw nothing of what I have said. I believe that the letter quoted contains the absolute truth, and from my place I , as the representative of the city of Melbourne, demand the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry presided over by a High Court Judge to decide who is right and who is wrong. the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) has mentioned my name in connection with this matter, I desire to make a brief personal explanation. I mentioned in the House that Lieut -Colonel Walker had said that he had been offered a bribe of £5 per cottage if he would let the a contract for 10,000 cottages to a certain person. But that has nothing whatever to do with '.the Caldwell case. In reply to something said by the honourable member for Melbourne, I did say, in this House, 'that Caldwell had tried to sell the Commonwealth something that he never possessed, in other words, a gold brick. is exactly the position.

The trouble concerning Robert Denholm occurred during the period of my recent illness, and in my absence the Deputy Speaker( Mr Chanter), in response to references by the honourable member for Melbourne and other honourable members, made statements to the House which will be found on reference to pages 9633 and 963S of Hansard of this session. The Deputy Speaker (the Hon. J. M . Chanter), in his statement on the 1st July, quoted from a report he had obtained from the President of the Senate (the Hon. Thos. Givens), in which it was stated thatDenholm has not been ""dismissed""-hi s services as a temporary employee were terminated in accordance with the requirements of the Public Service Act, to which the pointed attention of the Head of the Joint House Department was called by the Auditor-General. The termination of his serwith Hungary. vices was made by the head of the Department, under the authority conferred upon him by the Puhlic Service Act. On 13th July the Auditor-General gave evidence before the Senate Select Committee, in which he questioned the accuracy of certain statements contained in the report concerning his own action as bearing upon the employment of RobertI moveDenholm. The matter is fully dealt with public in the final report of the Senate Select the Tariff, and pending the adoption of Joint Committee (No. S.I.F. 181S9) ordered to be printed on 31st August last, to which TheI refer the honourable member for more detailed information.

Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr net propose to argue this afternoon. I inCharlton) has remarked, by way of inter-, jection, if the motion be agreed to, this will be by no means the first occasion that the House has refrained from asserting whatever may be its constitutional rights or obligations in regard to a matter of this kind, but has endeavoured to put aside the question for consideration at a more opportune time. arrangements have been made for joint standing orders, the House will be able to consider this very important issue, which you, Mr Speaker, have-raised in connection with the Senate's message. orders cannot alter the effect of the Constitution in so far as this matter is concerned. pave the way, should the occasion arise, for the proper deliberation of these issues by the two Houses. this afternoon to discuss the constitutional question raised under section 53 of the Constitution. That has been done at length on two or three occasions, in this Chamber. The only point I desire at the moment to bring before honourable members is the absolute necessity for finalizing the Tariff. finalize it if the Senate persists in pressing its requests? difficulty. which we cannot compromise any further. Should that position arise later on, the House will have to determine it. I do not think, however, that honourable members will have any doubt as to the desirableness of finalizing the Tariff at the first possible moment. The bvisiness community want to know where they are. member think it should be finalized in the way desired by another place or as desired by this branch of the Legislature? will of this House should prevail in such matters. Honourable members know perfectly well that the Constitution has provided for the Senate making requests, but that it is more or less ambiguous as to whether the Senate may press a request over and over again or merely make a As the request. Those are questions which I do tend to confine my remarks to the motion, which is, in substance, that, in view of the necessity for finalizing the Tariff this House, for the time being, will determine to put on one side t i e question of its constitutional rights and obligations, for final determination at some more convenient period, aud will proceed to When possibly consider the requests of the Senate for the second time. I emphasize that the like procedure has been adopted on two previous occasions. it was distinctly stated that that course was not to constitute a precedent. establish a precedent now. I am simply setting out the issue before honourable members; which is-, that in view of the early termination of the session, it is essential to finalize the Tariff at the I do not propose earliest possible moment. That being the objective, it becomes desirable that, a f this moment, we should prevent a constitutional issue from arising between this House and another place. The first of the two occasions on which a' similar situation developed was on the 3rd September, 1902. The Senate returned to the House of Representatives the first Tariff Bill with a message announcing that, in relation to certain of its requests, the Senate again requested the House of Representatives to make the amendments We may reach a point at as originally requested by the Senate; and, as regards certain other requests, the message stated that the Senate had made modifications and requested the House of Representatives to make the amendments as modified. The then honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mauger) asked the Speaker's ruling concerning whether the message was in order and could be received by the House.

On the motion of the then Attorney-General( Mr Deakin) a resolution, similar to the motion which I have presented, was agreed to. There have been two or three other occasions on which a somewhat similar issue has been raised. With all but one of those, however, I shall not now deal. On 21st May, 1908, a message was received from the Senate in respect of a Customs Tariff Bill in which, inter alia, it was stated, "" The Senate has resolved to further press certain requests;"" and that Chamber again requested the House of Representatives to make the-amendments at issue. Again, the Speaker was asked to give a definite ruling, which, however, he declined to do. He referred to the course which had been adopted in 1902, and said that it was for the House to decide whether that course should be followed. Consideration of the message was made an Order of the Day for the 26th May. Upon that date, the House resolved, on the motion of the then Attorney General, thatHaving regard to the fact that the public welfare demands the early enactment of the Tariff, and pending the adoption of joint Standthe business-paper, as honourable members ing Orders, this House refrains from the deternow see it before them. mination of its constitutional rights or obligations in respect of the message received from the Senate, and resolves to consider it forthbecause I feel that if , at this stage, a conwith. sion Mr Speaker has given a ruling. have not definitely ruled that the Senate cannot take the course under discussion. You suggested, sir, that it was a matter for the consideration of this House whether the Senate could press its requests after the manner which it is seeking to do. I took it, however, that you did not definitely rule that the Senate had no power to press its requests in such a manner; but that, inasmuch as you recognised that there was, in the Senate's message, a constitutional issue between the two Houses, instead of stating the question from the Chair in the ordinary way, namely, that the consideration of the Senate's message be made an Order of the Day for the following day, you left a motion to that effect ito be moved deliberately from the floor of the House. I am of the opinion that the Senate, in pressing certain requests for amendments in the Customs Tariff, has exceeded the righto conferred on the Senate by section '53 of the Constitution. stood, Mr Speaker, that you did not definitely rule that the House could not receive the message. than raise the question; he gave a definite opinion. ferent from giving a deliberate ruling. Mr Speaker suggested that the House should take, namely, that it should be for the Minister in charge to move from the floor of the House that the consideration of the Senate's requests be made an Order of the Day for a certain day was advised with the deliberate intention of giving this House an opportunity to discuss the matter in a way which, otherwise, it could not do. I moved thereforeThat the consideration in Committee of the Senate's message be made an Order of the Day for to-morrow. Thus, it became a substantive motion on I am taking this line of action simply stitutional conflict is raised-and it would be 'a fairly bitter' one between the two Houses the probabilities are that fche Tariff would not be finished before the House had adjourned over the Christmas holidays. And, in that event, honourable members would be required to return next year to settle the matter. gesting what would be the possible-or , indeed, the probable-consequence s if this House were to decide .that the Senate had no right to press its requests after Hhe manner which it is seeking to do. I am not asking the House to decide that the Senate has the right to press its requests over and over again. I desire honourable members to put that issue on one side, for the time being, and to agree to consider the requests for the second time.

I do not think we are justified orders dealing with the matter, so that when in accepting the position as he has placed this question is again called on on the day it before the House. This is. the third for which, to-night, it may be set down, it will be for the House either to proceed with tlie occasion on which we have been faced consideration of the message, or to deal with with the same issue, and it seems to me it as it may think fit, or to refuse to consider that, notwithstanding the language in it, precisely as the House at that moment which the motion has been couched for pleases. I may remind the House that, on the last occasion, it was decided to take the message the purpose of preserving the rights of into consideration, but the following resolution this Chamber, the fact remains that by was adopted: "" That having regard to the fact that the same trouble crops up we are on each occapublic welfare demands the early enactment of a Federal Tariff, and pending the sion setting up a precedent. adoption of joint standing orders, this House refrains from the determination of occurred on the same point. its constitutional -rights or obligations in respect to this message, and resolves to receive and consider -it forthwith.""

The Minister is proceeding on exactly-the same lines.as were followed in 1908. should never have been established. no opinion; but it is to be regretted that the point has not been definitely settled. It cannot, I think, be settled by the Speaker's ruling, which has no binding effect upon proceedings in another place. There is, I think, no doubt as to the right of the House of Representatives to control taxation; but how such control can be co-existent with the right of the Senate to virtually insist on the acceptance of its requests, by persistence in pressing them after this House has refused to accede to them, it is difficult to see. It is true that the Senate has no right to amend-and while a request, in itself, is not an amendment, the pressing of requests already refused is an indirect form of attempted amendment, and in certain circumstances might approximate to attempted coercion of this House, as in cases where urgency would not admit of the delay in reaching a final decision. The whole matter hinges on the interpretation of sub-section 4 of section 53 of the Constitution. ' It will be a matter for the House itself to determine, either now or at some future time, what attitude it is going to take to protect 1 its undoubted right of control in matters of finance and taxation.

If that is the case, we. have all the more reason for deciding the matter for ourselves, in order to put this House in its proper position in relation to the Senate in regard to such matters. The Minister suggests that he wants to get finality in Tegard to the Tariff. We all do. But how can we get that finality if we permit this game of see-saw to continue? We decided upon a Tariff schedule and sent it to the Senate. The Senate sent us back a message asking us to consider certain requests. We did so, and we returned the schedule to the Senate with a courteous message telling them that we had considered their requests, and taken certain action in regard to them. Then they took it upon themselves to send the schedule back to us again for further consideration.

It carries with it the whole authority and power of the position of Speaker of the House of Commons, with this difference': that the House of Commons is part of a unified Farliament, in connection with which there cannot occur such difficulties as arise under, a written Constitution denning the respective rights of the two Houses of a Legislature. It w ill be seen that Sir ""William Irvine was of opinion that it is a matter for the Speaker himself. Mr G-KOOM -Si r W ill i am Irvin e refrained from expressing an opinion on the merits of the question. onYou, sir, as Speaker, are the only authority that can determine it, and this House can only affect your determination by disagreeing with your ruling if it should desire to do so. l thereTariffj and if thafc were the only issue, fore ask you to determine whether this is a message that can be sent down from the Senate under section 53 of the Constitution? There is a difference of opinion on the point, but I think that most honourable members consider, with me, that the matter is one for the House to determine. We cannot procrastinate any longer. If the question is not settled now ib will only crop up, probably in another form, when, if we be near the end of' the session, we shall have a proposal similar to that now before us. If we continue to pass such motions our attitude towards the Senate will become a precedent, in spite of all that may be said. There is not the slightest doubt thab we ought to stand by our fights, and insist on the Senate accepting our decision. once, if the Senate stands on its dignity, and insists on returning these rejected requests to us again, we can hope for no finality. a double dissolution. solution, and, though a double dissolution may take some time to accomplish, I see no good in pursuing the course now proposed by the Government.

The Minister -has stated fche issue quite plainly in thafc respect, and there is a general desire on the part of the mercantile and manufacturing community to geb finality in regard to the provisions and figures,of the Tariff. But As I have safd more than fchat is nob the only issue, as fche Minister implied rather than said. This is the third major occasion on which the issue has arisen between the two Houses, and the more we refrain from putting a stop to this procedure the more we assent taci t l y to the assertions of another place. The Minister read the resolution passed in 1902 by this House, when it decided, on the grounds of public welfare, not. to settle the issue w i th ithe Senate.

On this occafrom the determination of its constitutional rights or obligations in respect to this message, and resolves to consider it forthwith. v The answer of the Senate to that message was a challenge of the most emphatic and proclamatory kind which could possibly issue from that House. This is what the Senate said by resolutionThat the action of the House of Representatives in receiving and dealing with the reiterated requests of the Senate 'is in compliance with the undoubted constitutional position and rights of the Senate. The Senate did not accept courteously the attitude of no fight which the House of Representatives put up then andagain in 1908. But in accepting the resolution, of the House of Representatives, the Senate said, "" We have insisted on our undoubted constitutional rights.'' That was in 1902. same course in 1908. decide the motion of postponement proposed by the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs without considering something of the elements' and principles of the dis-1 pute itself. It appears to me that there is no power but the two Houses respectively that can settle this matter as the Constitution at present stands. It would be wrong to put so grave a responsibility either upon the President of another place or the Speaker of this House. A decision, so f a r as a decision is possible, can only be arrived at by a majority vote of the respective Houses. I believe that we cannot with propriety refer this issue to any other tribunal. The Constitution is widely open. This is the first provision of its kind that ever was framed, within my reading. It is ambiguous, and susceptible of many meanings. decide this issue, because neither this nor any other House would surrender the interpreta>tion of its powers and privileges to a body of jurists created for another purpose. Without traversing f u l l y the merits and history of the question. I might ask honourable members to consider the position for a moment. Before the Commonwealth Constitution was framed, every Upper House within the 'British Empire, and I think it is quite safe to say in any other country adopting parliamentary government of owe kind, was limited with respect to certain Bills. It s powers 1 over finance were not co-equal with those of the lower, or the popular, branch of the Legislature. nexion with money Bills. There are various interpretations of that, as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Foley) knows. When the Commonwealth Constitution was framed two reasons apparently impelled the Convention, the Parliaments, and the people to accept the new method for the treatment of finance Bills. The two reasons were, first, that the Senatei n the Federation represented the second entity in the Union. The House of Representatives represented the Federation of peoples, and the Senate the Federation of States. It was clear, therefore, that if the States were to exercise any real in fluence in connection with important matters of government and legislation, the I do not think we can Senate must be given some concession in advance of previous practice. Thenf o r the first time in the history of British peoples that I can recall, the franchise of both Houses of the Federal Legislature was the same, and, owing to the broad, Democratic basis on which the Senate was elected, ib was fel t that it ought to be intrusted with some larger discretionary powers in money matters. The Convention invented, or tried to invent,"" a provision midway between no power and equal or f u l l power, and said to the Senate, "" Y o u may accept or reject a money B ill . You may not amend it , but you may request its amendment,'' and there it stopped. Convention followed the South Australian practice in that. our constitutional provision is exactly the same as the South Australian provision. is that in South Australia it is called the power of suggestion. suggest is not quite the same as the power to request. The honourable member may be inclined to view the question from the point of view of the Senate, as, unfortunately, for him , he committed himself to the Senate's views, as a leader in another place when this question arose on a previous occasion.",29,Customs Tarif Fbill Senate S Right To Press Requests

Many constitutional authorities hold fchat there are only three stages of any Bill-that is to say, there are three major stages, the second reading, the Committee stage, and the third reading. and technical stages There is a motion to introduce a B ill , a motion for the firsb reading, and other practically formal motions, . and these are perfunctory and elementary stages. The really deliberative stages commence when fche second reading is attempted, are pursued in detail in the Committee stage, and finally disposed of on the thir d reading.

But whebher there are three or five stages of a Bill-and different schools of thought would decide thafc point differently-ther e axe certain clear stages of a B ill , and if suggestions or requests may be made by another place afc any Btage of a B ill , there is still a l i m it to the number of stages. motion was submitted to strike out the words "" any stage,"" and insert the word "" once."" collision had occurred befcwet_ the Senate and fche House of Representatives, a Constitution was framed in this State of Victoria. It adopted practically the principle of the power of request for the Upper House; but in order to make sure fchat the confusion or ambiguity, obvious in the Federal Constitution, would notoccur in the State Constitution, the number of times upon which requests might be made by the Upper House of the Victorian Legislature to the Lower House, was limited. We are not in a position to make fchat provision here. A t some stage or another, possibly by deliberation of the Standing Orders Committee of the two Houses, a modus vivendi for the settlement of fchis issue will have to be found. The only alternative to that is to deliberately suggest an amendment of bhe Constitution more specific in its interpretation of this section, and put it to fche people for their acceptance or rejection. the section thafc gives rise to the trouble. Minister's proposal satisfy the House at the present time? Every time we postpone the settlement of the question we decline the challenge of the Senate. Every time the Senate receives the kind of message proposed, its determination becomes harder. If , every time the difficulty arises, the same precedent is laid AH the rest are formal down, they may contend that there is no means of interpreting the section other than the practice between the two Houses, and, as MT . Speaker Holder very properly observed, the\ rights of this House become weaker and weaker. There can be no democratic system of government, whether unitary or federal, in my judgment, which permits the Upper House to exercise co-equal powers with the Lower House on two very i m portant matters, the first being finance, and the second the power over the Executive. Those who read constitutional history and endeavour to appreciate the importance of constitutional principles, must realize that for the safety of a democracy of any kind it is necessary to keep these two powers finally in the hands of the Lower House of Legislature. I say now that, unless the Minister for Trade and Customs accompanies his In 1903, a f t -r fche nrsfc motion with a definite promise that the Government w ill , during the recess that is to rapidly supervene, produce for the consideration of Parliament next session some solution of this question as to either procedure or principle, the position in which this House w ill be left to-day w ill be worse than it has ever been. meet the situation. honourable member, but it w ill satisfy some of us. tion be referred to managers appointed by the two Houses? that, quite apart from the merits of the particular B ill which gives rise to the question now, the Minister might promise",30,Customs Tarif Fbill Senate S Right To Press Requests

133,Mr Gregory,"I am not asking forOn the other hand, in the case of a Bill euch as the Customs Tariff Bill, which the Senate may not amend, hut only request amendments, the House of Representatives alone is responsible for the form of the measure. The Senate cannot strike out, alter, or add one word to it, but can only suggest that the House of Representatives should do so. ultimately refuses .to make the suggested amendments, the Senate must either pass the Bill as it stands, reject it as it stands, the position be? The Constitution clearly or shelve it, because the Bill is in the Senate. A House which can make an amendment can insist on the amendment which it has made, but a House which can only request the other House to make amendments, and cannot insist on those amendments, is in a different position; if its request is not complied with, it has the power to reject the Bill or shelve it. The responsibility for sacrificing a Bill is on the House where the measure is at the time. In the case of an ordinary amendment made by the Senate, the Bill is returned with that amendment to the House of Representatives; but in ithe case of a requested amendment, the Bill remains in the Senate. This alone seems to be the important distinction between the right of amendment and the right of request. It would appear, therefore, that this provision in the Constitution is intended to declare nothing more than that: (1) the House of Representatives is solely responsible for the form of the money Bills to which the section relates; (2) that the Senate may request alterations in any money B ill ; and (3) that if such request is not complied with, the Bill, still being in the Senate, that House has to take the f u l l responsibility for accepting, rejecting, or shelving it as it stands, except in so far as it can say its action is caused by the House of Representatives refusing -its request. Having these powers, surely it cannot be pass the proposed law. argued that the Senate must accept the rejection of its request by the House of Representatives, and has no right to press, to amendments to a B ill ; but in this case and, if necessary, again press, its request it is requested amendments. before it decides whether or not it will reject the whole measure. It has been joint sitting is held, the ""suggested"" class done over and over again. The Constiof amendments are for the first time not tution seems to have contemplated very recognised. The joint sitting must vote clearly any such situation. The rights of the House of Representatives do not prevail over .those of the Senate in the case of.amendments ""suggested"" by the Senate until after a joint appeal to the people. In order to test a principle, it is advisable sometimes to take an extreme case. Let us, therefore, assume that the If that House Senate kept on repeating its suggestion, and the two Houses kept on playing at battledore and shuttlecock, what would meets the case. The Senate would not have ""passed .the Bill with amendments to which, the House of Representatives will not agree "" within the meaning of section 57; but it would "" fail to pass "" the B i ll within the meaning of that section. The House of Representatives would, af ter the statutory period of three months, even if the Senate was still repeating its request, again pass the proposed law, either with or without the Senate's "" suggested "" amendment. The section for the double dissolution, therefore, specifically recognises the "" suggested"" as well as the ""made"" class of Senate amendments. Af ter the double dissolution, the section again, in providing that the House of Representatives may again pass the proposed law, specifically recognises the Senate's ""suggested"" class of amendments, and provides that the House of Representatives may or may not include these in the Bill.

It is true that the word "" suggested "" occurs in this section, and the word ""request"" in section 53, but clearly it is intended to apply to the same class of amendment, for there are only two classes of amendments, namely, the actual amendment as in an ordinary proposed law, and in suggested or requested amendment of proposed money and taxation laws. As the Constitution recognises . the power of request in the double dissolution section, it is not possible to believe that it was ever intended that the Senate should, without even sending a request back a second time, reject a proposed law because the House of Representatives refused a request for an amendment sent down only once. Senate has exercised such a right on previous occasions since the resolution of 1902 was passed without any "" without prejudice "" motions being carried. 10th October, 1906, a message was received by the House of Representatives from the Senate returning and pressing its request for certain amendments in the Excise TariffB ill 1906. The House of Representatives agreed to a part of the request, but rejected another part. Later on the same day the Senate sent the request back for a third time, with a message indicating .that it further pressed uhe request. The House of Representatives agreed to the request. From the point of view of the States, and the position that was understood between them at the time of Federation, one cannot put the position clearer than to quote the words of the present Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) on 3rd September, 1902, vide Hansard, page 15705. ster was not a member of the Convention. years after the Convention. placed before the people in regard to bhat power. them before the people, and expressed what he believed to be the intention of the framers of the Constitution. It is better to have an opinion formed at that time than at this juncture, when we fancy [545]2 we require the power for a specific purpose. He saidIfI thought for a moment that any of our privileges were in question, I should vote against the motion; but I firmly believe that the Senate is acting quite within its rights. I do not believe that any of the men in New South Wales who voted against the Bill, or half of those who voted for it, hod any doubt in their minds that the Senate was to have, except as to mere quibbling of terms, exactly the same power as the House of Representatives in all matters. The honourable member for Wentworth described, during the referendum campaign, in colloquial terms the difference between a request and an amendment as the difference between "" tweedledum and Senate's tweedledee."" We have heard some eloquent and learned dissertations upon the construction of clause 53. But how is it construed by the people of the country ? Undeniably it was said by the Leader of the Government, by the Leader of the Opposition, and by the leaders of the Federal party throughout Australia, that one of the essentials of Federation was equal representation in the Senate in order to safeguard the interests of the States The as such as opposed to the interests of the majority of the people as such. Is there any State interest more important than the financial interest? Are On we to say that the Senate is to have the power to make requests and ask us to accept them, and no more? That is what we are doing to-day. a representative of one of the smaller States should, by an interjection of that nature, seem to favour destroying the power of the Senate. position as it is laid down in the Constitution. Minister stated further. . . . and that the .Senate is to be placed in exactly the same position as that accepted by the Legislative Council of the State Parliaments. If any man had dared to stand up and tell the smaller States that the Senate 'had no such power, the Constitution would never have been accepted.' This issue was f u l l y debated in the Convention. In volume 11, page 1,996, of the debates, Mr (now Mr Justice) H i g gins is recorded as having moved for the deletion from section 53 of the Constitution the words "" at any stage,"" with the Yes ; he placed object of inserting "" once "" in their stead.

Constitution was approved by the people of the Commonwealth in tlie f u l l belief that power was there. As I have shown, an attempt was made in the Convention to strike out from section 53 the words "" at any stage,"" and to insert in their stead the word "" once"" ; but the opinion of the Convention was against this course. The late Sir Samuel Griffith, speaking on this issue in the Convention, saidThere must be a check, and a substantial check, and if the smaller States are only going to be offered something which is nominally a check and which will not stand the test of time and use, it appears to me difficult to suppose that there will be any disposition on their part to enter into an alliance by which they practically subordinate their powers and interest in every Pederal question to the decision of the majority in the national assembly. . . . . . My present inclination-and I think I am justified in expressing my views at this stage of the proceedings in a tentative formis to give to the Senate the right of amending all money Bills-no t of increasing the burden, but simply of exercising power of veto in detail. My present idea is that no exception, should prevail, because, of course, in Appropriation Bills, by the aid of devices of which history affords various instances, the most important question can bo raised, and any House which does not possess the power of amending or of vetoing money Bills in detail can be subjected to disadvantages which practically make them powerless. He also pointed out that a weak Senate the position as stated by the honourable will give way, whereas a strong Senate member for Balaclava or the Deputy would adhere to its opinion for equal power for both Houses. ber for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), who interpreted as we find it to-day.

We are asked again to consider practically the same resolution, as was carried on that occasion. ence. desirable to have any Tariff settled at the earliest possible moment, and this provision of the Constitution, operating as it has, is responsible for the delay which has occurred in the determination of T a r i ff questions. Tariff about two years, and the Senate had it only a few weeks. member is referring to tihe time that has elapsed since it was introduced. The periods occupied in discussion in the respective Chambers do not bear the same ratio as the honourable member has suggested. It has been pointed out that the framers rjf the Constitution endeavoured to find a. solution of the difficulty that they anticipated as likely to be experienced between the two Housesi n connection with money and taxation Bills. The last paragraph of the very section under consideration shows, to the lay mind, that an exception was made with respect to laws appropriating revenue or imposing taxation. The concluding paragraph of section 53 readsExcept as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws. The honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) gave us some quotations fro m the remarks of the Convention delegates"", and some indication was furnished as to whafc was in their minds and whafc was done in 1891 in connection w it h money Bills. The provision adopted at the Convention in 1897 readsIn the case of a proposed law which the Senate may not amend, the Senate may at any stage return it to the House of Representatives with a message requesting the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks lit, make such omissions or amendments, or any of them, with or without modifications. bhere is an end to i i . at the Convention. He statedThere is one matter which I should like to draw attention to with regard to suggestions. It seems to me we might odd something to it to make the sub-section more complete. It says, "" And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make such omissions or amendments, or any of them, with or without modifications."" If we were to add, "" And the We know that it is House of Representatives shall take into consideration such suggestions and,"" it would be rendered imperative that these amendments sent down as suggestions should be taken into consideration. That Convention did not add those words. Mr Dobson, who represented one of the small States, and who had kept this vofced to give fche Senate fche righfc to amend money Bills, statedThis sub-section gives the Senate the power Tne honourable of making suggestions, and we have to be content with that, as we have been beaten on the clause which sought to give them the power to amend money Bills. There is an admission of the limitation thafc was inserted in the Constitution subsequently. It was remarked by the late Sir George ReidIf we are to work the Federation in harmony, the financial business must be under the control of one House, and that the House of Representatives. All through fche debates fche discussion was uponfchafcparticular point. If fchafc interpretation is not accepted, the position will be, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr. Watt), that, while the Senate is denied the right fco amend money Bills, ifc can, by requesting amendments and by its power of rejection, exercise considerably more power than if it were given tbe direct right fco make amendments. Ifc would have the power to enforce acceptance, of amendments at any time during the passage of a measure like a TariffB ill without having to take the responsibility, as ifc must in the case of other Bills, of amending them directly or rejecting them.

Sir [4.50] -Honorabl e members Have to consider this question from the stand-point of existing conditions. Try as hard as they may, they cannot disregard the gravity of the situation, brought about by the unconscionable delay in completing the Tariff. If the advice of some honourable gentlemen were taken, it would involve the postponement of the settlement of the Tariff question for a further considerable time. The position is -and I desire to emphasize it so that it may be truly realized by the Housethat, at fche present moment, we are practically collecting revenue under four Tariff instruments. which is at present in force as an enactment, is that of 1914. Collections which have been made since, under various schedules, have from fcime to fcime been validated, and the result is this extraordinary and anomalous state of affairs, that if a rate of duty imposed by the Tariff of 1914 is higher than that, imposed by the schedulefchafcis now the subject of the consideration of Parliament, then, although Parliament' has virtually . determined that the duty on a particular article shall be reduced, the higher rate is levied. But, on the other hand, if the rate provided for in the schedule UOAV under the consideration of Parliament is higher than that in the. 1914 Tariff,-duty is collected under the schedule; that is to say, the highest duty, whether under the Act or proposed by the schedule, is always collected. That is most unreasonable, unfair, and disturbing to the trading and commercial community. The practice has existed for many years, but it has occasioned a great deal of trouble and difficulty, and brought about many demands for refunds. Under it the commercial community suffers, and the consumer suffers. Therefore, some expedient must be found for the finalization of the present Tariff schedule, which has been before the House since March, 1920. The people will not learn with equanimity that this House and the Senate are quarrelling over what each conceives to be its constitutional rights, while the anomaly of which I have spoken remains. Let us do justice to the public, and settle this all-important Tariff matter, and afterwards take some other means to determine the constitutional rights of the two Houses, inj regard to which strong them. practical effect of passing this motion ? same asfchafcof similar, motions passed in 1902 and 1908.

When the resolution containing that assertion of rights was transmitted by message to the Senate, that Chamber said, "" We will deal with this matter in a manner that will provide for the reassertion and protection of our constitutional rights."" Time allowed for the discussion extended until its a strong and rigid assertion of rights by each of the Houses. I have been a member of the Senate, and I can assure honourable members that on this particular question each Chamber is animated by the indefeasible determination that there shall be no sacrifice of what it conceives to be its constitutional rights. It is, therefore, useless for the members of this House to say, "" We insist on this matter being settled at once."" The idea should not be held that we can coerce the other Chamber; because, we cannot do so. The members of the Senate are as strongly imbued with the necessity of asserting their constitutional rights as we are, and, therefore, will not recede from their position. Thus, unless we are prepared to proceed to a double dissolution, we have no chance of settling the question; and even' that would not permanently settle it . reason why the proposal now made by the Government should be accepted. has been suggested that there may be a Convention. question could then be considered; but it is obvious that certain alterations of the Constitution w ill have to be made in the more or less early future. Ifthis and the other Chamber are not going to come to some mutual working arrangement, an alteration of the Constitution will be needed. What took place anterior to the nassing of the Constitution is more or less beside the question. It is quite true, as has been mentioned, that this House in dealing with this question is justified in looking back to what took place anterior to the passing of the Constitution, in order to learn the spirit and intention of the framers of that instrument. out that in 1891, when it was suggested that the Senate should be at liberty to make an amendment, and to send that amendment down to the House of Representatives once only, that was objected to. For whafc reason? Sir Samuel Griffith said on that occasion, "" Under such conditions you would cripple and cramp the power of the Senate,"" and the Convention accepted fche view thafc ifc was undesirable that the Senate, which is a very different body from the Legislative Council of a State, should be so restricted in determination. its powers. Honourable members should not r u n away with fche idea thafc the Senate is similar to a Legislative Council; its powers are infinitely more important. When, in 1897, the Convention was contice Higgins, then Mr Higgins, wished to amend the provision, "" The Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives,"" by striking out the words "" at any stage,"" with a view to inserting fche word "" once,"" so thafc it should be competent for the Senate to send back its requests once only. The Convention would not agree to that amendment, because its adoption would have crippled and cramped the powers of the Senate, and the provision was allowed to remain as drafted. The Constitution, therefore, now reads, "" The Senate may at any stage."" When the word "" m a y "" is used, it connotes absolute and complete discretion so far as fche Senate is concerned. The words "" a t any stage"" are not There is a good limited in their meaning by the ideas ordinarily associated wifch stages of a B ill ; It they mean afc any fcime while fche B ill is before Parliament.

If it had been intended thafc fche power of making requests should be limited to the making of one request, fchat would have been expressed in the Constitution, but no such limitation appears there.

I claim that a settlement must be a matter of mutual arrangement, and it is the duty of the Government to take action to that end. In 1902 the opinion was expressed that the constitutional rights of the two Houses must be settled apart from the immediate issue on which the Tariff question was raised. So, too, to-day we musb settle this dispute as a constitutional issue, and aparb from the merits of the question which is immediately before the House. The best course is to follow the precedent established on two previous occasions. I quite agree with the honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) that the Government ""are called upon to take this matter into immediate consideration, and I reiterate the statement that if no Convention to consider the Constitution is held, some amendment of it , at the instance of this Parliament itself, must be made. throw out the B ill . and this Chamber should be animated by a desire to make mutual concessions, w i th the object of arriving at a common working arrangement between the two Chambers. It is most undignified for the two branches of the Legislature to be quarell in g over this matter. It is useless to abuse the Senate because it is insistent on what it regards as its constitutional rights. It has as much right to do that as has this Chamber.

Only if the Customs Tariff Bill interfered with the rights of' the States could the Senate perfor finality, and they must have intended sist in its objections. No Constitution providing for a bicameral Legislature permits tlie second Chamber to interfere with taxation. Of course, the American Constitution is framed by the Americans themselves, but the first granted under the British Crown was that of the State of New South Wales, and it and all those which have subsequently emanated from the same source, and which recognise the authority of the Crown, have .emphatically provided that the second Chamber shall not interfere with measures for the imposition of taxation. The men who drafted the New South Wales Constitution many years ago had no experience to guide them, but that document represented their conviction that under the British Constitution the second Chamber is merely a House of revision, and should have no power' of taxation. second Chamber is not an elective body. argument. The elective second Chamber of the Victorian Legislature is similarly limited in regard to powers of taxation. Andi t must be remembered that, when there are two elective Chambers, they are elected on different franchises. The Federal Constitution empowers this House to impose a Tariff, and the Senate cannot alter it. We might ignore the Senate's requests by continuing to collect the duties imposed by this Chamber, and then at the close of the Parliament pass a special Bill to indemnify the Government in respect of all money collected under the Tariff. the duties fixed by this Chamber continue to be collected until this Chamber alters them supports my argument that the 'Senate has no power in relation to Customs -taxation. The time has come when we must take a stand in defence of the privileges of this House, and we should lay it down that the return of the Tariff to this Chamber with requests is the final -stage. If we acknowledge the right of the Senate to request amendments, and when they are not made to press their requests and continue pressing them inprocedure. The framers of the Constitution must have understood the need the Senate's power to be limited' to the making of a request. Of course, the framers of the Constitution worked under great difficulty. The States and interested parties were trying to block Federation, and the Constitution, as finally agreed to, was the best compromise that could be devised. I feel confident that if the framers of the Constitution had intended that both Houses should have equal powers in respect bf taxation measures they would never have provided for the equality that exists in the representation of the States in the Senate. Both the Canadian and South African Constitutions provide that the second Chamber shall have no voice whatever in regard to taxation. When the South African Constitution was being changed the advice of Mr Alfred Deakin and Mr J. 0. Watson were sought, and they pointed out the anomalies in the Australian Constitution. My attitude upon this constitutional issue is not influenced by the fact that this discussion has arisen in connection with the Tariff. Any other attempt by the Senate to dictate taxation would compel me to take the same stand. If the Customs Tariff Bill interfered with the rights of any States the Senate would be within its constitutional powers in resisting it to the utmost, but no such question has arisen, and we should proceed to operate the Tariff as it left this House regardless of the opinions of the Senate. Does any honourable member believe that, if the matter were submitted to a referendum of the people, they would agree that the second Chamber should The very fact that decide what the taxation should be? I was somewhat surprised at the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt). I thought that he would have taken up a very strong stand, and would not have been prepared to gloss over this attempted invasion of our constitutional rights. The proposal he has made should not be tolerated by the House'. It is absolutely unthinkable that we should evade this issue to-day on",40,Robert Best Exactly Considerable Pains Endeavoured To Show

I am tired of hearing of precedents. Parliament, in matters of this kind, should bring its own common sense to bear. There is no reason why we should slavishly follow precedents created in years gone by, in circumstances thafc do not obtain to-day. If we are to be continually hedged about by precedents, we shall never accomplish any valuable reform. The House should be prepared to say afc once that the' Senabe is not entitled to press its requests. know whafc would be the effect, of some of the amendments of the Tariff which another place is pressing us to make. The amendments, whatever they may be, are of little consequence compared with the vital issue as to whether or not the Senate shall be allowed to encroach upon the rights of this Housei n regard to matters of finance and taxation. Surely we are not prepared fco disregard this attempt, on the part of another place, to invade our constitutional privileges, merely because it would not suit the convenience of some honourable members to remain here until the whole question has been fought to a finish. I think that if the honourable member for Balaclava had known my views on this subject he would riot have spoken as he did. We should tell fche Senate fchat in matters of finance and taxation the House of Representatives is supreme. I think thafc fche Senate, in deciding to press certain requests, was influencedby the belief that since the end of the session was close ab hand, we should not be disposed to combat its demands. I am convinced fchafc honourable members generally share my view, which is a common-sense one, and I hope thafc we shall decide that there shall be no infringement of our constitutional privileges on fche part of another place. ter for Works and Railways) [5.30] I desire briefly to address myself to this question of the relations of the two Houses, which has been discussed in this Chamber -on more than one occasion. In dealing with it , we must have regard, first of all, to the business out of which fche constitutional issue has arisen. Honourable members generally admit the pressing necessity for passing the T a r if f. If there is one question of outstanding public imThe honorportance which demands determination at the earliest possible moment, ifc isfchafcof fche Tariff, because for many years-eve n from the beginning of the war the whole Commonwealth has been anxiously awaiting T a r i ff revision. I urge honourable members, in dealing with this question, to keep that point in view. It is only because of the urgency for fche early enactment of the Tariff thafc the Minister has submitted this motion. The relations of the two Houses reI do not ceived a great deal of consideration afc the hands of the Federal Convention, and those who have read the Convention debates are perfectly clear on the point that it was never intended by fche framers of the Constitution that the Senate should be but a reproduction of the State Legislative Councils, with their limited outlook and status. The Convention created a Federal Constitution, in which provision was made for a people's House, based upon the popular w ill, and a Senate as a revising Chamber, designed to f u l f i l the functions ordinarily discharged by a second Chamber, bufc afcfchesame fcime, to possess, wiuh certain exceptions, co-ordinate powers of legislation. In order to determine what was intended, we have not to look afc the speeches of members of fche Convention. We have rather to examine critically the actual wording of section 53 .of the Constitution. That section, taken in conjunction with the whole fabric of the Constitution, makes it clear first of all that proposed laws appropriating revenue, or imposing taxation, shall originate in fche House of Representatives. In that respect this House is supreme, and fco fchat extent it has the con trolling power over finance. Responsible government is possible only when bhe control of the Executive is vested in the popular House, and honourable members are aware that the Constitution vests that control in the House of Representatives. Wifch reference to the proposition immediately before us, we have to ask ourselves what are fche respective rights of the two Houses, and whether the Senate is entitled, at any particular stage,",41,Robert Best Exactly Considerable Pains Endeavoured To Show
196,Mr Groom (Darling Downs,"Ministo repeat a request for the amendment of a Bill imposing taxation. Tihe Senate has taken up the strongest possible attitude with respect to its right to press such garding the present situation. There is no a request, and the House of Representatives has, before to-day, expressed just as strongly the opinion that the Senate is not entitled to press its requests for the amendment of a measure of this kind. If we return the Bill to the Senate with an intimation that we refuse to entertain. its requests, when repeated, then whatever may be the outcome we must stand by that decision. In that way a deadlock might occur, and lead to the dislocation of t'he whole of the business of the Commonwealth. Neither House could lightly regard such a situation. The whole working 6f constitutional government, both in the United Kingdom and in the Commonwealth, has proved , in respect of the two Houses, where each possesses certain absolute powers, that if it is desired to carry on the business of the country without continual conflicts there must be a certain degree of give and take. matter of all give and no take. Hitherto, if both parties had made extreme claims and had insisted on their particular rights, there could only have followed a deadlock, with resulting confusion and trouble. Common sense suggests, however, that when faced with such a serious position both Houses should, for the time being, refrain from pressing their respective claims, and should endeavour to'find some way of getting over the difficulty. That is what is now being sought. Honourable members are desired merely to agree to the motion. I admit that the present occasion will have been the third on which a similar method has been adopted. a Tariff schedule. of this suggestion does not establish any rights in the Senate. alter the legal and technical position respecting the constitutional powers of this Chamber. Failure on the side of one party to exercise its powers may strengthen the determination of the other party. That is all that one can say requestion of this Chamber waiving any of its constitutional rights; whatever rights the House of Representatives may possess still remain with it . I do not wish at this moment to go into strict legal interpretations. There have been two diverse view? expressed by men who attended Constitution Conventions, and by others who were not delegates thereto. The question is not one of pure legal construction. There must be considered the best methods by which constitutional government can be carried on in Australia. That should be the determining factor in deciding the relations of the two 1 Houses each to the other. I agree entirely with the view that twenty years is a long enough period to have been allowed to elapse, with this matter still remaining open, without any attempt on the part of the House of Representatives to get into touch wifch the Senate in order to bring about a solution. means ? gest to the Prime Minister-and I am taking this course entirely on my own responsibility-is that steps' should be taken to ascertain if standing orders cannot be devised by the two Houses under the guidance of.which we may be able to regulate procedure whenever again this issue may arise. suggest the introduction of a Bill for the alteration of the Constitution? ter for Parliament to decide. In the interests of Australia it might be better,_ perhaps, instead of having a rigid Constitution, that it should be so amended as to provide a greater measure of elasticity.

Under the Constitution the control of these measures, the power to make amendments, the power to originate, rests entirely with this House. In the course of a dispute a stage must ultimately come when this House would be bound to say, "" We are the controlling Chamber; we intend to exercise our powers, of control over f in a n c e "" ; and then, if the other place did not agree, we would throw upon that Chamber the responsibility for acceptance or rejection. But have we yet arrived afc that stage? In considering the Tariff schedule, Parliament has. been dealing with a matter covering thousands of items and effecting taxation over an exceedingly wide area. Afc this stage I ask if honourable members think we have arrived afc such a critical point in the course of the Customs TariffB ill that the House of Representatives would be justified in sending back the Senate's pressed requests with the message"" You must either acoept the items in dispute as we have sent them to you or take responsibility for throwing out the whole measure.'' The only way in which the issue may be determined, other than in the manner proposed for the acceptance: of honourable members, would be to issue, practically, a challenge. First, however, an endeavour should be made to secure the'' easy working of our Constitution so thafc ultimately in the making of our laws we might feel that we did not only express the sovereign will of the people, but of fche States also, as represented in the Senate, thu9 securing true representation of the whole of Australia in the Federal Legislature. All I ask honourable members to do is fco agree to the motion, to preserve the rights of this House, and then, afc some f u t u re opportune stage, to consider fche framing of joint standing orders which may provide a satisfactory determination upon the subject-matter of the dispute between fche two Chambers. MrM c WILLIAMS ( F r a n k l in) [5.45]. I agree that this is not a fcime to go very deeply into the constitutional aspect of this matter. Bufc fchis is fche t h i r d occasion on which I have heard 'a similar debate, arising upon an identical issue as between the two Houses of the Federal Legislature. And on two other ocasions the position 'of this House, in relation to certain requests of the Senate, has been waived without quesbion, and even without the consideration of a pious motion such as honourable members are now asked fco accept. As one who may be regarded as a sfcudent of these matters generally, I have taken considerable interest in the Constitution Conventions. Practically every leading man in the 1897 session of the Convention looked upon the power of suggestion and the power of amendment as identical. and Mr Isaacs were the two delegates who differed upon thafc point with such men as Mr Reid, Mr Barton, Sir Josiah ruthers. I have taken a few ex tracts from the records of the 1897 proceedings. Sir John Downer saidBoth the power of amendment And the power of suggestion will practically depend on the strength of the body which has the authority to exercise it. Sir Joseph Abbott saidI hope that the common-sense of the members of the smaller States will enable them-if they are in earnest about Federation-to accept this principle of suggestion. Practically, it is absolutely the same as the principle of amendment. "" There is this difference, that the people have been so educated with regard to the turmoils and disputes with Legislative Councils. . . . The people have got an idea that the Senate will be a tvpe of our Legislative Councils. The Senate will be nothing of the kind. I look upon it that the Senate will be filled with the best men in Australia. Mr O'Connor saidTf you place the power in the Senate of throwing out a measure or of amending it, and, therefore, moulding it, you cannot say the moulding of the measure is in the hands of one House. It is in the hands of the House which can show itself the strongest in having tlie greatest staying power.

213,"Syiuon, Sir Joseph Abbott, And Mr Car","arc putting in the hands of the second Chamber the power of dislocating the Government of the country and of absolutely stopping the machinery of responsible government. Here is a very important phrase, because, upon it , hangs the whole question of the double dissolution. tion in saying that if , when the Convention was dealing w i th this power of amendment or of suggestion, there had been, the provision which was afterwards inserted in the Constitution in respect of the double dissolution, the Senate would have been given the power of amendment. The reason why the word "" suggestion "" was inserted in place of "" amendment"" is indicated in a phrase of Mr O'Connor, "" Y o u are placing it in the hands of a House over which you have no power of dissolution."" vention must be read, so to speak, backwards, for the reason that the power of double dissolution was not contained in the Constitution when the other provision was decided upon for insertion. phasize that, w i th the exception of one outstanding character in the public life of Australia, namely, the late Sir Samuel Griffith, the gatherings of 1897 contained an assembled array of talent such as Australia had never before seen, and w ill never know again. Practically every delegate, I repeat, w it h the exception of Mr Isaacs and Mr Higgins, agreed that the power of suggestion was tantamount to the power of amendment. the words of Mr Josiah 'Symon, as f o l low:The same result would follow in the case of suggestion as in the case of amendment. The only difference is as to the form in which it should be adopted. . . . Exactly the same results have followed in regard to suggestion in South Australia, where the method of suggestion prevails, and they will follow the method of amendment that we wish to prevail of amendment in the Senate of the new Federation. Sir Joseph Carruthers saidThey propose to give the Senate power to make suggestions as to money Bills, which, to my mind, are equal to amendments. Sir George Reid interjectedI was always against it. Sir Joseph Carruthers continuedis a dispute over the choice of words, and that position, to my mind, is absolutely incontestable. If you want to debar the Senate, as representing a minority of the people of Australia, from having co-ordinate powers in regard to taxation and other Bills, you will not do so by depriving it of the right of amendment, and leaving it the still larger power of veto and rejection. I have no hesitaOn the question of the use of the word Conventions, the most consistent advocate of reducing the powers of the Senateproposed .that this word should be in serted; but I think that there were only three members of the Convention who were in favour of his proposal. B y the division thus taken, the Senate was deliberately given the power of making repeated suggestions; but when the Convention realized the power it had thus given to the Senate, it inserted in the Constitution a clause, the object of which The debates of that Conwas to provide means of preventing deadlocks. This was the double dissolution clause referred to by the Ministerf o r Works and Railways( Mr Groom), and it really is the only means by which we I emcan settle the issue between this House and the Senate. The suggestion for the appointment of a Joint Committee to devise joint standing orders is like a drop of water fallin g on a granite block. Even more f u t i l e is the suggestion of the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr. Watt) that we should send a B ill to the Senate asking it to approve of submitting something to the people which w ill l i m it its power. The Senate would merely put I shall proceed to quote such a measure on one side. The Constitution already contains ample provision for deciding any issue between the two Houses. A Joint Committee would prove worse than useless. orders can be drawn up with the consent of the Senate. it all comes back to the one point that we would require to secure the consent of the Senate to the cutting of their own combs politically. The Senate will nnt agree to do so. Sir Samuel Griffith's words concerning the powers of the Senate have become almost historic. He has pointed out that there is no difference between the right of amendment and the power of suggestion, because a strong Senate will insist on its suggestions, while a weak Senate will not insist upon its amendments.

As pointed out by the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory), our Prime Minister( Mr is a small issue on which to fight the Hughes) was emphatic on the point that bhe Senate was quite within its rights, and he went further, and said that if it had been suggested that the Senate' wab not to have this power, he doubted whether the smaller States would have accepted the Constitution. from the first elections, after the Conventions, the right honourable gentleman said that he and others in the State of New South Wales had fought the although not on that particular issue. If honourable members will take the time and trouble Convention the Adelaide Convention, that the great consensus of opinion was that the Senate should be granted power. covered that this power had been granted to the Senate that, taking advantage of the absence of the Western delegates, who had left for their homes, the double rushed through on the second day before the Convention ended, and it was inserted in the Constitution entirely for the purpose of making provision to meet such an emergency as has now arisen. It is useless to attempt to play with this matter. must either accept the position that the Senate has this power or fight the Senate, and we can only fight it by bringing It has always about a double dissolution, which, we would be lunatics to do on an issue such upon them. It AS tillS In Mr 'BOWDEN (Nepean) [ 5 . 5 7 ] I agree with the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Groom), whosays that in the framing of the Constitution the House Again, in of Representatives was made the people's House, and the Senate was made a revising Chamber and the representative of There was the States. Under the Constitution of In every British Dominion the people's House has the sole determination in regard to considered money Bills. The honourable member for that section 53 of the Constitution Act This, therefore, is the was inserted as a compromise between the views of those who considered that the Senate should have the power to amend money Bills and those who held that it submitted should have no power in regard to such measures except to accept or rejec^them. Like all other compromises, it has ever since led us into a. good deal of trouble and perplexity. I do not agree that this Senate. It is one of the most important constitutional points we could have under consideration, and is worthy of the best attention and thought of honourable members. It has always been a difficult question, and has been looked at from various Coming fresh stand-points. Opinions, however, have always been coloured according to the stand-point from which the question has been viewed. Quick and Garran, dealing Constitution, w i th the matter, sayThe money Bills which the Senate cannot amend are Bills imposing taxation and Bills to go through the three appropriating money for ordinary annual debates, especially those of services. Bills of this description canot be they will see amended by the Senate, but it may, at any stage, return them to the House of Representatives with a message, requesting the omission this or amendment of any item or provision. Under It was only when it was disthis law the Senate can suggest amendments in the ordinary annual appropriation Bills and in tax Bills such as a Bill to impose duties Australian of Customs and Excise. If the suggestions thus made were not entertained the Senate would have to pass or reject those Bills, as dissolution provision was sent from the House, so that the responsibility of final acceptance or rejection would remain with the Senate as if no suggestion .had been made. . . . . In the case of a Bill which the Senate may not amend, the House of Representatives alone is responsible for the form of the measure; the Senate cannot We strike out or alter a word of it, but can only suggest that the House of Representatives should do so If the House of Representatives declines to make the suggested amendment, the Senate is face to face with the responsibility of either passing the Bill as it stands",45,Robert Best Exactly Considerable Pains Endeavoured To Show

219,Franklin ( Mr Mcwilliams) Must Admit,"or rejecting it as it stands. It cannot shelve that responsibility by insisting on its suggestions, because there is nothing on which, to insist. A House .which can make an amendment can insist upon the amendment which it has made, but a House which can only request the other House to make amendments cannot insist upon anything. If its request is not complied with, it can reject the Bill or shelve it ; but it must take the full responsibility for its action. That was the position argued for all through. ister ( Mr Groom) that, after all, the procedure suggested to-day will have no effect upon the interpretation of section 53. meaning of a section of an Act, pay any regard whatever to the intention of the framers of the Constitution, hut, nevertheless, that intention can guide us to a certain extent. We know that this particular provision was one of the crucial questions brought before the Convention. In fact, at one stage, at Adelaide, if a vote had been taken on one particular day, the whole B ill would have been wrecked. It was only saved because, after a night's reflection, five of the representatives of the smaller States put the larger interests of Federation before the in terests of their States, and voted for this amendment. Otherwise there might not have been any B ill to put before the people. When the question first arose in this Parliament upon the first TariffB ill , the conditions differed somewhat from those in existence to-day. Tariffs were then in operation, and were to continue u n t i l the Federal Tariff was enacted. There were, therefore, special reasons why the latter should come into force as soon as possible. ference in circumstances, and nofc a difference in principle. in the circumstances which led fco the adoption of fche resolution, fche effect of which was to shelve the issue for the time being. These were Mr Deakin's words at the timeThis being the first session, it is, under the circumstances, no reproach to us that we find ourselves in a condition of unpreparedness to deal with this difficulty. Mr Higgins suggested fchafc fche first step was fche mosfc important. Mr Deakin saidThe first step may be the most important, but the first step is not proposed to be taken along the constitutional road. That is to be left clear for future action. Does the honourable gentleman think we can . retrace our steps if we take an unconstitutional step now? To this Mr Deakin repliedI do not think that the House, by acting as we now propose, will place any fetters on its future action. 1 A t another stage, one member of fche I quite agree with the M in Convention suggested thafc fche proposal wasfcoput a keg of dynamite in the basement of (his House; and Mr Deakin. while admitting thafc the thing was We cannot, in interpreting the loaded, and was more or less a keg of dynamite, said ifc was proposed fco put ifc at such a great distance, fchafc, even if it exploded, it would affect neither party to fche transaction, bufcfchafc,of course, fche process in which fchey were engaged could nofc be continued ad infinitum.

At present, however, I feel it incumbent on me to vote against the motion of the Minister( Mr which they sent to the House of RepreGreene). It is about time that this House insisted on what are its real rights. passed the Bill as so amended. The honourable member for Nepean( Mr House would have considered the Bill, Bowden) has quoted Quick and Garran, which is perhaps the best authority on our Constitution; and in my opinion the Senate on this issue is absolutely out of court. Realizing that, I am not prepared to assist the Senate to flout the opinions of the House and assert rights that the Constitution does riot give. [6.17] I am exceedingly sorry that the Government have determined to treat this important matter in the way it has. Of course, the Government has warrant for the action proposed to preserve the rights of the House of Representatives, but we have to look forward to the future, when succeeding Governments will be in the position in which the present Government now finds itself with regard to the claims of the Senate. Those claims can only be asserted on a measure submitted by a Government, and, as in the past, so in the future, a Government will desire to get its measure through rather than to conserve the rights of this House in the financial administration of the Commonwealth. But those of us who rememher the initial debates with regard to Federation know that this Constitution would never have come into being with the States equally represented in the Senate unless the compromise of 1891 had been made. there is no difference between a request and an amendment is to fly in the face of the whole history of Federation. Sir Henry Parkes originally suggested that the power of the Senate on finance should be completely and definitely expressed in the Constitution, and he would never have wavered from his position had it been made clear that the power to be given under this compromise was not a power equal to the power of amendment. YetI venture to say that, in practice, we are asked to assent to-day, not only to the power' of suggestion being made equal to , the power of amendment, but to it being made superior. What would have happened if the Senate had the power to amend? The Senate would have incorporated in the Customs Tariff Bill as amendments the proposals sentatives as requests, but would have This as amended by the Senate, and passing judgment on the amendments would have accepted or rejected them, and the Bill would then have been returned to the Senate as it finally left the House of Representatives. The Senate could not go on repeating its amendments, as it is now suggested it may repeat its requests, regardless of whether the House of Representatives accepted or rejected them. We have to 'assume that the framers of the Constitution intended to give us a workable instrument of government. We have to assume that they intended that requests should carry less weight than amendments, otherwise they would have used the customary term. We have to assume further that the final word should rest with the House of Representatives. That is evident in every phrase used in the section governing the matter. This House is to adopt . the Senate's requests "" if it sees fit."" There is no power given to the -Senate to repeat a request. It has the right only to make it. A request within the meaning of the section is nofc a demand: It is something submitted tb a body which has the right to refuse and to continue to refuse it. This matter is* of the gravest importance in a Constitution such as^ours. In the Senate, the State of Tasmania has equal power with the State of New South To argue now that Wales, although its population is little more than the population of two New South Wales electorates for the House of Representatives. In the Senate the representatives of the small States are in a = majority, and if we are to accept the proposition submitted by the Government, the Senate may interfere with a Tariff which affects trade and industry in all of the States. Its requests do not concern only one State or the small States, but industry and commerce throughout the Commonwealth.

We would then have had the opportunity of agreeing to or dissenting from your ruling, and it would have settled the question in this Chamber. It matters little to me what effect the decision would have had on the Senate, neither does it matter to the people of Australia iu this instance. No good purpose will be served by cavilling at what the Senate has done, and if we pass any motion contrary to the Senate's wishes, what effect will it have? It is useless speaking of action unless it is likely to lead us somewhere, and I do not see how definite action in a certain direction would improve the position. I do not think the Senate has the right to press its requests for amendments, and to adopt a stand-and-deliver policy. If the Pederal Convention Bill is passed by this Parliament-I this point can be decided by the proposed Convention, and a recommendation can be submitted to Parliament for approval. As has been stated, this position arises at the termination of almost every Tariff debate, and it is unfair, without honourable members having the opportunity of giving the matter the attention it undoubtedly deserves, to expect us to come to a decision in a moment to overcome a difficulty which has been in existence for so many years. No one appears to be jirepared to take the responsibility of submitting a definite proposal, although many honourable members now in the House were here when the precedent was first established. If the Government's suggestion is adopted, the position will remain as it is at present. Mr Foley. their intentions are regarding the various items in the schedule which are still in dispute, neither do"" I care. ' Having gone so far, the point should now be referred to the proposed Convention, and, failing that, it should be raised during the next general election, when the people could be informed of the position. I believe the popular ChamberI should always predominate. The Senate was created under different conditions to any other second Chamber in the British Empire, and a different set of conditions regarding it3 power to amend should obtain. In all the circumstances, I believe the Government are taking a wise course, because the Senate has considered the opinions expressed in this Chamber on two occasions, and still presses its request. I .am not in favour of high duties, and in this instance I do not care whether the duties are high or low. I am prepared to allow the rates to pass as they stand. The Senate will then be able to say that its rights have been conserved, and honourable members in this Chamber, representing ±he people directly, will know that the dignity of this Chamber has not been Ipwered, and that there has been no abrogation of any of its rights. views expressed by the .representatives of the legal profession in this Chamber have been very helpful; but as a casual observer of the difficulty that has arisen between the two Houses, I can see that an important issue is involved. The question sincerely trust it will not beof the States has been introduced, and the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) referred to one man one vote and the rights of the people. The smaller States would not have agreed Fo come into the Federation *had the provision of equal State representation in the Senate not been agreed to in connection with legislation which applied to the whole of the Commonwealth. It cannot apply partially. Take the first item, that of bananas, in the schedule returned to this House. That has been a bone of contention because it affects the trade of the Commonwealth. In the StateI come from, a big reciprocal trade with Java has been very seriously interfered with by the Tariff resolutions of this House.

If we depart from it the Senate might just as well be abolished, because this Chamber will then dominate all legislation, the principle of centralization will be endorsed, aud the development of Australia-retarded. I am of fche opinion fchafc this House has no power to alter the position. Neither has the Senate.

I do not think we need get angry w i th the Senate, and I do not propose to join with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr. Foley) in telling another place what it ought to do and what its duty is. It is quite sufficient for us to define what our rights are, and what our duty is in this regard. Nor do I agree that the position, from the constitutional point of view, is in any way obscure. There is not the slightest doubt that many shades of opinion, and many subtle opinions at that, were expressed by the wise framers of the Constitution on this issue.

And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any such omissions or amendments, with or without modifications. Except as provided in this section, tlie Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws. It has been suggested that the power to request is limited to a single act of request. Without going into any very subtle choplogic on the matter, it seems to me that the right of request remains' a right of request as often as we choose to send a proposed law to the Senatef o r acceptance. If we are content to do so a dozen times, each time a new righ t is created in the Senate to make a fresh request. parently if another place and this House were futil e enough to continue the pro1 cess, ifc might, within the terms of the Constitution, be continued indefinitely. honourable member has rightly said that, when the popular Chamber passes a law relating to taxation in a certain form , and re-affirms it deliberately, after further consideration it should, at least, be a broad hint to the wise men professing democratic beliefs in the Senate, which is not the popular Chamberi n fche sense the House""""of Representatives is, to accept it . Tf, however, in fche exercise of their undoubted rights they regard the matter of sufficient importance fco make a firm stand upon, they may send it back again and again. This is where I charge the Government with being guilty of one of those characteristic evasions of theirs which in recent months have so marked their progress, or lack of progress, in this country and in this Chamber. Instead of having the courage of their opinions, and telling fchis House and fche country what they think it ought to do in regard to this matter; instead of declaring that this question of barbedwire and bananas is of national importance, or is not, they come to this House with their policy of vacillation, and ask honourable members fco pass a pious resolution, which, by some process of reasoning, is supposed to sustain both fche dignity and power of this Chamber, and at fche same fcime permit us fco proceedfcofche consideration of bananas and fencing wire, and other things. I suggest that had this House proceeded to the. consideration of these issues, it would have lost none if its dignity, it would have surrendered none of its undoubted prerogatives, and ifc would have created no dangerous precedent whatsoever, because just as fche Senate may send requests back to us, and just as we, in turn, may send messages to the Senate, so may we at any I cannot accept that view. fcime change our opinions and votes, and ease the situation. The constitutional .position, 'by that means, w ill not be altered in the slightest. One of the objects, of course, in sending Bills backwards and forwards is to bring about a change of views, and consequent change in votes. Sometimes the wise members of Apthe House of Representatives read the crude utterances of the members of the Senate, and occasionally a littl e light, breaking in through the obscurity of those utterances, may alter our view on a question such as this. Having sent a B ill back a second, third , or fourth time, we may F o r ever. Some have it again returned to us in a slightly altered form, or not altered afc all. We would not, however, have established any precedent by their accepting it . The clear duty of fche -Ministry, in the circumstances, is to tell the House and the country whether the matter is vital, or is of such importance as to justify us in letting the Senate know fchafc fche machinery of fche Constitution will be tested to its f u l l strength to determine the rights of the respective Houses. It is no use evading the question. If it is an unimportant and trifling matter, let us make our concession to the Senate on this question of bananas; and if bananas are vital to the salvation of the country, let us use the machinery of the Constitution. The Act providesIf the House of Representatives passes any proposed law, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, and if after an interval of three months the House of. Representatives, in the same or the next session, again passes tlie proposed law, with or without any amendments which have been made, suggested, or agreed to by the Senate, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, the Governor General may dissolve the Senate",53,Robert Best Exactly Considerable Pains Endeavoured To Show

I suggest very mildly that the resoilution should never have been submitted by any Government with a capacity for taking responsibility in this House. Consistently with their policy of bringing in Estimates and whittling them down, the Government have introduced this makebelieve resolution to preserve their dignity, but it means nothing, and is nothing. do not think I need apologize for addressing the House. I recognise that I am breaking a rule that I have consistently followed up to the present, not to take parb in any debate in which party politics are involved; but I recognise that this question should be regarded as being altogether beyond the scope of party considerations. sider what are its rights, and what action it will take. I am not going over the ground already traversed by those who have preceded me in this debate. I would like honourable members to look at the facts as they are. Our duty is to the people who sent us here, and to the people of Australia as a whole. We have to consider the consequences of our action, if we are inflexibly and invincibly determined to stand upon our constitutional rights at this particular juncture. Is there not another way out of the difficulty, by which we may settle what may be called a f a m i l y quarrel, before we resort to the arbitrament of the people ? I think there is. A long controversy at this time would result in the disorganization of the whole trade and commerce of Australia for a period of six or seven months or more, above all, let us not take and that would be disastrous. I am not one of those who are willin g to give away the legitimate rights of the House of Representatives. I am not going to debate the merits of the question at all, because this is not the time to do so. A few hours are not sufficient to discuss a constitutional matter of this magnitude. Three or four weeks might be well occupied in dealing w i th it , if that were necessary. What are the alternatives? There are a few which I respectfully suggest to the Housef o r its consideration. Iu the very -first dispute between the two Houses with regard to a Tariff matter, it was contended that the resolution was only brought forward pending the almost immediate consideration of the question by the Joint Standing Orders Committee; but, unfortunately, it was never submitted to that Committee. could not break the Constitution. matter in dispute. It is not a question of a breach of the Constitution, but of the interpretation of the Constitution. WeI have the StaViding Orders relating to the operations of this House, and the Joint Standing Orders dealing with the operations of both Houses, and this question has never been submitted to the Joint Committee. I suggest that it should be placed before that Committee at the earliest possible moment. If the Committee's report were acceptable, the House The House has to conwoulcl accept it ; and if otherwise, it would reject it . If the Joint Committee could not deal with the matter, we could appoint a number of members from this House to confer with an equal number from the other Chamber. I would suggest twelve, or two from each State, in each case.

I am sufficiently optimistic to believe that either of the two courses I have already suggested woulcl enable a solution of the difficulty to be found. It has been solved in South Australia and Victoria. The only question we have to consider is whether the other Chamber has the right to press its requests. In South Australia and Victoria the number of times a request can be made is limited, and questions of this kind are settled satisfactorily. Who can say that it is not within the bounds of possibility that a Conference such as I have suggested, comprising twelve members from each House, could frame a report such as woulcl be acceptable to both Houses? This difficulty can be settled without any reference to the people at all. The people do not understand these great constitutional questions, and the matter could not be finalized in that way. In the event, however, of the methods I have referred to not being successful, and taking into consideration the absolute necessity to finalize the matter in dispute immediately, that is, as soon as it is practically possible to do so, how can it be done if the Senate will not compromise?

Every one w ill , T think, admit that, except in regard to money and taxation Rills, the Senate's powers of amendment are equal to those of the Representatives, but in regard to money and taxation Bills there is a. reservation in favour of the popular House.

It has exercised that right in the present instance, and is pressing requests with which this House has not complied. W it h the objectof finalizing the matter, I out bhe consent of the Senate. would suggest that, should attempts at conciliation f a i l, the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) should, as soon as we meet next year, bring dewn an amending Customs TariffB ill dealing only w it h the duties which are now in dispute.

274,Mr Hector Lamond,"There cannotalteration of the Constitution will have to be passed by the Senate, and a Senate which was bold enough .could throw out such a Bill, and prevent the submission of this point to the people, though I doubt if that would be done. that the Senate would give the people an opportunity to express its opinion on this matter. Section_57 provides for a double dissolution, but' if there were a double dissolution, and the new Senate were practically the same as that which had appealed to the country, nothing would have been gained. Such a happening is quite possible, because it is difficult to get the people to take a live interest in constitutional ..questions. It is hard to make them see the importance of such questions, and the consequences that may result from various positions. quently the Senate elected after a double dissolution might be virtually the same body as that which appealed to the constituencies. Couldi t be said, then, that the people had spoken in such a way as to settle decisively the constitutional question -remitted to it? a constitutional question ? What would be settled by the election following a double dissolution ? section 53 of the Constitution under which /this trouble has arisen would not be settled. would be the duties on barbed wire and bananas. £100,000! Constitution saysThe Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend I think that there is as much to be said for a wide interpretation of those words as for a technical interpretation of them. There is much to be said for the contention that, the Senate may make requests at any time that the Bill is in its possession. The section continuesrequesting, by message, the omission or amenduieiit of any items or provisions therein. requests is a very important one. And the House of Representatives mav, if it thinks fit, make any of such amendments or omissions with or without modifications. It would be absurd to say that the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, accept or alter the suggestions of the Senate in any way, if the Senate may make its requests more than once. The Constitution gives no support to the conI think tention that the power to make a request is equal to the power to make an amendment. After the Senate has been given the power to make a request, the section continuesExcept as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws. From that it is clear that the power to make a request is not tantamount to the power to make an amendment. strengthen the limitation of the previous Consepart of the section. ' it clear that the power to make a request is not as wide as the power to make an amendment. Then, again, while section 57 provides for a double dissolution, it specially confines joint sittings of the two Chambers to the consideration of Bills which can be amended. That, again, is evidence that the power to make a request is not tantamount to the power to make an amendment. that the whole debate is "" much ado about nothing:"" No one could afford to prejudice the r.ouutry by postponing the finalization of the Tariff in order to determine the right of the Senate to press its requests. We are practically bound, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, to put tlie best face on the matter we can; to assert our constitutional rights, and then to consider the requests which the Senate has pressed. We have done that on two or three previous occasions, and I do not think that we shall prejudice our position if we do it again now. We shall be following the course already followed, and one which ispractically imposed on us by a consideration of the public interest. We cannot afford to have a constitutional fight at this time.

That was never intended. South Australia the Upper Chamber is restricted as to the number of times it can press its requests. House of Assembly w ill not then comply with its requests, the Council must choose between accepting or rejecting the measure under consideration.

299,Mr Atkinson,"I am not preparedthink we are bound to follow the weak and rather flabby course which has been followed in the past. [9.5] I do not understand whether the Minister( Mr Greene) intends to accept the dictum of the Senate or to still further bargain with the other Chamber. there is much to be gained from bargaining; but, unfortunately, our parliamentary procedure is largely governed by precedents. Even tbe Constitution can be defined by precedents, and for that reason I am afraid to agree to the suggestion made by the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Chanter). If we agree to postpone the consideration of this matter for six. months, perhaps twelve months will elapse before the matter is settled as he suggested, and that will mean that three times this House will have accepted the Senate's refusal of a Tariff formulated by the House of Representatives. Every time we accept the Senate's dictum we strengthen its hands, and eventually the position will be that the House of Representatives, and not the Senate, will make requests. If the Senate's contention that it has powers equal to our own be admitted, it will be only a matter of time before we shall cease to formulate the Tariff, and will simply send up suggestions to another place. The time has arrived when we ought to fight out this question, and determine which is the paramount Chamber in regard to money. Bills. The honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) has said that a double dissolution would not settle the issue. If the Government had the strength of mind that they should have, they would look for a double dissolution; and if we went to the country on the issue of the House of Representatives versus the Senate, and the majority of the Senate were returned with authority from the people to uphold the powers of the second Chamber, this House would have to cave in, and admit that the Senate was equally the people's House, and had a right to amend money Bills. Therefore, I cannot agree with the honourable member for Kooyong that a double dissolution would yield no result. However, I suppose it is useless to discuss the matter, for bodies have the same rights as the Senate the Government have decided to cave in ; but I still regret that we have not in 1 power a Ministry with some backbone, so that we might assert the right of the people's House. The contention of the smaller States^I mean the States which are small in population-that they can dominate the whole of Australia is not new, and it is time that the States with the big populations took a stand. I am not particularly fond of elections, but I was pleased to hear the honourable member From my point, of view for Hlawarfa( Mr Hector Lamond) showing such determination in this matter. I agree with him that this House is representative of the people; the Senate is not. represent? The Senate was created to protect the land of Australia, and one State against another. Throughout the Convention debates it is clear that the Senate was designed to protect State rights. Unfortunately, it has proved to be as much a party House as is this Chamber, and, apparently, it has the same powers as we have, except that it has not the people behind it. I remember sitting in the gallery to listen to the debate, in 1902, when this issue was first raised, and after listening to twoi nights of keen debate one was justified in believing that the issue would be settled in the near future. In 1908 the Senate was again allowed to have its own way, as it has been allowed since, notably when, because it suited the Government, the Senate was allowed to alter the taxation on amusement tickets. If we cave in again on this occasion, there will be no hope of this. House asserting its constitutional rights against the Senate. I do not know what attitude the ! Minister( Mr Greene) intends to adopt, but I do not intend to give a silent vote upon this motion. In my opinion, the whole discussion has been unnecessary and a waste of time. If the Senate is to exist at all, it has a perfect right to make requests, and, if it thinks necessary, press them. If the Senate does not repeat its request, it tacitly admits that it was wrong in making the request in the first place. The Senate's position is analogous to that of the Legislative Councils in the State Legislatures. Those has to make requests that may or may not be acceded to by the popular Chamber.

303,' Mr Bamford (Herbert) [9.11],"Australian Bill which had been rejected because the Legislative Council had amended it. It seems to me that it was absurd to throw out the Bill on such a frivolous pretext; the Bill might have been admirable in itself, and it"" was lost only because of some mistake made by the Council in inserting.an amendment in it . We are told that the only way tb settle this issue is by a, double dissolution. Such a course is unthinkable. Our last double dissolution was the outcome of the Senate's refusal to pass legislation sent up by this Chamber. If a. double dissolution arose out of this constitutional issue, we would be appealing to the people on a subject of which they knew nothing, and members of this House would be fighting members of another place on the hustings. Such a situation is too absurd to contemplate. I am in favour of the Senate being allowed to make requests, and, if necessary, press them. This, however, does not imply that I agree to support the requests made by the other Chamber. If it is not to have that power, it should be abolished as an unnecessary. echo and appanage of this Chamber. If the Senate is only to endorse the decisions which this Chamber arrives at, there is no need for it at all.

In submitting the motion early this afternoon, I intentionthis motion mean that we accept the ally avoided the constitutional issue, which Senate's requested amendments? has been traversed over and over again, because I desired as far as possible to confine the debate to the particular question merely asking the House to agree that which I was submitting. I frankly admit whilst refraining from coming to a final that an attempt should have been made determination as to its constitutional long ago to settle the issue by commonrights or obligations, it will forthwith sense methods. I agree that for all pracconsider the requests made by the Senate tical purposes the only method, short of for the second time. All that the House an alteration of the Constitution, by will be committed to by the passing of Which the question could be settled, is the motion is that it will refrain from the the adoption of joint standing orders final determination of its constitutional governing the situation as between the rights or obligations in respect of this two Houses. It seems to me to be inconvexed question, leaving it for determinaceivable that the two branphes of the tion at a future period by the means I Commonwealth Legislature should be unhave ventured to suggest, and that we will, able to come to a final decision as to what at the same time, agree, without prejudice is a fair interpretation of the rights of the to our constitutional rights, to consider Senate, as laid down in the Constitution, in regard to money Bills or taxation measures. After all is said and done, that is all that is required, and one's common sense revolts from the idea that it should be possible for the two Houses to go on indefinitely playing a game of battledore and shuttlecock in respect to any Bill, and not coming to a determination. There must be a common-sense method of settling this all-important issue. It is quite clear that tbe framers of the Constitution intended that there should be a material difference between the rights 6f the Senate in respect of money Bills and its rights in regard to other measures. While the Constitution gives the Senate the right to throw out or finally reject a money Bill, taking the full responsibility for so doing, it does not give it the right of direct amendment. Consequently, it seems to me that there should be a perfectly logical, common-sense method of settling this question by an agreement between the two Houses, which should be embodied in joint standing orders. As it is, the issue has been raised for the third time-and probably three times too often. It ought to have been settled at the very outset. On behalf of the Government, I can only say that if we can devise a way of settling this question definitely and for all time we shall try to do so.

The Government has given very careful consideration to the position, and as f a r as I am able to gather, the Australian arsenate of lead is now being sold at 50 per cent, less than the cost of the imported commodity, which, of course, is one of those indications that go to show in a most unquestionable way that the imposition of a duty does not necessarily increase prices. I am exceedingly sorry that the Minister( Mr Greene) has gone back on the strong arguments he advanced when on a previous occasion he moved that the Senate's request be not made. He is dealing unfairly w i th the local industry when he seeks to wipe out the protection afforded to it because the price of the commodity it produces is less than that of the i m ported article. sions of the anti-dumping law w ill rescue the industry if the removal of this protection w ill cause it to languish, if not die altogether.

House of Representatives' Message -Not made. Senate's Message -Request pressed. That the requested amendment be not made. I had expected the Minister( Mr. Greene) to make some statement in regard to the explosives industry, to which he has already made great promises. If . . he is not prepared to give some assistance in the shape of a protective duty, what does he intend to do? Apparently he has gone back on his original attitude to afford some protection to what he has already described as one of the key industries of the Commonwealth. duty condition on the fulfilment of certain undertakings. Those conditions have not been fulfilled. the Minister to sit at his table and put on a superior air because he has probably a majority of the Committee with h i m , but has he taken into consideration the fact that the removal of this duty w ill throw a large number of men out of employment, including very many returned soldiers! Surely returned soldiers employed in a key industry are of as much value as returned soldiers employed at Victoria Barracks, or engaged in Defence factories! much value as ten times their number of"" returned soldiers who are employed in getting coal. statements of honourable members who I hope that the provirepresent the coal miners, I guarantee that the rank and file of the men engaged in the mining industry are opposed to the supply of explosives made by black labour. The miners would be the first to object if coal was coming into Australia which was the product of black labour, and I am only trying to protect the white worker against explosives, the product of black labour. I need not repeat what I have said on "" this subject on a previous occasion, but I propose to divide the Committee upon the question. .

Under my proposal, explosives produced by white labour overseas would be practically admitted free of duty, but explosives the product of black labour would pay a reasonable duty. A more reasonable proposition has never been put before an Australian Parliament. Minister has agreed unhesitatingly to increased duties wherever they have been requested by the Seuate, but apparently he has no time for them in regard to this key industry. The miners cannot expect any sympathy from me when, owing 'to the absence of local competition, the price of the black labour product is in creased. come about. have the support of at least one follower of the Government. there will be no increase in the present price of the local explosives if sufficient protection is afforded. No company has made a more reasonable proposition to the Minister than that which has been submitted by the local company. On the 24th November, 1921, I asked Has the attention of tbe Prime Minister been called to the threatened explosives industry T Is it the intention of tha Government to support a black labour product of South Africa as against that of white workers of Australia? He repliedMy attention has not been called to the threatened explosives industry. It is not the intention of the Government to support a black labour product of South Africa as against that of white workers of Australia. If the Prime Minister gives a definite answer like that,"" I cannot see why this Committee, the majority of which is supposed to be Protectionist, proposes to destroy a local industry, and cause a lot of men to be thrown out of work. It makes one smile when one contemplates bhe fact that a so-called coloured race can surpass the British race in the manufacture of explosives. I am alluding to Japan, which, in the period of ait ordinary man's life, did not know how to manufacture any explosives, but now, having garnered the wisdom of the West, has up-to-date works for the manufacture of explosives which we, the descenment that, unless the explosives industry is supported by a protective duty, it cannot possibly exist in competition with one of the vilest Combines that desecrates the earth at the present moment. Wealthy mine-owners of SouthA f r i c a have formed a Combine against Nobel's, The and employ in the production of explosives a coloured race, no doubt of splendid physique, b u t yet a people which should not get any sympathy fro m us aa compared w it h those of our own race, who are working in our own midst. If the Committee decided that the price should be fixed for these explosives, I should be quite w ill in g ; but I understand that the manufacturers are prepared to give an'undertaking that the prices w ill not be raised in the future. WhatI am pleased that I more could the Committee desire? I listened to the most eloquent speech that I guarantee that has been delivered here for many years past by the honourable member for M a r ibyrnong ( Mr Fenton) when the T a r if f schedule was before us; and if that speech did not change the vote of any honourable member, no speech would. However, honourable members are not regarding this matter from the point of view of Protection, or of assisting the white worker as against the coloured worker, but w it h the desire to obtain these products at the cheapest rate possible.

The honourable member has been telling us how to eoonoimize, and I felt sure that he would oppose the B ill . ing the interests of the consumers. sure very strongly, and pointed out that I thought a Board of this character, if it had been at work before the Tariff was under consideration, could have supplied the Committee with a good deal of useful information. We have now passed the Tariff, and I trust it will be many years before another one of this character is in troduced. The consumers in this country will realize how they have been penalized to placate the wishes of a few city manufacturers. I said when the B ill was introduced that it would be the means of imposing extra charges upon revenue, and there is not the slightest doubt that this is a direction in which we could economize.

If , however, I cannot do that, I desire to l i m it the Board's expenditure. glad to hear the Minister say that he would accept the last amendment on the list, because at the end of two years we shall know if the Board is going to be of any value. In the meantime, I hope that we shall be able to keep down the expenditure.

Department as well. I know of no method by which we can possibly obtain economy, together w i th efficient administration, than by rationing the whole of these Departments. This'was shown in the history of Lord Cromer's control of the finances in Egypt. He took over the administration at a time when the finances were in a most disordered state, due to unchecked extravagance, but by severely rationing the various Departments he restored order and brought about economy and efficiency in administration. Extravagance is the worse enemy of efficiency. Reasonable remuneration and a reasonable number of officers in our Public Service are the best guarantees of efficiency. The Senate was well advised when it carried an amendment limiting the expenditure of this proposed new Board to £4,000 a year.. member tell me how it is possible to discriminate between expenditure for the Board and expenditure which, under any circumstances, would have to be incurred by the Customs Department?

Obviously, it deals only with the extra expenditure required for the establishment and maintenance of the proposed Board, and £4,000 a year should be ample. Can the Minister say what it is likely to cost? Will it be £10,000, £20,000, or £50,000 a year? During the second-reading stage, the honourable member for Dampier( Mr made an insulting observation, but has Gregory) declared that it would cost at least £10,000 a year. squander the country's money. This proposal to appoint a Tariff Board is one of the most deliberate attempts to squander public money that has ever been placed before this House.

I have a perfect right to raise my voice in the interests of the taxpayers, and the Minister has no right to sneer at me and suggest that I am taking up the time of the Committee unnecessarily. The Minister has not only sneered at every taxpayer in Australia. I would like some assurance from the Minister on the point raised. Some limit ought to be placed on the cost of the Board. I agree with the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) that the proposed expenditure would be absolutely useless. Honourable members are not in the mood to be consulted on this matter at the present juncture. Will the Minister give me an assurance that the extra £1,400, so it leaves very little. matter ample consideration. The work proposed to be given to the Board conld be done ten times better by the head of the Customs Department -himself.
