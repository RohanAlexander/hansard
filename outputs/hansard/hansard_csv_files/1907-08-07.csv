In Committee (Consideration resumed from 6th August, vide page 1468): Clause 4In this Act, Quarantine has relation to measures for the exclusion, detention, segregation, isolation, protection, and disinfection of vessels, persons, goods, animals, or plants, and having as their object the prevention of the introduction or spread of diseases or pests affecting man, animals, or plants. of amendment-That after the word "" introduction,"" line 6, the words "" into the Commonwealth"" be inserted. This clause gives the Commonwealth authorities very extensive powers. I admit that whatever authority is appointed to deal with such matters as quarantine and the preservation of the public health should be clothed with the fullest powers, for use in times of emergency, and we must trust that a wise discretion will be exercised in their use and administration. Whatever powers we give to a Commonwealth Department, they should be f u l l and complete for the proper administration of the matters with which we wish that Department to deal. But I doubt, if it be wise to give, at the present time, such large powers as are conferred by the B ill . I am not sure that we have the constitutional right to endow any Commonwealth Department with such powers. Therefore, the Government would do well to accept a reasonable compromise. It would not be right to put the States to the trouble of showing that this Parliament had exceeded its powers, and it would I shall be very pleased be a reflection upon us if the High Court promise made by my ruled any of the provisions of a Commonwas to lay the papers wealth Act to be ultra vires. Therefore, table when the matter we should try to ascertain exactly what is our constitutional position in this matter. Not even the Attorney-General has shown that the Commonwealth Parliament can legislate with respect to more than the quarantining of human beings and animals. A memorandum upon a report by the Public Health Department of New South Wales has been placed before us, which contains this paragraphThe term "" Quarantine"" has long been used in England, in Australia, and elsewhere, as applying, not only to maritime quarantine in I shall be pleased to relation to human diseases, but also as to land quarantine and quarantine of animals. See Imperial Diseases of Animals Act 1S0.4, section 26, schedule 3, &c.; New South Wales Stock Act 1901, Pt. IV . , sees. 146, 151, &c; United States Act of 29th April, 1878, chap. 66. In that memorandum there is no claim that the Commonwealth can take any further power in regard to quarantine than may be exercised in the case of animals. A t the Federal Convention of 1897, held at Svdney, Mr O'Connor, the present Justice, endeavoured to amend paragraph n of section 51 of the Constitution. He moved that the word "" quarantine"" should be omitted with a view to inserting in .lieu thereof the words "" public health in relation to infection or contagion from outside the Commonwealth.""

If the Bill be passed as it now stands, the Government may be led to incur greater expense than the Treasurer anticipates. When he introduced the Bill, the honourable gentleman said he. did not anticipate there would be anv additional expenditure; and if the Commonwealth confines its attention to oversea matters, and elimimind, they would be acting wisely by so nates plants and goods, we might obtain a very effective administration, probably at less cost, and certainly at very little more cost, than at present. There would be more effective contiol, because the central authority could arrange that a ship which had got pratique at Perth, could continue the voyage round to Sydney without further molestation. arrangement it frequently happens that a ship is inspected at each port, and the owners thereby put to much inconvenience and expense; while the new arrangement I have indicated would be a great convenience to shipping business, and lead to better administration from a Commonwealth point of view. Such a desirable result, in itself, affords another reason why we should not go any further than is actually necessary at the present time. If we persist in going further, there must sooner or later be a duplication of officers. supervision at the present time, and, conFor instance, if the Commonwealth thought, it right to assume the functions of'a State Department in opposition to a State's wishes, how could the Commonwealth ask that Department to act at any time? There would have to be fresh officers appointed; and, as I say, there must, sooner or later, be duplication. The fruit industry of. Tasmania, for instance, has been built up gradually, and is now under stringent and effective control by local bodies, who make their own regulations, appoint inspectors, and impose penalties. If diseased apples are allowed on trees a penalty is imposed; and every precaution is taken to keep orchard's clean, and to export only the best and soundest of fruit. The regulations go so far as to insist on cases, which may have been taken to the wharf, being dipped in boiling water before being returned to the. grower, There are different regulations in different neighbourhoods as the local conditions require; and the local bodies aredoing their work thoroughlv and enthusiastically, and far better than it could be done from the distant office of a central body.. with that? to interfere with it;, but if tbe Bill be passed, in its .present form, it will certainly give the Commonwealth power to interfere with it. I say that there is no necessity for us to interfere, and the Government might very well limit the scope of the measure in the way I have indicated. To my doing. For instance, it is well known that the fruit-growers in the Huon district were called upon to take up land which was covered by dense and heavy vegetation. They have laboriously cleared that land, but even now it i's practically valueless for anything save fruit growing. In many instances their whole lives have been devoted Under the present to assuring themselves a livelihood in this way. If their lands are interfered with as the result of some regulation, or if the industry in which they are engaged be threatened, they will have nothing to fall back upon. member allow them to continue their avocation without check or hindrance? out check or hindrance now.

I simply maintain that the States are better able to deal with small local matters than is the Federation. the local residents are more enthusiastic, and understand local conditions better. That being so, why should we interfere? local people, but it would not hit outsiders. in its present form, the Commonwealth may, with the very best of intentions, do a vast injury to the fruit-growing industry, to which I have already referred. It has been said that the authorities in Queensland were somewhat lax in their efforts to deal with the tick pest. That may have been true in the early stages of the disease, but as soon as it was accurately diagnosed, and its effect thoroughly appreciated, that State was most active in its efforts to combat it. The Commonwealth could not have done better than Queensland has done during the past few years in attempting to cope with that f r i g h t f u l scourge. that the Government will adopt the view which I am expressing. they can do so without any loss of prestige. I am satisfied that by acting in the way I have suggested they will be taking a wise step. wards proceed to legislate to the f u l l extent of our powers if the interests of the Commonwealth, or of the States, should demand it. member of the Committee will agree with me that one of the most important functions which we were led to assume would be undertaken by the Federation was that of quarantine. It is perfectly clear that.the work of oversea quarantine can be most efficiently discharged by the Commonwealth, and I hold that one of the fundamental objects underlying the purpose of Federation was that the Commonwealth should discharge those duties which it could f u l f i l more effectually than could any of the individual States. Consequently I was of opinion that it would be a mistake for the Commonwealth to interfere with the local conditions obtaining in the various States, and with the arrangements which those "" States have already made. But I must confess that a closer consideration of this question has led me to believe that the Commonwealth should, in the interests of the public health, exercise such powers as I do not pre-suppose would enable it if by any mischance any of the States neglected to discharge their duties-to assert its authority. I do not think it can be laid to the charge of any They have more local knowledge, State that it has neglected that primary duty. But at the present moment the States rightly or wrongly entertain the view that the Commonwealth Government has introduced a Bil l which, possibly, has a tendency to very seriously dislocate their internal arrangements. Consequently they say, ""We ask you to delay consideration of this meaI f the B ill be passed sure before coming to a final decision upon it."" I think that without any loss of prestige the Government might have given greater consideration than they have done to the representations which have been made by the different States in this connection. Representative bodies, whose members are desirous of seeing quarantine arrangements effectively carried out, have also requested the Government to delay the consideration of this measure until they have had an opportunity of making representations in regard to it. Protests in regard to it have come from Brisbane, from Sydney, and from various organizations in I hope Melbourne. The Commonwealth has been six years in existence without undertaking I am sure that the very important duties of quarantine, and if there has been no need for it to exercise these powers during that period, it cannot be said that there is any extreme As the occasion arises, we can afterurgencv for their exercise now, or to push this matter to its final conclusion immediately.

I trust that we shall be careful in dealing with this measure not to place any new obstacles in the way of trade and commerce between our various ports. It is admitted that the method of supervision so long in force in many countries is being 'somewhat relaxed in Great Britain, or, at all events, at the port of London, and I hold that we should be very careful not to impose what may prove unnecessary restrictions upon the free entry of large numbers of people to Australia. As far as is consistent with our desire to preserve the public health, we should remove all barriers to such an inflow. The Other day my attention wa3 drawn to an article which appeared in the Age in July, 1901, and which dealt with this question in a very able and satisfactory way. Capable articles are often published in that newspaper, and evidently the management considered that this one was eminently satisfactory, since . they republished it in globo in the issue of Wednesday, 4th March, 1903. The position taken* up by the writer is a just, reasonable, and rational one. After dealing with the whole history of quarantine, the article proceedsTlie British quarantine procedure, it will be seen, is eminently suited to modern requirements. It may be said to provide the maximum of precaution with the minimum of inconvenience, and hence on somewhat similar lines should that of Federated Australia be based. is required is an efficient system of medical -inspection for all vessels coming from infected ports, OT vessels on board of which sickness has occurred during the voyage. should take place at the first port of call within that we should give the Government an the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, and it is then that the quarantine precautions should be initiated. Now, as a rule, the three diseases most dreaded in Australia are small-pox, plague, and cholera. Their introduction is most to be feared from Indian and Chinese ports. two first diseases named are, to a certain extent, now regarded as always more or less prevalent, and special precautions in this direction will be required. The method which will naturally suggest itself is that two Federal quarantine stations shall be established, tlie one for the purpose of supervising the health of vessels coming by our western ports, and this would have to be eitheT Fremantle or Albany, and the other coming by the eastern ports, either at Thursday Island or Cooktown. The duty of the officersdeputed by the Federal Government to carry out the quarantine regulations would be to hold an effective inspection on the arrival of any vessel from an infected port, or having sickness on board. If , on examination, actual cases are found, then the patient or patients should be landed, and the usual precautions taken to prevent any spread of the disease. On Mr Knox. the other hand, if the vessel is found to be free of disease, then a clean bill of health should be given that would prevent the trouble and waste of time that now frequently occurs in holding medical inspections at every Australian port at which an ocean-going steamer may call That appears to be good, sound, common sense. provides for such a scheme. the writer is to my mind a very sound one. His contention is that the scope of Federal power should be limited to oversea quarantine, and that I believe was the original intention. My only justification for addressing the Committee, after the full and able debate to which we have listened, is my desire to emphasize the reasonableness of the plea put forward by the States Governments, who say, in effect, to us, "" Do not dislocate the machinery that we have built up as the result of years of careful thought. Limit the Federal control to oversea quarantine, except in cases where it is necessary in the interests of public health to deal with Inter-State or IntraState quarantine."" If the Minister makes it clear that the administration of the Bill will be limited in that way, I hope that the Committee will give the Government an effective measure, sufficient to enable them to cope with any contingency, and to deal with any failure on the part of one or more States to carry out these duties satisWhat factorily. with the honourable member for Kooyong This inspection effective measure, and, that being so, I intend to support the clause as it stands. I think that the Ministry are proposing that which is necessary in order to secure The an effective system of Federal quarantine. According to some honourable members, the States are afraid that we shall exercise these powers too rigidly. afraid ? of local knowledge may cause the administration of the measure to be ineffectual. ber has told us that the States are relaxing their supervision.

In the first place, the change will benefit the Governments of the States, by removing from their control Departments which are now a charge upon their revenues. Public men in the States have declared that the Commonwealth Government is a costly affair, and we have now to show them how they can save money by handing over certain Departments to Commonwealth control. take into its service the stock inspectors of the States? are almost wholly consumers, and they ask to be protected from disease likely to be conveyed by f r u it and vegetables, as well as from disease likely to be conveyed by animals or man. I understand that the intention of the amendment is to limit the control of the Commonwealth to quarantine in respect to persons and goods coming from abroad or passing from State to State. In other words, those who support the amendment appear to be ready to go two-thirds of the way which the Government ask us to go. Why should they not go the remaining one-third of the distance, and give the Commonwealth power to interfere for the prevention of the spreading of disease within a State? I remember that, some years ago, it was found difficult to prevent the tick fever froni getting into New South Wales from Queensland, notwithstanding the robust administration of the Agricultural Department of the former State. gentleman, who was a Member of Parliament at the time, evaded the quarantine which was established by avoiding the well known crossing places, and driving 1,700 remounts across the border by an unusual route. technical knowledge in regard to this measure; but I shall vote for the clause as it stands, in the desire to provide effectively for the stamping out. of disease in every part of the Commonwealth. cannot altogether agree with the amendment. As it covers the whole ground of the present controversy, I shall not now say anything about tbe constitutional aspect of the question, or deal with more than the point immediately raised, as to our right to take powers for the prevention of the spreading of disease withint a State, as well as for that provision to mean that, to ""prevent"". If that be done, and the mathe prevention of the spreading of disease from one State to another. I hold that under the Constitution we can endow a Commonwealth Department with the f u l l powers proposed to be conferred by the B ill ; but I am also of the opinion that expediency must weigh with us in considering the advisability of exercising our constitutional powers. We should be very loth to endeavour to exercise the powers which the Government have told us they, desire to exercise through the local health officers of the States, because we cannot expect to obtain the service from State officials that the States get from them. Sir WILLIAM LYNE A similar arrangement under the Commerce Act works very, well. Commerce Act are not so far reaching and extensive as those of the B ill . Does the honourable gentleman propose that the Commonwealth should take over the Stock Departments of the States, and pay the salaries of their stock inspectors? If that were done, and similar action were taken in regard to the Health Departments of the States, we should have to alter our financial arrangements under the Braddon section. But while I hold that it would be expedient to ask State officers generally to administer internal quarantine, I feel that we ought not to limit our powers in any way. The necessity may arise in the future for exercising these powers to the fullest, either because the States have exceeded their powers of local quarantine, or because they have failed to sufficiently exercise them.

If a disease were allowed to spread through a State until it reached its boundaries, nothing the Commonwealth could do would '' prevent'' it from spreading to adjoining States. Consequently, the reasonable interpretation of the provision would give the Commonwealth power to track down disease to its place of origin within a State, have both States Departments and a Comand to deal with it there by any system of quarantine which it might choose to adopt. member for Angas says that the amendment to which the honourable member refers will prevent litigation. will; because it leaves the wording of the clause too vague.

He gave the Committee much valuable information. We require a powerful central authority to regulate quarantine, and I shall support the Bill as nearly as possible as it stands. In Victoria, at one time, the care of the public health was in the charge of local bodies; but it was found that on occasions their members were afraid to exercise their powers for fear of offending persons in the district over which the Board had control. The Legislature, therefore, felt compelled to institute a cenhas behaved any better than has Western tral Board of Health, with power to override the local bodies, which have since been altogether wiped out, the Health Act now being administered by a central department located in Melbourne. This1 arrangement has been found to work well, and every one is pleased with the change, although, when first suggested, it was opposed by the local bodies. What is proposed by the Bill is a , similar change, although on a larger scale, and, similarly, the State Departments are objecting to the control of a central Commonwealth Department. the Victorian Board of Health has not sufficient power, and that it could do better work if it had moie power? it originally possessed, and has done great good by exercising that power. Possibly it would do more good if its power were extended. We do not want to have in existence two sets of authorities. If we monwealth Department, the friction which will be caused should the Commonwealth Department attempt to coerce the States antness and ill-feeling than the transfer ' of the sole control to the Commonwealth. My view is that the Commonwealth should take over the Departments of Quarantine and Public Health. In my opinion, they would be better administered by one central authority than by independent State authorities. Has the Commonwealth been unable to properly adI reserve the minister the Departments of the Post Office,. Customs and Defence? Are those Departments not as well conducted as they were by the States? I think they are. administration of these Departments is perfect; but I believe that a central governing body would manage quarantine quite as well, if not better, than do the divided authorities of the several States. There are local jealousies already. We have Western Australia endeavouring by a side-wind to keep out fruits from other States. out the codlin moth. taken a similar step in relation to Queensland bananas. I do not say that Victoria Australia or South Australia in this connection. But the Commonwealth being the superior authority, the more power that is vested in the central body, the better it will be for Australia as a whole. member any idea of what the cost would be? should cost any more to administer Australia as a whole in the matter of quarantine than it does to carry on the administration of the different Health Departments of the States.

At any rate, honourable members would do well to support the Government, and to avoid so legislating as to give the States power to act on exactly the same lines as the Commonwealtha policy which could only give rise to much friction. .There would appear to be two questions before us. First, there is the constitutional question, which has been very exhaustively discussed by honourable members, who, in this House are, perhaps, the most capable of discussing it. I do not desire to go very far' into that question; but I find that the honourable member for Angas, in reply to an interjection by the honourable member for Parkes, said he was not sure whether the Commonwealth could constitutionally take up all the powers sought under the Bill, although he was prepared to "" chance it . "" The honourable member for Kooyong was also prepared to say, "" Let us .risk this departure."" That, in my opinion, is a wrong attitude for the Committee to take. It would be more in consonance with the dignity of this Chamber for us to be sure of our ground before we move; while any false step will only put us more and more in conflict with the States Governments, and invite captious criticism and litigation. So far as the word ""quarantine"" is concerned, I do not think there is any doubt that we have not the powers sought under the Bill. It has been argued, however,, that we have additional powers under the provisions of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce. I am willing to admit that a great deal that is not contained in the provision relating to quarantine may be found in the provision relating to trade and commerce. But we find that the regulations in regard to trade and commerce in Canada and the United States ""are almost entirely, if not exclusively, in regard to Inter-State trade and matters of that description. The honourable member who submits the amendment, and, I think, the majority of honourable members, are willing to give the Government power to regulate Inter-State quarantine. The only question on which 'we come into collision is whether we should exercise what are called the police function of the States in regard to matters within the States themselves. That is a course which, in my opinion, we are not called upon to take at the present time, even if we have the power. ThereI gave particulars are steps which may or may not be lawful, but which may not be expedient; and this, I think, is a step which it would be inexpedient for us to take, seeing that such matters can be better administered by the States than by a central authority. We all agree that there ought to be central administration in regard to what may be termed quarantine proper-that is maritime quarantine-so as to prevent the introduction of diseases dangerous to human, animal, or plant life.. These are matters which could be dealt with by the Commonwealth, and Parliament ought to take the necessary power; but when we come to interfere with the States in the exercise of their present powers-power s which, at any rate, the majority of the States are exercising well at the present time-w e are on another footing altogether. There would be much difficulty in administering the law if we took the full powers proposed in the Bill. The Acting Prime Minister, when he introduced the measure, saidI frankly confess that it has been found somewhat difficult to devise a means of doing this effectively aud inexpensively, and I hope that when the B ill becomes law we shall find it possible to work harmoniously with the States As to taking over the machinery of the States, I understand from what the Acting Prime Minister said, that he referred to the quarantine stations and to the health officers, more especially those employed in these stations. I do hot think for a moment that the Acting Prime Minister proposes to take over the administration of the Public Health Acts, the Nuisance Prevention Acts, the Cattle Slaughtering Acts, the Stock Acts, the Fruit Pests Acts, and'similar statutes of the different States; it is inconceivable that the Commonwealth could administer those Acts in the way they are being administered at the present time. All those powers ought to be left to the States, which possess all the necessary administrative machinery. The States Governments have at their disposal the municipal councils, and the health officers appointed by the councils, and also the police, who are often used in enforcing regulations made under such Acts as I have mentioned. The Commonwealth",22,Willis Th E Honourable Departments Will Create More Unpleas

The administration of the States is increasingly effective; and we do not desire to create extensive administrative machinery merely in order to meet such an emergency as has been suggested. Our experience is not that the States do not enforce their Acts, but rather that they are apt to go too far. power is necessary for the Commonwealth, is it not? panic the States Governments go too far that is better than their not going far enough. What we have to look to is the effective protection of the people from the inParramatta askedtroduction and spread of the diseases and pests mentioned. In the case of the Commerce Act, we allow the States to do their own work by experts, and under fhe Conciliation and Arbitration Act, we deal only with matters concerning more than one State; and we ought to act on the same broad principle in the Bill before us. If we do that, we shall have done all that the Commonwealth is called upon to do at this stage; and for the reasons that I have given, I am prepared to support the amendment. after the lengthy discussion which has taken place, I feel somewhat in doubt as to what course I shall take with regard to the amendment. We have had two or three splendid addresses from the legal point of view; but the speakers appea* to be in conflict upon a very important point. The amendment of the honourable member for Angas commended itself to my judgment; but an equally eminent' member of the legal profession, the honourable member for Bendigo, told us that if we adopt the amendment it will simply shatter many of the subsequent clauses of the Bill. We have no desire to bring about that result-w e would rather accept the measure, and endeavour to make it perfect. I apprehend that the desire of the Committee is to assist the Government in carrying into effect what is undoubtedly an essential part of our constitutional powers. But there appears to me some doubt as to what the Bill is de-' signed to accomplish. Legal members have presented the Bill to us as one containing powers designed to be concurrent with certain powers which the States will possess, even if the Bill becomes law, and will still continue to exercise. That was certainly not the view presented to us by the Acting Prime Minister when he introduced the Bill. I have the Hansard report of the honourable gentleman's speech, and it seems clear from what he said that the intention of the Government is to take over the whole control of quarantine. The honourable gentleman saidI t is, perhaps, unnecessary to remind honourable members that we have at present six different State laws dealing with quarantine, and -every one will admit it is unwise that the existing system should continue any longer than is absolutely necessary. At a later stage, the honourable member for What powers of quarantine will be preserved) to the Statesi f this B ill be passed? To that question the Acting Prime Minister repliedI have made inquiry, and am advised that no power will be preserved to them. Consequently it is clear that in the opinion of the Acting Prime Minister we are going to take over the wholepower of quarantine, so that in future no power in that connection will be vested in the States. At alater stage of the debate, the honourable member for Franklin askedIs the Minister advised that the CommonwealthGovernment can quarantine one part of a State as against another without the consent of that State? The Acting Prime Minister repliedI am so advised.",23,Willis Th E Honourable Departments Will Create More Unpleas

78,Mr Palmer (Echuca) [3.57],"EvenTherefor the intention of the Bill is that the Commonwealth shall assume absolute control of all quarantine arrangements^ including the internal control hitherto exercised by the States. To my mind, it is perfectly clear that if we do take over these functions we shall have done very little more than take over quarantine arrangements so far as the ports of entry are concerned, because no provision has been made by the States for the quarantining of districts or portions of a State. of that sort becomes necessary, action is invariably taken by their Stock Departments, and not under quarantine regulations. Therefore I think we may accept this Bill, which is particularly designed to assume control over existing quarantine arrangements, and from that Stand-point I am prepared to support the Government proposal. that this work can be discharged to better advantage by the Commonwealth than it is under present conditions, which appear to me to be likely to create difficulties. Only in to-day's newspapers a report is published of a discussion which has pust taken place in the South Australian Parliament. ence to the introduction of the fruit fly, and to the objection which is entertained by the State authorities to the importation of apples from New South Wales. Some honourable members of the South Australian Parliament expressed the fear that if the State Government prohibited the introduction! of apples from New South Wales because of the presence of fruit fly there, the latter State would resort to reprisals by refusing to allow fruit from South Australia to enter Broken Hill. of the difficulties which is always likelv to arise where conflicting authorities exist, and, in matters affecting the whole of the States, I am inclined to think that, it will be in the interest of the general community to secure administration by the Commonwealth. Of course, it may happen that, owing to the establishment of a central authority, we shall not be in a position to secure prompt action in certain' cases. That is one of the difficulties associated with the establishment of an authority which is called upon to govern a very large area The danger which I apprehend is that, in some instances, a disease may evidence itself iii one portion of a State, and before the central authority can be induced to move the area of infection may become enlarged, so that it will be more difficult to cope widi it than it would have been if action had been taken earlier. That, however, is a matter of administration. Unfortunately, Government Departments are proverbially slow to move. I do not know whether they are quite so slow as the average man credits them with being, but I do know that, in many instances, it is very difficult to get them to move. In cases where disease becomes manifest, and reI f anything quires to be grappled with expeditiously, we must talke care that our organization is such that its services may be called into active exercise at the earliest possible moment. I am quite prepared to support the Bill. Concerning the amendment, I scarcely know what action to tike. Upon its face, I feel inclined to agree to it . But I should like to hear from some member I believe of the legal profession how it would Jbe likely to affect the Bill, because I do not desire the prediction of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo to be realized. We must be careful to guard against that, and, therefore, as a layman, I should like to hear a further expression of opinion upon the subject. I shall support the amendment. The Acting Prime Minister states that he has an amendment which he may move, but he declines to say whether or not he will move it until clause 13 is under consideration. I do not think that this Committee actually wishes the Commonwealth to interfere with the internal arrangements made by the States in respect of ""health matters and the control of pests. The position I take up is that That is one I desire to see the Commonwealth assume the control of quarantine matters in regard to oversea shipping and as between State and State. But I would point out that if we undertake control of the matters which are now dealt with by the State authorities under their Quarantine Acts, we shall not deal with one tithe of the subjects over which they exercise supervision. If we are going to deal with diseases in fruit, why should we not deal with slaughtering operations, and with other matters affecting the public health, which, in some States, are incorporated in their Police Acts, in others in their Vegetation Diseases Acts, and in still others in their Pests Acts? The object of the major portion of this Bill commands the support of honourable members, but I would ask them to recollect that in all the States pests have been dealt with",24,Willis Th E Honourable Departments Will Create More Unpleas

But I do not intend .to deal with the constitutional asoect of this question. I recognise that there are certain functions relating to quarantine which the Commonwealth should exercise. I think It is not nethat every honourable member is prepared to give the Federal Government power to The States Governdeal with the general question of oversea and Inter-State quarantine, and surely it would be wise for the Minister to refrain from seeking additional power at the present time. Throughout the electorate which I represent there is a feeling of unrest in connection with this proposal. Their experience of the working of the Commerce Act has not been such as to lead them to believe that further interference, on the part of the Federation, with local matters is by any means desirable. This Bill, in Under s.o far as it deals with pests affecting plant life, is of the utmost importance to orchardists. We are dealing here with the very bread and butter of men who have carved out for themselves homes in the bush. Everything they possess is repre-' sented by their orchards. Thev have made a success of their industry without State assistance, and they simply ask us to leave them, alone. They have shown that they The authorities can manage their own affairs far better than the Federal authorities could hope to do. They have done much better than even the State Governments eould hope to do in taking measures to preserve their industry from the various pests that from time to reply at once,, "" We time assail it. It is because of this that fhe Government of Tasmania have seen fit to vest the local boards with complete powers, and those powers are 'exercised in order to preserve the industry, in which members of the boards, and those Ths whom they represent, have embarked practically every penny they possess. We need not fear that such men are not likely to take The varied the necessary steps to prevent the introduction of pests calculated to sweep away their' In means of earning a livelihood. We know from bitter experience that Government interference in these local matters has been attended by disastrous results. The Acting Prime Minister has said that it is not the intention of the Federal Government to interfere with the local bodies; but is it wise to I hope that the Government will see their pass a law with the deliberate intention that no machinery to give effect to it shall be created? Under the system prevailing in Tasmania an inspector of a local board may also be employed as a rate collector or secretary of a road trust, and may, perhaps, exercise half-a-dozen other functions. Under the Federal control, however, new machinery would have to be created. We should require new machinery in order that the Act might be properly administered. The orchardists view with alarm the possibility, not only of a more rigid quarantine system, but of the passing of uniform regulations that may break down the barriers they have thought fit to create for the protection of their industry. The Government should be content to acquire general powers of oversea quarantine and quarantine as between State and State, leaving Intra-State matters to be dealt with for the time being by the local authorities. As an honourable member has said, the question is not so much one of legality as of expediency. I do not think any one would say that under this Bill the system of quarantine relating to the suppression of fruit pests should be more rigid than it is in my electorate. I doubt if it could be more thorough, and in these circumstances, I ask whether it is wise for the Federal Government to seek to run counter to public opinion. I have never raised in this House the question of whether it is wise for the Federal Government to come into conflict with those of the States, and I am not dealing with this question from that stand-point. feel that we often make a mistake in speaking of a State Government when we have really in mind the people who have elected us, and to whom we are responsible.

I am not in favour of any of the amendments which have been suggested, because I think that the greater the powers of the Commonwealth for the protection of the public health the better. I hope that the Bill will pass as it is printed. Some years ago, when smallpox broke out in Launceston, the people of Hobart isolated the 20,000 inhabitants of that city, putting up barriers on every road, and even preventing the bakers' carts from going to the quarantine station to take bread there. There was a panic'in the southern city, and its citizens wished to injure those of Launceston. That is shown by the fact that, although there has been plague in Sydney on several occasions since, the Hobart people never tried to prevent vessels from coming from that port to Hobart. In a small community, one section will take action to injure another; but under wider control such petty jealousy cannot have effect. the people of the localities have, of their I therefore hope the Bill will pass as printed, and that much good will be accomplished by its means. been too much diversity of opinion in the past as to what is proper quarantine. For instance, in Tasmania it was for years impossible to import a beast from Victoria unless it remained six months in quarantine, and cattle sent from Victoria to agricultural shows on the mainland could not return to their own pastures before undergoing a similar quarantine. tion we have adopted a system of InterState free-trade, and, therefore, the.'Commonwealth should have full control of all quarantine matters, because many of the restrictions placed on movements of cattle and goods between State and State have simply meant protection. It is time that we removed the numerous borders and boundary lines which are at present recognised, and secured a wider and purer Federation. Personally, I was in favour t of 'complete unification of the whole of Australia, and I have seen no reason to alter my opinion. The honourable member for Bass, and others who have spoken, seem to have a remarkable faith in the benefits likely to result from Commonwealth administration. Such a faith is simply touching, in view of our experience of some Commonwealth Departments. The Honourable member for Bass asks why we have federated if not to create centralization and uniformity; and he contends that the combined wisdom of all Australia must, of course, be greater than that of any small locality. Quite so; but that same argument could be applied to the question of how the roads in Launceston should be metalled. Nobody will deny, however, that the metalling of the roads is a matter that can' be much better decided by the people of the town. Some quarantine administration deals with matters of purely local concern. Why, then, bring to bear the whole machinery of the Commonwealth ? Why use a steam hammer to crack a nut? The only persons who are affected by, or have any interest in-, the spread of plant diseases from one State to another are those engaged in growing plants: the general community take an interest only in so far as they recognise that such diseases, damage the industries of the orchardists and others. Fruitgrowing districts are widely separated, and have greatly varied local conditions; and own accord, imposedall kinds of restrictions in order to prevent the spread of There has disease. The objection to Federal administration is not a fear that the latter will impose greater restrictions, but that it will not impose sufficient restrictions. It has been contended that the Commonwealth is more likely to act than the States; but the contrarv is the case. The small local todies might be induced to act, when the huge machinery of the Commonwealth GoBy Federavernment could not be moved.

If the prosperity of any parts of Australia is injured by some Federal action, then, of course, Australia as a whole is injured. We have been told that the Commonwealth ought to take the widest possible powers, but ought not to exercise them. In my Under no conopinion it would be much better not to specify those powers in an Act of Parliament. I do not believe that it is possible for any statesman, however able, to All that the Commonwealth could devise regulations, especially in regard to diseases of plants and stock, so as to give If that advice the satisfaction that is now given by the administration of the local authorities. I intend to support the amendment. I should like to emphasize the remarks of the honourable member for Boothby, and to Honourable members talk in the point out that for the Federal Parliament to take power to interfere in internal State administration of quarantine, is not to make for efficiency. This is not a matter of Federal or anti-Federal spirit. I believe in the Federal Parliament taking over to the widest extent the powers which we can the more efficiently administer. I need not even mention oversea quarantine, because that, together with Inter-State quarantine, we all admit, should be under Federal administration as the more efficient. It is necessary to have some supreme power to prevent a State so administering, its quarantine laws A t present the whole reas to practically impose a prohibitive Tariff, as has been clone in certain instances in the past. But in regard, to internal and local matters I am satisfied-and I may inI f that responsibility be reform honourable members that I have had considerable experience in regard to the quarantining of stock-that the States can administer regulations much more effectively than can any central authority. Fbr tffat reason I intend to assist those who propose to restrict the exercise of the Federal authoritv to Inter-State and oversea quarantine. To my mind, it is purely a question of securing expediency and efficiency. I had a considerable experience of the' tick IfI trouble in Queensland, and in that connection obtained a very good knowledge of how the stock quarantine regulations are administered.

It is in the interests of the whole community that the administration of such regulations should be in the hands of some authority as near to the different centres as possible. For that reason, I shall support every attempt which is made to confine Federal action to Inter-State and oversea quarantine. I trust that honourable members will regard the matter from that stand-point.

Indeed, the honourable member might go so far as to indicate the duties of the officer, and so forth. think the Treasurer scarcely sees the intent with which the honourable member for Corangamite spoke. What the honourable member for Corangamite desires is that any officer appointed shall be a competent person. To that the Acting Prime Minister retorts that any Government would take care to appoint a competent person. Of course, if the present Government, with their careful administration, remained in office, no doubt nothing would go wrong; but, unfortunately, in course of time, the Opposition may crqss the floor, and, by inadvertence, an officer might be appointed who was not a competent person. be liable to Parliament if he appointedan incompetent person ? be so, as soon as the incompetence was discovered; but that would be locking the stable door after the horse had departed. Under clause 87,. there is power to make regulations, and I think the difficulty could be got over if an addition to that clause were made to the effect that it be a direction to the Minister, when appointing art officer, to appoint a reasonably qualified man. As the honorable member for Parramatta has said, there are a number of officers throughout the Commonwealth who are neither veterinary surgeons nor qualified medical men, but who are quite fit and proper persons for the work of inspection. If anvthing serious occurs, they telegraph or send to the nearestauthority, and an exoert is sent to the spot.

We have Dr. Norris in charge of the Health Department of Victoria no'vy; and why not make him, and the corresponding official in each of the other States, the officer in charge. I understand from the Acting Prime Minister 'that there is no intention to incur fresh expenditure, and, moreover, that there will be no proclamation, perhaps, for some time, bringing the Act into force.

Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [6.10] I wish to call attention to another point connected with this clause. know the real meaning of the term ""quarantinable disease""? The clause defines it thus"" Quarantinable disease"" means small-pox, plague, cholera, yellow fever, typhus fever, or leprosy, or any disease declared by the GovernorCeneral, by proclamation, to be a quarantinable disease. The word ""disease"" is defined in two places as follows:"" Disease"" in relation to animals, means glanders, farcy, pleuro-pneumonia contagiosa, foot and mouth disease, rinderpest, anthrax, Texas or tick fever, hog cholera, swine plague, mange, scab, surra, dourine, rabies, tuberculosis, actinomycosis, variola ovina, or any disease declared by the Governor General by proclamation to be a disease affecting animals; "" Disease"" in relation to plants, means any disease or pest declared by the Governor General by proclamation to be a disease allecting plants. I have shown that under the head of '-' quarantinable disease "" is included any disease declared by the Governor General to be a "" quarantinable disease."" It is very necessary to have a clear understanding as to the meaning of this term, because it occurs in so many portions of the Bill, notably in clauses 17 and 18. If my reading of the measure be correct, the goods referred to in paragraph b of sub-clause 2 of clause 18, would require to be infected with some disease which would be ejusdem generis with those which are specifically mentioned under the head,ing of ""quarantinable disease."" I think it is desirable that I should call attention to this matter. member that I will look, into it. In advocating the appointment of medical officers to investigate and report upon diseases under this Bill, I am supported by the very highest authorities. I have no desire to increase the expenditure which will be incurred under the measure beyond that which is absolutely necessary. At the same time, I wish to make the Bill a thoroughly efficient One. That result can only be assured by insisting that at every port of entry into the Commonwealth there shall be a duly qualified medical man to investigate diseases affecting human life, and a qualified veterinary surgeon to deal with diseases affecting animal life. At present these matters are dealt with by the States. Under the Bill they will still be administered by the State officials, because I apprehend that the officers at present charged with their administration will act in this regard, as I desire to Federal officers. But if any State has hitherto neglected to employ the services of a properly qualified officer in this connection, the Government should see that such an officer is appointed. in the Bill? embody any provision that we choose in it. Our aim is to benefit the whole of the people.

In answer to the honourable member for Parramatta, I would point out that quarantine officers on the States borders may be ordinary Customs officers that the honourable member should take steps to insure that a ""quarantine officer "" shall be a specially qualified medical officer, leaving the word "" officer "" to cover all others to be appointed under this measure. Evidently the honourable member wishes to shut out the other officers. Minister would have power to appoint Customs officers as quarantine officers at different points, and these, under my proposal, would have to report to medical men acting as health officers; to veterinary surgeons acting as inspectors of live stock, and to entomologists appointed to deal with the introduction of plant life. B ill , the Minister has power to declare certain ports of entry for animals and plants. the case of a State having a coastline two or three thousand miles long? stock intended to be introduced into that State from oversea would have to be sent. to the ""port of entry."" There might, however, be two or three ports of entry in a State, and I hold that it is. absolutely necessary that we should have at the ports of entry for plants and animals properly qualified veterinary surgeons and entomologists. My only desire is that the Bil l shall be as near perfection as possible, and I have high authority for the suggestions I have made. The honourable member for Corangamite commenced by saying that the Committee seemed to be at sixes and sevens in regard to his proposal. If there is any misconception the honourable member is responsible for it. The proposition which he origiUnder the honourable nally submitted was that in the definition of the term ""quarantine officer "" we should insert words providing that such an officer should be a medical man, or that every quarantine officer should be specially qualified. at the time had no amendment ready to submit, or, if he had, he was not prepared to yield to the request made again and In order to secure efagain to him that he should read it . again in error.

I -should like to say at this stage that he has attributed to me two statements which I did not make. He said, in the first place, that I had declared that stock inspectors under the States laws were better qualified than veterinary surgeons to administer this measure. I did not do so. By way of interjection, when the honourable member for ' Parramatta was speaking, I said that some stock inspectors were better qualified than veterinary surgeons for dealing with diseases in stock. I repeat that assertion.

I simply inquired whether stock inspectors in Victoria had to pass an examination, and learned, much to my astonishment, that they had not. As to the amendment moved by the honourable member, I think that, like another that has been proposed, it is immaterial whether it be accepted or rejected. Under the clause as it stands, the Minister will have power to appoint specially qualified men as quarantine officers, and I am sure that he will do so where practicable. In the circumstances, therefore, I do not think that the amendment should be pressed. tory j it would not compel the Minister fo do that which the honourable member desires.

Whether it is, or is not, needful to incorporate in the measure a direction to the Government that only duly qualified medical practitioners shall be appointed to examine ships' passengers and crews, I do not think it necessary to provide for the appointment of stock inspectors at ports of entry to visit ships. All stock imported into Australia under this measure will, I take it, be landed under practically the same conditions which now apply to the landing of stock under State Acts. Bitter experience has taught the authorities of the States that diseases of stock can be excluded only by detaining for observation, for long periods, all imported stock. That being so, the appointment of veterinary surgeons as stock inspectors to board ships at the port of entry should not be necessary. But the impression has got abroad that the ports of entry for stock will not include all the capiI t would .not be mandatals of Australia. I hope that that will not be so. As I read the measure, the Government is empowered to declare certain ports to be ports of entry for animals, and I urge upon the Minister the advisability of proclaiming as "" declared ports"" those which are now recognised by the authorities of the States as ports at which stock can be landed and quarantined. Imported stock is usually stud stock of great value, whose owners desire If the honourable memto inspect it from time to time, to see how it is getting on; and a Ministerial statement as to the policy of the Government in this regard would go a long way towards removing what I believe to be a misapprehension as to what is intended. which to insert my amendment, I ask leave to withdraw it.

Unless these appointments are made, the B ill will not be as effective as are the Acts of the States. At the present time, there is at every port of entry in the Commonwealth a legally qualified medical practitioner who acts as Health Officer, and I go only a little further in proposing that a legally qualified veterinary surgeon shall also be appointed for each port of entry for animals. also? animals will have to be landed perhaps a thousand miles from the place for which they are destined. to prevent the introduction of diseases affecting stock is to prohibit the landing of animals at any but declared ports of entry. to be declared ports of entry.

If ing animals or plants, exists, to any State or part of the Commonwealth in which the disease does not exist; (h\ declare any part of the Commonwealth' or of a State in .which any quarantinable disease or any disease or pest affecting animals or plants exists to be a quarantine area; or (i) declare that any persons, animals, plants, or goods in any quarantine area, or in any State or part of the Commonwealth in which any quarantinable disease, or any disease or pest affecting plants or animals, exists, shall be subject to quarantine. (2) The power of prohibition under this section shall extend to authorize prohibition generally or with limitations as to place and subject matter, and either absolutely or subject to any specified conditions or restrictions. On paragraph c I propose to raise the question of whether or not plants should be subjected to a general quarantine or merely to a limited quarantine I had given notice of an amendment, which, if carried, would have had the effect of exempting goods as well as plants from general quarantine, but after hearing the arguments advanced last evening by members of the medical profession, particularly by the honourable member for Laanecoorie and the honourable member for. Corangamite, I decided not to press that portion of my proposal, because I can easily conceive that it might be just as necessary for the Federal quarantine authorities to pursue goods the property of passengers as to pursue the passengers themselves. The personal effects of a passenger might contain quarantinable diseases, and therefore they ought to be subjected to the general control of the Federal authorities. reason, I intend to confine my amendment to the exemption of plants from general quarantine, and accordingly I move That in paragraph e the words "" o r plants"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words "" and appoint places at the ports at which, imported plants are first landed to be quarantine stations for such plants."" In regard to plants, I propose to limit the Federal quarantine authority to tlje first inspection at the port of landing. orable member's amendment have the effect of limiting the quarantine of animals ? served by preceding words. Full control is thus given to the Federal authority in matters of quarantine over persons or animals on land as well as on sea.

With reference to plant life, I think that some differentiation may be justified upon the ground that there is a greater possibility of the spread of infection from human and animal life than there is from plant life. In addition, I think that there is not the same demand for Federal intervention in the case of plants that exists in reference to persons and animals. ber think that the word "" plants"" in his amendment will cover the product of plants such as fruit? Vegetation Diseases Acts declare that (plants include fruit. However, it is unFor. this desirable to enter into too many definitions in this portion of the Bill. With reference to plants and vegetation products, I would point out that at the present time the laws of the' various States are very com-' plete and scientific. They are also very effective in their operation. I do not think there is any State in the world where the Government have a. more scientific and up to-date system of inspection and regulation of vegetation diseases than obtains in Victoria.

301,Sir John Quick,"Certainly . Allsystem exists in Tasmania, South Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland. In fact, all the States are up-to-date in their legislative efforts to suppress these diseases, and I believe that of late they have been fairly successful. Of course, it may be that in years gone by they were not so enterprising and so prompt as they are now. But all of them have established active, vigorous Departments of Agriculture, and I think they may fairly be intrusted with the administration of these laws, and with the task of developing, improving, and supervising means of controlling anything in the nature of local outbreaks in plant and vegetable life. In regard to plant life, the differsurer) [8.31] I understand that the obence in climatic conditions and latitude has necessarily involved a variety in the legal system. There is not a legal uniform system for the .regulation and suppression of vegetation diseases, such as obtains in regard to animal life. there is a well-organized 'Department, backed up by a good legislative system for this purpose, so that there is no cause for the intervention of the Federal authority, in matters of internal supervision in regard to plants and vegetable life. on ? But in the meantime, carrying out the principle which I affirmed last night, I shall not be a party to interfering with State functions without good cause. think that honourable members may be once more reminded of the dictum of Chief Justice Marshall in reference to quarantine matters. He said that every effort should be made to secure harmony and conciliation between the P""ederal and State authorities, and that the former should not, without reasonable cause, interfere in matters which were local and provincial as distinguished from matters which were of national or general concern. I believe also that there is a feeling of uneasiness amongst some of the States that the power of quarantine embodied in this Bill, if applied to orchards and vegetable plantations, might be made an instrument to harass, if not to oppress, our orchardists. They fear that orchards may be unnecessarily quarantined, and that the recommendations of the local officers may be disregarded by the Federal authorities, who may not understand the local requirements of the industry. Consequently, I think, first upon the ground that no strong case has been made out for the inclusion of plants, and, secondly, because in this matter we may fairly make a concession to State susceptibilities, that the Committee, without any surrender of power or anything savouring of self-, abnegation or of an abandonment of trust, may fairly leave plant life to the supervision and' protection of the State authorities when once it has run the gauntlet of Federal inspection at the port of entry. This would still give the Federal Government unqualified powers of supervision and inspection up to a certain point, leaving the subsequent movements of the plants under the control of the States authorities. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea ject of the amendment moved by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo is to prevent the Federal authorities from dealing with plants passing between the States or within the States, and' to make But in each of the States the Commonwealth inspection applicable only to plants from oversea. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I regret that at present, at all events, I cannot see my way to agree to that proposal. We do not intend immediately to put info operation any power that we may take under this clause.

It will be possible to leave many of these matters to the States, but we should have power to step in, and take action where there is any abuse of the quarantine powers of a State, or an undue restriction of interchanges between one State and another.

It would be a pity to. interfere with the uniform administration of the Bill by providing that the control of the States over the introduction of fruit pests by land shall be retained, but shall be abandoned in respect of the possible introduction of those pests by sea. Such pests might be introduced by sea, not from parts beyond the Commonwealth, but from one part of Australia to another. That, at all events, is my reading of the amendment. "" imported."" Acts there is power to declare places beyond the sea as infected places for the purpose of putting into force the fruit pest laws against importations from such countries. We have not taken that power under this Bill. Under-clause 12, to which we have just agreed, the power of the Governor General by proclamation to declare places beyond the sea infected with a quarantinable disease does not apply to plants. under the South Australian Act of 188=;, such a power exists. It would be rather dangerous to confine the operation of the States laws to the introduction of disease by land from State to State. really abrogated, part of the power to deal with imports from abroad, which is given by the States Acts, and have not put in this Bill sufiicient provision to take its place. In this way great danger might arise. If we agree, as proposed by tbe honourable member for Bendigo, to confine the operation of the States Acts to the introduction of disease from State to State, then we surely ought to take as ample powers under this Bill as exists under the States Acts to prevent the introduction of plant or fruit pests by imports from oversea. If we do take over the power of controlling the introduction of plant pests from oversea, we ought to be as thorough as are the States. The South Australian Act of 1885, to which I have referred, does not deal with quarantine, but with the introduction of fruit pests, and it is a very ample and exhaustive measure. I hope that in the circumstances we shall hesitate before we split up between the States and the Federation powers in relation to the introduction of 1 plant and fruit diseases. fective local provisions of the States Acts still operate? clause provides that there shall be a general power of proclamation, and this will not be affected by the amendment foreshadowed by the Treasurer. There will be a general power to put in force all the subclauses of clause 13, and we do not know what the proclamations will substitute for the State laws. I think that we should exercise a little caution before we -decide to vote for the amendment. I hope that the honourable member for Bendigo will accept the proposal foreshadowed by the Minister, since it will go even further than he proposes. I join with the honourable member in expressing the hope that we shall' do eveiything possible lo maintain friendly (relations between the Commonwealth and the States.

By limiting the power of the Commonwealth, we might seriouslv cripple our capacity to'make what might be in the future a desirable effort.

Mr HE*NRY WILLIS [8.44] -The explanation of the amendment which the honourable member for Bendigo has ;given to the Committee shows very clearly that he wishes to restrict the operation of this Bill. ment made by the Minister that he proposes that the Federal Government should have in reserve the power to step in when the States do not properly administer their quarantine laws Sir WILLIAM LYNE only by special proclamation. of that proclamation we should exercise our powers to the fullest extent, and I think, therefore, that the Ministerial proposal is preferable to that made by the We know that from time to time honourable member for Bendigo amendment of the honourable and learned intended undoubtedly for the member for Bendigo is a good one. As I said, this afternoon, when speaking 00* another clause, I think that it will be, well to exclude plants from the scope of the B ill , except so far as their importation from oversea is concerned. Except in regard to foreign importations, the authorities of the States, may well be allowed to make such laws as they think necessary for the prevention of the spread of diseases affecting nothing vegetation.

The Minister having stolen the clothes of the honourable member for Brisbane, it seems to me that the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo is not needed. I should like to put before the Committee some reasons why it is desirable that the word ""goods"" should be retained. tives of the Continental Powers have met in Convention to determine how their territories can best be safeguarded from the introduction of infectious diseases, and regulations, known as the International Sanitarv Regulations, have been drawn up. Clause LXII . of these declares thatCargo will for the future be divided into three classes. The following shall belong to the ist class, and be subjected to an obligatory quarantine and to purifying processes, viz., old clothes and articles in common use, rags and waste paper, leather and skins, feathers, hair, and in general any parts of animals; and lastly, wool and silk stuffs. The following shall belong to the 2nd class, and be liable to perform quarantine, viz., cotton, flax, and hemp. In Austria, goods are divided into four classes-""muc h suspected,"" ""suspected,"" "" l it t l e suspected,"" and ""not suspected."" The"" much suspected "" goods comprise1. Every sort of rag of whatever material. 2. Every sort of clothes which have been worn, and other susceptible effects, which do not belong to persons who have entered quarantine with them, and whose origin is not well known. 3. All effects which are known to have belonged to persons who have died in the Levant, although not of the plague. 4.

Like other members of the Committee, I desire that the Commonwealth shall not interfere unnecessarily or unduly with the authorities of the States, and, furthermore, I wish to put an end to that undue and improper interference by one State with the trade of another, which, if it has not yet extended far, is beginning to operate under the regulations which have been made, not altogether for the exclusion of disease, but for the exclusion of goods. Holding these views, I welcome the amendment foreshadowed by the Minister, for which credit must be given to the honourable member for Brisbane. It will prevent interference with the States by the Commonwealth, unless they grossly neglect their duty to other From time to time representaStates in allowing diseases to spread unchecked within their territories. do so? afraid that they have sometimes done so in the past; but, with the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, I think that, they are now more particular. So long as their officers are properly enforcing satisfactory regulations for the prevention of the spread of disease, I hope that no proclamation will be issued to interfere with the actions of State authorities within their own territory. But in connection with the provision that the Minister may appoint places on land or sea to be quarantine stations for the purpose of quarantine of vessels, persons, goods, animals, or planes, I ask him whether he has considered the financial aspect of the proposal. One of the reasons for transferring the control of quarantine to the Commonwealth is that economy may thereby be effected, and the",49,William Lyne I Have Another Can Be Done For The Prevention Of The Spread

That, however, does not touch the question that the Departments taken over mean the quarantine grounds, fhe officers-the property in connection with this very important function of Government administered by the various States in preventing the influx of disease in human beings, and possibly also animals, from oversea. Our legislation in regard to every Department we take over is exclusive' of the legislation of the States. So far, therefore, as concerns the quarantining of persons and animals from abroad at the sea-board, any legislation we pass wipes out or supersedes the legislation of the States, and there can be no conflict. The legislation of the State and Commonwealth is not concurrent or cumulative, but one takes the place of the other ; and that is all right. But when we come to deal with particular Statutes concerning the control of the movements of stock or of plants, or of s anything of that kind, as between different parts of the Commonwealth, we are not making, laws-w e may be making laws, though I do not think we are-whic h come under the general term of quarantine, and we are certainly not making laws in regard to the quarantine Departments of the States which we have taken over.

It is purely cumulative, or an addition to the legislation passed by the States. object of taking over the quarantine to be considered, I should think. Mr W. H . IRVINE -The object has, of course, to be considered in all cases. I shall take an example to illustrate what I mean. .It may be highly desirable-in fact, I . think it is, in many respects-that there should be a central, authority controlling the general movements of diseased stock. There are many arguments in favour of that view, and I am not going to ask the House to reverse the decision come to a little while ago. I am endeavouring to show that, if we pass legislation controlling the movements of stock as between the States, or as between different parts of the Commonwealth, we are not creating legislation that affects in any degree the existing legislation, or the existing power to legislate, of the various States. That is the point I desire to impress. that definition of '' quarantine.'' Mr W. H. IRVINE -On the definition of "" Quarantine Departments."" In Victoria, there is a Dairy Supervision Act, for example, in which it is provided that certain diseases are to be isolated, and that the isolation of the herds shall be done under the order of inspectors, who work under the administration of the Minister of Agriculture. I am sure that honourable members will not think that it ever was the intention of the Constitution that, in taking over the Quarantine Department of Victoria, the Commonwealth should take over that portion of the Minister of Agriculture's Department, with all its officers and machinery concerned with the isolation of diseased stock. desire that in regard to operations within a State. Mr W. H . IRVINE -It is not so much a question of what we may desire. c We may have different opinions of what we desire, but honourable members will admit that what I have indicated could not have been intended. so. Mr W. H . IRVINE I shall give another illustration. In Queensland, there is a very important Act called the Stock Diseases Act, under which a Board of Commissioners is appointed, and which has proved a very effective measure. The Commissioners have the power to appoint inspectors, and also to impose taxation in proportion to the number of the stock; and they may create a statutory fund for the purpose of dealing with the local conditions of stock. do exactly the same thing in another connection. Mr W. H . IRVINE I am merely"" giving this as an instance. This Board of Commissioners exercise-and I think most effectually-mos t important internal functions in the State of Queensland.

Mr W. H . IRVINE -They would not clash with the State regulations, but would be cumulative upon them.

We are merely establishing fresh machinery for the prohibition of these pests. lations specified that the quarantine of stock should extend over twenty-five days, and the State regulations declared that it should extend over thirty days, should we be required to abide by the State law? Mr W. H. IRVINE -Certainly , assuming that the State regulations were such as it had power to make under the Constitution, and were not unreasonable for the purpose of protecting its own people or stock, our regulations would not be inconsistent with the State regulations in the slightest degree, and would therefore not override them. The two sets of regulations would exist side by side. It is possible that under the name of a Quarantine Bill we might pass a law regulating, or possibly prohibiting the action of the States in regard to some of these mafters; but we are. not attempting to do that. an amendment which .will meet every word of the objection which the honourable and learned member has uttered.

It all resolves itself into the question of whether we have the extensive powers which it is proposed to take in this Bill. occurs to me that that general observation ought to be considered in dealing with the question of our powers. What is the object of taking over quarantine at all ? What was the object of taking over the Defence Department? Clearly it was to obtain a better Defence Force. I am almost certain, however, that we have not got it. Indeed, I very much doubt if we have a more efficient Post Office than we had prior to Federation. It may be that we shall get a better Department under the control of the honourable member for Maribyrnong. Nevertheless, the main object in taking over these Departments was to amplify them. is straining the question of amplifying. Was not the object rather to harmonize the Departments ? harmonizing to take place ? Clearly to make the power a more efficient one. Everything, I repeat, will ultimately depend upon the ruling of the High Court. If it rules that the narrow' interpretation of quarantine suggested member for Flinders must obtainand I admit it will have many precedents for adopting that view I do not know of any quarantine law covering so wide a field as we contemplate under this Bill. Assuming that we have the power-and the Committee has already decided that we shall proceed on that assumption-it occurs to me that the proposal foreshadowed by the Minister will cover far more ground than that contemplated by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. I therefore do not think that he ought to press his amendment. A point that I should like to emphasize is that this seems to be only a Bill to fortify and reinforce the quarantine laws of the States. It does not propose to give relief from the stringency of those laws. Surely the measure is one which should operate in the direction of greater leniency as well as of greater stringency where necessary. I should be glad to hear what further proposals the Acting Prime Minister has to make; but I trust that the honourable and learned member for Bendigo willagree to waive his proposal in favour of that made by the Minister. It -There can be no doubt that this clause will involve a great deal of expenditure. Under section 69 of the Constitution we have power to take over certain Departments, and as 1 contended in my speech on the motion for the second reading of this Bill, I think we are proceeding beyond our powers in providing that this Bill shall apply to other than oversea quarantine. Is it to be assumed that the framers of the Constitution, in passing section 69, and also the Braddon section, which makes the exercise of economy imperative, ever contemplated that we should, take over the hundred and one services with which this measure deals? I repeat that these proposals will involve an enormous expenditure on the part of the Commonwealth, and I am satisfied that the contention of the honourable and learned member for Flinders is correct. I urged the Minister privately to confine the operation of the Bill to oversea quarantine, taking power to deal with quarantine in any of the States only when we find that effective action is not being taken by them. There has been a lengthy discussion on the meaning of the word by the honourable "" quarantine,""^ as used in the Constitution, and I am strongly of opinion that the intention of the framers was that the Federal authority should exercise control only over oversea quarantine. I am fortified in that belief by the fact that such serious financial responsibilities are imposed upon the Commonwealth by the Constitution. -The amendment foreshadowed by the Minister seems to me tc go a long way towards granting that for which I and others have been contending. HadI been apprized of the intention of the Minister to move such an amendment, I should have been saved the necessity of making a long trip at the end of last week. was drafted on Friday, just after I had a conversation with the honourable, member. ister taken us into his confidence I think that much of the discussion that has taken place would have been avoided.",55,William Lyne I Have Another Can Be Done For The Prevention Of The Spread

I then pointed out that we have in Tasmania local Boards, appointed under special Acts, and possessing enormous powers to insure the effective operation of laws relating to fruit pests. Boards have been created under special laws that have no bearing on quarantine, and I fail to see how it would be possible for the Commonwealth to deal with those bodies under a Quarantine Bill. If we have not the power to take them over, we must either sweep them away altogether or allow them to remain as at present. Under the Bill as it stands power is being taken to enable the Minister by proclamation to create quarantine areas. If a pest be found in an orchard the whole of the orchard may be quarantined. The Minister may quarantine a whole district, and bring ruin upon many orchardists. It is difficult to determine what will be the effect of the Bill when so many additions and emendations are being made, but so far as I have been able to gather from the information imperfectly put before us, I think that the amendment foreshadowed by the Minister will go a long way towards granting that which the honourable member for Bendigo, the honourable member for Brisbane, and I , as well as others, have been endeavouring to secure. I would suggest that we should agree to the clause as proposed to be amended by the Minister, and that it should then be reprinted, so that we may have an opportunity of examining it and determining whether any further alteration is necessary. In that event we should make an effort to secure the recommittal of the clause. My object is to insure that internal quarantine arrangements will be carried out by the local authorities. Had I"" known that the Acting Prime Minister intended to propose the amendment which he has indicated, I should not have .taken up the time of the Commiftee in submitting my proposal. I think that the honourable gentleman's amendment will meet the view of myself and others who wish to safeguard orchardists from unnecessary interference on the part of the Federal authorities. I shall therefore ask permission to withdraw my amendment. In doing so, I should like to refer to the point raised by the honourable member for Flinders, and to which he had previously directed attention, as to the extent to which the Federal control over quarantine becomes exclusive. The honourable member contends, I under-' stand, that when, under section 69, we take over the Quarantine Department, the control of quarantine becomes exclusively vested in the Commonwealth by virtue of paragraph 11. of section 52 of the ConstiThose tution. Under that section we have exclusive power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect toMatters relating to any Department of the Public Service, the control of which is by this Constitution transferred to the Executive Government of the Commonwealth. My reading of the words "" matters relating to any Department "" is that they mean matters relating to the organization of any Department, its officers, regulations, and management, its plant and its property. I am somewhat surprised to hear the contention that these words, properly read, mean that quarantine, as a legislative power, becomes exclusively vested in the Commonwealth. I cannot agree with that contention. the word "" quarantine,"" as used in the section giving general power, was limited by the words ""Quarantine Department."" tion is a fairly sound one. that by section 52 the legislative power in quarantine becomes exclusively vested in the Commonwealth. I believe that to the extent to which Federal legislation occupies the field of action, so to speak, and expressly displaces States laws, it will be exclusive; but Federal legislation need not necessarily occupy the whole field. We may take over or exercise only a fraction of the power, and the residue of that power will remain with the States. Colonel FOXTON The Department could have been taken over by proclamation and without anv legislation. ment "" merely means the officers and other persons conducting the administration of the law; it does not mean the law itself. A Department is merely an agent for the enforcement of the law.

Except by inference from the use of the words "" spread "" or "" introduction,"" we have not the effect of the specific provisions in the English Act, and in some of the States Acts, under which the diseases dealt with are contagious or infectious. Therefore, what may .seem to be an innocent wording may convey larger powers than the Committee wishes to give. For instance, it might be possible to declare a quarantine area in respect of a fever which is not infectious. The English Act deals with epidemic, endemic, and infectious and contagious diseases. Pararal may, by proclamationDeclare any part of the Commonwealth or of a State in which any quarantinable disease or any disease or pest affecting, animals or plants exists to be a quarantine area. There two provisions are joined together which should be separated. The technical reading of the, provision is that there may be a quarantine area declared in respect to a disease affecting a plant, which shall apply not only to plants but also to animals. What is meant is that a quarantine area may be proclaimed in relation to plants, and apply to plants only, if a disease affecting plants exists there, and that, similarly, a quarantine area may be proclaimed applying only to animals. I suggest the insertion after the words "" to be "" of the words "" in respect to animals or plants, as the case may be."" Some such words as those should be inserted.

It is no new experience for us to find lawyers differing from one another, and the fact that the honourable member for Flinders entertains a different view from that expressed by the honourable member for Angas possibly points to the conclusion that the former is not to be accepted as a great authority upon this question. We must recollect that the honourable member for Angas was a member of the Federal Convention, and is well versed in the constitutionality or otherwise of our. procedure. Certainly his opinion is quite as worthy of acceptance as that of the Honourable member for FlindersI say that the Acting Prime Minister is taking up a reasonable position in contending that this clause should be dealt with before we adjourn. At the present time two proposals are practically before the Committee. One has been submitted by the honourable member for Brisbane. Had the Acting Prime Minister not suggested another amendment whiMi is terser and very much preferable to that proposed by the honourable member for Brisbane, no doubt we should have been content to accept the latter. But seeing that the proposal of the honourable member for Brisbane necessitates an adverse judgment being given upon the management of the States Quarantine Departments, I think that it would be an act of grace upon his part to I suggest that it would withdraw it in favour of. that of the Minister. Considerable weight is to be attached to the remarks of the honourable member for I consented to an Robertson in regard to the wording of the amendment. But his observations only strengthen the request which has been made that honourable members should be afforded a further opportunity to consider this clause. The Minister said that one of his objections to the amendment circulated by the honourable member for Brisbane was that it would involve some delay in giving effect to the law. That, to my mind, is not an that I should have moved the omission of subclause g. had I thought that there was any possibility of securing its excision, since I think that the Commonwealth should not of the States. There is a danger of muchinjury being done to different interests by reason of panic legislation. We have experienced something of the kind in Queensland, notwithstanding that the Administration has had a full knowledge of local conditions. So far, however, the State quarantine laws relating to stock have been excellently carried out, and I see no occasion for the Commonwealth t'o interfere with the internal administration of the States. It is only because I recognised that there was no likelihood of my securing the omission of sub-clause g that I refrained from (proposing such an amendment, and decided to support that circulated by tlie honourable member for Brisbane as being the most for which we could hope. The delay in taking action, which his proposal might involve, would be a very useful safeguard, for the interests involved are very considerable. In connection with the administration of the Queensland regulations relating to tick and other stock pests, hardship and loss have been suffered as the result of hasty and ill-considered action on the part of the local authorities, and' the danger must be accentuated when we have the Federal authority operating far away from the affected area, and having no knowledge of local conditions. The measures to which fhe amendment relates are not of great urgency. Before the Federal authority would be asked to step in much work would have been carried out by the State. The power of the Commonwealth would be invoked only when it was thought that the time had arrived when it should",61,William Lyne I Have Another Can Be Done For The Prevention Of The Spread

I , therefore, think it would be fair to give the honourable member an opportunity to discuss the amendment with those who assisted him in drafting it before he is called upon to withdraw following papers:it. If the wording of the amendment were varied so as to remove the objection to which I have referred, I should much prefer it to that foreshadowed by the Minister. Every formality should be observed in invoking Commonwealth interference with the internal arrangements of a State -Statutory Rules 1907, No. 81. Such an action should be most circumspect, and the greater the leisure with which it is done, within reasonable limits, the better it' will be. In that way, all chance of friction would be removed, and it is for this reason that I think the Minister should give us an opportunity to consult with the honourable member for Brisbane before the amendment is withdrawn. I suggest that unless that opportunity is given the honourable member for Brisbane should press his amendment, asking leave only to vary its wording. -Holding, as I do that the Bill has a tendency to go very much further than I think it ought to do in regard to quarantine matters, it would"" be strange if I did not prefer the more sweeping reservations in my own amendment to those of the amendment foreshadowed by the Minister. AlthoughI prefer my own amendment, more especially as it would compel the observance of certain formalities before the Commonwealth could prevent the. passing of human beings from one State to another, still I recognise that, under existing circumstances, it is more than probable that if I pressed it to a division .it would be rejected in favour of that which the Acting Prime Minister intends to move.
