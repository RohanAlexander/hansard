I I was intrigued by some of the arguments prewould like to make reference to a comment by the sented by the honourable member for Wills.

First, the designation of companies and the availability of copies of these the Chief Judge of the Court is changed to 'Chief registers will be standardised. See, for example, Justice'. This brings the designation into line with clause 95. Other amendments result from ongoing the Supreme Court of all the States and the work on preparation of the regulations to be made Northern Territory. Secondly, clause 65 makes it under this Act. Some of the amendments are not clear that a judge of the Federal Court of intended to change the operation of the principal Australia who is appointed to the Supreme Court legislation, but simply to ensure that it does, in of the Australian Capital Territory is not entitled fact, operate as originally envisaged.

This will enable the Ministerial Council to amount by way of salary or annual allowances review the provisions relating to the register. For equal to the excess. this purpose, a new section 215A is to be inserted in the Act by clause 105 of the Bill. There are also exemptions provided by that legislation.
