On what date was the construction of the first of these residences begun ? 3. On what date did the Minister, by Avriting under his hand, modify the plan in accordance Avith section 4 (2) of the Seat of Government (Administration) Act to enable these houses to be built? answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The land referred to formed portion of the .area indicated for university purposes in It is also the plan' mentioned. Prior to the publication of the plan, however, part of the site had been utilized for a number of years for the present hospital and for official residences, and the commission has since added both to the hospital and also to the number of residences already on the land in question. All the buildings have been erected in temporary construction. 2. The first of the residences was erected in 19.13. 3. On the 29th October, 1927, the Minister modified the plan in accordance with section 4 .f2) of the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1924-26. This modification was not, as suggested, .to enable the'houses to be built, but for the purpose of making an adjustment of the university area to obviate the necessity of erecting buildings on sites that would be unsuitable and expensive for building purposes.

I have no knowledge of any treaty entered into between Great Britain and Ger many relating to a matter such as this. On the ""lCth October, 1920, however, the British Government gave to the German Government a unilateral undertaking that they would not exercise their rights under paragraph 18 of annex II . to Part VIII . of the Treaty of Versailles to seize the property of German nationals in the case of voluntary default by Germanyi n the matter of reparations. This applies to German property in the United Kingdom or under TJnited Kingdom control, whether in the form of bank balances, or in that of goods in British bottoms, or of goods sent to the United Kingdom for sale. This undertaking was renewed by the British Government on the 2nd December, 1924. New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Canada, and Newfoundland have given undertakings very much on the lines of that given by Great Britain, but New Zealand has made an exception in respect to companies. I am not in possession of information as to what other Germany in connection with the matter. present considering the question of giving a the Prime similar undertaking. It might be pointed out, however, that the Commonwealth Crown Law authorities advise that German capital, if now invested in Australia, could not be confiscated under the Treaty of Versailles. Under section Government to introduce 8 of the War Precautions Act Eepeal Act 1920, however, a company in which more than one-third of the shares are held by aliens cannot, without the consent of the Treasurer, acquire any mine or interest in a mine, or carry on any mining or metallurgical business.

34,Mr Hill,"R e c e n t l y the honorableter for Home and Territories) [3.20] On Thursday last, in reply to a question without notice asked hy the honorahle member for Herbert (Dr. Nott), I promised to make a statement on the subject of the charges imposed upon lessees in Canberra in respect of kerbing and guttering. I now ask for leave to do so. (Leave granted.) charges has been taken by a. number of lessees, on the ground that an official announcement was made at the first auction sale of leases at Canberra, on the 12th December, 1924, to the effect that the cost of kerbing and guttering had been included in the upset prices placed on the land offered at that sale. The question was officially raised in a communication recently addressed to my department, and signed by nine lessees. It contained the following statement:We, the undersigned, beg to draw tlie Minister's attention to the official announcement made by Colonel J. H . T. Goodwin from the rostrum on the date of the sale of the first leases, T2th Docember, 1924. In answer to a question by one of the prospective purchasers, an announcement was made that the roads, footpaths and kerbing and guttering would be carried out by the Government, without cost to the purchaser, as the cost of such had been taken into account when fixing the reserve values of the respective blocks. Honourable members will observe (1) that the announcement is said to have been made by Colonel Goodwin; and (2) that it is further said to have been intimated that the cost, not only of kerbing and guttering, but also of footpaths, had been taken into account when fixing the reserve values .or upset prices, and that that work would be carried out by the Government. I may explain that the inclusion in the upset prices of the cost of road making is not in dispute, and that I do not propose to make any mention of that matter, except by way of incidental reference. When I received the communication from which I have quoted, I determined to sift the whole matter as thoroughly as possible in order to satisfy myself as to the. facts. I am now in possession of a report by the Chief Commissioner of the Federal Capital Commission, and also of a number of statutory declarations and statements by persons in a position to furnish evidence of what took place at the sale. The Commission itself had nothing whatever to do with the sale, as it did not enter upon its statutory duties until the 1st January, 1925. Honourable members, I feel sure, will agree with me that the evidence to which the greatest weight should be attached is that which is' obtainable from the accredited representatives of the Government at the sale, Exception to these namely, the auctioneer, Mr Crammond, who conducted the sale, and the administrative representative of the Government, Colonel Goodwin. On the 7th March, 1928, Mr Crammond wrote to the Chief Commissioner as follows:Dear Sir, Referring to your telephone conversation with me this afternoon, any statements in my opening remarks at the sale of the Canberra leaseholds, held on 12th December, 1924. should be recorded, and be amongst your records, as there was a shorthand writer taking notes, a proof of which transcript was sent to me prior to its being published. I certainly said that -roads would be formed to the undeveloped portions of the subdivisions sold, but the question of kerbing and guttering was never mentioned. Yours faithfully , For RICHARDSON & WRENCH. LTD . (Sgd.) C. H . CRAMMOND. Managing Director. On the following day, Mr Crammond sent a telegram to the Chief Commissioner in these termsReferring to conversation per 'phone and my letter to you yesterday's date. Have searched all records in connection with sale, including transcript of my remarks as reported in Sydney Morning Herald, 13th December, 1924, which confirms my statement that no reference was made to kerbing ancl guttering. I had no idea of Commission's intention, and had no instructions. Mr Crammond's ' statement that the subject of kerbing and guttering was not mentioned at the sale is definite and unequivocal, and is entitled to respect, because of his having taken the precaution of refreshing his memory by a search of his records of what occurred, including the transcript of his remarks for publication in the press. In corroboration of Mr Crammond's version of the matter, I have received, through the Chief Commissioner1. A very definite statement by Major Marr, Honorary Minister, who made the",17,Developmental Project 4 The Commonwealth Government Is At
35,Sir Neville Howse (Calare,"Minisintroductory remarks at the sale, and who says that he was present during the whole time the sale was in progress, and heard everything that was said, but does not remember hearing the words "" kerbs -and gutters"" mentioned. 2. A statutory declaration by Sir John Harrison, a member of the Eederal Capital Commission, affirming that he was present at the sale, and heard every word that was said by the auctioneers, every question that was asked, and every answer that was given, and that the words' "" kerb "" and "" gutter,"" or anything corresponding to those words-were not used during the whole of the proceedings. 3. Statutory declarations by Messrs. J. C. Brackenreg, F . Maxwell and W . R. Buchanan, all of whom are officers of the commission, setting out that they were present throughout the sale, and paid close attention to all that transpired, but did not hear, the words "" k e r b "" and "" glitter "" mentioned. 4. An extract from a report of Mr Crammond's speech at the sale, published in the Queanbeyan Age,of 16th December, 1924, which contains a reference to ""roads,"" but no reference whatever to ""footpaths,"" ""kerbing,"" or ""guttering."" Colonel Goodwin, on the other hand, has made a statutory declaration, which reads as follows:I , John Thomas Hill Goodwin, of Braddon, in the Territory for the Seat of Government, grazier, do solemnly and sincerely declare1. ThatI was present at the auction sale of leases in the Territory for the Seat of Gothem. vernment, held at Canberra on the 12th day of December, 1924. 2. That in my capacity of Surveyor-General be borne by the commission. of the Commonwealth, and Director of Lands, and administrative representative of the Commonwealth Government at Canberra, I gave the auctioneer authority to announce, in reply I am informed, was due to an error on the to a question asked by a person attending the sale, that the upset prices placed on the lands of whicli leases were being offered for sale at the auction included the cost of the kerbing and guttering of the footpaths adjoinGoodwin, dated 30th March, 1925, which ing the said lands, and that the auctioneer made an announcement accordingly. 3. That, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the basis of my valuations was fully explained to the then Minister for Home and Territories, before the upset prices were approved by the Commonwealth Government. When discussing the terms of the declaration with the secretary of my department, pressly that the announcement Sir Neville Bowse. have been.made upon his authority did not intimate that the cost of footpaths had been included in the upset prices, and he thus narrowed the issue to one of whether there was an announcement by the auctioneer respecting the cost of kerbmond, however, Colonel Goodwin does not appear to have taken steps to refresh his memory of the events of the sale before making his declaration, as I shall proceed to show. Colonel Goodwin's declaration was referred to the Chief Commissioner, who, very properly, ordered a thorough examination to be made of the files which had been under the control of Colonel Goodwin, when Surveyor General, prior to the sale, and also of the commission's files subsequent to the sale. Whilst this examination has failed to disclose any trace of the calculations made by Colonel Goodwin when fixing the upset prices, or any explanation of his figures, it has revealed some highly i m portant evidence as to what was in Colonel Goodwin's mind, immediately after the sale, on the question of charging lessees w i th portion of the cost of kerbing and ' guttering. On the 28th March, 1925, a memorandum in the f o l lowing terms was sent to Colonel Goodwin and other officers of the commissionWill you please note that at its last meeting the commission resolved that lessees be required to pay half-cost of the formation of roads and footpaths, including kerbing and guttering, in front of properties leased by This does not include the cost of any plantation or parking, the whole cost of which will (Signed) C. S. DALEY, 28/3/25. Acting Secretary. The inclusion of the references to roads, part of an officer when noting the resolution of the Commission. This memorandum evoked a reply from Colonel reads as follows:With reference to your memorandum of the 28th inst., advising me that the Commission resolved that lessees be required to pay half-cost of the formation of roads and footpaths, including kerbing and guttering in front of properties leased by them, I desire to inform you that in making valuations it was considered that the formation of roads, into a state similar to National-avenue, would Colonel Goodwin stated exnot be a charge against the lessee, otherwise said to the valuations would have been lower.",18,Federal Capital Kerbing And Guttering Charges
36,Ing And Guttering. Unlike Mr Cram,"The matter of forming a footpath and kerbing and guttering is quite another matter; but under tlic circumstances I do not think that the cost of bringing the road into a state similar to National-avenue should be a charge against the lessee. In fact, purchasers were given to understand at the sale that there would be no charge for road formation. W i e n Colonel Goodwin wrote this report, barely three months had elapsed since the date of the sale, and the facts should have been fresh in his memory. Nevertheless, the report shows that, at that time, it. was very definitely and clearly fixed in his mind that there was a distinction between roads-certai n expenses in connection with which were to be borne by the Government-and kerbing and gutter-ing, which he described as "" quite another matter."" earlier, he had caused an official announcement to be made that kerbing and guttering costs would not be charged against lessees, it is inconceivable that he should have remained silent on the point, and allowed a different view to prevail. The only reasonable conclusion to which 1 can come is that he did not cause such an announcement to be made, and that the declaration made by h i m three and a quarter years after the sale indicates that his present recollection of what occurred is seriously at fault. Nine other declarations have been submitted in support of the statement that an official assurance of immunity from kerbing and guttering charges was given at the sale. Two of these were made by one person, namely, Mr John Deans, company director, of Canberra. In the first of these, Mr Deans declares as follows:I , John Deans, of Canberra, in the Territory for the Seat of Government, company director, do solemnly mid sincerely declare:1. ThatI was present at the auction sale of leases in the Territory for the Seat of Government held at Canberra on the 12th day of December, 1924. 2. ThatI was standing close to Joseph Daniels, who asked a question during the sale of the Eastlako residential blocks. The question was asked in the following manner:The auctioneer was describing the large fronta.ges, and Daniels said, ""What about the kerbing and guttering?"" The auctioneer turned towards Colonel Goodwin, who was also standing on the rostrum, and Colonel Goodwin stated that the reserve values of the land included the cost of roads, footpaths, kerbs aud gutters, and these would be carried out without cost to the purchaser. 3. ThatI have purchased a large number of residential blocks at each subsequent sale, and that no question was raised at these sales, nor any statement made in variance with the statement made at the first sale of leases on the 12th day of December, 1924. As this declaration specifically named the person whose question was alleged to have called for th the official announcement which is said to have been made, I in quired why there had been no supporting declaration by that person. The reply I received was that it was not possible to produce such a declaration, as, unfortunately, Mr Daniels had died about eighteen months ago. Mr Deans' second declaration is in the following terms:I , John Deans, of Canberra, in the Territory for the Seat of Government, company director, do solemnly and sincerely declare1. ThatI am one of a number of persons responsible for organizing a petition to the If , just three months Minister for Home and Territories in reference to a statement made at the first sale of leases on the 12th day of December, 1924. 2. That on the Oth day of MarchI interviewed William George Woodger, one of the auctioneers at the sale, who authorized me to advise Sir John Butters that he was prepared to make a statement to the following effect:His recollection of the happening at the sale in connection with the development of the frontages to the allotments, i.e., the footways, roadways, &c, was. that, probably in reply to a question, it was im' plied that purchasers would not be put to any expense in tliat connection. 3. In consequence of this authority, I telephoned Sir John Butters on the morning of Wednesday, the 7th instant, to the above effect. Upon receiving this declaration, I asked the Federal Capital Commission to endeavour to obtain an independent declaration from Mi"". Woodger himself. Mr. Woodger subsequently made a declaration in the following words:I , William George Woodger, of Canberra, agent, do solemnly and sincerely declare1. ThatI am a member of the' firm of Woodgors and Calthorpe, of Canberra and Queanbeyan, auctioneers and estate agents. 2. ThatI was present at the auction sale of leases held at Canberra on the 12th December, 1924. 3.

E. Woodger, recollects a statement regarding roadways, but does not recollect a statement regarding kerbing and guttering. An impression was formed in his mind that developmental costs would not be a charge against lessees, but he is unable to say how it arose. The remaining declarations are by:1. T. E. Woodger, who declares:1. That he was present at the auction sale of leases in. the Territory for the Seat of Government held at Canberra on the 12th day of December, 1924, in the capacity of joint auctioneer for the Government. 2. He heard the question asked by one of the buyers present as to whose was the responsibility of the kerbing and guttering. Goodwin, as representative of the Government, that the kerbing and guttering would be done at the Government's expense, and he informed purchasers of blocks at after auction sale that they had no responsibility beyond the boundary of their own blocks-that the cost of all footpaths gardens and roads would be carried out at the cost of the Government. 2. J. H . Calthorpe, who declares:1. That he was present at the auction sale of leases in the Territory for the Seat of Government held at Canberra on the 12th day of December, 1924, in the capacity of joint auctioneer for the Government. 2. He heard a statement made that all roads and footways would be put in order by the Commission, with the question that water, sewerage, and electric light would be made available for every block being auctioned at that sale-and that these improvements would be carried out by the Government without cost to the purchaser. 3. H . S. Martin, who declares:1. That he was present at the auction sales of leases in the Territory for the Seat of Government, held at Canberra on the 12th day day of December, 1924. 2.

Honourable members are now in possession of the whole of the evidence.I have been ""able to procure in This was answered by Colonel regard to the matter. I have given very careful consideration to all aspects of the question, and I have conferred with my colleague, the Attorney-General, who has summed up his examination of the position as follows:The result is tliat, in my opinion, the weight of evidence is emphatically against the claim that persons were induced to bid for leases at the first sale by any representation made by any person to the effect that the cost of kerbing and guttering was included in the reserve prices, or that in any way it would be borne by the Government. I would also add that it is open to any purchaser to take proceedings to establish what he considers to be his rights if he thinks proper to do so. With this view, I am in complete agreement, and I do not propose, therefore, to take any steps to interfere with the action of the Eederal Capital Commission in debiting the purchasers"" of leases with a proportion of the cost of . kerbing and guttering.

37,Motion (By Dr. Eaele Page) Pro,"The Treasurer should give honourable members some indication of the nature of the amendments it is proposed to make. It will be remembered that just prior to Christmas some extraordinary happenings occurred in connection with the Commonwealth Housing Bill which was then under consideration. When the measure was being debated in this chamber .we were told that it was essential that a sepaduced. rate board should be set up to administer it ; but when it was before another place it was said that there was no need for a separate board, and the provisions designed to set up such a board were deleted. When the bill came back to us we were assured that there was no need for the proposed separate board. What is the position now ? Is it suggested>that a separate board shall be set up, or what is the nature of the proposed amendments? So far as we know the act has been inoperative. At any rate, I had not heard of a single house being built under its provisions. In all the circumstances the Treasurer is hardly justified in calmly asking at this stage for leave to introduce a bill to amend the act. I rarely offer objection to a motion for leave to introduce legislation, but I think we are entitled to some explanation on this occasion. For the Treasurer to act as he has done in this case is to my mind to show something bordering on contempt for the House. We ought to be told whether these proposed amendments are urgent. We are within a fortnight of the Easter adjournment and have some important matters on the notice-paper for our consideration. We should not therefore be asked to spend our time iu discussing matters of minor importance. The Government promised during the last election campaign that it would make provision for the people to build or buy houses; but so far nothing has been done.

It is not customary when introducing a motion of this nature to describe the proposal at any length, but the contemplated work, which is being referred to the Public Works Committee for investigation and report, is of such importance that I believe that honourable members will be glad to have whatever information I can give them in connection with it. The Australian War Memorial was established by an Act of Parliament passed' in 1925, and consists of our collection of war relics, and the building in which they will be preserved. The relics include practically the whole of the documentary records of the Australian Imperial Forces, together with the pictures, photographs, models and souvenirs in which the story of the Australians, who took part in the great war, is enshrined. The gathering together of these relics began at the front early in 1917, and the building up of the collection has been assisted, in a wholehearted way, by all the",21,Commonwealth Housing

Part of the collection has been displayed in Melbourne, where, in the course of two years, it was visited by 800,000 persons. It was afterwards removed to Sydney, where more than 1,250,000 people have inspected it. Upon the advice of the Federal Capital Advisory Committee and the Australian War Memorial Committee, the Government allotted a site for the Memorial on the lower slopes of Mount Ainslie, facing Parliament House, and authorized the holding of an architectural competition for designs for a suitable building for it, to cost £250,000. Memorial Board has followed the very The competition, closed in 1926.

The adjudicators, the War Memorial Board, and the Federal Capital Commission then proposed to the Government that two of the architects who had taken part in the competition should be invited to collaborate in preparing a fresh design. One of them had submitted the least costly design, and the other had subdo not intend to oppose the motion, as I mitted the design which most appealed to the. adjudicators.

43,Mr Mcgrath (Ballarat) [3.52],"Ibe constructed in Canberra. If the considerable amount of money necessary is available for such a purpose, it could be used with infinitely greater benefit if spent ou those of our returned soldiers who are alive. I have received quite a number of letters from returned' soldiers declaring emphatically that their writers are unable to obtain a home, either through the Repatriation Department or the Commonwealth Savings Bank. They declare that those bodies have failed to fulfil hundreds of applications. It would be better to use in providing suitable homes for our returned soldiers and their families, and in relieving those who kill people, but to utilize the discoveries are now out of work, the money now proposed to be expended. Many thousands of returned soldiers are out of work, and public works are being closed down, thus narrowing the scope of employment. I am a member of the Publie Works Committee, and I know that many works recommended by that committee, and approved of by the Ministry as being of an urgent nature, have been indefinitely postponed. A recent debate in this chamber disclosed that many returned men suffering from tuberculosis are dying from starvation, and that others are not receiving a fair deal. It will not it the intention of the Government to give those men much satisfaction to know that the Government proposes to build a war memorial in Canberra at some future date. Most of them will be dead before the memorial is begun, l t will take a long time for the Government to make the necessary preliminary inquiries, and, if the work progresses in a similar manner to many other projects undertaken by this Government on the recommendation of the Public Works Committee, it will be many years before the taxpayers of Australia will be called upon to provide the necessary funds. I urge the Minister to deal with the necessitous cases at present existing in Australia, which are a continuing stigma on our good name, and an admission of complete failure to honour the many promises made to our men prior to and after enlistment. Returned men are receiving half and three-quarter pensions, and are expected to earn sufficient to make good the difference. If the Government will not employ those men it .cannot expect the private employer to do so. While such distressing cases exist it is futile to contemplate the building of a war memorial. In every capital city and in every town of Australia, hospitals are overcrowded and unable to cope with the sick. Many of those unable to receive attention are returned soldiers -or their dependants, and no better memorial could be erected to the memory of our men than adequate up-to-date hospital accommodation throughout Australia. Awful tragedies were enacted at the Great War, where human life was treated almost with contempt. Its lesson should be, not to expend further money to maim and of science.to alleviate the sufferings of our f ellow men. I would gladly subscribe to any memorial which would tend to alleviate suffering aud prolong life. That would be infinitely nobler than constructing a building of brick and mortar in Canberra, which could be viewed by comparatively few, and which could accomplish no utilitarian purpose. -The Minister has intimated that 60,000 names have already been received for registration on the roll of honour. Is record on the proposed memorial the names of those who have died since the war as the result of war service? all those who died either during or subsequent to the war, and whose death was due to war service, will be inscribed on the Roll of Honour.

46,Upon Which Mr Chablton Had Moved,"history of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, and the long drawn-out negotiations that preceded Federation, has been very exhaustively debated in this chamber, and I do not propose to add to it except by reminding honourable members that those relations found final expression in the Braddon section of the Constitution. That provision had a life of ten years, and provided that three-quarters of the customs and excise revenue should be returned to the States. Later, provision was made by this Parliament for a per capita payment of 25s. to the States for ten years or for such period as Parliament otherwise determines. The per capita payment continued until last year, when the financial partnership between the Commonwealth and States was terminated by its withdrawal in what I believed to be an abrupt, unfair, and unfriendly manner. I voted against the proposal for the withdrawal of the per capita payments. a completely new set of proposals submitted to us for approval. have not been discussed previously outside the conferences, at which the representatives of the Commonwealth and the States came to the agreement which' is embodied in this bill. To the definite financial partnership thus entered into there is no alternative before this House or the country; we have before us the terms of an actual agreement between the Commonwealth and the States to govern their future relations for a period of 58 years, and we must deal with them on their merits. On the previous occasion I fought for a different arrangement, the 'maintenance of the 25s. per capita payments, but because I cannot get that, I am going to reject everything else that is put before me. logical attitude for any honourable member to adopt. cide what is the best arrangement obtainable in the light of existing circumstances. I suppose I have not been the least vociferous of those who, in the chamber and in the country, have inveighed against the alarming growth of the public debt, and in so far as this agreement is, I believe, an honest attempt to arrest that unhealthy growth and provide machinery for the control, and I hope, drastic curtailment of future borrowing, I wholeheartedly support it. It is, perhaps, worthwhile to remind honourable members that the previous proposals made by the Government were the discontinuance of the per capita payments, and the complete evacuation by the Commonwealth of the whole field of land taxation, amusement taxation, and probate duties, and the surrendering of 40 per cent, of the field of income taxation. Those proposals did not find favour with the country, the press, or the House, and I believe that the Government was helped materially by the op=position to them in framing its new proposals. In saying that, I do not deny to the Prime Minister and his colleagues credit for the much more statesmanlike view of the financial relationship of Commonwealth and States that is represented by this agreement, which provides for the taking over, consolidation and extinction of the State Now we have debts by the Commonwealth. The federal authority becomes sponsor for the They whole of Australia's debt, and the States enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth . for its liquidation. A sinking fund of 7s. 6d. per cent. -2s . 6d. to be paid by the Commonwealth and 5s. by the States-is to be established, and it will extinguish the existing State debts in 58 years. Future borrowings, are to be managed and controlled by the Australian Loan Oouncil, which will be representative of the Commonwealth and the States, and'will determine the annual loan programme. There is to be established' a loan redemption fund of 10s. per cent. for all future borrowing, to which the Commonwealth is to subscribe 5s. and the States 53. In addition, the Commonwealth is to pay to the States annually That would not be a for 58 years £7,584,912. That sum is not to be paid into the general revenues We have to deof the States to be spent by them as they think fit, but is to be applied by tb.f Commonwealth on their behalf to the payment of the States' annual interest bill. Australia has at last evolved machinery for the liquidation of its existing debts, and for the control of all future borrowing. As the Commonwealth has a sinking fund in connection with its own loans, and has",24,Bbtjce
47,Mr Rodgers (Wannon) [4.0],"Th eassumed an obligation of 10s. per cent, in regard to its loan redemption fund, the Australian and overseas creditors will have a definite assurance of the automatic liquidation of all existing debts in 58 .years, and the amortisation of new debts by regular contributions in 53 years. That, however, is not a sufficient assurance to the Australian people that the borrowing mania is not to continue, and I regret that the agreement does not include a provision that the interest and sinking fund payments on new borrowings in any year shall not exceed the contributions in respect of interest ana sinking fund for that particular year. Such a provision would afford relief to those of us who view with alarm the rate at which the public debt is increasing. In the respective governments. A fair com1914 the Commonwealth had practically no debt; it owed £19,182,000, which represented transferred properties, and temporary borrowings from some of its own funds. On the 30th June, 1927, the Commonwealth debt was £366,611,000, of whicli £139,474,000 is redeemable in Australia and £227,137,000 is redeemable overseas, or an increase of £347,429,000 since 1914.. The aggregate debt of the States on the 30th June, 1914, was £320,255,000, and by the 30th June last it had increased to £677,121,000, of which £303,510,000 is redeemable in Australia and £373,611,000 is redeemable overseas. This accounts for an increase in State debts of £356,866,000 since 1914. The total debt of the Commonwealth and the States on the 30th June last was £1,062,914,000, the aggregate increase since 1914 having been £704,295,000. Of course, the-Commonwealth debt was swollen suddenly and abnormally by war expenditure; but, although the States had no such extraordinary obligations to meet, their debts more than doubled in thirteen years, whilst the average rate of interest increased from £3 12s. 6d. on 30th June, 1914, to £4 18s. 2d. on 30th June, 1927'. The average Commonwealth rate of interest on the 30th June last was £5 2s. l i d . per cent. If those figures are not will apply to the . people for consufficient to alarm Australians and their creditors overseas, I do not know what will arouse them to a sense of our dangerous drift. I do not desire to depreciate the credit of Australia; but we shall not enhance it by hidingour heads in the sand and persuading ourselves that all is right and comfortable. The Prime Minister very ably championed Australian credit when it was attacked in London; but even he could not compare with pride the net quotations for Australian, New Zealand, and South African stock on the London market. On the 29th February last Commonwealth 5 per cent, stock, maturing in 1945-75, was quoted at £98 15s.; New Zealand5 per cent, stock, maturing in 1946, at £101 15s. and South African stock, maturing in 1945-75, at £102. This difference, varying from £3 per centum in favour of New Zealand and £3 5s. in SouthAfrica, is equivalent to 3s. per cent, per annum in the effective rate of interest payable by parison is that of Commonwealth and New Zealand loans floated at approximately the same time. On the 24th April, 1927, the Commonwealth borrowed £11,700,000 at 5 per cent., and the loan was floated at £98. New Zealand borrowed £6,000,000 on the 3rd May following at 5 per cent., and the loan realized £99 10s. No Australian can find cause for pride or satisfaction in such figures. the difference? to be that we have increased our public debt at too fast a rate, and one effect has been to cause inflation within Australia and to set up false economic standards. It is a well-known economic fact that, when money is plentiful, values rise to absorb it. Both the Commonwealth and the States have made available too much loan money. The worse supervised expenditure is that of borrowed money, especially money borrowed by one governing authority and handed to another governing authority to be expended. The proposal to seek from this House the ratification of the agreement made with the States is a step in the right direction so far as the public debt of Australia is concerned. The agreement in turn promises the States that the Commonwealth stitutional power to enter into such an arrangement.

49,Mr Rodgers,"I believe the reasonStates to be correct. They show clearly that for at least eighteen years the States to block any alteration in the agreewill under the agreement receive greater benefits than they would, have received under the per capita grant. I therefore urge the States and the people of Australia to accept the agreement. If it is found at the end of eighteen or twenty years that the agreement is not satisfactory to the States they can then approach the Commonwealth with a view to substituting a better arrangement. The fact that this agreement is for 58 years does not prevent the contracting parties from varying, modifying, or even rescinding it ; definite provision is made in the agreement for such alteration by mutual consent. has no power to make this agreement with the States. House accepts the proposals, the obligation will be placed upon the Government of bringing down legislation to this chamber to enable it to submit the agreement to the people for ratification. The Commonwealth asks that it shall be given power to make this agreement, which contains a clause enabling the contracting parties to vary it, or to rescind it. stitutional authorities to-day believe that spirit in which federation took place. that power does not now reside in the Commonwealth. This Parliament unquestionably had power to withdraw the per capita payments, and to substitute an alternative scheme; but it has not the power to enter into this agreement, which involves the control of future States' borrowing and the creation of an Australian Loan Council to manage it and is of course a great experiment in responsible government. I know of no other instance in which parties with self governing irights have agreed to surrender them to a central loan authority. It is a great experiment and one which we shall watch carefully; but in so far as it will arrest the alarming rate of increase in the national debt I support it, and hope that it will have the effect that of the per capita payments.. Still, I have its sponsors claim for it. There are many. aspects of this agreement, and if I find that at the end of twenty years the States are, by a process of financial strangulation, having their powers weakened, I shall join with those who seek to protect them. Mr Rodgers. . ment. variation of the agreement can be made except with the mutual consent of the parties. I am not a unificationist. I believe Australia to be the least fitted country in the world for unification. At the beginning, the* founders of federation estimated that a revenue of £300,000 would suffice for Commonwealth needs. To-day the Federal expenditure has grown to £75,000,000. It is therefore evident that we can overload the central authority to the detriment of the development of the country. The mainTo-day the Commonwealth tenance of the financial standing of the self-governing States is essential to the If the preservation of federation, and I should be the last to vote for anything on the lines of unification. To those who still claim to fight for the per capita paymentsI say, "" How are you going to restore that system, seeing that it has gone?"",.

The honourable' member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) when speaking during this debate raised the same point, but I contend that by discussing the agreement we may be able to create a public conscience. For my views I am responsible only to my There are two phases of this agreement. One is the action of the Governmentfor which I wholeheartedly commend itin dealing with the public debt of Australia, for the first time in our history, since the days of Crown colonies and the granting of the right of self-government. This is the first time that we have had legislation introduced into this chamber to consolidate and deal with Australia's public debt. That action has been welcomed by British commentators, lt is certainly a step in the right direction, and should meet with tbe unanimous approval of the people of Australia. The Commonwealth has another obligation to the States. lived through 27 years of federation, this is the first time we have f aCed that obligahave accrued under the per capita paytion. take over State debts to thevalue of £11,000,000 to fulfil its obligations with regard to transferred properties, and to increase the interest rate from 3£ per cent, to 5 per cent. That is only just to the States, since they have been paying a much higher rate of interest than 3i per cent. ment to take over, consolidate, and extinguish State debts is a step in the right direction, and it transcends any other financial consideration at the present time. It will greatly increase the financial credit of the nation, and is only doing justice to the States, which showed a fine spirit in meeting the difficulties of federation at the early stages. I believe that over the whole period of the agreement the benefits to the States from the annual payment will not be equal to what they would have received in per capita payments; but I foresee the same opportunity after, say, eighteen or twenty years for the States to approach the Commonwealth as exists to-day. The Commonwealth withdrew the per capita payments and then consulted the States about its financial relations with them. The termination of that agreement was abrupt, unjust, and unfriendly. The Commonwealth certainly had the right to terminate it , and nobody can deny that this Government has made a splendid agreement with the States for the liquidation of Australia's indebtedness and for the future borrowing policy. When the Government withdrew the per capita constituents. payments it was left with a free hand to negotiate with the States. The Prime Minister promised to do the fair thing by the States. I am one of those who did not favour the withdrawal of the per capita payments, but in so far as the past and future obligations of Australia are concerned, an agreement has now been entered into such as was contemplated by the founders of the Constitution, and I shall advise the people of Australia to accept it. When the referendum is being taken I shall tell my constituents that I believe the agreement to be in the interests of Australia, and that they should accept it. I take that stand because the figures supplied by Mr Wickens show that for Although we have eighteen years benefits will accrue to the States in excess of those which would The Commonwealth proposes to ments. If at the end of eighteen years the financial position of the States has been weakened, they can approach the Commonwealth with a view to bringing about an alteration of the agreement.

Suppose the imports of this country ceased, where would then be our custom's revenue. By what means, in such a case, would the money promised to the States be provided ? I pay no heed to the statement that it is not good for one authority to collect money for another to spend. Even when the present agreement is put into opera'fion, that process will continue. The taxes are contributed by the whole of the people, and no matterwhether the money is spent by the federal authorities or by the States, both are responsible to the people for the manner' of its expenditure. Should the agreement prove to be unsatisfactory, it will remain for this Parliament to make it workable and equitable; otherwise a Parliament will come into, being, by the will of the people, that will do so. I was considerably influenced by the remarks of the Attorney-General( Mr Latham), who Mr Prowse. declared that the States would still have the deciding voice in this matter. Ultimately the people would determine it at the referendum. I feel greater responsibility in regard to this bill than to any other that I have had to consider.

The House would find itself in an absurd situation. If we make Honourable members will recollect that the States Grants Act passed last year provided for an agreement between the States and the Commonwealth to supersede the payments being provided under that act. That agreement has been made, and it is much more advantageous to the States in its terms than was the""percapita arrangement that it superseded. Every State Government gets certain definite relief to its budget as the result of that agreement, and each State Government has based its budget for the present year upon that extra relief. Take the State of Victoria. The Premier, Mr Hogan, pointed out that, in his State, the relief would amount to some £553,000 ""as the result of the operation of the agreement during the current year. Consequently, having practically instructed the Commonwealth Government to make an agreement with the States for the purpose of superseding the States Grants Act, and the whole of the budget arrangements of the States having been based upon that agreement, if we, as a parliament, in the ninth month of the financial year, should attempt to cut",28,Bbtjce

It is abetween governmental borrowing agencies; finally it provides a plan for the enhancement of the national credit of Australia, and enables the control of borrowing and credit to be retained in Australia instead of being at the whim of outside people, as it was when we were fighting for money in a suicidal way amongst ourselves. These proposals are not in any sense new. They merely translate into practical terms the dreams both of pre-federation and post-federation statesmen. every discussion on finance from the early days of federation down to the present time, the subject uppermost in the minds of all was the determination of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, together with the better management of the public debt. In proof of t h is . it is only neceswar. In 1914, immediately before the sary to read the speeches of such men as SirI l e n r y Parkes, Sir Samuel Griffiths, and Sir George Turner. Mr Kidston, who was at that time Premier of Queensland, pointed out in 1904 that the provision of the "" financial security of the States, the transfer of the State debts to common management of borrowing was necessary to the consummation of federation. This is exactly what the agreement proposes to bring about. The honourable member for Y a r r a said that he had been for many years enamoured of such a project as this. There is no doubt that Mr Eisher recognized the i m portance of such a scheme, and Mr ""Watt, speaking to this House on the States GrantsB ill a few months ago, saidI t would be futile to provide a sinking fund unless definite control was exercised over the whole of the national borrowing, both Federal and. State. ThereI join issue with lett). If the section of our Constitution which relates to the transfer of debts were real instead of being merely a fiction, the Commonwealth could assume control of State debts. If, as they fell due, a loan council, constituted by the authority of the Commonwealth, assumed control of all loans as they fell due and was responsible for their conversion, and gradually established either interminable or terminable Commonwealth consols, no individual State could approach the London market for money unless it was prepared to pay ruinous rates of interest for it. There would be an automatic refusal of loan money to the States once the Commonwealth had assumed control Dr. Earle Page. boldly put forward such a proposal at a Constitutional session and later at a referendum, it would have the support of the best thought in this country, oven in defiance of State authorities, because the more intelligent people in Australia are becoming alarmed at the tremendous borrowing tliat is being indulged in, and the mountain of debt that is piling up until it threatens to obscure the sky. In this agreement we have a proposal brought down, not in defiance of the State authorities, but with their f u l l concurrence. Nevertheless, we .are asked to wait for someIn thing more to be done. Already four State Parliaments have ratified the agreement, and six State Premiers have signed it . This agreement has been arrived at after many conferences. The subject was discussed every two or three years at conferences held during the' first period of federation-that prior to the war, at a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, Sir John Forrest brought forward a definite proposal to take over the public debts of the States. He said thatThe Commonwealth should take over the public debts of the States. The net profits the Commonwealth, and arising from all conversions, renewals or consolidation would be credited to the State concerned, and the annual payment of the State reduced accordingly from time to time. tt was not proposed to interfere in any way with the borrowing powers of the States. The Commonwealth would raise loans for the States if desired, provided it was satisfied that proper provision had been made for the interest and sinking fund on the loan. Tlie taking over would not relieve the States of any obligation to pay the principal or interest of the debts taken over, but it was believed that Commonwealth management would result in large economies. The States would be responsible for the payment .of both interest and principal to the Commonwealth. A sinking fund of \ per cent, would be established under the control of the Chief Justice of the High Court, President of the Senate, and Speaker of the House of Representatives as trustees for tlie time being. That conference dealt with these proposals similar to those in this agreement, and generally approved of them; but submitted the matter to a conference of the Commonwealth and State Treasurers for further consideration. That conference, held on the 13th of March, 1914, went into the matter very f u l l y , and resolved thatNo scheme of debt transfer would be satisIf the Commonwealth factory whicli did not cover the operations",30,Bbtjce

The conference, therefore, recommended the matter to the consideration of the Federal and State Governments, with a view to further conference. Wow, for the first time in the history of Australia, we have been able to reconcile the divergent views of the States which, in 1914, were incapable of arriving at an agreement. Notwithstanding that, the Leader of the Opposition says that we should delay still further so that this golden opportunity may be lost. When this Government came into office in 1923, it set itself to bring about the establishment of a sinking fund, the co-ordination of borrowing, the formation of a Loan Council, and the improvement of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and States. In 1923 it was able to create a sinking fund for all Commonwealth debts and future State debts, and, in 1924, it brought into being a Loan Council on a voluntary basis. It brought about certain other forms of co-operation, such as the amalgamation of the. taxcollecting authorities. vernment that did it, as an executive act. The present proposals for doing that which various governments have sought a means of effecting during the whole 28 years of federation, will be tried out for two years, and then put to the people for their ratification.

But can consider. Our debt amounts, at the the real test is the market, rates for compresent time, to £1,040,000,000. annual interest bill is £53,000,000 a year, which is practically three-quarters of our total revenue from taxation. If Zealand and it were possible to convert all our debts, we should be able to save 3s. per cent, in our interest, whicn would effect a saving of £1,500,000 a year in interest alone on existing debts. If we go on borrowing at the same rate as at present, and are able to effect the saving of which I have spoken, we should be able, at the end of 58 years, to save no less a sum than £3,500,000 a year. No one can doubt the wisdom of devising a scheme for the better management of our public debt. That is borne out by a comparison with Canada, which occupies a so much better position than ourselves on the American market. In spite of what has been said in this House by certain honourable members, the credit of the Commonwealth at the present time is better than that of the various States. The honourable member for Perth tried to show that our credit was worse than that of the States generally, because the average interest on Commonwealth debts . was greater than that paid by his State, but he omitted to point out that many of the State loans were floated prior to the war, at a very low rate of interest.

I have quoted those comments for the reason t h a t they were made by recognized authoritie s outside of A u s t r a l i a . They are unbiased, and because of t h a t deserve v e r y close a t t e n t i o n . In the l i g h t of such opinions we ought not h as t i l y to condemn t h is scheme. It is h i g h l y desirable in the interests of A u s t r a l i a t h a t we should do e v e r y t h in g in our power to enhance our credit . An e x a m in a t i on of financial r e t u r ns made characterisl as t . m o n t h in d i c a t e d t h a t comparable statesmanlike and courageous, and Australian stocks were considerably less favoured on the market than New Zealand and South African stocks. New Zealand, which covers an area of only about one-third that of New South Wales, had its stock quoted on the London market at £3 per cent, better than ours, and South Africa, which is not as large as Queensland, had its stock quoted at £3 5s. per cent, better than comparable Australian stocks. It cannot be denied that in -urcumstances such as these, New Zealand and South Africa are both in a better position than Australia to undertake developmental work. If we could obtain money at the same rates as those dominions obtain theirs, we should be able to undertake considerably more public work than is possible at present and not add to our interest bill. It is desirable therefore that we should take every step that we can to place Australia in this favourable position. The first step towards that goal is the elimination of competition between the various borrowing authorities in Australia. That is provided for in this agreement. We must, if we are to make any progress, co-ordinate our borrowing and general financial arrangements. It has been demonstrated that this can be done through the Loan Council, notwithstanding that it has been under tbe disadvantage for two years out of the four in which it has been operating of having New South Wales as an outside competitor. This has forced us to pay higher interest rates. We shall also help to improve our financial position by setting up properly safeguarded sinking funds as provided for in the agreement. The only satisfactory way of doing so is to make provision for it in the Constitution. It is true that, if the sovereign rights of the States even a constitutional amendment such as that which is now suggested could be altered if the States and Commonwealth Governments were unanimous; but all the Governments in Australia would hardly be likely to flout public opinion by altering it without ascertaining by a referendum the mind of the people. It should not be overlooked that any economy that we can effect in our public finances will be reflected in private and commercial financial circles, for the rate of interest charged for money borrowed privately is largely governed by the rate [148] at which Government securities are available. It is recognized that Government securities are the best investment open to the community. It is for this reason.that other than public borrowers always have to pay something more for the monev they secure than the Government pays for the money it obtains. If Government rates are high private rates arp invariably higher. This adds to the cost of production and handicaps us in our competition with other countries. On the other hand, if we can reduce our interest rates, our whole financial structure will benefit. We may expect, there for., that 1 if the people approve of this proposed alteration of the Constitution, the benefit of the new arrangement will be felt throughout the Commonwealth. It is true that there are difficulties in the way of giving full effect to this agreement. The members of the Loan Council would be very glad if this Parliament would give its attention to them. One of the greatest obstacles in formulating this plan was the question of restricting the sovereignty of the Commonwealth and the States. It was felt for a long time that to bring into operation any scheme for the joint management of public borrowing would necessarily restrict the sovereign rights of the States. It was upon that rock that all negotiation hitherto entered' upon had foundered. This is the first time that any possible satisfactory solution of the difficulties associated with this matter has been reached, and I submit that only the Operations and experience of the Loan Council have made possible the. discovery of this solution. I wish to point out, however, that even are in a measure limited by the provisions of this agreement,' so. are those of the Commonwealth. It is unavoidable that there should be a certain amount of restriction on all the parties to an agreement of this description, but restriction falls upon the Commonwealth equally with the States. The parties which have been represented on the voluntary Loan Council hitherto have found that the restrictions are not nearly so serious as some people thought that they would be, and that the mutual compromise which has so far resulted from its activities has not had the irksome effect which it was alleged that it would have. In fact, the parties are so satisfied with their experience over the last four years that they are quite willing to make the Loan Council a permanent body. It has been suggested that the Commonwealth Government would dominate the Loan Council and the States, but this is not a fact. It is true that under this agreement the Commonwealth will have two votes, and a casting vote if there is an equal number of votes on each side; but it would be necessary for at least two States to vote with the Commonwealth in order to ensure that its view should prevail. It is quite reasonable that if the Commonwealth and, say, New South Wales and Victoria, in which States the greater proportion of our population resides, should agree on any financial plans that are submitted their views should be seriously considered. are unanimously opposed to any Commonwealth proposal, or if even five of them are against it, the Commonwealth will be defeated. I submit, therefore, that the possibility of the view of the States being overridden by that of the Commonwealth is negligible. Only those who have had actual experience of the work of the Loan Council can realize that the problems that come before it. are discussed from the point of view of mutual help, and that there is no attempt by one party or State to obtain an advantage at the expense of another. In times of difficult finance the Loan Council never ultimately determines the amount that shall be borrowed. That depends in the last analysis upon the state of the money market. If money is scarce and the rate of interest high, then it is apparent that the council must borrow lightly and not heavily. More than this, however, the allocation of the borrowed money is not left to the arbitrary decision of the council. Under the provisions of this agreement, the money available will be divided on a definite basis. Assuming' that insufficient money is obtainable to meet the requirements of all the parties, and that the council is not able to reach a unanimous decision as to the allocation of its funds, it is provided that the Commonwealth shall be granted one-fifth of the Dr. Earle Page. total and each State an amount to be determined on the basis of its borrowing during the preceding five years. This is definitely fixed in the agreement. No pressure can be exerted, therefore, to oblige one State to take a position unfavorable to it in comparison with the other States. It must be quite clear that if a particular State has large public works in hand for which it has been borrowing -heavily over a period of years, it cannot be expected at a moment's notice to abandon its programme. To do so would probably cause a heavy loss on the amount already expended, and also serious unemployment. I suggest, therefore, that the automatic arrangement set out in the agreement is reasonable, safe and satisfactory. The restrictions which are imposed upon the parties to the agreement are no greater than those which common decency and ordinary practice make necessary. If the States The procedure of the Loan Council is rendered automatic in those cases where there is any chance of a State being dominated. The money market imposes just as rigid restrictions as any that will operate under the Loan Council. Tbat is, in essence,, the position that the Government wishes discussed. The Government wishes to see if there are any loopholes in the proposed arrangement that need closing up. It invites suggestions which would make it easier for the Loan Council to operate in its management.of State: debts and borrowing. Instead of that, the criticism of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) is merely directed against the time when this agreement should be brought into effect. I shall examine the credentials presented by the honourable member. It cannot be claimed that, in his attitude towards the agreement he represents any of the great parties of the Commonwealth, because behind the agreement are ranged the men of all parties in executive governmental positions throughout the Commonwealth. Four Labour Premiers and two non-Labour Premiers admit that this is not a party matter, and state that they stand behind the pro-' posals because they believe that they are for the benefit of Australia at large. The Leader of the Opposition cannot claim that he is the representative of the States, because the State leaders declare that they are in favour of the scheme. Mr difficulty, or to embarrass them in any way, McCormack, the Premier of Queensland, said on the 14th December lastThere are many advantages in the agreement. the question of the control of borrowing, and this is a very fine step in that direction. As mentioned in the constitution, sooneror later the Commonwealth would have had to consider the taking over of the States debts, and that is accomplished under the agreement. -Sinking fund payments are provided for, in which the Commonwealth and States w ill participate. The gains to the Commonwealth as a whole wall be the anore effective control of borrowing; tlie more effective and searching investigations of the borrowing programmes of the different States and of the Commonwealth itself; the regulation of borrowing on the market; no competition between the several constituent States of the Commonwealth on the overseas markets; a definite rate of interest; and definite sinking fund payments on all loans floated by the States or the Commonwealth. our credit on the overseas market. This competition between the States was a bad tiling for the borrower, though a good thing for the lender. 3Jew South Wales Government have been selling bonds over the counter at 5$ per cent. It is very difficult for any other State to get money at 5 per cent, when one State is giving -oi per cent. To a limited extent, the Loan Council has removed many of those disabilities; . and that council, when constituted legally and operating under the Constitution -of the Commonwealth, should he able -to do much to help Australia to control her borrowing, and improve her credit abroad. Mr Butler, the Premier of South Australia, saidThe establishment of a Loan Council, in .principle, is the best thing that ever happened to Austi'alia. to delay matters? The Commonwealth Government has given a lead to the State Premiers in conference, and they support the suggested agreement. An Honorable MEMBER -Ho w many -States have ratified the agreement ? State Parliaments have ratified it. Mr between the Federal and State governHogan, -the Premier of Victoria, said' The States' position under the agreement will be better than that under the per capita payments system. . . . payment'has been abolished by the act passed by the Commonwealth last March, the proposed alternative, which is embodied in the present agreement, is one which I commend to members of this House. I am satisfied that under this agreement, the Commonwealth has no desire to involve iihe Statesi n any financial hut is prepared to treat them with absolute equity. Those quotations indicate that the States Sooner or later, Australia had to face appreciate that they will receive a substantial advantage under the agreement. The Leader of the Opposition very clearly stated his position. At page 3625, of Hansard for the 7th March, he is reported as saying that the Government is giving too much away. The honourable member indicated that certain sums were necessary for social schemes which he enumerated, and he said that if this agreement was carried out the Commonwealth would not be able to proceed with those schemes. He said that this would save State expenditure. That expenditure was The agreement should stabilize merely contemplated expenditure, aud would be made only if certain schemes which the honourable member During the last few months the had in miaul were brought into being. The Leader of the Opposition is prepared to approve of the scheme if , first of all, there is a remodelling of the Constitution, practically amounting to unification. He declared that this agreement will prevent unification. There is a great deal in that contention. Opinions received -from London and New York claim that this agreement establishes the principle of federation. Several honourable members on this side, however, opposed the agreement because they feared that it will bring about unification. It cannot do both things. It .really is one of the means whereby the federal union will be made complete. The Commonwealth attitude is, first of all, to honour the agreement arrived at in conference between the Commonwealth and the States. If we waited for the report of the Constitutional Commission before proceeding with the agreement, the delay would disorganize every State budget throughout the Commonwealth. Conferences have been held ments which were practically replicas of the meetings of the finance committee of the Federal Convention, and the legal As the per capita and financial officers of the States and Commonwealth have, for the first time since'the matter was mooted in the early discussions on federation, been able to determine upon the definite and satisfactory basis contained in the agreement.",32,Bbtjce

69,Dr. Earle Page,"Already fourIu addition to those conferences, a tremendous amount of other work has been done to make the agreement as comprehensive and satisfactory as possible. Some honourable members now ask that all that work should be thrown on the scrap-heap, merely to delay matters. It has been suggested that there has been a deviation from principle by this Government. 'Honourable members must recognize the very definite way in which the Commonwealth' Government has acted, since on its formation it formulated definite schemes of Commonwealth and State financial co-operation. 1923 Premiers' Conference it proposed to raise a sinking fund, both Commonwealth and State, but the'States would not agree, contending that any sinking fund would have to operate on the future debts only, otherwise it would be too costly. The Commonwealth Government also suggested the formation of .a loan council, and has since collected sinking fund contribiitions for all the loans that it has raised for the States. If the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) were here, he could tell honourable members that in 1926 I showed him figures which had been prepared specifying the exact effect of the scheme for taking over the whole of the debts from each State. In a speech made by me at Benalla in 1926, also in one by the Prime Minister in Parliament last year, it was stated that we were examining every avenue, of settlement, including those dealing with sinking funds and the common management of borrowing. Nothing has been done to contravene these principles. Commonwealth Government have always been directed to bring about a satisfactory and comprehensive scheme, and that is what is embodied in the agreement now before the House. agreement gives very definite advantages to the States. The Leader of the Opposition quoted figures showing that for eighteen or twenty years the States would be better off under the new agreement than under the past system of uniform per capita payments. Government cannot be accused of doing something prejudicial to the interests of the States. If every scheme that has been brought forward were examined Dr. Earle Page. it would be seen that they would benefit various State budgets by at least from £50,000 to £100,000 annually. monwealth Government obtain the money ' to do all this? tax the people of Australia for this definite purpose of improving the credit of Australia. The Commonwealth Government has a definite scheme in mind, and is able to show how the money will be wisely used. This GovernAt the ment has always been prepared to raise money for the State governments provided that the spending of that money is a matter of mutual arrangement be-, tween the Commonwealth and State Governments. That was done in connection, with the Roads Agreement many years ago. Mr Andrew Fisher said that he was quite prepared to give sums-in one case amounting to £5,000,000 for all time, and in another to £7,500,000-to the States provided that the money, was used for the payment of interest on debts. He merely asked that it should be definitely allocated. That is' the only way in which we can exhibit a months before, proper responsibility to our taxpaytuo and our constituents. Under the proposed scheme the States will have a definite financial advantage for eighteen to twenty years, and for no less than 58 years they will have security in connection with their taxation proposals. In 1923, when the matter of the Commonwealth evacuating the field of taxation was being debated, Sir William McPherson, then Treasurer of Victoria, said that such a scheme would The efforts of the give his State an opportunity to arrange its taxation on a sound basis; that for ten years the Commonwealth would go out of the field of income taxation, thereby enabling each State to deal with every The proposed branch of taxation, co-relate it, and so inaugurate an equitable system. This agreement will enable the States during the next 58 years to arrange their taxation upon definite, systematic, and comprehensive lines. At the end of that term the sinking fund to which the ComIf that is so, this monwealth will contribute one-third, will have extinguished the present State debts, and the. States will be free of a liability which now amounts to approximately £23,000,000 per annum. The argument",36,Bbtjce

71,Dr. Earle Page,"It is prepared tolias been used.that-instead of this agreement the' Commonwealth should have continued the per capita payments to the States. It is impossible to revert to the uniform per capita system because four of the six States have expressed themselves as definitely opposed to it. able member mean by uniform? uniform rate per head. On this subject, Commonwealth is paying to the States is saidA State witli a large and an increasing population, because of the establishment of secondary industries in the favoured centres of population, would receive increasing payments out of all proportion to those received by a primary producing State, and would to that extent give to the wealthier States the greater proportion of the customs revenue. That is the most vulnerable point in regard to the continuance of the per capita payments. No doubt that State would pay the revenue, because the customs revenue is collected from ' the people individually, who buy these goods in the markets of the States; but where a Commonwealth is founded for mutual protection to all the interests embraced within that Commonwealth, it would be a much wiser policy to adopt some system that would at least help the weaker States or the States that were not so favourably situated for the establishment of secondary industries. Consequently, we get to the point where we have to view this loss by tlie larger States from the broader or wider Australian point of view, and from that viewpoint the agreement has advantages over the present system. Some two or three years ago, the Tasmanian Government prepared an official statement of the State's disabilities, and in that document, as well as in the columns of the Tasmanian newspapers, the inequity of a uniform system of per capita payments was stressed. ments were never supposed to bear any relation to the necessities of any State. payments have been upon a uniform basis, and four of the six States have -'pointed out that unjust. Tasmania suggested that the per capita payments could be continued only on a basis of 25s. for New South Wales and Victoria, 30s. for Queensland and South Australia, 40s. for Western Australia, and 50s. for Tasmania. The Premier of South Australia said that the amount of £7,584,912 which the Commonwealth is to pay to the States each year, should be apportioned, not on the per capita basis, but on the basis of the debt per head. In this distribution it was decided to adhere meet the claims of the smaller States, the per head of the population, and it works out in this way:Receivable On under Population Agreement basis £ £ New South Wales .. 320.000 345,000 Victoria 199,000 251,000 Queensland .. 133,000 132,000 South Australia . . .. 113,000 84,000 Western Australia .. 91,000 57,000 Tasmania. .. 37,000 30,000 It will be seen how four of the States definitely benefit by an arrangement which departs from the uniform per capita basis. It is remarkable that in this House the representatives, of the States which will benefit more by the arrangement contained iu this agreement than they would have done had the per capita payments continued, should be the most vociferous in their opposition to the bill. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) made some startling statements in opposition to the agreement, and, comparing its results with what he estimated the States would receive if the per capita payments continued, he said that in 58 years it would deprive the States of £383,000,000. Yet r in June, 1926, the honourable member proposed an amendment to the States Grants Bill to provide that the total payments to the States should be on the basis equivalent to the per capita payment for that year and should not increase. That he said would be an honourable substitute for the per capita payments: Now that is an arrangement by which the States will receive £900,000 in excess of what he then Said was an honourable compensation is deno'uhced by him, and he makes imputations against the capacity of the State 'Premiers who",37,Bbtjce

The Government has stated emphatically, from time to time, that it must get rid of the. per capita system; that such payments are improper and unjust. At the time the States Grants Bill was before the House last year, the Government intimated quite clearly that it would have nothing more to do with the per capita system. Nevertheless, we find that the system of per capita payment has been incorporated in this agreement for a period of 58 years. The payments of the Commonwealth Government towards the liquidation of the State debts are to be made on a population basis. What, then, becomes of the Government's objection to the per capita system? Another objection raised by the Treasurer was that it was improper and unfair for one authority to raise money for another authority to spend: Under this agreement, however, the Federal Government will raise money to pay interest, up to a certain amount, on the debts of the States. If the Commonwealth Government pays the interest on State debts, it is obvious that the State Governments will have a corresponding amount of money to spend as they think fit, which is essentially the same as if the Commonwealth had handed them that money to spend. Further examples are provided by the roads grant and the Housing Act, under which the States are to spend money provided by the Commonwealth. It is .clear then that the Federal Government has already departed in many directions from its avowed principle. A big effort is being made to increase migration, not for the Our purpose of further inflating the cities, but in order to put more people on the land. In Western Australia, in Queensland, and in South Australia an endeavour is being made to put a large number of settlers on the land. Under the Group Settlement Scheme 10,000 people have already been brought to Western Australia. A scheme has been suggested for the co-operation of the State and Commonwealth. Government in opening up that huge area of wheat-growing land in Western Australia. This will cost money, and the interest on the money expended will have t» be found by the State Government. The Commonwealth Government has asked the strengthen our defence, and to increase the production of wealth. The States are spending millions of pounds on developmental works for the absorption of immigrants, and the States'will have to find the interest on that money. the assets that are created. rive little benefit from those assets for a long time. The people whom we"" are putting on the land now will not pay any income tax for years. In the meantime, the State Government will have to build roads, erect schools, provide medical assistance, and contribute to charities. The State will have to provide everything without any prospect of a return for perhaps another twenty years. The Commonwealth Government, however, will benefit almost immediately from the arrival of the immigrants. High duties have been placed on practically everything they will use. There is a duty on rails, which must be.used to build developmental railways, and a tax has been placed on every bit of wire netting which will be used. It is difficult to get wire netting even from Great Britain without a dumping duty being placed on it. Every additional person coming into Australia tends to increase the revenue of the Federal Government. It should be possible, with proper administration, to increase the population of Australia to 15,000,000 or 20,000,000 people.

A fte r that the Prime Minister took a hand, and secured the agreement of the State representatives to the present proposals. These proposals are excellent, with one exception. not to get any portion whatever of the customs and excise revenue, no matter how that revenue may increase. honourable members made up their minds to accept that proposition? That is what we have to consider. tution was drawn up it was proposed that three-quarters of the customs revenue should be distributed in the form of per capita payments to the States. I am suggesting that one-fourth only should be so distributed. Does any honourable member contend that that is unfair, or that the States have no right to share in any of the customs revenues raised by the Commonwealth Government. In my own State great developmental works arc being carried out in the south-west, and large numbers of people w ill eventually be settled there. as big as the whole of Victoria.

This is a splendid agreement from many points of view, particularly in connection with borrowing and the provision of sinking funds, but I cannot agree to the abolition of the per capita payment. The action of the Federal Government might be justifiable if it had been able to show that its revenue was not sufficient to continue this payment, but it was not able to do so. took office the revenue of the Commonwealth was £62,000,000. The honourable member is discussing the general principles of the bill. whether the States should receive any share of the customs revenue, and I am within my rights in pointing out make the excuse that it was compelled for financial reasons to abandon the per capita payment system. The federal revenue was £62,000,000 for the year before the Treasurer assumed office. It was £64,000,000 in the following year, and it has grown steadily, u n t i l last year it was £7S,000,000.

I do not think the customs revenue is likely to fall below £40,000,000. Let me make it quite clear that this is the only alterathat this agreement has been formulated tion that I suggest in the agreement. likely to forget the fight of the honor' able member for Swan( Mr Gregory) some little .time ago for the view which he represents. We all honour him for his persistence in maintaining his own point of view. Prior to the dinner adjournment, the honourable member intimated that there was a "" catch "" in his amendment. . I have been waiting for him to disclose it, but he has not done so; consequently we must look for it ourselves. Prior to doing so I wish to draw atteh. tion to one or two .defects in the honourable member's argument. He said that the States had heavy commitments, the full effect of which no one could foresee. That is perfectly true. But the gentlemen who participated ih the conferences which led to the formulation of this agreement were not ignorant of those commitments. In fact, they were equipped with all .the knowledge needed to estimate them, so far as it was within human poAver to do so. It appears to me that after considering all the facts of the case they came to the conclusion it was better to have a definite rather than an indefinite income, to enable them to meet their commitments. It is impossible for us, or any one else, to estimate the variations that may occur .in our customs and excise revenue, or in our population-thoug h we all believe that this will increase-o r in the distribution of the population over the various States. No doubt the experts who considered this agreement took all those matters into consideration. we had spiked their gUns. matter until doomsday,and still differ in opinion upon it. One hundred years hence the historians may conclude that, had the A'ieAv of the honourable member for SAvan been accepted, it Avould have been for the welfare of the nation; but, on the other hand, they may determine that the country Avould haAe gone r to the dogs had the honourable member's advice been acted on. We do not knoAV. All that Ave can do is to determine the matter in the light of the best information that is available to us. I believe after the most careful consideration of all the pros and cons. I come UOAV to the "" catch"" which the honourable member mentioned. It is simply this: that if we accept the amendment Ave shall reintroduce the basic subject which has been the cause of all the disagreement during the years which have passed. This agreement Avas drafted during my absence from the CommonAvealth. It is possible that if I had remained here some remark of .mine might have changed the Avhole course of events. The point is that I Avas not here, and this is the course that events have taken. I may say this, though: that one of the things that droA'e me away Avas that I had a continual headache from listening to such arguments as have been submitted to us this eAening, and I do not want to r have my health impaired by a repetition of them. This matter has been considered by the most qualified men in the country, and we may take it that the agreement is the best possible reconciliation of tbeir varied views; consequently I trust that Ave shall accept it. The honourable member for SAvan( Mr Gregory) desires to kill the agreement; if that is not his intention, he has overlooked the real effect of his amendment. I cannot agree Avith his contention that his scheme Avill be beneficial to tbe States, either immediately or ultimately. It may happen that our revenue from customs and excise will fall. . below £30,000,000! ceivable that it may.

The agreement can only become effective if the parliaments of the Commonwealth aiid all the States ratify it. No provision is made for any of the parties concerned to alter it.

That purpose would not be accomplished by attempting to modify the agreement by the proposed amendment of the schedule. accomplish the destruction of the old agreement, but I cannot support that, nor do I think that many other honourable members are prepared to do so. surer) [8.31] I do not propose to traverse the ground already covered by Ley) and Dalley( Mr Theodore). The facts are as they were stated by those honourable members. out to the honourable member forSwan( Mr Gregory), who moved this amendment, that the inevitable result of its acceptance, apart from the problem of its practicability would be that the sinking fund provided by the agreement would have to be removed from the bill. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) has already shown the burden that the present agreement will place upon the Commonwealth. Now the honourable member for Swan desires to superimpose an additional burden. It is quite evident that it could not be borne. The State Premiers admit that they are benefiting to the extent of £960j000 more than under the per capita scheme. If the proposed additional burden were added the Commonwealth Government would be unable to carry on the sinking fund payments. The operations of the Loan Council would not then be as successful, nor would Australian credit be as satisfactory, as would be the case if the sinking fund were maintained. Because of that, and because it would emasculate the proposed agreement, I urge the honourable member for Swan not to press his amendment. urge the honourable member for Swan to withdraw the catch, and his amendment. The catch is the apparent restoration of the opportunity to honourable members to vote on the merits or demerits of the 25s. per capita scheme. That scheme cannot be restored without destroying the whole of the proposed agreement The honourable member cannot put us back where we were. The ship which he loves so well, and which I also favoured, is sunk. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are to be congratulated upon entering into the conference with the States from such a. vantage ground. The per capita payAn amendment would ments had been withdrawn, and some other scheme had to be substituted. The honourable member for Swan cannot re. place the ship that has gone, and honourable members will not be caught, as the 25s. per capita arrangement cannot again be voted for without involving the destruction of this agreement. I do not agree with the statements made by the honourable members for Dalley gers).

If we refuse to endorse this agreement it does not necessarily follow that the ship has sunk. It merely means that further conferences between State and Eederal representatives would have to be held to review the position. The States are still in the same state of duress that they were in when they entered into this agreement. Apparently honourable members have short memories. This Parliament repealed the Surplus Revenue Act and forced the States to come to some decision. I give the States credit for having outwitted the Commonwealth and they now have an exceedingly good-agreement. AlthoughI opposed the agreement, I approved of the provision for the Loan Council, which went a long way to overcome my objections -I also oppose this amendment, because it would give the States even better terms than they now have under the agreement. I realize, as must other honourable members, that the Commonwealth Government must in the future take over considerable obligations from the States. The tendency is to clothe this Parliament with greater and greater powers. As those powers are given to the Commonwealth they reduce the responsibilities of the States, and it would be illogical and unsound to allow the States to draw more money after being relieved of many of their obligations. Such a position would necessitate the imposition of heavy taxation by the Commonwealth Government. Until the population of Australia reaches 8,800,000, which .will be in twenty years with our present increase rate of 130,000-per annum, there will be very little difference between the effect of the agreement and that of the proposed After that the States would benefit considerably. Under the agreement as it stands the States will benefit to the extent of £1,822,000 at the end of fifteen years, but at the end of twenty years the Commonwealth will benefit to the extent of £1,87S,000. The acceptance of this amendment would extend favorable conditions to the States for an additional five years. The agreement is a good one for the to States, and does not need improving. The Commonwealth would find it difficult to raise the necessary money if the amendment were accepted. As custodians of the interests of the people we have to look ahead, and it is only because of that that I offered any opposition to the agreement. I admit that the honourable member for Swan has a perfect right to move his amendment, which should be carried if approved. Honourable members should not endeavour to make it appear that the agreement is a settled thing. been suggested. ment can only be rejected or accepted. further conferences will be necessary in order to draw up a new agreement. That would not necessarily have to be done within a given time. This agreement may be carried on for two years before it is submitted to the people for ratification by a referendum; but there is nothing to prevent the Government extending the present payments for an additional term. If this 'amendment were included in the agreement submitted to the people that agreement would be rejected. In 1910 the people were asked to approve of a payment of 25s. per head being incorporated in the Constitution, and they decided against it. They would record a similar decision if this amendment were carried and submitted to them in the agreement. was particularly interested in the opinion of the honourable member for Barton( Mr Ley), who urged the House to accept the agreement merely because it agreement. was endorsed by the States. The honourable' member appears to have acquired quite suddenly a profound respect for the opinion of the States. A year ago, when the States chanced to be hostile to the schemes of this Government, the. honourable member condemned them, and treated them almost with contempt. To-day, when they chance to support the schemes of the Government, the honourable member contends that we should bow to the wishes of the States. I cannot support",46,Paibs

130,Mr Gullett (Henty) [8.42],"Ithe amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), because of his proposed limitation of the extent to which the States may participate in the customs and excise revenue, to 25 per cent, of the whole. Had that limitation not been embodied in the amendment, I should support it. It may be remembered that I strongly favour a substantial reduction of revenue duties, and that I am also very sympathetic towards a reduction of excise. I look forward to seeing the customs and excise duties substantially less than at present. If that hope is realized, the States will be in an even worse position, than they are in to-day. I appeal to the honourable member for Swan not to be depressed about the future. ""We have been told that the States will be better off for fifteen or twenty years under this agreement. I look upon the whole agreement, as purely of a temporary nature; otherwise, I should not have supported the second reading. I do not, for one moment, anticipate that it will last for 58 years. The original provision for paying the States three-quarters of the customs revenue lasted for only ten years after federation, while the per capita payments operated for eighteen years. It seems logical, therefore, to assume that this agreement will stand' only until the people, in their own generation, decide to alter it. I know of nothing more absurd than that this House should attempt solemnly ""to legislate for '58 years ahead in the supremely important realm of finance. If I thought that'the agreement would last for that term I should not view it as favourably as I now do. It is merely a good temporary arrangement. . The Treasurer referred again to the effect this agreement would have in enhancing the credit of the Commonwealth. I strongly deprecate these highly-coloured assurances as to the effect which the agreement will have upon the credit of the Commonwealth, in either reducing the interest rates or improving our credit abroad. It is a pity that that aspect of the agreement has been so greatly exaggerated. More important than the machinery by which we borrow and repay money, is the use to which we put it, and we shall be judged by the world not by our sinking funds and arrangements for borrowing, but by the purposes to which we devote money when it is lent to us. That our credit in the world stands relatively low in comparison with that of other British Dominions is not because of the absence of sinking funds or of inefficient borrowing machinery, but because of the rate of our expenditure in recent years and the extent to which the money has been employed upon unprofitable works. I congratulate the honourable member for Swan as a distinguished representative, of the ancient order of diehards upon his praiseworthy endeavour to have the whole principle of the bill, which has been already accepted by the carrying of the second reading, altered by an amendment which, judged by the modesty of the mover, seems perfectly innocuous, but is in fact absolutely destructive. The position of the committee is rather curious. We are asked at this stage to adopt in gldbo an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, covering 7 twelve pages of closely printed matter, and we are told that if we alter one line or letter of it we shall do something fatal to the whole structure. In practice, that is true, and it arises from the fact that the Commonwealth Parliament comes into the negotiations at the tail end. We should have come into them at the beginnning. This agreement when drawn by the Government should have been submitted to this Parliament and here discussed in detail, and it should not be brought to us as a completed instrument with an intimation that we must accept it or reject it as it stands. The points of view of' the honourable member . for Dalley and the Leader of the Opposition are reconcilable. The honourable member for Dalley says rightly that this agreement has been accepted by tha States and is brought before us as a schedule to the bill, and if we interfere with the schedule in any detail we might as well not have agreed to the second reading. The Leader of the Opposition, on the ether hand, says that this Parliament is in the curious position of being told that it must accept this agreement in to to, because if we attempt to amend it, all the work that preceded our .deliberations",47,Paibs
131,Mr Brennan (Batman) [8.47],"here will fall to the ground. I think the whole discussion on this schedule is irregular. The proper place for it was on clause 2. It was tliere that we should have decided to accept or reject the agreeI , too, was thinking the same. Eor the ment. The question now before the committee is merely "" That the schedule be the schedule to the billand not be discussing the details or merits of the agreement. A curious way of dealing with matters is developing in this Parliament; with increasing frequency shbrt bills with very long appendices are presented to us, and when we have dealt with the introductory clauses, we are helpless in regard to the kernels of the measures, which are contained in the appendices. My ""main purpose in rising is to protest against this Parliament being consulted last in connection with the various deliberations leading up to the agreement, and against our being., asked to accept such a document in globo. The Government drafted the agreement; some have been unkind enough to say that it was ""submitted to the States with a polite intimation that if they did not accept it voluntarily it would be forcibly fed to them. ""Whether or not that be true, we are the last to be consulted in regard to it. On the general question, I look forward to the time when the Oommonwealth will come into its own, and those who now boast loudly, or urge patriotically, that Australia is in fact a nation among a commonwealth' of nations, will recognize that nationhood unless somewhere is a final responsibility, cannot be ultimate responsibility in a nation which has not final control of its finances. I hopefully anticipate the time when the present more or less petty State jealousies and contentions will disappear. They die hard, because people, no matter what their political colour, are reluctant to surrender power, and the power of the purse is the most potent in the relationships of human beings. The States are loth to give up the power they have in regard to local government; so they retain their local sovereignty and the batch of imported Governors and all the trappings that go to make up the panoply of State government. Mr Brennan. honourable member is going too far. reasons I have mentioned I cannot support the amendment moved by the perwe should sistent and amiable honourable member for Swan. thank the Leader of the Opposition for his clear statement of my point of view. Feeling as I do I was fully justified in submitting this amendment. I am sorry if the honourable member for Barton( Mr Ley) has contracted a headache over it ; it is pitiful that any honourable member should be asked to study in detail an agreement of this character. The honourable member for ""Wannon( Mr Rodgers) suggested that I should withdraw the amendment because the ship has been sunk. It has not been sunk, although an attempt has been made to scuttle it. ""When the Premiers met the Federal Treasurer their guns had been already spiked, and they had no option but to accept this agreement. My object in proposing the amendment is that it may focus the attention of the people upon the extraordinary action of the Federal Parliament during the last two years in legislating upon so important an issue without consulting the electors. I have little hope that the amendment will be carried, but it may gain circulation amongst the people, and they will realize we cannot have undivided the justice of my contention that a small there share of any increase in the customs and and there excise revenues should go to the States, which are doing their part to build up the prosperity of Australia. I remember one honourable member boasting that he had told the people in his constituency that he was prepared to accept the promise of the Prime Minister in regard to the future of his State. Finance is government, and when we undermine the finances of a State we undermine the authority that controls it. I hope this amendment will have some little influence at the next election, and that when the"" new Parliament assembles we shall find that the ship of State Rights is not lost entirely, as . the honourable member for Wannon believes, but that it will be",48,Paibs

136,Is That Countries Cannot Be Governed F R O M ( Mr Gbegoby's Amendment),"put . TheSION'S EXPENDITURE: PUBLIC WORKS That the House do now adjourn. take this opportunity of drawing attention to tbe position that has arisen at Walsh Island dockyard, which, of course, is under State control. I do not intend to go into the merits of the dispute that has been in progress there in regard to the bonus system; but I am concerned at the fact that this week all employees, with the exception of about 50 out of 2,000, are being paid off, thus adding materially to the number of unemployed in New South Wales. The matter in dispute was dealt with in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court by Judge Beeby, who decided that the bonus system should not be introcused of participating in a strike; but it duced. In fixing the conditions in regard to employment, he provided for day wages. The point that I wish to emphasize is that, without reference to the court, the State Government has decided to dispense with the services of its employees. In my opinion this is purely a lock-out. The law that the employees are expected to obey should also be observed by the employers. The fact that a State Government has refused to obey the court's award makes its conduct more reprehensible than a similar act of a private employer. The State Government has certainly set a bad example. It should is sub judice, although the Attorneyhave gone to the court for a variation of the award, instead of changing the condithat according to the court it was so. tions operating at the Island. and throwing a large number of men into a state of idleness. The Commonwealth Government is spending about £150,000 towards the cost of constructing a floating dock there, and I think tliat some representation might be made to the State Government from this Parliament. Action such as this only serves to foment industrial trouble. The law provides that claims must be brought before the court. The men were working under an award, and, because they refused to accept altered conditions that were forced upon them by the State Government, they were accused of striking, when in reality they were locked out. We canat its own sweet will, breaks its agreement and declines to apply to the court for an alteration of an award. In addition to the large number of men who have been thrown out of work, many other persons are indirectly affected, and the result will be greatly to swell the ranks of the unemployed. At a time when there is general depression throughout Australia, every effort should be made to keep men in employment. We should try to induce the State Government to have the matter again referred to the court, whose decision should be obeyed. always do that. a specific case. When employees refuse to work under conditions that are disagreeable to them, they are generally acis most difficult to prove a lock-out on the part of the employer. The present trouble at Walsh Island is clearly due to a lockout, and the Commonwealth should at least know whether it is possible for the dispute to be referred to the Arbitration Court. Perhaps more public interest is now focussed on the Abrahams case, concerning which the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) has given notice of a motion, than on any other matter engaging our attention at the present time. It cannot be justly claimed that this case General( Mr Latham) stated recently According to the Minister, the case might remain sub judice for all time. Notice of the motion has been given with the concurrence of the Opposition, and I suggest to the Prime Minister that the setting apart of a day, say to-morrow, for its full consideration is warranted. should like the Prime Minister to give an outline of the intentions of the Government with regard to work at the Cockatoo Island dock-' yard.

141,Mr Theodore (Dalley) [9.25],"Iwho constitute a highly trained staff, depend upon the activities of that establishment for employment. Work has been very slack at the Island lately, and the outlook is not promising. One important undertaking that has beeu carried on there for some months past is now nearing competition: I refer to the construction of the equipment for the seaplane carrier, Albatross. This work, it is expected, will be completed about August next, and a considerable portion of the personnel will then be dismissed unless other employment is provided. Naturally the men are apprehensive as to the future. About 900 men are engaged at the Island at the present time; although, when the shipyards were fully staffed, as many as 4,000 men were employed. Has the Government arrived at any decision in the matter, or is it contemplating the adoption of a policy regarding the future of the Island? The tendency seems to be to allow work to be diverted from it. That is having a deplorable effect. The yards are well equipped with modern appliances and plant suitable for carrying out extensive naval and ship construction and repair work. If it is likely that further vessels will be built for the Australian Navy, as much of this work as possible should be clone at Cockatoo Island, and it should be put in hand as early as possible in order to provide continuity of employment for the highly trained personnel there. This personnel includes engineers, boilermakers, and artisans. It would be unfortunate if that skilled staff had to be dispersed, since it would not be easy to get it together again should the need for it arise. An unfortunate decision by the High Court regarding a contract for certain plant required by the Sydney City Council for the Bunnerong power station a year or so ago, prevented work being done at the Island that would have ensured activity there for a period of three or four, or even more, years, and would, no doubt, have enabled the authorities to maintain continuity of employment. Possibly, had that contract been given to the dockyard, the management could have expedited the work at periods and could have slackened off the contract work when employment at the dockyard was active on other orders. Unhappily, however, that contract was let overseas. So far as practicable, the Government ought to devise a policy of active, employment for the equipment and staff at the dockyard. I believe that that would be a sound policy, economically and industrially. Prom the point of view of defence, too, it would be wise to maintain the Island at ful l efficiency and capacity. wish to support the remarks of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore). I am very pleased that he raised the matter of the skilled staff at Cockatoo Island. I would go so far as to say that when we have spent £7,500,000 on new ships such as cruisers, submarines, and a seaplane carrier, even if we cannot find enough work to keep the men employed all the time, the staff should be kept intact. Years ago we sent men Home to learn this class of work. Subsequently they were allowed to drift away into private employment, and now we cannot get them back. There are other skilled men employed at Cockatoo Island now; and are we to lose them in the same way? This is a matter to which the Government should give serious consideration. This morning the honourable member for Lang( Sir Elliot Johnson) asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence a question regarding the . training of men for the Navy. As a member of the executive committee of the Navy League in New South WalesI intended to bring that matter up this morning, or possibly to move the adjournment of the House in order that it might be discussed. However, as the honourable member for Lang has raised the question, and as it will, I understand, be on the notice-paper tomorrow, I have no desire to anticipate the Minister's reply. The Navy Leagues of Australia have written recently to the Prime Minister raising the subject of the age at which recruits join the Navy. The practice for centuries past has been for recruits to join at the age of fifteen or sixteen years. The idea is to catch them young, so that they may imbibe the traditions of the Navy, and have instilled into them the ideas that are necessary to make efficient sailors. Some time ago the Public Works Committee of this Parliament went into the matter, and suggested",51,Cockatoo Island Not Expect Industrial Peace I F Either Party
142,Mr Marks (Wentworth) [9.30],"Ithat Geelong should he chosen as the place where naval men should be trained. The Government declared that it had not sufficient money, and that it would not go on with the proposal. It then disposed of the Tingira, in which hundreds of the best naval men had been trained, and, at the same time, raised the age of enlistment to nineteen. It is impossible to train Australians at the age of nineteen, because they are men by that time. This matter is causing a good deal of concern among Navy League men in Australia, and among naval men generally. I ask the Prime Minister to consider seriously the request put before him by the Navy Leagues of Australia that there should be sufficient money placed upon the next Estimates to enable us to revert to the system of commencing naval training at the age of fifteen or sixteen years. sire to endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Dalley, and to make an appeal on behalf of the experienced and technical staff at present employed at Cockatoo Island, together with the army of skilled workmen now engaged there. Aiiy action which the Government may take, particularly in regard to employment, will now be belated. Nevertheless, it has a duty to the men at Cockatoo Island, and particularly to those men who have spent the greater part of their lives in the shipbuilding industry. The Commonwealth Government, and also the Government of New South Wales prior to the taking over of the dock in 1913, spent many thousands of pounds in despatching Australian workmen overseas to gain experience in the building of warships and submarines. Later, owing to tlie shortage of work at the dockyard, the services of these highly trained and experienced men were lost to the Commonwealth. They were absorbed by various firms, and brilliant young men with great careers before them were snapped up by engineering firms in different parts of the country. Now, instead of their services being at the disposal of the Commonwealth, they are mostly employed in private ship-repairing works. The plant at Cockatoo Island is valued at £400.000, and that is one reason why it should be retained, and continuity of employment provided. It is the most up-to-date in the Southern Hemisphere, and we have the men with the necessary experience xo use it. Unfortunately, the Governmentthrough its action in placing an order for two cruisers and submarines overseas, hasrobbed Australian workmen of a great deal of employment. Had they been built in Australia, over £3,000,000 would have been spent in labour alone. We should strive to keep whatever 'work Ave can for our own Australian workmen. The dockyard at Cockatoo Island! has the necessary facilities for building ships, for docking them, and for carrying out major repairs. I suggest to the Prime Minister that the Government may perhaps see its Avay to authorize such expenditure on next year's estimates as will provide for the conversion of the naval collier \Biloela into an oil carrier. That would provide a good deal of employment. We have heard a lot of "" squeakers"" talking about the cost of doing work at Cockatoo Island. I can speak Avith experience of this, and I can say that work done there with Australian labour and Australian materials will compare more than faA orably Avith Avork r done overseas. Let me remind honourable members that the two submarines recently built overseas have developed trouble on the way out. The honourable member for WentAvorth a few years ago raised the question of the ability of Australian dockyards to build submarines, and the Prime Minister stated that Ave had not a dockyard in Australia capable of turning out these vessels. We have the facilities here for doing the Avork, but, unfortunately, Ave have men in control of our nnvy office who are more English in their outlook than Australian. It is time we had in control men with a stronger Australian sentiment. We pride ourselves on the excellence of the soldiers Avhom we sent to the Avar, and upon the manner in Avhich they Avere equipped; yet Ave are told that Ave do not possess either the men or the plant necessary to construct submarines. That is, 'the attitude of an anti-Australian. I have a great admiration for those Avho were responsible for the construction of the Brisbane, the Adelaide, ancl other ships built in Australian dockyards. The work was' better than that turned out on",52,Cockatoo Island Not Expect Industrial Peace I F Either Party
143,Mr C. Riley (Cook) [9.36],"I detlie other side of the world. As the result of this policy of constructing ships locally, we attracted to our shores hundreds of men specially trained in Belfast, on the Clyde, and in other shipbuilding yards. We have a duty to those men, arid the Government should do something on their behalf before it is too late. The honourable member for Franklin has complained regarding the delay in the construction of ships, and regarding the cost of the work. Let me remind the honourable ' member that circumstances in the past have not favoured local construction. We have been obliged to send overseas for material, and have been at the mercy of conditions prevailing in the Old Country. A few months ago there was trouble in the coal mines in England, and the output of the steel works there was interfered with. The contractor for the Commonwealth Government for plate and angle iron was a firm engaged in ship construction work overseas, and if there was any shortage of material it would see that it filled its own gation to them. In conclusion, let me say requirements before troubling about ours. The Government should keep the staff at Cockatoo Island together so that the men might be available at a time of national emergency. whicli they can be kept employed, and their services retained for Australia. Ten months ago the Joint Committee of Public Accounts presented to this Parliament a report dealing with the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers, and touching also upon the activities' of the Cockatoo Dockyard. The committee made a recommendation that the whole of the work of government departments should be undertaken by the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. The Customs Department, Lighthouse and Navigation Department, Works and Railways, and other government departments have much work to do from time to time which could, and should, be undertaken by our own dockyard. I trust that the Prime Minister, in his reply, will indicate what hope he can hold out to these men, some of whom have been in the employ of the dockyard for many years. There are also men occupying managerial positionsmen who enjoy a high reputation in shipbuilding circles. They have been taken away from their own spheres of activity, and it is our duty to provide them with remunerative employment. Unfortunately, Cockatoo Island dockyard has had a rather chequered career. It has been under the control of the State Government, then of the Commonwealth Government, and has been, at different times, under the control of various Commonwealth departments. Owing to this diversity of control, many of the old employees have technically lost their right to long-service leave. The Public Accounts Committee urge that they should receive the sympathetic attention of the Government. I hope that the Prime Minister will intimate that the Government is prepared to do the right thing by them. There are cases in which men have completed nineteen years' service. If the yard had continued under the old management, instead of having been handed over to the Oommonwealth Shipping Board, those men would have been entitled to six months' leave; but now the Government refuses to recognize its oblithat the high cost of shipbuilding at Cockatoo Island in the past has been due to a number of causes which.cannot be laid at the door of the Australian wornman, There are many ways in nor of the management of the yard. We have at Cockatoo Island an excellent establishment under efficient management, with a fine body of workmen who should be kept in employment. desire to bring under the notice of the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs, a matter of urgentimportance which demands immediate action. During the recent debate on the censure motion the Minister for Trade and Customs informed me that only 65 petrol pumps had been imported into Australia during the past seven months. I have just received a letter from the secretary of the Chamber of Manufacturers, of New South Wales, which states, inter aliaI unilerstaiid, on excellent autliority, orders for over 500 pumps representing a capital outlay of £30,000, have already been placed for American and othei foreign makes. As a matter of fact, we believe that an instalment of these is on the water at the present time. This is a setback to Australian manufacturers, particularly as there are at least twelve competing firms needing the work, and in a position to supply the whole of our Australian requirements in these lines.",53,Cockatoo Island Not Expect Industrial Peace I F Either Party
144,Mr Coleman (Reid) [9.45],"IThe reasons for these importations, amongst other reasons is, I am in formed that the Atlantic UnionO i l Corporation is ahout to commence extensive business operations in Australia. Seeing that we have more than a dozen companies manufacturing petrol pumps, in Australia there is no justification for these importations. months ago I introduced a deputation to the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs at which speakers pointed out that not less than £500,000 worth of petrol pumps would be required in Australia in the next few years. It was asked that the T a r i ff Board should be requested to make immediate inquiries into the matter with the object of recommending the imposition of a specific duty on petrol pumps. The secretary to the Chamber of Manufacturers of New South ""Wales refers to this in his letter to me. He writesSo far as we know no reference has heen made to the Tariff Board, and therefore that body has not been able to institute the very brief inquiries necessary to establish these facts to their satisfaction. The delay is a serious and an irksome one, particularly when one bears ih mind the alarming increase in unemployment in New South Wales, in particular, at the present time. This chamber has been invited by the Government of New South Wales to participate in a conference to deal with unemployment problems. So far as we can see, it devolves into a question of finding more work for established industries. I know of several cases where the possibility of placing work with Australian manufacturers is on the balance at the present time. Here is a case wliere prompt action on the part of the Government can divert to Australian manufacturers, a line that must mean a worth-while instalment, and to that extent a reduction in the amount of unemployment. In view of the large amount of unemployment in Australia and also of the large importations that are occurring, I submit that every possible step, should be taken to protect the interests of the Australian men, tralian industry. are in the nature of a luxury and that the American oil interests are already filching millions of pounds per annum from the Australian people, the Government step to deal with the situation. Mr Coleman. Sir NEVIL LE HOWSE (Calare-Minister for Home and Territories) 19.491 The general report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for 1927 contains certain reflections on the Eederal Capital Commission, in ""consequence of which I have had inquiry made into the matters complained About two of. Paragraph 13 of the report states thatCertain works carried out at Canberra have been estimated at so small an amount under the statutory £25,000 as to warrant the impression that the Federal Capital Commission is purposely endeavouring to avoid investigation of its projects by the committee. And quotes the cost of certain hotels in support of this view. The committee contends that the total cost at which a project stands as a debit in the books of the -' Commission, when absolutely finalized, is the completed cost w it h in the meaning of section 15 (1) of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act. In fairness to the Eederal Capital Commission, I wish to state that, about two years ago, the Commission raised this issue, and that, after considering the representations made, the then Minister acquiesced in the view that the Commission should base its estimates, for the purpose of Public Works Committee references, on the net cost of a project, exclusive of interest charges during construction, architectural fees and costs, and general administration costs. The object in view was to avoid differentiating between tlie Commission and the other constructing authorities of the Commonwealth which Parliament obviously had in mind when it passed the Public Works Committee Act, and which are not required to take into account such charges. These charges consist of the amount of the interest which the Commission has to pay, during the course of the construction of a building, on the loan moneys expended on it and overhead charges, manufacturers and workwhich represent the cost of the services of and to stimulate the Austhe Commission and its executive officers petrol pump manufacturing clerical and accounting work, preparaSeeing that petrol pumps tion of plans . and specifications, and supervision. The present rate for overimportation head charges is 8 per cent, on the actual cost of construction, except in cases where the Commission decides for any reason to make a special reduction. The should take some drastic Commission does not need to include these figures in. its estimates, but in preparing scheme had been developed and a comits various utility balance-sbeets it has to operate on a strict accountancy basis and include both overhead and interest. Insistence upon the Commission including such charges in its estimates for the purpose of Public Works Committee references would have . the anomalous effect of requiring a Commission building estimated to cost a very little over £22,000 to be referred to the committee, whereas a building proposed to be constructed by, say, the Works and Railways Department at an estimated cost of £24,000, would not need to he so referred. In the case of each of the hotels mentioned by the committee, an expenditure of between £1,000 and £2,000 had to be incurred in respect of extras. It is, therefore, quite clear that there was an ample margin between the cost as estimated by the Commission and the statutory limit of £25,000, and I can find no support for the inference that the Commission, in these matters, deliberately evaded a reference to the committee. Paragraph 14 of the report, which relates to the cost of Government House, is, admittedly, in a different category from the other strictures of the committee, but an examination of the circumstances does not disclose any ground for ascribing to the Commission the intention of "" purposely evading "" its obligations. I ask honourable members to bear in mind that the Commission, upon its appointment, was faced with an enormous programme of work which had to be completed within a very limited .time. One of the most urgent works was the remodelling of Yarralumla House for use as the residence of the Governor General The preliminary designs forwarded to the Commission involved an estimated cost, for the building alone, of considereven with the furnishings added, the cost ably less than £25,000, and the work was accordingly put in hand without hesitation. Some months later, upon a change occurring in the Governor-Generalship, a review of the situation showed that, it. through no fault of the Commission; the actual requirements had' been insufficiently considered in the first instance, chairman of the Public Works Comand that it would be necessary to provide offices and certain other out-buildings, separate and distinct from the main building. mencement made therewith, the decision to invite Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York to visit Canberra for the purposes of the Parliamentary opening ceremonies was reached, and this necessitated a still further review, which made it clear that additional accommodation would be needed. At the time, the Commission was definitely under the impression that individual buildings, although forming part of an aggregate, could rightly be regarded as individual works, and it was not until after all of the work was well in hand that the general question of Public Works Committee references was raised in connection with cottage contracts. I am assured by the Commission that it had not the slightest intention of flouting the committee, and that it very much regrets any action on its part that may not have been in strict conformity with the letter and spirit of the act. As I think I have sufficiently indicated, the whole organization of the Commission was working at extraordinarily high pressure in an endeavour to have all arrangements m readiness for the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra, and it had become involved in a very much bigger programme for Government House than had ever been contemplated. Paragraph 15 of the report relates to the residence of the Prime Minister. So far as I understand the position, I am unable to see that the facts provide any justification for the censure which this paragraph seems to imply. The entire cost of the building,, including both overhead and interest, was less than £18,000, which is greatly below the statutory limit of £25,000. It is not the practice to include the cost of furnishings in estimates for Public Works Committee references, but, of the completed and furnished building, excluding overhead and interest, is below the statutory limit, and, with overhead and interest included, is only £287 above mittee, I appreciate the courtesy of the Minister for Home ancl Territories in making available to me an advance copy Soon after this extended of the statement he has just made.

146,Mr Brtjce (Flinders,"Prime Ministhat Government is now pursuing? On reflection, he must recognize that it is extremely difficult for the Government of one sovereign State to make representations to that of another with regard to any course of conduct. having regard to the relative positions of the governments and parliaments concerned, I do not feel that I should follow the course suggested by the Leader of the Opposition. I assure the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) that I shall take steps to permit an early discussion of the motion of which notice was given hy him this afternoon. The Leader of the Opposition has indicated that it concerns a matter of great public importance, and iu that I agree with him. There is the further fact, that it is so worded as to suggest almost improper conduct on the part of the Government. It is, therefore, desirable that the matter with'which it deals should be ventilated at the earliest possible moment, and I assure the House that an opportunity will be given for its discussion. -The future activities of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard were referred to by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), and his remarks were supported by the honourable members for Cook' ( Mr C. Biley) and Wentworth ( Mr Marks). members generally that the Government shares the view that the activities of Cockatoo Island must continue, and that the trained and efficient staff which has been got together cannot be permitted to disperse. A few years ago the Commonwealth set about obtaining two modern 10,000-ton cruisers, twoocean-going submarines, and an airplane carrier, and it is essential that we shall have in Australia facilities for docking and repairing our fleet. The Commonwealth must .see that this dockyard is kept going in order to maintain our sea defence. But there is a limit to the amount of construction work that can be done there. Honourable members opposite would not view very enthusiastically the prospect of the construction of naval vessels either in Australia or elsewhere; indeed, no one would desire that Australia should be forced to indulge in a great programme oi naval construction. As to ordinary mercantile work, I have received many deputations protesting against Cockatoo Island being used othe* Consequently, than for naval and other' government work; but I have always refused to .acquiesce in that view. This Government stands definitely and firmly for the principle of private enterprise, but when, because of national exigencies, we have to conduct business enterprises, we certainly shall not do so at a loss if this can be avoided or at excessive cost. At the same time we took steps in 1923 to ensure that our competition would not be unfair. We insisted that in the estimates of cost the necessary provision should have to be made for income taxation and other charges, as with private enterprise, and that the dockyard should compete with private enterprise only on equitable terms. Subsequently strong representations were made to me that the dockyard was not functioning on a fair and proper basis, in that excessive overhead charges were being debited against government work, so that outside work must be tendered for without making provision for the proper proportion of overhead costs. I asked the board to report whether that was the case, and it reported that it I assure honourable was not the case. My complainants were still not satisfied and, as I did not wish any misunderstanding to exist, I asked the Commonwealth Auditor General to investigate the position and report. He reported that no such practice existed, but that a fair debit of overhead charges was being made against all contracts. The dockyard has, therefore,continued its operations, being entitled to compete for outside work so long as the Government has to keep it going for purposes of defence and other public needs of the people of Australia. Last year, however, when the dockyard had obtained a certain contract its right to undertake the work was challenged, and the court declared that it could not take it. That work was consequently lost to the dockyard. There may be doubt as to the actual constitutional powers of the Commonwealth in this regard, but I do not propose to discuss that matter now. The Government recognizes that the dockyard must be kept going. It also recognizes that if the skilled staff which has been built up is to be retained it is essential that there should be a continuity of work. In the past the Government has endeavoured to obtain all the -work that could be done by the dockyard, and that policy will be continued. ' I cannot hold out any hopes in regard to naval construction, that in the immediate future any large order will be placed with the dockyard. It was contemplated that the construction programme would extend over a period of five years, and that period does not expire until next year. To carry out that programme the Commonwealth Government went to the maximum of its nnancial resources, and of the burden that could legitimately be placed on the Australian people for defence at present. There is, therefore, no prospect of additional employment being granted in that direction in the immediate future. The honourable member for Cook( Mr 0. Riley) referred to a subject that has been fairly thoroughly thrashed out in this House, and on the platforms of the country, when he said that the order for the two cruisers recently placed in Great Britain should have been placed with the Cockatoo Island dockyard. I remind him that the decision both in this House and in the country went badly against him. I remind him, further, that because the two cruisers were not built in Australia it was possible for the Cockatoo Island dockyard to undertake the construction of the seaplane carrier. The Government was ablo to effect a saving of £1,000,000 in the building of the two cruisers, so making it possible to build the seaplane carrier at Cockatoo Island. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) advocated the acceptance of boys at an earlier age for training in the Navy. The Government is giving that matter every consideration. I have received strong, representations on the subject. The extension of age was due to financial circumstances, many of the important things connected with our naval programme having to be weighed against each other to determine where money could best be saved. On the advice of its naval officers the Government took the Mr Hruce. course embodied in the policy for this year. I assure the. honourable member that his representations will receive the fullest examination. The honourable member for Reid. ( Mr Coleman) quoted a statement made by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) in the course of a motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I understand that the statement was that during a period of seven months only 60 to 70 petrol pumps had been imported into Australia. I have no knowledge of the circumstances, but have no doubt that the information given by the Minister was accurate. The honourable member now has some further information, and says that an order for 500 petrol pumps has been placed. I shall look into the matter, and bring his remarks under the notice of the officers of the Department of Trade and Customs with the object of ascertaining the exact position. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.15 p.m.",57,Cockatoo Island Not Expect Industrial Peace I F Either Party
