Prime Ministeri f tbe statements appearing in this morning's Age under the headings "" New Mail Contract, Conditions of Tendering, A Seven Years' Service, ""are correct. If so, docs ho think that Queensland is gettion ting a "" fair deal "" in this Parliaments can judge, the report in the daily press is a bombarded with half-a-dozen questions on a correct statement of the terms of the advertisement which is to he published in the Gazette. I , in conjunction with my colleagues, have endeavoured to the best of my ability to so word the advertisement that justice may be done tb all parties concerned. It must be remembered that Brisbane has not hitherto beena port of call for the mail steamers, and that to insist upon the steamers calling there in future would be to introduce an element of novelty into the proposal. Tenderers will require a considerable length of time in which to make their arrangements. Tho acceptance of tenders will close on the 31st January, 1904, and if we made it an essential condition that Brisbane should be a port of call we should be exposed to this difficulty-that if we failed to receive a. satisfactory tender on that basis by the date mentioned, it would he practically impossible to arrange for an efficient and satisfactory service on the old basis before 1st February, 1905. Therefore we have thought it best to allow an alternative. Mr O'MALLEY -Does the advertisement shut out tlie American lines ? Sir PHILIPFYSH No ; it invites all ship-owners to tender. Brisbane not being mode a port of call, will Queensland be expected to pay a full share of the subsidy ? tracts ore entered into primarily to secure the carriage of mails, not to facilitate the land will get its f u l l share of the advantages of any mail service arranged for, and those advantages will not be detracted from by the fact that in the event of tenders on & certain basis bejng accepted, the steamers will not call at Brisbane for perishable Brisbane not being made a port of call, will the cost of the service be shared among the States in proportion to tbe benefits received I Sir EDMU ND BARTON I am not sure that that is possible under the Constitution, but if it is the matter'will be considered. Sir EDMUNDBARTON I think that a Minister should not be, without notice, subject like this'. I ask honourable members, to give notice of their questions for next week.",12,Setup

The only cases mentioned by others as possibly coming within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court were shearers' disputes, maritime disputes, and. differences in the coal trade.

Its effect might be felt throughout Australia, but the State tribunal 'would have full power to deal with such a difficulty. State trade, and might extend beyond the State.

The Attorney-General then said :I think that Mr O'Connor way mistaken, although he has very good reasons for assuming that the next stage in this matter will be that of compulsory arbitration. The Convention should not, however, allow itself to be influenced by that argument. I do not look forward to the time when it will necessarily be compulsory. The Federal ParUament will wait for the psychological moment. That moment seems to nave already arrived. This is about the last question it will touch until it can touch it usefully, and in bhe interests of commercial life. Honourable members seem to think thafc if they give this power to fche Federal Parliament the Federal Parliament will rush in and use ifc without reason and common-sense. I can come to no such conclusion. That conveyed that there was no danger, because the power was not likely to be used until the necessity arose and until there was a manifest failure on the part of the States tribunals. The Attorney-General's present attitude is a complete reversal of that which he assumed at the Convention. Several other members of the Convention expressed the opinion that the power proposed to be given would be limited to the settlement of maritime disputes. Sir John Downer even doubted the expediency of conferring power to deal with maritime disputes, because he was of opinion that the States tribunals. i",14,Malcolm Mceachabn Would The Clause As I T Stands Simply Declares

27,Mr Mccay,"Ove r what disputes wouldframed it, are we justified in passing an Act which will apply to every industry in which a so-called dispute by sympathy started ? If the Bill be retained in its present form, and if on any question being submitted to a State Arbitration Court, the Court holds that no dispute has arisen, nothing will be simpler than for a body, whose organization extends in to two States, to again start a dispute withga view to test it in the Federal Court. The position of employers and employees will thus be one of continual unrest. From the inception of a dispute until its final settlement, perhaps twelve months may elapse. Do we not know that in New South Wales the business before the Arbitration-Court has become seriously congested ? May I also remind honourable members of the effect of making provisions disputes other than those ' of a maritime character 1 Surely, in the beginning we ought to proceed slowly. Should the Bill prove a success in its relation to maritime disputes, we can afterwards extend its operation. At the beginning, let us confine'its operation, strictly within the lines contemplated by the Convention. nexion, I may, perhaps, be permitted to point to the attempt which was recently made by some of the employees of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to raise a dispute in tlie Arbitration Court of New South Wales. The union which started that dispute contained only 100 members, of whom but twenty were financial. A great number of the other members were mere boys, and the man who actually signed the document necessary to bring the matter within the cognisance of the Arbitration Court was not a member of the union at all. Yet the total number of employees who would have been effected by that dispute, had it been entertained by the Court, was 3,000. that tremendous power to abuse its provisions is conferred by this Bill1 the Court. the High Court may be constituted of tional limits. purely political Judges, I am not prepared to repose implicit faith in it. Probably that honourable member use the words "" trade tribunal will be composed of individuals and commerce,"" which are surely wider than whose predilections are pretty strong, and "" trade and intercourse 1"" whose opinions upon these matters have been practically stereotyped from the debates includes passenger traffic as well as comwhich have taken place in this Parliament. merce. sell strong political views when he accepted may be his position 1 affects my position. A StateA c t can always cure the errors of any Judge. Parliament, which is omnipotent, can at once enact legislation which will bring him back to reasonable lines. But the moment we establish the High Court its decision will practically be final, unless its jurisdiction is kept within proper bounds by the appellate power of the Privy Council. Therefore I say it is inexpedient in the infancy of our political life to give doubtful powers to the Federal Arbitration Court. But to revert to the so called dispute in which the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was involved. In the that case some busy-body, who was not a, of the Bill applicable to member of the union which contained only 100 members, and was not necessarily composed of adult labourers, attempted to precipitate a dispute which, had it been entertained and settled by the New South Wales Arbitration Court, would havefixed the wages of 3,000employes who werescattered th rough'out New S.outh Wales, Queensland, and In this conVictoria. What were the facts regarding the real cause of that dispute 1 It was a question of hours. The Court held that no real dispute existed, and asked that a conferencebetween employers and employees should take place. A conference was held ab which the great bulk of the employees declared that they were perfectly satisfied with their hours and their rates of wages, and that the so-called dispute was practically confined to a very small percentage of their number. Under this Bill a little knot of unionists could initiate a dispute in the State Arbitration Court, and, failing to get it entertained there, could bring it before the Federal tribunal. Then, if they were successful, .despite the wish of the majority Do honourable members see that of the employees, a. common rule would be established fixing the wages in thafc particular branch of industry throughout bers in the beginning to confine the In the beginning, when operation of this Bill clearly to constituMr L.

To my mind, it is clear that maritime disputes of an Inter-State character do fall within the terms of the Constitution. putes contemplated by this Bill. not partake of an Inter-State character. In such a dispute the Court could not apply its award to all Australia, because if the rates of wages vary, there is a difference in climatic conditions, a difference in purchasing value, and in the cost of the raw material. It is therefore impossible to obtain uniformity. Bill.

A t the same time. I do not question its integrity. It is all very well to talk about the High Court being free from bias. We enthused about Federation till we obtained the reality, but the very moment that we secured it , it was attacked. Similarly, if the High Court is composed of men who have been particularly active in politital life, my idea of its freedom from unconscious influence and predilection will not be so great as if it contained two Justices who had taken no part in politics. MrV . L . SOLOMON -The honourable and learned member will not trust the Court unless it is composed of two outsiders as against one politician ? must have a politician upon the High Court, because politicians usually take a broader view of matters than do outsiders. But in the beginning, if the High Court is composed of three Justices who have gone from this Parliament red-hot, with opinions which have been formed here in the course of the debates to which they have listened, I shall not be able to regard them as being free from prejudice. It is therefore inexpedient to confer powers under this Bill which exceed those that were clearly contemplated by section 51 of the Constitution. Mr L. E. GROOM -If we use the words of the Constitution surely we shall be doing only what the Constitution contemplates 1 is the application of machinery which can be useful only in relation to matters which T -A shearers' dispute does are not within Federal powers-the principle of the "" common rule.""

I expressed myself then in the most unqualified manner in favour of this propo sal and its principle. My own view was that industrial legislation should be left wholly in the hands of the States until the Federal Parliament assumed this power, as it has a right to assume certain other powers under the Constitution, and that after it had assumed responsibility the industrial legislation for the whole Commonwealth should be in the hands of the Federal ""Legislature.

My intention in supporting an amendment of this kind is not to destroy or emasculate the measure. I want to bring honourable members back to' fche real position. The Attorney-General has told us there is no doubt as to the powers conferred by the Constitution, but that is not the point. Lefc us look at the history of this matter. I suppose there was never in the world a larger assemblage of able consulting lawyers than was brought together in the Convention; but even fchey found it difficult to insert in the Constitution a set of words which might hot be strained by the .Federal Parliament to the violation of the independence of the States. The whole debates of the Convention breathe the sense of this danger. It is no argument for the Attorney-General to say that I and' others admitted that the Federal Parliament might exercise to the f u l l fche extreme power which it was proposed to give to it . ""Who would have dreamed five years ago that' a Bill of this kind would be introduced into the Federal Parliament? vention thought that this power would be exercised by the first Federal Parliament ? embodied in the Constitution if ifc was intended that the power should not be exercised ? the right honourable member for South Australia, who is largely the father of legislation of this kind, would admit that it was not intended that the Federal authority in regard to industrial matters should override that of the States. He would admit that the provision was intended to cover only those larger disputes of moving industrial populations affecting more than one State, to the mercantile marine, for example, who3e members belong not to one State, but to all Australia. As the Attorney-General has said, matters have advanced very rapidly since the Convention sat. Arbitration laws have been introduced into several of the States, though it cannot be said that we have yet had any sufficient experience of the operation of those laws. But the fact that they have been adopted to prevent disputes is a reason why, if we deal with the question at all, we should deal with ifc only in a tentative manner. The Constitution i [4 SEPT., 1903.] Arbitration BUI. 4669 was accepted by the people upon the distinct understanding that the States authorities should have the supreme control in regard to social and domestic affairs. Thafc principle was enunciated by every public man. member wish to cut down the Constitution ? honourable member knows that it .was intended that this power should be only latent, and not exercised unless absolutely necessary. statements of members of the Convention who were opposed to the granting of this power to the Federal Parliament, or by the wording of the Constitution ? of course, bound by the Constitution. Honourable member's must not think that I am now speaking in antagonism to the B ill ; but sinae the House has passed its second reading, I wish to lay down the lines upon which I think this legislation should be framed. It does not follow that, because a certain power is given to the Constitution, it should be immediately exercised by this Parliament. Under tlie What member of the ConBill as its stands, the J udge of the Arbitration Court could bring within his jurisdiction the whole industrial life of the people of Australia, not merely in regard to disputes extending beyond a State, but in regard to disputes occurring coincidently in more than one State. There Even might, for instance, be a dispute in a certain trade which was being conducted in Queensland under localized conditions as to wages, hours of employment, and so on, and at the same time a dispute in the same trade independently conducted in Victoria. These two separate and local disputes might, by a little finessing on the part of individuals who desired fco keep matters in turmoil, and objected to the adjudication of the State Courts, be brought within the jurisdiction of fche Commonwealth Court. The Judge of that Court would have practically no discretion in' the matter, because the Bill is mandatory. vide for the interference of the Commonwealth ? honourable member had listened fco some of the speeches made at the Convention, he would know that the Attorney General declared most distinctly thafc the",20,Malcolm Mceachabn Would The Clause As I T Stands Simply Declares

Yet, in the second session of this Parliament a moribund Parliament-the Government have introduced this measure to save their political skins. Mr L. E.

That was in 1898-fiv e years ago. pened since then. of the fact that this Parliament is practically moribund, we should, to adopt the words of the Attorney-General, confine the operation of the Bill to the narrowest possible limits. The extreme advocates of the Bill are taking advantage of the difficulty which was experienced at the Convention in framing the Constitution. of the Convention had had any idea that an attempt would be made, not merely to deal with essentially Federal matters, but to bring under control the whole domestic and industrial life of the States, the Constitution would never have been framed in its present form. If honourable members, like the honourable member for Indi, had been asked three or four years ago to give evidence upon this point they would have spoken to the same effect tliat I am now doing. I think tliat the amendment requires some alteration, because it leaves matters much too open. A t the same time, I doubt whether we shall find it possible, any more than at the Convention, to adopt language which would convey our exact meaning, and which would not be open to a mischievous interpretation. I am content to have this question settled at once. If the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, is lost, I say "" Take the Bill."" which confer absolute power upon the President of the Court. If the President is to make his own rules, and, with the Registrar, is to be allowed to declare that certain disputes come within the jurisdiction of the Court, he will have unrestricted control. I shall watch with great interest the discussion which takes place with regard to the application of the common rule. Possibly some safeguards may be provided for, but, if we once agree to some of the provisions contained in the Bill, it will be of little use to bother any further about it , because'its effect will be topractically hand over to one man, who may be steeped in prejudice without knowing it,, owing to his having been under certain I do not influences all his life, the control of the whole industrial life of Australia.

I would suggest to the honourable and learned member forI f the members South Australia, Mr Glynn, that, instead of attempting to limit what is practically a. declaration of our constitutional powers, it would be infinitely better to take the sense of the Committee with regard to the extent to which we should endeavour to exercise them, in connection with the definition of the word "" industry."" It is my wish that the Court we are proposing to constitute should be invested with every power which the Constitution permits us to giveit, and I have every confidence that all such powers will be wisely exercised. In this connection I was sorry indeed to hear a suggestion regarding the possibility of bias on the part of thePresident of the Court.

That applies to every judicial appointment in Australia. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN hitherto been called upon to deal with this particular class of cases ? Surely there is a difference between adjudicating upon industrial matters of this kind and upon ordinary disputes. Every man has his prejudices, but the man who in his capacity of Judge allowed himself to be influenced by them would be unworthy of his ofiice. I do not believe that any such man will be selected for the high office about to be created. I thoroughly agree with the. honourable member for Wentworth that there ought not to be any unnecessary interference by the Federal Court in matters with which any State authority is competent to deal, and I say further that 1 do not believe that there is any possibility of that occurring. When I first had the honour of introducing the subject to the notice of the Sydney Convention on 3rd April, 1891,1 proposed to add a new clause, which would confer legislative powers regardingThe establishment of Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration, having jurisdiction throughout the Commonwealth, for the settlement of industrial disputes. I then saidI think, in view of the magnitude of the recent industrial disturbances which have affected Australia and the whole of the civilized world I was referring to the great maritime strike which had just previously occurred it is desirable, when we are framing this Federal Constitution, that we should at least do something in the way of avoiding difficulties of the character to which I have referred. I am not in favour of conferring unnecessarily any powers on the Federal Parliament. I have hitherto seized various opportunities for advocating the expediency of leaving fche settlement of matter's of purely local concern to the local Legislatures. .But we cannot avoid recognising this fact-thaf c in disputes of the magnitude to which I refer, which affect nofc ouly one, bufc allfcheAustraUan Colonies, it is utterly impossible for any local Legislature to constitute a tribunal competent to deal satisfactorily with the question. Sir Samuel Griffith suggested that my amendment would more properly find a place among the powers to constitute Courts, and I therefore proposed to confer power to create Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes. Unfortunately I did not carry my amendment, but I am delighted to think that I had the honour of co-operating on that occasion, as I have done all through, H a v e Judges with the Attorney-General. The matter was revived in 1897, and, as has already been mentioned, the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne was able to carry an amendment which is now embodied in the Constitution. That provision does not give all the power we should desire, and it is open to the objection that it has not yet been judicially construed. It is impossible to predict with absolute certainty what construction will be placed by the High Court upon the power conferred by the Constitution, but I think that the provision for. conciliation and arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond any one State, preserves the line of demarcation which can be laid down between the State functions and those properly belonging to the Federation. Where a dispute is puiely local, and does not extend to more than one State, we have no power, and we do not propose to .interfere. I thoroughly agree with the honourable member for Wentworth that probably our prime care in this connection is in regard to matters in which the States Courts are helplessin cases, for instance, affecting the maritime interest, where the men employed are in one State to-day and in another to-morrow. No State Legislature can properly deal with cases in which, in the natural order of things, a man receives his wage in one State to-day and in another to-morrow. But -whilst this is so, I by no means say that it is the only dispute with which the Federal Court can properly deal. We cannot look into the future with , absolute certainty. Reference has been made to shearers' disputes. I am inclined to think that next to maritime disputes they would properly engage the attention of the Federal tribunal. There may be many more, but we cannot precisely lay our fingers upon them at the present moment. Let us give to the Federal tribunal such power as the Constitution enables us to confer upon ifc. Lefc us have trust in that tribunal. IE we do not trust it,' do not let us appoint it . If it is unworthy of trust, let us leave fche matter alone. I have confidence in it .

If it be the intention of the Constitution, what foliowg ?

That is the opinion of a high legal authority, as it was expressed in the Convention. I do not know what view of the matter the Prime Minister takes to-day. the Constitution' we accepted those things which we did not like, such, for example, as the selection of the Federal Capital site in New South Wales. may have objected to the inclusion of that power of conciliation and arbitration in the Constitution have accepted it for what it means.

I contend The illustration drawn from the quotation of the Prime Minister's words is given only in support of the view which I am putting forward. If such a means of extending disputes beyond a State is to be availed of, and it is admitted that it will be, disputes will be created in a State where they would not otherwise occur; the local tribunals will be constantly flouted by one side or the other, and a game of cross-purposes will be played by which each side will endeavour to gain an advantage by In the Convention the Prime seeking at one time to limit a dispute to a particular locality, and at another' time to extend it over the whole Commonwealth.

W ill the honourable member say that we can extend powers which already cover every industry in Australia » powers of the Constitution. of the Constitution, but of the Bill. We cannot extend powers which, as the Bill is drafted, cover every industry in Australia. Therefore, the affect of the amendment must be to limit the scope of the Bill. I am not going to discuss the precise wording of the amendment. The honourable and learned inember for South Australia has done what has been done on many occasions in this Chamber. He has brought forward an amendment to allow the discussion of a certain principle. If the principle which he advocates is adopted, the amendment can readily be altered to meet the caseWe have accepted our defeat upon the second reading of the measure, and we arenow trying to make the B ill as workable as possible. We want also to make its interference with the authority of the States as, little as possible, because, we hold that the States Courts are better qualified than the Commonwealth Court will be to adjudicate upon local disputes. Our desire is to confine the provisions of the measure as nearly as possible to the evident intention of the framers of the Constitution. I shall support the proposed limitation. only a few words upon this clause, because I feel that it is the duty of every friend of the Bill not' to occupy more time than is necessary at this period of the session. A good deal of time has been taken up in the discussion of other matters, but I trust that now the consideration of this measure has been resumed, we shall be able to proceed with it uninterruptedly. Bill occupied most of the time taken up in the second-reading debate. in any retrospect. I agree that the clause should be amended as suggested by the Attorney-General. It would be possible to strike it out altogether, and that course would perhaps have the same legal effect as the adoption of the amendments which he has suggested, but it seems to me desirable to retain the clause in order to allay certain fears which have been expressed by persons outside. It has been stated that it is the intention of Parliament to intrude upon what are really State matters, and.thereforeI think it is necessary to insert in the B ill a clause, framed on the words of the Constitution, announcing that we do n«t intend to deal with any but. Federal matters. It is not the province of this Parliament to interpret the Constitution by using words which are not contained in it. which are used in the Constitution. ing to interpret the Constitution we may get ourselves into difficulties. The adoption of this clause does not increase our powers one jot, nor does it give to the tribunal which we are about to create any power which is not authorized by the Constitution. The intention of the honourable and learned member for South Australia is at the very threshold to limit the scope of the Bill. If there is to be such a limitation, however, this is not the occasion to discuss the matter, because we cannot wholly deal with it in connection with this clause, and it would be most inartistic and unusual to deal with i i in a piecemeal fashion. Surely the occasion to discuss a proposed limitation will arise when we are dealing with clause 6. If a limitation is thought desirable, it should be . made by amendments of the definitions of ""industrial disputes,"" ""industrial matters,"" and "" industry.""

I shall not I am not going to indulge address myself at this juncture, for the reasons I have given, to the other considerations which have been advanced by honourable memhers in support of the amendment.

I wish to draw the attention of the Attorney-General to the bearing of the word ""extending"" upon the provisions of clauses 37 and 38. Clause2 confines the scope of the Bill to industrial disputes ""extending beyond the limits of any one State,"" whereas clauses 37 and 38 give the Court power to deal with "" any industrial dispute "" at the request of any State industrial authority, or of the Governor of a Statei n which there is no State industrial authority. pute,"" occurring in clauses 37 and 38, must be understood to have the meaning attaching to it under the definition in clause 6.

He then said that the in all probability the Commonwealth would not aet until after an abundant series of well-conducted experiments in the States.

I know that it is thought that shearing disputes should be. brought within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. In Victoria, the pastoralists have entered into an agreement with the Australian Workers' Dnion, whereas a dispute is still proceeding ' in New South Wales. If the Bill were in force, the Victorian shearers would, owing to their sympathy with the shearers in New South Wales, probably refuse to come to au agreement with the employers, and thus trouble would be extended rather than restricted by the operation of the law. AndI am quite certain that the same thing would happen in many other industries. Naturally men would desire to better their condition, and would extend disputes over two or more States if they thought they could thereby secure their ends. I hope that the Committee will agree to the amendment, which will have the effect of reducing the scope of the Bill. able member for Wannon can bring forward no better illustration than that which he has used, his argument must fall to the ground. He has failed to grasp the meaning of the word ""dispute."" So far as the pastoral industry is concerned, both the employers and the men are organized, and fche federated unions extend their operations over four States. The honourable member spoke of the creation of disputes by the operation of the Bill, but I would point out that a dispute now exists between the Pastoralists' Union and the Australian Workers' Union. It is true that a settlement has been arrived at so far as the Victorian sections of these unions are concerned, but disputes still exist in New South Wales and South Australia, which would come within the jurisdiction of the Federal Arbitration Court. The pastoralists in both those States refused to meet the representatives of the Australian Workers' Union; but the Victorian pastoralists come of extending disputes. to terms with the men as soon as they received, permission to meet their representatives. I musfc do the pastoralists of I did nofc change my Victoria bhe justice to say that they have always been anxious to settle their disputes with us by conciliatory methods. The Pastoralists' Union has branches in Victoria, South Australia, New Soutli Wales, and Queensland. The Australian Workers' Union also has its branches in the three first-named States, and is associated with a similar organization in Queensland. A dispute exists between the two federated organiza tions at present because theemployers refuse to meet the representatives of the men. It is not necessary that men should go to work in order to tvreate a dispute. It would be competent for the Federal Arbi tration Court to take preventive measures, otherwise the Bill would be of no value. The Court could make an award covering the whole of the Commonwealth, and lay down conditions which would be in accord with the varying customs prevailing in the different States. We know thafc the conditions in Victoria are quite different from those which obtain in New South Wales, and the terms of the award could be, and no doubt would be, so shaped as to suit the varying circumstances. There would be a common rule applying to each State within a given radius in the same way that the terms of the arrangements entered into for shearing in Victoria and New South Wales were varied to suit the respective conditions of the two States. Unfortunately the agreement which has been entered into between the Victorian pastoralists and the Australian Workers' Union has no force in law. But having been voluntarily arrived at it could be registered as an award of the Court. It need not necessarily be reviewed by the Courfc unless either party wished that that should be done. A common rule could be applied to New South Wales and Queensland to suit the conditions of those two States, and special provision could be made for the difference in the conditions prevailing in the northern as distinguished from the south-eastern districts of South Australia. That is what we understand by the application of the common rule. I do not know why the Bill should be regarded as calculated to create disputes. -",28,Malcolm Mceachabn Would The Clause As I T Stands Simply Declares

If a court were established which afforded some means of securing justice the public would be made acquainted for the first time with grievances which had existed all along. Recourse could not be had to the Arbitration Court except by large bodies of men, and as their organizations .provide complete checks against hasty action, honourable members may rest assured that only genuine grievances will be submitted to adjudication In my opinion the Bill should be made as comprehensive as possible. any additional reason for supporting the amendment of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, it has just been furnished by the honourable member for Darling. Either the Court which it is proposed to establish under this B ill will have the power to make awards or it will not. According to the honourable member for Darling, if a union extends into more than one State, and a dispute arises in which its members are interested, that dispute can be referred for settlement to the supreme arbiter-the Court which is to be established by this Parliament. Unfortunately for the soundness of his argument, he gave an illustration which seems to cut directly the other way. He pointed out that, after all, any award must necessarily be a purely local one. In this connection he showed that in the case of the Shearers' Union a different award would be required in New South Wales from thab which would be given in Victoria, whilst in South Australia two different awards might be expected. nob, it seems to me that that fact is equally destructive to his argument. the risk. men, I decline to take that risk. upon the second reading of the Bill. the motion for its second reading was whether or not we should have a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill.

As a general rule, however, it is advisableespecially in the drafting of Bills-that any point which is raised shall be fought out upon the very first opportunity which presents itself. If we allow this clause to pass in its present form we shall require to change almost entirely the character of clause 6. This provision is practically declaratory of the scope of the Bill. I wish to submit one argument from the workmen's point of view, as to the necessity for providing thab the proposed Court shall not be empowered to interfere in any local dispute, merely because the union which is interested in it may extend throughout the different States. Otherwise, I can easily conceive the position which may be taken up by a smart body of the employers' union. They may create a strike or lock-out in a certain branch of industry in Tasmania, where, owing to the fact that living is cheaper, the wages of the workmen are lower than those which are paid to men engaged in bhe same industry in Queensland or Western Australia. If they were, successf u l before the Court, the common rule would be applied to all engaged $in that industiy throughout Australia.

The laws which kept workmen down until 1799 were entirely Judge-made laws. From 1700 to about 1795, the judgments by which the workmen were oppressed were based upon statutes which had no reference to industrial combinations: That has been pointed out upon more occasions than one. Similarly, by placing the narrowest possible interpretation upon the laws directed against gambling, the Judges kept back the development of insurance societies for perhaps 150 years. Judges of sound common sense arose afterwards, and by refusing to control new conditions by old statutes made for other purposes allowed the work of development to proceed. and learned member to confine himself to the clause. so, because I am endeavouiing to show how necessary it is to say exactly what we mean by this Bill.

If the mere fact that the branches of a union ramify throughout the Commonwealth will enable the Court to deal with an industrial dispute in which the members of that union, are concerned, its jurisdiction will be taken advantage of, not only by the men to make a favourable common rule apply all over Australia, but also by the masters. It may thus happen that the Court may make a common rule which, although suitable to the conditions of an industry in Tasmania, where, living is cheap, may be altogether unsuitable fco the conditions prevailing in Western Australia and in Queensland. the Court doing anything so absurd, because the J udge will exercise his common sense in dealing with these matters. for .Darling has argued that if there is a dispute in New South Walesi n which the members offcheShearers' Union, which has branches in New South Wales, ""Victoria, and Queensland, are concerned, and a sympathetic dispute occurs in one of the other States, the Court will be empowered to adjudicate on the question in the first-named State. able member is not confining himself to the amendment, which provides for the insertion of words limiting the application of the measure to certain employments.

I am. merely using an illustration put forward by the honourable member for Darling, and endeavouring to answer his arguments. Let me try to state my point in another way. If the Court is to have jurisdiction to deal with a dispute whenever a Otherwise we sympathetic dispute occurs in some other State, the Employers' Federation as well as the Workers' Unions will be able to take advantage of the fact, and thus great injury may be done fco either side. If I were called upon in my professional capacity to advise the employers, I would say "" Create a dispute in Tasmania or in some other part of the Commonwealth where you are most likely to get a judgment favourable to your interests, and then threaten a lock-out in some other State, in order to bring the matter under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Courfc."" That being done, the Court would be bound to deal with the original dispute, and would be guided by the evidence brought before it in the Statei n which that dispute occurred. One honourable member said that men would be brought from other States to give evidence, but does he not see what a great expense that will involve? If that has to be done, all the money of the unions will be dissipated in law expenses.

I thought over the form of words very carefully and they were not the result of my own judgment only. The amendment would extend the jurisdiction of the Court to all agencies connected with inter-State commerce. It would embrace, for instance, disputes with wharf labourers who might be engaged in connection with inter-State shipping. The words, "" inter-State coasting trade "" might have been used, but they would not, I think, have applied to passengers carried in vessels engaged in the inter-State trade, nor would they have included oversea vessels. Words of the nature suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne, might be inserted as follows ""Disputesi n the industry.""

It will then be for the High Court to determine exactly the extent of the powers which are conferred by that instrument of government.

I was merely remarking that the Amalgamated Miners' Associations of Victoria and Tasmania are one industrial organization. which exists for arbitration. delegates who went from Victoria to Tasmania will not be able to say that they did not receive every consideration. There has been a desire on the part of the Company to place all the facts before the two representatives of the men who have been acting as 'conciliators; and, although I have no wish to say anything that might prejudice their position, I am disposed to believe that, as reasonable men, they were satisfied with the position taken up by the Company.

261,Mr Crouch,"I agree with the honthe objections raised against the Bill is that it will give rise to two jurisdictions-that both the States Courts and the Commonwealth Court will have power to deal with these matters. We have Conciliation and Arbitration Actsi n Western Australia and New South Wales, and Factories Acts in Victoria and South Australia, but no such industrial legislation in Queensland or Tasmania. If we distinctly provide in this clause that those measures shall not legislation of the Commonwealth shall be the only governing power, much more good will be done than by amending this clause in a way that will cause it to have no effect. We do not wish to introduce useless verbiage into the Bill, and I hope, therefore, that the Attorney-General will substitute an amendment of the character I have indicated. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). I feel constrained to support amendment, although I do not think it will carry us any further. We are face to face with the real difficulty associated with the Bill, and I think I can foresee the object which the Attorney-General has in view in framing the amendment submitted to us. We have to obtain a decision of the High Court as to our powers under the Constitution in reference to this question, and the phrase which the Attorney-General now proposes to insert in the clauseand the whole provision in the clause, by the way, might just as well have been used as the title of the B ill w ill enable that decision to be secured. It appears to me that the difficulty is that tlie phrase used in the Constitution is exceedingly indefinite. The word "" extending "" will admit of two very clear and distinct definitions. ""Extending"" may mean ""which have extended,"" or, "" which may extend."" If it means "" which have extended,"" we shall be forced into a difficulty in regard to the word "" prevention,"" because we cannot prevent a dispute which has already extended to another State. If the phrase were held to mean "" which may extend,"" it seems to me that the Commonwealth Parliament would have full power to pass legislation for the settlement of all industrial, disputes throughout the Commonwealth. I am rather sorry that we do not possess that power It would have been far better if the full power had been given to us. I can foresee the difficulty of the Federal law overlapping the States law, and producing 10 A not only a very great deal of friction between the two* sets of Courts, but friction amongst employers and employees which would not otherwise occur. When a workman or an employer is brought face to face with certain decisions by the Federal Court on the one side, and by the States tribunals on the obher, he will not know how he stands. But, owing to the wording of the Constitution, I do not see any way out of the difficult}'. We have to mako this amendment apply, and that the industrial so that a test case may be taken to the High Court at the first opportunity to determine the meaning of this rather ambiguous phrase. To that extent, therefore, I intend to support it, because I see no other way of settling grevious trouble in connection with the whole Bill. If we could have limited this measure to certain great industrial troubles, such as maritime disputes, and difficulties in connection with coal miners, the wharf labourers, carriers, and shearerswhich, if they originabe in one State, must necessarily extend to others-the position would be different. But if in this measure we iire going to take power to deal with every factory in the Commonwealth, then, although I should be prepared to adopt that course if we had the power to do so, I foresee great difficulty, having regard to the fact bhab cerbain power is reserved to the Sbabes to deal wibh bhose mabters. We shall have two sets of Courts issuing different decisions, and the unfortunate workers and employers will be placed in a position of great difficulty. The amendment will enable us at the first opportunity to obtainfcheruling of the High Court as to the meaning of the ambiguous words in the Constitution. Amendment agreed to.

Yet he asks for a tender of that kind. the cost ofA fortnightly or weekly service . . . subject to special conditions relating to the carriage of fruit and the provision of refrigerating chambers, the service. -which include certain rates of freight. This is not a party matter. my State is being got at, and therefore 1 am standing up for its rights. The fact that I may be opposed to the party now in power in Queensland has nothing to do with the case. Queensland is to be asked to pay for the carriage of fruit and other perishable products without being able to take advantage of the accommodation provided. That is no proper Eederal arrangement. opinion, if the steamers do not go on to Brisbane, Queensland should not be called upon to pay one-seventh of the mail subsidy. Surely the Government do not want us to pay for a service from which we get no advantage 1 will have their letters carried by the mail steamers. States have their letters carried by the Vancouver mail boats, but the only States that subsidize that service' are Queensland and New Soutli Wales. I strongly object to the alternative allowed in the tender. The Premier of Queensland, when in Sydney some time ago, interviewed the manager of the P. and 0. Company, and was informed by him that the company would be willing to send their boats to Brisbanei f they got the mail contract. The Queensland Government have intimated their willingness to forego harbour, wharfage, port and light dues in the event of mailsteamers proceeding there. Mr between Sydney and Vancouver, calling at Hertzburg, in his statement of the case to the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce, says1. The trade of Brisbane is larger than that of either Fremanfcle or Adelaide. 2. Brisbane has over 5,000 tons of available cold storage, which, I understand, is larger than any other town in Australia. 3. The steamers are required here for the export of butter, fruits, meats, and station produce principally. The trade in the export of pineapples will equal the trade in apples from Tasmania. 4. The Government here are agreeable to forego port dues and wharfage, and the accommodation at the Government wharfs at Pinkenba is sufficient for the largest vessels trading to Ausbralia. monwealth Government. A t the very outset, 5. The depth of water to the Pinkenba wharfs is also sufficient for the largest vessels. 6. Two days *at the most would be sufficient for vessels to stay here, leaving nine days for their stay in Sydney. 7. Queensland pays one-seventh of the contract Tenderers are also invited to state price for the mail service, which is of little advantage to her, as we get mails md America as quickly, and practically for nothing. 8.

If Queensland is going to be asked to pay her share of this mail subsidy, surely the other States of the Commonwealbh should contribute towards the Vancouver subsidy, especially since the crews and stewards on the steamers trading to Vancouver are white men, and most of them Australians. If the In my representatives of Queensland do not look after her interests, I am sure that other honourable members will not do so. All we ask is that Queensland shall get as fair a deal as the other States. protest against the action of the Government in not making Brisbane a porb of call for the mail steamers. To leave out Brisbane is to do a great injustice to the State of Queensland. The arguments advanced by the honourable member for Maranoa were placed before the Prime Minister and the Postmaster-General, and we expected that they would receivefa vorableconsideration. I think that if any other State had been concerned it would have been treated differently. Tenderers, however, are asked to submit a statement of the cost of including Brisbane as a port of call merely as an alternative, while paragraph b of the advertisement asks for a sbatement of the cost of a serviceNew Zealand and Honolulu; or, as an alternative; between Brisbane and Vancouver, calling afc Piji and Honolulu. In any case, although Queensland pays her f u l l share of the subsidy, Brisbane is only an alternative port of call.

Edward S (Oxley),"I wish to the Commonwealth Parliament passed legislation which interfered with and greatly injured some of the most valuable industries which the State possesses-industrie s which exist only in one other State, and there to a much smaller extent. I have already placed before the Prime Minister the following telegram received by me from the Premier of Queensland :In conversation with representative P. and U. Company, he was quite satisfied that Brisbane could be served without additional steamers, both companies wait now fourteen days in Sydney, five out of this would be ample for the voyage to and from Brisbane, giving us two days to load and unload. That telegram was also placed before the Postmaster-General. Tenderers are asked, however, to state a price for including Brisbane as a port of call. The very fact of asking for a price implies that it is expected that something extra will have to be paid, and no doubt tenderers will take their clue from the wording of the advertisement, and charge highly for including Brisbane as a port of call. Queensland should be placed in this matter on the same footing as the other States. She is compelled to pay oneseventh of this mail subsidy, although she will get practically very little advantage from the service, but the other States contribute nothing to the Vancouver mail service, although they get nearly as much benefit from it as do Queensland and New South Wales. If all the States were treated alike, the cost of the Vancouver mail service would be distributed equally amongst them. I have a list of Queensland grievances in my hand which would occupy too much time to read now, but I regard this as the last straw. The injustice to Queensland has been so continuous since the inauguration of Federation, and it has been so impossible to get for her that favorable consideration to which she is entitled, that I cannot pretend to be any longer a supporter of the Government. this matter that, until I find that they are willing to do justice to Queensland, and to treat her in the same way as the other States are treated, I shall be quite the opposite of a supporter. sympathize keenly with the representatives of Queensland in their efforts to obtain communication by mail steamer, and I earnestly request the Government to investigate, the matter, with a view to ascertaining whether 10 A 2 it is not possible to accomplish the desired end. sidered the matter. It has been brought before them by deputation. suppose that the whole thing is settled. It is still open to make investigations. I am informed, however, that the extension of the mail service to Brisbane would involve the employment of an additional steamer. in the way of expense. Still, if it can be reasonably managed, Queensland is entitled to this communication. I have always considered that one of the advantages which that State would get from Federation would be the callingof the mail steamers atBrisbane. I stood out very strongly some years ago for the calling of the .mail steamers at Fremantle, which the Minister for Home Affairs was then trying to bring about, and in consequence my action was very severely criticised in the New South Wales Parliament. Nevertheless I believe that I did right. It seems to me to be a matter of very grea.t importance that, if possible, Brisbane should be placed upon the same footing as the other Australian capitals. No doubt the representatives of Queensland will be able to vigorously champion the cause of their State in this matter, and I shall content myself by expressing my sympathy with them. I desire to direct attention to a matter affecting New South Wales. The honourable member for Maranoa said that he was afraid his State was being got at. I do not wish to say that my State is being got at, but there is no doubt that the people of New South Wales are at present intensely agitated over the vexed question of the selection of the capital site. The Prime Ministei has been 1 considering the motion which is to be submitted in connection with this matter for nearly three weeks, and I would urge him to I feel so strongly upon promulgate his plan as early as possible. mulgated early next week. to hear that, and I shall say no more. in sympathy with the representatives of Queensland in their desire to secure further advantages in connection with the mail services.

274,Mr Fowl Er (Perth),"I am heartilyago, and felt very thankful to those who assisted her. It so happens that the capitals of all the States are practically on the seaboard, and therefore every effort should.be made to extend equal conditions with respect to tlie mail services. I realize that there are financial difficulties in the way of extending the service to Queensland, but the Government should be prepared to surmount them, even though the cost involved may be something more than would be approved of by the average Kyabramite. I hope that before long all the capitals of the States will enjoy the direct communication with the outer world which we have found of such great advantage in Western Austra ia Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I also sympathize very much with Queensland in this matter. I think that State is entitled to every consideration, because it has in the past shown very great energy in regard to mail services. It is now paying £10,250 per annum towards the Vancouver mail service, from which all the States derive very considerable advantage. The P. and O. and Orient steamers have to wait so long at Sydney that very little extra expense would be involved in the extension of their voyage to Brisbane. member permit them to carry cargo 1 Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN not desire to prevent the mail steamers from carrying passengers; but I contend that the cargo traffic should be entirely left to Australian steamers. I do not wish to deal with that question now. It will be sufficient for me to indicate my views when the Navigation Bill is before us. land has not derived any very great benefits from federation, and as the expense involved would not be very great, her request should be complied with. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) -Any one listening to the remarks of the honourable member for Maranoa, and the honourable member for Oxley, would imagine that Queensland was lying prostrate on her stomach and that a wicked Government, shod with hob-nail boots, was dancing on her bare back; but there is nothing of that kind. I sympathize with honourable members for Queensland, and all I ask is, "" I s this a business proposition, and will it pay V It .would be ridiculous if, for the sake of mere sentiment, we sent the big mail steamers on to Brisbane. If , on the other hand, the extension of the service will pay, I hope tliat the request of Queensland will be acceded to. The mail steamers should be required to make Hobart one of their ports of call for at least three months in the year. MrL . E. GKOOM -If it will pay. MrO ' MALLEY It is already paying. The mail steamers should be required to call at Hobart during March, April,and May in order to convey to England the Tasmanian apples, which are now competing successfully with the best in the world. The people on the west coast of Tasmania are much aggrieved because arrangements have been made under which they are to have a mail service to Burnie only once a week. MrL . E. GKOOM -T t does not pay. to give them any more. Mr O'MALLEY -Yes, it does pay well. I trust that the Postmaster-General will inquire into the matter, and do his best to afford the fullest possible facilities to the residents of that part of Tasmania. presentatives of Queensland are asking for consideration, not on the grouud of charity, or because Queensland is lying prostrate upon her stomach, as the honourable member for the honourable Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, implies. We are asking for what is just and r i g h t ; I do and we claim that we are as much entitled to the full advantage of the mail services as are the other States. So far from the proposed extension involving any great expense, I am informed on very good authority that the mail steamers could go on to Brisbane and return to Sydney Queenswithin such time that they would still have nine days' stay in that port. The Government of Queensland have agreed to forego the harbour dues and other charges, and in view of the prosperous season which is now anticipated in Queensland, the mail companies may count upon receiving a considerable quantity of cargo from that State to compensate them for any extra expense. The outlook at present in Queensland is much more promising than it has been for a decade past, and there is no doubt that the export trade of the State will improve very much during the next few years. No doubt Queensland has suffered considerably by the disturbance of industrial conditions brought about by Federal legislation, but I deny that she has sustained any permanent injury. She has not had time to experience the",39,Telegraph Offices

I believe that eveiy Federal Aot in which Queensland has been intimately concerned will prove of benefit to that State.

A t the .same time.

I desire to make a complaint with regard to the postal and telegraph facilities in Queensland. I do not know anything regarding the relations existing between the Queensland Railway Department and the Post and Telegraph Department, but a large number -of telegraph offices which were formerly managed by railway officials have been -closed, in my own electorate and elsewhere, in that State. satisfactorily adjusted, and that the residents of the localities affected will not be deprived of facilities which they have enjoyed for years past. Minister for External Affairs) -On e would suppose from what has been stated by some honourable members that -an attempt was made, in connection with the advertisements for tenders for the mail service, to -exclude Queensland. So far, however, from that being the fact, Queensland is being better treated than ever before in respect to the calling of tenders, because this is the is to ascertain upon what terms we can get first occasion on which tenderers have been aiskcd to name a price for a service extending as far as Brisbane. In the next place, the position of the Government must be understood. It is for them to endeavour to -obtain some satisfactory tender for ' the -maintenance of mail communication with Europe. If they were to impose any conditions that would result in no satisfactory tenders being received, they would be very much to blame, because we might be left for a long period after the expiration of the present contract without a service suitable to our conditions and outlaws. When these facts are borue in mind, I may ask honourable members to concede that the right step was to call for alternative tenders. The condition that the steamers should call at Brisbane was not the only alternative. We have offered alternatives with regard to the treatment and carriage of perishable products, with regard to the route, ""and many other matters, in order that we might secure reasonable tenders. It must be recollected that the tenders must be submitted to Parliament. Any proposal which the Government may 1 would not go so far as the make, irrespective of whether they submit it to Parliament before agreeing to it, or whether they agree to it subject to the approval of Parliament, is governed by the I would ask the Prime Minister, fact that it rests with Parliament to say whether one of these tenders shall contain a provision that Brisbane shall be a port of call, whether another shall go only so fatas the previous, tenders went, or whether it shall stop short at another point. It will be recollectod that Adelaide is the present terminus of the mail contracts. The visits of the mail steamers to the two chief centres of population in Australia are made for the purpose of obtaining freight and passenger traffic, which are profitable to the I hope that matters will be companies which secure them. Before the steamers called at Tasmania an offer was made to provide them with a certain quantity of freight, which appears to be payable, because they still continue to call there in the frui t season. If Queensland made a similar offer to the P. and O. or Orient Company, or to any other tenderer, it might secure equally favorable terms with those which Tasmania has obtained, because there is no desire on the part of the Commonwealth Government to prevent the boats going to Brisbane if it pays them to do so. What we have to do a satisfactory tender. It is therefore essential »that we shall obtain comparative tenders, so that we may make a proposal to Parliament, which will be open to its acceptance or rejection. But I cannot consent to import a new element into the tenders by declaring that the vessels must go on to Brisbane. We are prepared to do all that is fair.' If their stay in Sj'dney is of sufficiently long duration that they can afford to travel to Brisbane without necessitating an additional boat, or if the cost of proceeding there appears to be reasonable, these are matters which will be taken into consideration by the Government and Parliament when tenders",40,Telegraph Offices

Buti t is not fair to accuse the Government of treating Queensland with as much injustice as Ireland has received in the past, simply because we are endeavouring to obtain tenders upon a comparative basis. tender for the delivery of mails at Adelaide with no conditions beyond that 1 SirEDMUNDBARTON -Therehasbeen a condition. , It has been one of the alternatives that the steamers shall proceed from Adelaide to Melbourne and Sydney. That has been a customary condition of such contracts. But, while that is so, it is equally an but I venture to say that the population of alternative that they are required to go to Brisbaue. We have invited tenders for both services. There is no alternative that the vessels shall stop at Adelaide. An other clause in the agreement leaves it open to make offers which do not comply with the conditions laid down either as regards the route or otherwise, so that tenderers may, if they choose, put something forward for consideration. We desire to obtain tenders from as many sources as possible, and covering as many contingencies as possible, so that we may see what is before us, and then come to the most equitable arrangement that we can. To the honourable mpmber for ' OxleyI may say that if it were necessary for him to declare that he was no longer a supporter of the Government-altogethe r irrespective of whether the course which the Government are taking warrants such a declaration-it is equally necessary for me to say that since a memorable occasion in Brisbane when, by reason of some unfortunate occurrence, he fell into the arms of the Brisbane CourierI have not regarded hira as a very warm supporter. unsatisfactory part of the Prime Minister's statement is that but for an interjection by the honourable inember for North Sydney, he would have conveyed the impression that there was no necessity for the mail steamers to go beyond Adelaide after they had. delivered their mails there. Previous contracts insisted that the steamers should go beyond Adelaide. that the mail steamers require to go only to Adelaide of all strength. All we ask is that these vessels should proceed as far as Brisbane for the purpose of carrying passengers and cargo, especially perishable cargo, which suffers from transport before it finds its way to the mail steamersproceeding to Europe. The Prime Minister has declared that the conditions under the new contract are more favorable to Queensland than have been any previous conditions. Under Federation it is quite right that they should be so. l t must be remembered that Queensland has been growing at a greater ratio than any of the other States. Australia ? a very great influx of population of late years, Queensland will continue to increase, notwithstanding what has been said regarding the injury done to that State by Federal legislation. I regret that there are somehonorable members who cannot touch upon any grievance without referring to someparticular act on the part of this Parliament which they regard as wrong. In my opinion the abolition of Kanaka labour in Queensland was distinctly the right policy to insist upon. I hold that Queensland has not been injured by Federal legislation, and. if she has I am prepared to accept my shareof the responsibility, and to stand or fall by that legislation. Now is the time for the Commonwealth Government to deal with this question of the mail contracts-whic h is a Federal matter-in a Federal spirit. As theBrisbane River has recently been deepened and widened sufficiently to allow the largest mail steamers trading to Australia to proceed up to the Pinkenba wharf, this is a fitting opportunity for the Government to insist that the successful tenderers shall take the mail steamers to Queensland. It should also be pointed out that the Queensland Stateauthorities are prepared, as far as possible, to offer special facilities to those tenderers, in the shape of a free port. No State in the Commonwealth has been more maligned,, more misunderstood, and more injured than Queensland has by those who are constantly telling the people of the outside world that its productive capabilities are fit only to be worked by Kanakas. What we require is more light. Let the steamers come to Brisbane, and observant travellers will quickly discover a land the capabilities of which they had previously not suspected. No better evidence of the magnificent resources of that country can be furnished than is supplied by the Queensland exhibit at the Victorian Agricultural Show.

Now that Australia is united, we contend that our subsidized mail steamers should touch at all ports. We make this request, nofc as a matter of favour, bufc as a matter of right; and we urge that we are entitled' to have this consideration extended to us. It is idle to say that these tenders are invited solely in relation to the carriage of mails. If that were so, there might be some force in the Prime Minister's contention. But when we look at the terms of the proposed contracts, and note the provisions as fco the storage of perishable goods and other matters, we must see that the Prime Minister realizes that these services are to a great extent to promote trade and commerce, and to encourage production in the various States. New South Wales ancl Victoria have the f u l l benefitof theseservices. They can ship their produce straight way to the markets of the old world by these vessels, and we demand that similar treatment shall be meted out fco the producers of Queensland.

I agree w^fch the honourable member for Oxley as to the Vancouver mail service, but when that question was before the HouseI understood that the Premiers of New South Wales and Queensland had assented to the adoption of the course proposed. Ifc seems to me that there is considerable force in the contention thafc the proposed service is really a new service, the cost of which should be borne by the whole Commonwealth. But even had we framed a resolution in this House, we, could not have determined thafc matter. It is purely a constitutional question, and if fche cost of the service is beingimproperly debited to Queensland, there is no reason why the matter should not be determined by the High Court. I think thatfcheanswer given byfchePrime Minister, although on the face of it plausible, is not by any means satisfactory. unfortunate for the consistency of some honourable members that a question of this kind should have been brought forward on a day during which we have been dealing with a Bill, one of the objects of which is toplace obstacles in the way of vessels carryingpassengers and cargo along our coasts. learned member must not deal with that measure. be very glad if some reasonable arrangement could be made to facilitate the carriage of our produce to the great markets of the world ; but I was filled with astonishment when I heard some of the strongarguments that were addressed to the Prime Ministeri n support of the request that Brisbane should be tine terminal port of call for these vessels.

290,Mr Conroy,"Fo r my part, I should-fairly to all the Statesi n relation to this matter, but it is unfortunate that they -should actually be inviting tenderers to demand a higher subsidy for allowing their vessels to call at Brisbane. The conditions specify that tenderers are -required to mention an additional sura for calling at Brisbane. We may depend upon it that neither the P. and O.

No doubt they will be glad to have a cut in at the -Queensland frozen meat trade, which is bound to develop in good seasons to a very igreat extent. It is essential to the prosperity not only of Queensland, but of the whole of Australia, that we should be in a fair condition to compete with our very -dangerous rival, Argentina, in reference to frozen meat. The only objection I have to -make to the tenders is that they suggest to the companies todemand a higherprice. Such being the case the Companies are bound to -demand it . When the replies to these tenders are received we shall have a better -opportunity of discussing the subject. In the meantime, it is desirable that the Government should send to England a supplementary cable withdrawing the present condition, and calling for absolute tenders, naming Brisbane amongst the ports -of call. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) -It is very nice to be talking about extending the mail service to Brisbane, and I am heartily in accord with those who favour that being done. But why is Brisbane the only port in Queensland that is mentioned ? W h y not Townsville and Rockhampton? The -only reason that I can think of why Brisbane should be mentioned is that if we can get the mail steamers to call at Brisbane, we may later on get the service extended -to other ports. It has been properly said that we are really subsidizing these boats between Adelaide and Sydney to carry perishable products. Why should not that privilege be extended to Queensland ? If the subsidy were merely, for the purpose of the carriage of mails to Adelaide, which is the first port of call at which there is railway connection with the eastern States, -there would not be so much to be said for extending the service to Queensland. But .such is not the case. The Government have invited tenderers to tender for the carriage of perishable produce from Melbourne and Sydney. in? the contract. The Government ask for alternative tenders so that the boats may not only call at Adelaide, where the mail business is practically concluded, but also at Melbourne and Sydney. That is unfair to Queensland. While I am speaking on this matter I would remind my honourable friend the member for Oxley, to whom I give credit for being in earnest in this matter, that some time ago we in Queensland desired extra mail facilities for the benefit of the northern portion of that State, where, there is a population of 100,000 people, who had to be content with practically only one mail service per week. There certainly were two boats per week, but practically there was only one mail service, because there was only a difference of a day between, the two boats. But Mr Philp was by no means anxious to compensate the northern portion of Queensland in tliat respect. He is prepared to go to any expense to secure additional mail facilities for Brisbane, but when it was a question of accommodating about 100,000 people in Northern Queensland, and bringing them in closer touch with the southern portions of Australia, he adopted quite a different attitude. However, the present movement has my sympathy and support, and I endorse everything that has been said on the subject. Although there is no immediate opportunity of securing an extension of mail services to the north of Queensland, I agree that the Government would have shown a more Federal spirit in making Brisbane a port of call, seeing that they are subsidizing the 4 vessels for other than mail services. Sir PHILIPFYSH (Tasmania-Post master-General) I might be satisfied . to leave the matter where the Prime Minister has left it , but probably honourable members might consider me wanting i u courtesy if I did not follow up what has been said by my right honourable colleague. I preface my remarks by saying that I agree with the honourable member for Carpentaria that this subject could better be dealt with later on, when we are discussing.mail services generally, upon the estimates. The honourable member for Maranoa has mentioned the question as to",44,Telegraph Offices

292,Mr Mcdonald,"In the terms ofhow the charges should be apportioned among the States.

I shall be very happyindeed, when the period arrives, when we can deal with the whole of the States of the Commonwealth, not under the bookkeeping sections of the but charging the people of the States per capita for the services rendered. Then we shall get away from the necessity of studying the interests of certain States instead of those of the whole I arn quite in sympathy with very much that has been said, and I am going to show that I have far more sympathy than would be represented by mere expressions. I recall the story of the old lady, who, when she had expressed her sympathy in a certain direction, was asked, ""How much is your sympathy worth ?"" I am going to show how much the sympathy of the Government is worth, as compared with that of some honourable members who have spoken so glibly with regard to the extension of mail services to Queensland. The Government sympathize to the extent that we have practically called for tenders under which tlie steamers will call at Brisbane. not been made previously. only called for tenders for boats to call at Brisbane weekly, but by way of an alternative, for steamers to call fortnightly. cannot obtain the one let us hope that we shall obtain the otlier. A deputation waited upon us during the last few days with reference to this subject, and I put the question to them whether they demanded that the steamer should call at Brisbane at all costs, tenders under those circumstances only, and had not named any alternative, it is very likely that we might not have secured any tender whatever, or we might have received one involving terms that we could not possibly accept. It is important to remember that we must close our contracts with the present Companies very shortly, and must give time for the steamship Companies that .tender for our mail services to make their necessary preparations. Special preparations will be required if Brisbane is included, and although honourable members from Queensland have been told by the agent of the P. and 0.

The Ministers were not able to commit themselves, and ' cannot be said to have committed the Parliament, to the extension to Brisbane regardless of cost; first, because we thought it unlikely that we should get a tender by January, and, secondly, because we believed that the service would be rendered at a comparatively extravagant cost. We areaffording to the steamship companies an opportunity to say how much the extra cost will be. Honourable members have been premature in raising this discussion, because, as they were reminded by the Prime' Minister, the matter will have to be fought Such a condition has out in the House after every tender has We have not been laid upon the table. Honourable members who have doubted the bona fides of Ministers in respect to Queensland are misIf we taken in their view.

Honourable members who are now very proIf we had advertised for perly caring for the interests of Queensland especially, may rest assured that, if the travelling thus far should not be regarded asvery detrimental to tlie business of the Companies, they will secure their end. I may point out that the steamers are not visitingany States by reason of the subsidies which are granted by the Governmeut. Queensland may accomplish its object, as Tasmania did, by entering into a contract for a weekly supply of freight. If the people of Brisbane or Rockhampton can offer that inducement no doubt they will secure the visits of the mail steamers. gentleman think that we are doing enough in providing the Vancouver service without asking us to pay any more 1",45,Telegraph Offices

298,Mr Page,"Does not the honorableservice waa taken up by New Soath Wales .and Queensland, and for the portion of the service which is rendered by those States, through the contract, to other States payment is made. Unfortunately it amounts to a small sum, because the other States send most of their letters in another direction. .gentleman call a small sum 1 In Queensland we are paying over £10,000 a year. are paying a small sum towards the Vancouver service by reason of the fact that most of their letters go in another direction. Sir PHILIPFYSH It is an absolute fact. How can the honourable memher or anybody else be dissatisfied with a Government whioh is now calling for tenders for a service and wishing to learn, as all business men ought to learn, the cost of that service before it is undertaken1 When the Honse is asked to consider the tenders will he the time fbr the representatives of Queensland to ascertain whether or not Ministers sympathize with their request. The Government have not been forgetful of the perishable products of Queensland. We have asked for two alternative tenders at specially reduced rabes of freight. The cost of those reduced rates will also have to be borne by States which have no interest in chilled meat or frozen butter. The charges will be gd. per lb. for butter, and £d. per lb. for carcass meat, which includes beef and mutton. The Queensland companies which are in the habit'of shipping chilled meat will derive un advantage, I hope, from our securing a maximum rate for the next seven years. Because, once a maximum rate {or seven years has been fixed, it is not at all unlikely that the other large carrying boats will start to compete for freight at even lower rates. I . should have been satisfied to leave this matter where it was left by the Prime Minister, only that I desired to express my satisfaction o» regards the terms of this important contract-the first of the kind which Australia has ever sought to enter into, because these contracts have always been made by the Imperial Government-that no objection has been taken except that it has not been made an absolute condition that, regardless of cost, the steamers should go toBrisbane. Although that condition has not heen made by the Government, still we believe that when the tenders are opened it will be found that the extra charge for the steamers going to Brisbaneparticularly if Queensland can offer some inducement in the way of freight-wil l not be. so hea vy as to prevent our entering into a contract which will embrace its ports and satisfy its people. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.44 p.m.",46,Telegraph Offices
