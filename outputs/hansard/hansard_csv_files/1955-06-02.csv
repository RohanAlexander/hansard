External Affairs whether it is a fact that the Singapore Government has expressed opposition to the stationing, in Singapore, of Australian forces. Is that a clear result of a communication made by the Minister to the Chief Minister at Singapore? Government of Singapore, by expression through the channels that the right honourable member has mentioned, or otherwise, has expressed direct opposition to the stationing of troops in Singapore. The matter has not been the subject of government determination, or of inquiry in the terms used by the right honourable gentleman in his question. like to ask the Minister for External Affairs a question supplementary to that asked by the Leader of the Opposition. 1 preface my question by reminding the Minister that the elections in the Eederated Malay States, which are due to take place in July, will be contested by the People's Action Party, or P.A.P. as it is known for short, which is making the main plank of its election campaign programme, opposition to the stationing of Australian troops in Malaya. I wish to know from the right honourable gentleman whether it is a fact that the British Government has requested the Australian Government to withhold a decision on the question of sending troops to Malaya until after those elections are over, in order to persuade the people of Malaya that no such plan is, in fact, mooted by the Australian Government. Is it also a fact that tbe Australian Government has also been requested by the British Government to give serious consideration to not persisting with the request made by the American Government for this Govern* ment to send Australian troops to Malaya at all? I want to know also whethei the Government is prepared, in the event of the People's Action Party winning the election in Malaya, which will indicate that the people of Malaya, as distinctable gentleman is making a lot of statements. I cannot detect very much in the way of a question. 1 I ask the Minister for appreciate the point, Mr Speaker, but this is such an involved question, and so terribly important, that I am sure that you will appreciate that it is not possible to put it into a few brief words. I have almost finished now. ""Will the Minister, in the event of the People's Action Party being successful at the elections, accept its success as an expression of opinion by the people of Malaya in opposition to this Government's decision to send Australian troops to Malaya? In that event, will the Government reverse its decision, because the sending of troops to Malaya in the face of such an expression of opposition by the people of Malaya to their presence in that country would be tantamount to an invasion of one part of the British Commonwealth by another part of it? I believe that I would know-the British Government has never made representations in the direction mentioned by the honourable member. It is quite improper to canvass the views of a particular party -before an election in another country over which Australia has no jurisdiction, but even if it were not, I think that the statement of the honourable member would be quite wrong. I do not propose to add fuel, to the flames by bringing this matter to the point of controversy. It is entirely wrong, and against .the interests of this country, for the honourable member to say these things. the Courts-martial Appeals BillI urged that it be amended in another place to give effect to the principle that appeals shall be possible from the decisions of not only courts martial but also medical boards.

I pointdirect questions to Ministers and that it is the privilege of Ministers to decide whether they will answer questions at all, or the way in which they will answer tb emquestion fully because it relates to an important aspect of employment policy. [ want to tell the House what the Government is doing. The honourable member covered a good deal of ground in putting his question to me. The question has gone on the record. I request the right to explain, on behalf of the Government, the action we are taking in relation to the matter. I have every intention of dealing with the point he raised. It is relevant to that point to explain to the House that, thanks to full employment, difficulties which might otherwise have arisen to an intense degree in respect of elderly persons have not been experienced on that scale. The fact of the matter is that in the whole of Australia at the present time only about 3,000 persons, of both sexes and of all ages, are drawing the unemployment benefit. That is a record which, I suggest, is without parallel in any other industrialized country in tbe world. The particular passage to which the honourable gentleman has referred appeared in a statement prepared by me for submission to the Ministry of Labour Advisory Council, on which managements and trade unions are represented, so that we could examine together that element of unemployment, which relates to persons who are regarded by some employers as being beyond employment age. The whole purpose of the move made by us was to demonstrate to employers that there are many years of good service left in people who have gone beyond the ages specified in the advertisements, and to impress upon employers the desirability of providing employment opportunities for such persons. Anybody who studies the statement that we put out at that time will see the reasons we advanced and the case we stated on behalf of elderly persons in tbe community who may be seeking work. I am happy to say that, as a result of our efforts in that and other directions, never have the prospects of employment for elderly persons in this country been brighter tban they are now. directed to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, is supplementary to a question asked by the honourable member for Robertson. Has any ex pansion taken place recently of the Australian trade commissioner service overseas? If so, will the Minister indicate whether new posts have been established, and whether any extra posts and additional staff for existing posts are contemplated in the future? To what extent is the trade commissioner service co-operating with Australian export industries ? functions of the trade commissioner service is to maintain close contact with the Australian export industries. One of the mechanisms of maintaining that contact is the Federal Export Advisory Committee. The representatives of chambers of manufactures and chambers of commerce, the National Farmers' Union and such appropriate bodies, meet the representatives of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. Out of this arrangement flow suggestions for the investigation and exploration of new trade opportunities overseas. This is a constant process. In recent times, new trade commissioner offices have been opened, out of this background, in Rome, Trinidad, Bonn in Western Germany, Salisbury which is the capital of the new Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Rangoon, and at Auckland, in addition to the office already existing at Wellington in New Zealand, which, incidentally, is the principal and growing market for the export of our secondary industry products. It is not fully understood, or recognized, that Australia is at the present time, notwithstanding cost problems here, constantly expanding the export of our secondary industry products. Even motor vehicles made in Australia are finding a market overseas to the tune, if not already to be spoken of in millions of pounds, then of certainly more than one million pounds, and it is growing at that rate. The matter of opening additional trade commissioner offices in new areas abroad is constantly under review, and, as I have said in reply to the question, to which this question is",11,Employment Of Ageing

Minister for Health been drawn to the report of the New South ""Wales Director General of Public Health, in which it was stated that, according to the latest United Nations reports on narcotics, Australia has the highest per capita consumption in the world of narcotic drugs. As most of these drugs are used in highly-advertised patent medicines as sedatives and so on, is the Minister prepared to call a conference of State Ministers with a view to reaching some general over-all Australian control of this patent medicine racket and introducing legislation to protect the Australian people? is that certain representations have been made by the World Health Organization with regard, for instance, to heroin, and the Australian Government has prohibited the importation of it into the Commonwealth. The question of the limitation of other narcotics in patent medicines is a matter for State legislation, and not for Commonwealth action, because it is quite impossible to prohibit the total importation of those drugs. I shall examine the honourable gentleman's suggestion and see whether it is possible or .worth-while to summon such a conference. QANTAS EMPIRE AIRWAYS Civil Aviation inform me whether it is true that Qantas Empire Airways has purchased the Union Club premises in Bligh-street, Sydney, for £500,000? As Qantas Empire Airways is building new premises nearby, what is the purpose of this purchase? Furthermore, if it is proposed to build on this site in Bligh-street, the signature of the right honourable which will front the new Elizabeth-street extension at some future time, will an opportunity be given to the Public Works Committee to conform any new buildings erected on that site to harmonize with new Commonwealth offices shortly to be built in this new extension of Elizabeth Street, so that a substantial Commonwealth centre can be established which will be a very great contribution to the development of the City of Sydney? member would know, he being keenly interested in the city of Sydney, Qantae Empire Airways Limited has owned a block of land in Hunter-street for a good many years. About a year ago, it was decided that the company would build a block of administrative offices on the land. Those offices eventually will front Hunter-street and Elizabeth-street. Owing to the realinement of Elizabeth-street, one of the proposed Elizabeth-street entrances of the new building will be blocked out, and there will be no access to the rear of the premises. The land was purchased in order to ensure that the new building would have access from Elizabeth-street and Hunter-street. 1 shall be pleased to consider the question of having the Public Works Committee consider any new building that may be associated with the project. tion to you, Mr Speaker, in your capacity as chairman of the Library Committee.

35,Sir Eric Harrison,"In the firstin three parts would mean that it would give three times the production that we require at present and at three times the cost that would be incurred if only one factory were erected. reason why the output of each factory should not be reduced? posed plant has been designed to give a certain output. Not only would the triplication of the plant raise serious technical problems in relation to output but it would also raise the problem of finance, management and transport. Such a plant would cost three times as much as a single unit. nothing about it. have said is perfectly true. Nobody should know better than tbe Leader of the Opposition that maximum production is not achieved by the triplication of plant. It is much more economical to have a certain production from one unit tban to have the same production from three small units. The whole of .the industrial expansion of the United States of America is a testimony to that principle. I have no doubt that what the Leader of the Opposition has said was in the mind of the honourable member for New England; but in establishing this factory, the Government has considered tbe history of all filling factories in the free nations of the world. a personal explanation in regard to a matter that was raised in the House during my absence last week. I was misrepresented by the Leader of the AntiCommunist Labour party ( Mr Joshua) in relation to what I said both inside and outside the House. In the first place, lie has sought, in my view, to create the impression that there are honourable members on this side of the House who are not wholly behind their leader in his attitude on foreign affairs. In order to bolster up his case, the honourable member for Ballarat related a conversation that he alleged took place outside the House, and he was called to order by you, Mr Speaker, for quoting from earlier debates. The honourable member said that one of my statements was that Australian is there any troops would be welcome in Malaya. I never made such a statement. What1 said, and what everybody knows I have advocated in this House, was that I considered that, before any troops were sent from Australia to South-East Asian countries, a delegation from both sides of the House should go to those countries so that we would be better informed than we have been by any speeches that, have been made by anybody here. I was amazed at the state of ignorance of South-East Asian affairs that was displayed by many honourable members. The inference to be drawn from the speech of the honourable member, both before he was called to order and afterwards, was that I was one of the members of the Opposition who were dissatisfied with their leader's policy. My position was made clear three weeks earlier when I stated in this House as follows:I support the action of the Leader of the Opposition in this debate in every particular. Nothing could be plainer tban that. But apparently the honourable member sought an opportunity in the Hotel Kurrajong. after I had left the dining room to go to the office to buy an evening Herald, to raise the question with me. I did not seek it ; he sought it. What he said Opposition members interjecting. jected to a good deal of interruption. ruption is coming from the honourable member's own side. these things, and I am disturbed about, references to conversations that are alleged to have taken place outside tbe House. WhatI said was that I was not prepared to see any Australian troops sent to Malaya unless or until a delegation had gone to make inquiries and had reported back to the Parliament.

He may not deplore anything. . repeat, that I did not discuss this or any other matter with this misrepresenter of private conversations, and I feel that, as the statement was made in my absence, which has delayed correction, no person holding a position in the official Labour party could afford to let it pass. My strong feeling is that, when people speak to you and when, in ordinary courtesy, you reply but do not carry on a conversation, you should not be misrepresented in this House in the way that the Leader of the Anti-Communist Labour party has sought to do. There is much more [ could say, but I do not want to belabour the point. gentleman claim to have been misrepresented ? inference has been drawn from what I have said. The bonorable member for .Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) gave the House to understand that there were people in Malaya who would not be opposed to the appearance of Australian troops in that country, because they were military people and it was in their way of profession to have troops to work with. For that reason, they were not opposed to the appearance of troops in Malaya. [ think that is a fair statement. I cannot see that tbe honourable member has been misrepresented by anything that I have said. Honourable members interjecting, able members will be good enough to maintain order, we shall get through those matters much more quickly. fore, that my remarks which the honourable member for Maribyrnong has quoted are a misrepresentation at all. The second point is, that when a man makes a statement, and when one knows that he bas been to Malaya quite recently, one would expect him to substantiate his remark by some direct knowledge of his own, and his speech did not able member is now dealing with the honourable member for Maribyrnong. He can only deal with misrepresentation of his own position. anything I said was a fair statement, and that the honourable member for Maribyrnong had not substantiated his statement in any way by his own experience in Malaya, which was the point I made ir my speech. Mr J. R, FRASER I wish to make s personal explanation, because something that I said in this House recently may have misled the House and have done an injustice to an individual. On the 25th May, in the course of a question to the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) in relation to the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory, I asked the Minister whether he would investigate a report that an owner of business premises recently constructed at Ainslie at a capital cost of about £5,000 was seeking to obtain rentals totalling £45 a week from them. I desire to inform tbe House that my information was incorrect. I have now been informed that the cost of these buildings was £10,800, not £5,000, and that the weekly rentals payable total £40, not £45. I regret that I unwittingly misled the House and perhaps did an injustice to the owner of the premises. Mr W. M. BOURKE I wish to make a personal explanation.

It did not give a report of the remarks I made concerning the honourable member for AVerriwa, upon which he based the attack. If a full and balanced report were made, it would be clear that the extreme language which the honourable member for Werriwa used concerning the remarks that I made was completely unjustified. In the course of the debate on Tuesday night, I cited two paragraphs from the Sydney Morning Herald's report of a speech which the honourable member for Werriwa had made at a conference early this year. The Sydney Morning Herald did not repeat the remarks that I made.

I did not admit yesterday in the debate, which, in his characteristic fashion, the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr W. M.

I said, as he and all other honourable members will be able to ascertain by perusing the daily Hansard later to-day, that I bad not been fully reported. It was the newspaper's own function to decide what was most sensational or most news-worthy in what I said. It chose to repeat some of tbe portions of my remarks. I furthermore said that I could not ascertain whether the honourable member for Fawkner had repeated all that the newspaper had reported of my remarks on that occasion, since that particular copy of the Sydney Morning Herald was no longer on the library file, having disappeared on the day before yesterday. I furthermore said that if the honourable member for Fawkner had pursued his researches, as one would expect a person who belongs to the same profession as I do, and a person who holds office in this House, to do, for a few further issues, he would have found that the Sydney Morning Herald, in characteristic and just fashion had, in its "" Letters to the Editor"" column, published a letter from me on this very matter.

[ wish to speak to it. Eirst, I wish to ask that the committee furnish the House with a copy of its report. An attendant is now handing me a copy of it. I tbink it is extraordinary that the chairman of a committee to which matters have been referred by this House, should simply rise in his place in the House and present the report of the committee without adding anything whatsoever to his mere announcement that he is presenting the report. If a matter referred to the Committee of Privileges is thought by this Eouse to be of sufficient importance to warrant its reference to that committee, surely the consequent report of the committee should be held to be important enough to warrant consideration by the House. .This is tbe first opportunity I have had of even knowing what the committee has decided in relation to the matters referred to it as a result of motions moved by the honourable member for Fawkner and by me. As far as I can gather from my necessarily brief study of this report since it was handed to me a minute or so ago by an attendant, the committee has decided that statements made by an honourable member in this chamber about another honourable member are not matters of concern to the Committee of Privileges. In other words, the committee has decided that, whatever statements may be made, by an honourable member in this House, the Committee of Privileges has no jurisdiction in relation to them, and that no breach of privilege occurs, irrespective of what allegations or reflections may be made by the particular honourable member concerned. It has been suggested to me that, in view of the disability that we are faced with in endeavouring to discuss a report which has just been distributed, I should ask for leave to continue my remarks at a later date. I therefore ask for such leave. Leave granted; debate adjourned.

80,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar),".1 do not intend to delay the House long in regard to this matter, which deals with a question of procedure. I point out, however, that if the matter is allowed to lie it is unlikely that the bill will be brought to any conclusion before the Mouse rises for the recess, which, I underof the matters referred to in the bill is stand it will do next week. In those circumstances this whole matter could not be brought before tbe House again. It can only be brought before the House by the motion that I have moved. You can understand, Mr Speaker, that an honourable member has no chance, except by an absolute majority, of moving the suspension of Standing Orders successfully except on every alternate Thursday. This is the last Thursday in the present sessional period. I have, therefore, taken the only means that are available to me to bring this matter once again to the attention of the House. In doing so, and in regard to the bill which is the subject of this motion, I remind the House that, like all honourable members who are not members of the Government, under the provisions of section 56 of the Constitution I cannot bring in a bill for an executive act. As a result, the bill which I presented to the House certainly does not, in my mind, cover all the things that should be done. Indeed, it seems to me that the most important of those things are in the realm of executive acts rather than planning, although planning is an essential ingredient also. But it is urged that further action be taken on this matter, and this is the real point to which the House should direct its mind. Our country is doing far less in the realm of civil defence than are other countries which are threatened, perhaps to a greater degree than we are, but not to a much greater degree. The House already knows that the per capita expenditure on civil defence in Australia is ludicrously below the corresponding figure in both tbe United Kingdom and the United States of America able gentleman may not argue about civil defence matters. The question to which he is speaking refers to the suspension of the Standing Orders and nothing else. Mr ""WENTWORTH -Indeed, I am directing my mind to the urgency of the suspension of the Standing Orders, and I am pointing out that, since this bill and the Government's decision are not likely to be otherwise debated, then the urgency certainly a matter for proper consideration by the House in regard to this motion. I am simply directing my mind, not to what is contained in the bill which, as we all know , it would be out of order for me 7 to do, but to the question of urgency in relation to the subject with which the bill deals. That is a proper matter to be debated in regard to a motion of this character. The Government's plans, so far announced, are still inadequate to deal with the very real danger that faces us. It is urgent that something should be done towards putting the civil defence of this country on a proper basis. The implementation of the Government's plans is still a nugatory thing. In these circumstances, the House has a very real duty to direct its mind to the urgency of the situation. I do not intend to' delay tbe House, but I do intend to make it clear that, apart from this bill, the measures that the Government has taken are quite inadequate to deal with the situation which has arisen. It has been said that we should do nothing, lest we terrify people. I do not believe that that is a proper argument for further delay. It is true that the facts are likely to terrify, but it is much better able member is now debating civil defence. debating the urgency of doing something about it. I am not referring to the contents of the bill for, as you properly point out. I am not entitled to do that. It is quite true that the facts, wben known, are likely to cause terror. It is far better to get that terror over now so that the people can be inoculated against it than to allow the event which the enemy controls to coincide",19,Suspension Of Standing Obders

83,Mr Wentworth,"No sir, I amable member is now dealing with terror and all sorts of things. It looks as if I will have to become a terror. greatest respect, sir, no one has ever regarded you as being anything else. I do not intend to delay the House but this is the only opportunity given me by the Standing Orders to point out that, in my view, the plans so far announced by the Government are inadequate. I hope and trust that that will not remain true, and that the Government will take executive action in the way I have suggested. I proposed pressing this matter to the vote, but the Prime Minister made it plain to me that he would regard that as a vote of censure, necessitating the resignation of his Government. That would certainly have served no useful purpose. would in no respect be better than the present one; indeed, I believe that in every respect it would be far worse. If the Government has failed, as I suggest, it is on this front alone. not permit the honourable member to proceed in this manner. The question before the House is the suspension of the Standing Orders. The honourable member has a perfect right to defeat the Government or let it alone, as he likes. in other respects, the Government has done a very good job. able member will resume his seat.

92,Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [11.34].,"earlier days, the House of Commons did not wish to have the press report its .proceedings and, with that great capacity for improvising situations, which is so noticeable in the English character, a -fiction was created. The press gallery was placed behind the Speaker's chair, -so that the Speaker could not see it. _We 'have adopted that practice, too. We have three other galleries, which are intended for the use of the public. Back in the depression years, in the late 1930's, when Canberra became the permanent capital and the Parliament assembled here, the gallery on the southern side of the chamber was handed over by the then Speaker, Sir Littleton Groom, for the use of the press. That position has been continued by succeeding Speakers. The gallery on the left of the Speaker's chair is not always fully occupied by the press. On most occasions there are very few pressmen to be seen in it. I understand that there are something like 60 or 70 pressmen utilizing the facilities provided for them in and around Parliament House. These 60 or 70 journalists represent the Australian metropolitan daily and weekly press, the Australian provincial daily and weekly press, and, in some instances, overseas newspapers and chains of newspapers. The time has arrivedI always held this view when I was a Minister^-when the press should be asked to vacate that gallery, which they now occupy and have occupied for nearly twenty years. . I believe the press should be asked to vacate tliat gallery because, as we are in an age of syndication, not so many pressmen are required to report the proceedings of the Parliament. Because of changes in readers' habits, and particularly because the proceedings are broadcast to the nation, the reports are neither extensive, nor always informative, nor always so printed that they give a fair and accurate account of the proceedings. In other words, a good deal of the reporting now is unbalanced. The tendency is to play up the vituperative side of debates, and less attention is given to a full report of proceedings. Therefore, not so many pressmen are required; and certainly not so many pressmen are using the gallery on your left, Mr Speaker, or the gallery immediately behind you. There is always the exceptional occasion. When tbere is a foreign affairs debate, a motion of want of confidence in the Government, a debate on some important bill or the presentation of tbe budget and speeches by Opposition leaders in criticism of it, the press galleries may be fuller than they normally are. I have said that there are 60 to 70 pressmen in more or less continuous attendance here when the Parliament is sitting. There are many here when we are not sitting. They have relations with Ministers and departments, and they must remain in Canberra. The pressmen are here in great numbers when the House is sitting, but they are not to be seen using the galleries. Therefore, there cannot be any objection to handing over the gallery on tbe southern side of the chamber to the general public. BeforeI proceed to argue the case for the general public, I should like to say that only a fortnight ago I took the precaution of checking attendances, just to see the extent to which the galleries were being used by the press. I made checks at intervals of roughly a quarter of an hour. At 8.15 p.m., there were five pressmen in the gallery on your left, Mr Speaker, and there were another five in the gallery behind you. At 8.30 p.m., there were six pressmen on the left of your seat and seven above you. At 8.45 p.m., the figures were four and four; at 9 p.m., three and ten; at 9.20 p.m., four and eight: at 9.45 p.m., three and four; at 10 p.m., two and three; and at 10.30 p.m., six and eleven. It cannot be said that the proper press gallery was not large enough to accommodate all the pressmen in attendance in this House on that night. That being so, I suggest that the time has arrived when the interests of the public should be given the consideration they deserve. time? member for Calare( Mr Howse) had not asked that question, because comparisons are invidious. I should not like to be the cause of losing even one vote for him",21,House Of Representatives Gallery Accommodation
93,_ Mr Howse,Who was speaking at the,22,House Of Representatives Gallery Accommodation
94,Mr Calwell,"I wish the honorablein his electorate. However, he was not one of those who spoke during that time. The population of this country is growing. Facilities for reaching Canberra are better than they used to be. Certain tourist organizations are bringing people to Canberra, and one of the attractions for tourists is Parliament House. It is a common sight in the evenings, and sometimes during the early part of the day, to find members of the public from all over Australia lined up in queues, waiting for seats in the two galleries open to the public. On many occasions, I have seen people who had come here from the far corners of Australia turned away because the press gallery was not open to them. The press gallery is practically empty all the time, but they cannot be admitted to it, under existing conditions, and not without an opinion from this House as to how the galleries shall be used. Some of the visitors who are turned away from this House arc found seats in the Senate. I make no observation on whether that is a suitable alternative or not. Thoy are able to get into the Senate but they cannot see the House of Representatives. If the Senate does not happen to be sitting, they may have to go away altogether without having had the opportunity to see the Parliament in session. If these people are prepared to wait around for two hours-while on your left remains empty-they able to fill positions vacated by some persons who have arrived earlier. I know it is contended by a number of peoplesome inside this House and .others outside-that who fill the galleries when the big debates are in progress. Well, I do not think that is so, but I consider that the general public, whether they come from Canberra or any other part of Australia, have the first right to the use of the galleries. They have more right to the gallery under discussion, which I want to be made available to the public. When I make that statement, I am speaking on behalf of the party which, by unanimous decision, has decided that the gallery should be made available to the public, and not to the press. Mr Caltoell. dation should be provided. seating accommodation to be provided in all the galleries. We think that the seats in the northern gallery are very hard, and that the seats in the gallery in front of you, Mr Speaker, over the clock, are also too hard. We ask for the furniture to be modernized, and the facilities improved. Reverting to the observation I was making about the people of Canberra, it is not true that they flock in, as it were, to the first night of a new performance. They come because they are entitled to come. I think that the press proprietors themselves should be reasonable about this matter, and they should use the facilities that were originally provided. We .might even modernize those facilities for the use of the press, but the proprietors should not continue to demand something to which they have no right at all. We reached an extraordinary position recently, sir. I understand that you, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and some other people spoke to the chairman of the Press Gallery, and requested that that gallery be made available to honourable senators who could not be. seated in the area provided for them in this chamber, so that they would be able to hear the Prime Minister's speech on foreign affairs, and the report this gallery of his recent visit abroad. After some may be discussion, the chairman of the Press Gallery had to be told by the Speaker and the Prime Minister that the gallery, or portion of it, would be made available to tbe senators. That is an intolerable it is the people of Canberra position, in my view. When we wish to make available any portion of the gallery that belongs to the public, the Speaker's .word should be sufficient, and the seating accommodation should be arranged so that senators or anybody else wbo come into that particular gallery should not have to stand for an hour, or an hour and a half, when they could be seated in comfort. That would be the position if we adopted the attitude we ought to adopt. The British House of Commons would not tolerate the position we have in Canberra for one minute. Very few pressmen are to be seen around the .King's",22,House Of Representatives Gallery Accommodation

96,Mr Calwell,"We want properHall or the corridors. They belong to one category, arid they get special privileges for special work. Those who report the House are in another category, and they never leave their particular chamber. The way proceedings have gone on in Canberra for years has developed a situation which is not satisfactory to the general public, not satisfactory to the Parliament, and, I suggest, not satisfactory to the press themselves. The press have their rights and their duties, but Canberra is now becoming a big city, and it should be the privilege and the obligation of the press proprietors of this country to provide their own Newspaper House, as they have been talking of doing for 37 years. They could locate most of their staff in that building, and transact most of their business from it. Tbey should not be using the facilities of this House as if it were a factory or a newspaper office, or anything of the sort. The Government of which I was a member gave them many additional facilities, more than I would bave given them, in actual truth. Those facilities were provided for them, and a rental was charged, which you, Mr Speaker, in my view very properly, discontinued, because they began to claim that tbey bad some right to occupancy of Parliament House itself, when honourable members could not obtain accommodation for tbe proper discharge of their duties to their electorates. Tins is a. situation which should be resolved, and must be resolved, sooner or later. T. think it should be resolved now. WhatI bave had to say is in no spirit of antagonism towards individual pressmen. on behalf of the Labour party, that we want to get. a proper regulation of the use of galleries. Consequently, I have brought this motion forward, and I hope the House will carry it. The motion cannot be regarded in any way as being critical of the Government; it cannot be regarded in any way as being offensive to any pressmen or any press interests, [t simply statesTliat in tlie opinion of this House, the available gallery accommodation for tlie general press should be reviewed, having regard to the necessity for providing greater facilities for members of the public. I am satisfied that the public who come to Canberra, and the public who will want to come to Canberra at 3ome time in the future to hear the proceedings of this House, will be unanimous in their support of this motion. seconded ? second the motion, and I desire briefly to support it. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) has given very clearly his reasons why he believes that the accommodation should be increased in this Parliament. Just in passing, Mr Speaker, I mention that the Parliament is not the only place where accommodation is somewhat crowded, but I do not intend to trespass on that aspect at this moment. In view of the great interest taken in political affairs in this country at the present time, and in view also of the large increase in the number of visitors to Canberra, who come here as members of organized tours or by other means, it is quite apparent to those who see tbe queues outside the chamber, practically every night of the week and every day, that there is not enough accommodation in the chamber for those who desire to see, at first hand, bow the National Parliament works. I do not say that it will always be possible to provide the accommodation necessary for all who want to come into the chamber. It is evident when prominent speakers and radio stars are available at certain times, that practically every one desires to come in ; and that applies also when matters of great moment, which have a bearing on all sections of the community, are being 1 am saying, discussed. gentleman a radio star? gentleman for that compliment. I certainly did not include myself in that category. I see no reason why a raised dais at the back of the Speaker's gallery should not be constructed, so that visitors seated at the rear might see more of the House than they do wben they are seated on the same level as the people in front of them. Although that gallery is supposed to be",23,House Of Representatives Gallery Accommodation

100,Mr Daly,"I thank the honorablethe best in this House, I suggest that people seated in the public gallery at the King's Hall end of the chamber obtain a better view, because they are able to look down on the scene. Visitors seated in the Speaker's gallery often cannot see what is happening and sometimes cannot bear what is being said. It might be of addeavour to ensure that all public visitorsvantage if the rear part of the Speaker's gallery were raised, and if similar action were taken in the Senate chamber, in order to enable visitors to obtain a better view of the Parliament in action. Possibly, the best solution would be for the government of the day to proceed, over the next few years, with the construction of a permanent Parliament House on the chosen site at CapitalH ill , in order to provide adequate accommodation for members and visitors and the necessary facilities for members. Wbether accommodation should be provided also for the members of various staffs that work here when Parliament is in session is a mattter that will have to be decided. As the honourable member for Melbourne bas stated, at the present time it is not possible for all of the visitors who wish to see the Parliament in action to obtain admission to the public galleries at the appropriate time. I agree with the honourable member that visitors are entitled to come here, whenever they wish, to see the Parliament at work. Many visitors to Canberra come here only periodically or even only once in their life-time. Many of them take great pleasure in meeting their local member here and in seeing him participating in the work of the Parliament. That is more particularly the case in respect of supporters of honourable members on this side of the House. tourists and visitors to Canberra are able to spend only an hour or an hour and a half in this city, and they go away disappointed when they cannot obtain admission to the public galleries to see the Parliament in action. I do not know whether it is possible to extend the existmember for Grayndler ( Mr Daly), who ing galleries by adding another tier to them-, or whether, if it is possible to do so, tbe expense would be justified since a new permanent building is proposed. I think we all are inclined to take things for granted when we consider the problems of accommodation and housing. We Mr Daly. are inclined to lei things stand and do nothing practical in an endeavour to alleviate the inconvenience that many people suffer. I support the motion, which has been, submitted in all good faith by the honourable member for Melbourne in an enwho wish to see the Parliament in action shall be able to obtain admission to the public galleries and that those, who obtain seats in the galleries shall enjoy reasonable comfort and be able to see and hear everything so that they may enjoy the feeling that, perhaps, they are more or less participating in the work of the Parliament. I suggest that, as an immediate measure, the Speaker's gallery be raised, in order that visitors, many of whom naturally wish to sit in that gallery, may readily see and hear what happens in this chamber while they arepresent. It would be much better, also, if bonorable members who are seated near to that gallery could be kept clearly apart from tbe public gallery. It is not possible, with tbe present crowded accommodation, to do this. With those few constructive suggestions, I support the motion. I trust that it will bear fruit and that ample accommodation will soon be available for visitors who wish to seethe Parliament working. I have in mind' particularly the time when tbe nextLabour Government will hold office and' when legislation of real value will beintroduced. Visitors in their thousandswill wish to watch the enactment of such legislation. Many Vice-President of the Executive Council' and Minister^ for Defence Production) [11.59] I listened with great interestto the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), whose remarks made a lot of sense. I was particularly interested' also, in the observations of the honourable suggested that various platforms should be constructed about the chamber. Itseems that the honourable member resrards this House as some sort of a stadium, about which tier upon tier of seats should' be provided for visitors to watch the F™«e , as the honourable member said, in action. I am aware that he is greatly",24,House Of Representatives Gallery Accommodation
101,Sir Eric Harrison (Wentworth,"interested in the noble art of boxing. Perhaps he is unable to think of this House except as a stadium. This chamber was never designed as a departure from the conventional plan for a chamber of a British parliament. One has only to see the House of Commons to learn how greatly limited is the accommodation provided for the general public in the Mother Parliament. In the chambers of the various State parliaments, also, the accommodation made available for the general public is very much limited. This building was designed on the conventional basis. Since it was designed, Australia's population has increased considerably and, as a consequence, the Parliament has been enlarged. I u Canberra, we are far from the great centres of population to which adequate press reports of proceedings here must be transmitted so that the public may be informed about the proceedings of the National Parliament. This fact causes major problems. It is only a short time since the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), a representative of the Opposition, and other leading figures in this House, with you, Mr Speaker, examined this building to ascertain whether additional space could be made available to the general public and to review the accommodation provided for the press. I think each and every one of those who made that inspection with you, sir, agreed that it is almost impossible to provide additional space for the public. In this building, we have, and must have, adequate press representation. That is the reason why the gallery along the wall of the chamber behind the Opposition was made available to the press. Canberra, by reason of its isolated position, is subwait for admission to the galleries, but it jected to repeated waves of visitors from the various States who come here to see the Parliament at work, especially since large-scale bus tours have been introduced. They wish to spend a short time in the public galleries and then proceed on their travels according to the schedules of the bus companies. All of these circumstances cause problems in this building. Visitors from all of the States are entitled to see the National Parliament at work, and it grieves me much to see long queues of visitors extending across King's Hall barred by attendants from admission to the crowded public galleries. That sort of thing should not happen. At present, all we are able to do is point out those difficulties. What can we do to remove them? Nothing less than a new Parliament House with adequate gallery accommodation will solve the problem. The space available to the press must not be reduced, because the newspapers need all the space they have in order to provide the necessary press reports of proceedings in the Parliament. It is true that, in the press gallery on the wall behind the Opposition, a little space is available, but it is sufficient only for standing. It is impossible to put in an additional row of chairs in that gallery if the newspaper reporters are to be free to move to and fro in the course of their duties. From time to time, when major debates take place in this House, you, Mr Speaker, have allowed visitors to be admitted to that gallery, and I have seen a long line of them standing, uncomfortably, at the back of the press gallery to watch the House at work. It is all very well for us to say that tbe problem must be solved. What is the solution? Thf honourable member for Melbourne, if 1 did not misunderstand him, finds the solution in the curtailment of press representation. I do not agree Avith him. Press reports are provided by the newspaper reporters in this building for more than one capital city. The problem is greater than is that in a State parliament, where, generally speaking, only the local press has to be served Newspapers ir. all of the States and also overseas must bp represented here. It is unfortunate that visitors must seems that the only practicable solution while the Parliament meets in this building is to make available to the public the little additional space that can be 'provided by extending towards the rear the press gallery on the wall behind members of the Opposition. I do not know whether it would be possible to extend that, gallery further towards the rear. An extension would be a major building operation, but if it could be made, it might temporarily solve tbe problem. I emphasize the fact that the solution would be only temporary, because we would find this problem in our laps again in a few years' time. I think that it is just as well that this matter should be ventilated and that honourable members should direct their attention to it in an endeavour to find a solution of the problem. Personally, I should like to give the matter much more consideration. I should like to give you sufficient time,Mr Speaker, to consult your oflicers and tbe representatives of the newspapers in order to discover whether some action can be taken to make additional space available. The problem cannot be solved merely by a resolution, of this House. 1 know that you have interested yourself in this subject and I do not think that the House should assume that you are taking no action and, by resolution, give you a direction. So that I may have an opportunity of considering this matter further, and so that the leaders of the various parties and honourable members may further consider it, I ask for leave no continue my remarks. Leave granted ; debate adjourned. -noveTliat in the opinion of this House, section 114 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth -iperates unjustly towards a section of thc people, namely, the ratepayers, who are compelled by local government authorities to connet collections for the coming year would tribute funds for community services, while the Commonwealth Government is exempt from the payment of any such contribution to local government revenue. Section 114 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth providesA State shall not, without the consent of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, . . . impose any tax on property of any kind belongas far back as 1904, local government ing to the Commonwealth. . . . This section also provides that the Commonwealth shall not impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to a State. I hope that all honourable members will approach this subject on a non-party basis. I am sure that most of them wiU agree that the terms imposed by this section of tbe Constitution, under present conditions, are unjust and inequitable. I think it fair to point out that throughout England, Scotland, Wales, and throughout Ireland, including Dublin and Belfast, no such provision operates and, as a result, the taxpayer? as a whole provide the government'? share of the cost, in conjunction with property owners and tenants, when fundsare raised to pay for community services. In Australia, this is not the case. The responsibility falls upon the property owners, including pensioners who have provided tbeir own homes, and upon tenants whose rentals have been fixed so as to provide for the payment of rates. The Commonwealth, which is the largesi property owner, goes free. It is unjust to ask the ratepayers, who comprise a small section of the people, to provide roads and maintenance, footpaths, lighting, fire cover and many other amenities while the Government shelter? behind the Constitution and refuses to accept its share of the responsibility. Figures which. I have extracted from the Commonwealth Tear-Booh indicate that a steep increase has taken place in net collections by the Commonwealth since 1901. The Commonwealth Year-Booh No. 1, al page 643, shows that the net collections for the first six months of 1901 wercjust under £5,000,000. In 1902, they amounted to £11,296,895. Tear-Booh No. 40, at page 667, shows that the net collections for 1939 were £74,000,000. In 1952. they amounted to £934,000,000. In the budget which was presented to the Parliament in 1954, it was estimated thai be £1,022,000,000. I think that these figures suggest that a corresponding increase has taken place in relation to the buildings that have been required by the Government for the purpose of housing the increased staff which it has found necessary to employ. Records show that, authorities have been protesting against tbe operation of section 114 of the Constitution. Of course, they have been protesting to all governments, regardless of party. It was not until 1951 that the present Government agreed to contribute a grant in lieu of rates in respect of all Commonwealth instrumentalities engaged in commercial enterprise in competition with private firms which either own property or lease property from the Commonwealth, such as the Commonwealth Bank",25,House Of Representatives Gallery Accommodation
102,Mr Mcleay (Boothby) [12.7],"Ior Trans Australia Airlines. The principle also applies to houses erected on Commonwealth property and used solely for domestic purposes. I shall cite figures which were compiled for the lord mayors of capital cities in 1952, showing the loss that has been suffered in all States. These figures are not complete, as many small local authorities did not furnish returns. A total of 30 local authorities failed to furnish returns in Victoria. The following table sets out the losses which have resulted from the failure of the Commonwealth to pay rates on its property:New South Wales. Sydney Newcastle Other municipalities VictoriaMelbourne Other municipalities south AustraliaAdelaide 17,205 Metropolitan municipalities (100 country municipalities not included) QueenslandBrisbane Other municipalities Western AustraliaPerth Other municipalities 11,000 TasmaniaHobart Other municipalities Total Despite the submission, of this evidence to tbe Government, no further relief has been given to those taxing authorities which are responsible for raising revenue so that local governments can function effectively. It is very disturbing to note that since the Government came into office in 1949, and up to 1953, the losses of the City of Adelaide had increased to the following extent:Year. Amount. £ 11)50 1051 1052 1053 Total Ihose losses are additional to tbose which were atvffered before 1949. Whilst the figures that I have quoted are disturbing enough, those for 1954 are even worse. In the latter year the loss to the City of Adelaide, which is probably similar to losses suffered in other States, based on a rate of 3s. Sd. in the £1, has reached a total of £22,121 8s. 9d. When added to the amount lost by the non-payment of rates by the State Government, the total loss is at the rate of 10^d. in the £1, or an extra 33^ per cent, of the total rate struck. The increase from 1949 to 1954 was 300 per cent. I think it can be established that, in South Australia, the refusal of the Commonwealth to share in the cost of these services places the 93,609 burden inequitably upon some councils. 12,765 Let me compare the case of the City of 180,079 Mitcham with that of the City of 286,453 Prospect. The City of Mitcham is in 28,450 the electorate of Boothby, and has 12,500 170,654 ratepayers. The annual loss of rates on 199,104 Commonwealth property is £6,125 17s. 6d. The City of Prospect, which is in the electorate of Adelaide, has 9,850 ratepayers, and hae a small annual loss of 21,174 £58 2s. 6d. In the case of the local 38,379 governing body of Salisbury, which is in 85,919 the country and which has 2,000 rate28,639 payers, the loss is estimated to be 114,558 £3,000 a year. I have based those statements on the 1952 figures. There are 13,000 other similar cases, all of which go to 24,00 0 prove that the burden imposed upon the local governing authorities is inequitable 3,512 and that the responsibility falls unjustly 5,131 upon certain of those bodies. 8,643 671,137 Situated within the City of Mitcham are the Dawes-road military hospital, the Cowan tuberculosis institution, the Byerlee rest home and the Waite Institute, which is used by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Besearcb Organization in conjunction with the State. The Waite Institute is situated on 340 acres of the most suitable and valuable building land in the metropolitan area. It abuts Cross-roads, where land to-day is bringing over £30 a foot. In s. d. fact, a reasonable average for the whole .. 858 12 0 area would be not less than £10 a foot. 2,470 3 As you, Mr Speaker, know, this land 4,521. 16 was given to the State by the Waites, one 4,677 16 of the oldest and most respected families 12,528 6 9 in South Australia. We all know the work that is being performed at the institute in the interests of primary mdustry, and the real value that it has been to Australia as a whole. My objection is that the Commonwealth does not pay rates on that land. When it was necessary to provide transport in this particular area, the municipal tramway trust imposed a special levy on the abutting owners to meet the loss on capital and running expenses. It has been argued that concessions have been made to local authorities, and there is no doubt that that did happen. We all know that the Commonwealth has withdrawn from the field of land taxation, but in South Australia, as in many other States, the State Government was very speedily moving into a position to levy that form of tax. The annual pay-roll tax for the City of Adelaide is £10,401, and the estimated gain from the exemption of local governing bodies from the payment of sales tax to the Commonwealth is £6,600. That leaves a net loss of £3,801. There has been some rural thinking in relation to the benefits that should be enjoyed in the capital cities. In the City of Adelaide, as I believe in all the other capital cities, not only do the ratepayers pay the bulk of tbe petrol tax and of motor registration fees, but also, when those funds are distributed throughout the State, the city does not participate in the benefits that accrue. The users of motor vehicles in the capital city have to provide the bulk of the petrol tax, and, as ratepayers, they have to pay, in addition, rates that are used for the purthough not necessarily in all, unjustly. poses of the community generally. It should be pointed out also that in the last twelve years the number of properties affected in the City of Adelaide merely says, "" All right, let us strike out has increased from five to 25. There has been a corresponding increase in the number of government-owned vehicles that are using roads which have been provided in many cases by the local authority. From time to time, the various local governing bodies have made representations to different governments asking them to make better use of tbe accommodation that they possessed. I think the time has arrived when we should declare that the Commonwealth should no longer be a landlord, but that it should dispose of any surplus buildings and should make Ur. McLeay. better use of tbe buildings it retains. Bydoing so, it would recognize the claim' that has been made over the years in relation to the injustice that exists. I make no apology for having submitted this motion. I feel sure that it is the obligation of every private member to take advantage of any opportunity he has to place constructive suggestions before the House, and I hope that, duringany debate which may follow, honourable members will take advantage of that opportunity. seconded ? motion. Minister) [12.21] -I do not propose to* speak at any length at this stage, but not out of disrespect to the honourable member his case in very powerful terms. The case' itself relates to a problem, or, if you like,, a group of problems, with which we have all become more or less familiar. I am not so familiar with them as is the honourable member for Boothby, who has had an uncommon and full experience of these matters, but, from time to time, I have had the advantage of hearing theviews of the lord mayors at conferences,, and of other representatives of municipal bodies. I have no doubt that the constitutional exemption operates in many cases, But this is not one of those simplematters, as my friend the honourable member for Boothby will agree, in which one the constitutional exemption"", because the Commonwealth is not the only authority that is affected by it. The States themselves, in to to, probably levymore in rates than does the Commonwealth. I know there are persons who are optimistically inclined who believe that, if tbe Commonwealth sets £1,000.000worth of example, the States might display £2,000,000 worth of virtue. My experience has not entirely encouraged me to believe that that is likely. In the meantime, let me, first of all, inform the honourable member that his re-",27,Rates On Commonwealth Property

106,For Boothby ( Mr Mcleay) Who Has Put,"marks, and in particular, the very valuable figures that he has submitted on this occasion, will be very carefully studied by me and my colleagues. But I point out that there are one or two considerations of another kind which must be borne in mind, although I do not undertake to state what the answers are. I have already mentioned one of those considerations-the position of the States. I now mention another. There are some cases, particularly in well-established and closely settled cities, where the subtraction of a building from rateability would mean a serious loss to the municipal authorities, without any diminution of their responsibility. Not very far away from such cities there might be an aerodrome, the property of the Commonwealth, which is exempt from rating. There are counter considerations in such a case, because very frequently, the establishment of that airport would have drawn to its margin, as we have seen all over Australia, close settlements of people, the building up of those areas, and the establishment sometimes of factories and shops. All that, of course, has led to an increase of rateable values, and, therefore, to an increase of municipal revenues. I agree that it is a special case, but I put it forward because it is an indication that there is no simple single rule that will do justice overall. My own feeling right through the piece is that we have to deal with this thing justly, provisionally if you' like, taking one step at a time. I acknowledge that the bonorable member for Boothby has generously recognized the fact that the present Government made changes in respect of buildings that were occupied for what might be described as commercial or competitive purposes. ""We did that, if I remember arightI am not perfectly clear on the point-by providing not that there should be, technically, any exemption from rates, but that the Government could pay an amount that should be calculated by reference to them, f think I am right in saying that that was tbe way in which it was done, in order not to abandon the general principle. I do not want to speak further on this matter. I should like to acknowledge, not only tbe constant pressure that the honourable member has exerted in relation to this problem, but also the fact that honourable members on both sides of the House have, on many occasions, taken the opportunity to direct the attention of the Government to these matters. I admit the gravity of them, and I am conscious of the difficulties associated with them. They contain in themselves, of course, relatively large financial implications, which nobody could deal with casually in a discussion of this kind. I assure the honourable member for Boothby that all he has said on the subject to-day, together with what has been said on it on former occasions, will receive the earnest scrutiny of the Government. I ask for leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. Leave granted; debate adjourned.

That has not been done. The real point ""is whether the proposals contained in this particular measure constitute the best way to tackle the problem. The bill provides for the establishment of a civil defence council.

I now come to the point for the House to determine, and I direct the attention of the honourable member for Mackellar and his colleagues associated with the measure to it . Clause 14 reads( l ) The functions of thc Council are<a) to inquire into and examine possible measures for the protection of the civilian population of Australia against the consequences of armed attack by an enemy of the Commonwealth or the agents of such un enemy. That is the key function. Tbe olau.v '""--ntinues'6) to devise plans for ensuring thc maximum survival of thc people of Australia in the event of such an attack and for maintaining the existence of organized government 'and society in Australia in that event. rtiohe are excellent descriptions of what is required in planning the civil defence of -Yustralia, but that is not a matter for such a council, except as a possible adjunct of the Department of Defence and an adviser of the government of the day. The security of Australia is entrusted to tbe Commonwealth and to its executive government under the Constitution. It is the Government's job to have made inquiries into this matter, to see that the plans are adequate and that there are provisions for carrying them to completion. The situation to-day is that nothing has been done. While the honourable member for Mackellar is perfectly entitled to bring in the b ill , and no doubt some of his observations on the weapons of mass destruction have been positive and helpful, many of his statements in relation to the causes of the international -utuation have been most unhelpful, particularly his reference to the possibility of preventive action, but I pass'by that to say that the bill at all events tells the Commonwealth Government from within its own ranks that it has to start planning on this great matter. The States cannot be expected to take the initiative. In my opinion, the Commonwealth Parliament has exclusive power in this country in relation to all defence measures, naval military, air, or civil. Civil defence is just as much a part of the defence of the country as is naval, military or air defence. There is no distinction. In time of war, industrial organization is an essential part of defence. Therefore, J think it is a w ill o' the wisp to suggest the formation of a council with all these representatives of the Commonwealtb Parliament, the State parliaments, and the State governments. We would not get much benefit from such a body. I suggest as an immediate step that the Government should appoint, in associa tion with the Department of Defence, t> committee of a representative character, not necessarily consisting of personsholding specified offices, but consisting of people who can assist the Department of Defencei n this matter, irrespective of whether they are members of Parliament, or of the Commonwealth or Statsservices, together with the responsible Minister. In my opinion, responsibility for civil defence should not belong to the Ministerf o r tbe Interior( Mr Kent Hughes), not because he would not be able to do the job, but because civil defence is an integral portion of the defence system itself. Why can that not be done''. Why cannot the matter be approached from that point of view? That is tluview that the Opposition would take. We appointed a Director of Civil Defence in .1949, just before the Chifley Government was defeated. I know that this Government has since appointed some one else in his place. I repeat that, as f a r as 1 know, not a thing has been done in civil defence preparations, notwithstanding tintalk that has taken place in the last fivtyours in regard to the inevitability of war. and the obvious fact that if there is a world war, there w ill be a grave danger that nuclear weapons w ill be used and th» civil population w ill be affected. The Government's record in this field is 8 completely barren one. The introduction of this bill has directed pointed attention to that fact. I ask for leave to continue my remarks at a later stage.

OrderedThat Mr Menzies and Sir Philip McBride do prepare and bring in a bill to cany out the foregoing resolution. read a first time. Minister) [2.17] I move That the bill be now read a second time. I do not need to make a very elaborate speech on this matter, because honourable members will recall that, since the 1st July, 1950, we have had legislation of this nature. Prior to 1950 there had been Commonwealth grants for research, and substantial subsidies were paid to universities in connection with the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme. Tn 1950, after an investigation by a committee, we decided that this matter ought to be .put on a regular footing, and inevitably, of course, through the process of State grants for those specified purposes. What this bill does is to seek to continue the Commonwealth grants to universities for the year 1955, and to repeal the act of 1953 under which sums were paid to the States for their universities up to the end of 1954. It might be useful if I reminded honourable members of the principles on which those grants have been calculated. First of all, there is a basic grant. If honourable members will examine the schedule to the bill they will find that the basic grant is shown in the third column of the schedule. The first column of the schedule describes tbe university; the second column describes the amount of State aid and fees, which represented the sub-structure on which this scheme was begun; tbe third column shows what we call the "" basic grant"", which is related quantitatively to what has been happening in the second column-relate d quantitatively in this sense, that having qualified by exceeding by that amount, the Commonwealth would then pay a proportionate sum to be known as the "" basic grant"", which is shown in the third column. For this year it will be £877,130. Then, to the extent to which those universities exceeded in their fees and State grants the amount set out in the second ^column, it was agreed that we shouldpay a second level grant, which would be equal to one-third of that excess. I am happy to say that, one of the objects of the exercise having and been, to improve the financial position oi the universities, honourable members will see that the second-level grant in the fourth column is now almost equal to the basic grant and, in the result, the amount to be found by the Commonwealth this year will be slightly more than £1,700,000. Since 1950 all universities have qualified easily for the basic grant, and the question has been, how much of tbe second-level grant they can attract. I point out that this year it will be £328.800, as shown in the fourth column of the schedule. Last year there was a short fall in the second-level grant because one or two of the universities failed to qualify for the full amount that had been voted and, in the result, the amount paid fell short of the estimates by something over £100,000. This year the estimate will be £180,000 more than last year, without allowing for the short fall to which I have referred. We propose in this year, in other words, grants of £1,700,000. Some slight variations are made, as those honourable members who are interested in the matter will observe, as between one level and another. That is the result of our desire-and I am sure that honourable members will approve of it-to pay attention to the increases of numbers in universities and, in some cases, to their particular disabilities. The fifth column of the schedule refers to the amount for teaching and administrative costs of the residential colleges. I myself felt from the beginning that there was a strong case to be made out for some assistance, in a university context, to the residential colleges. Therefore, wben this scheme began in 1950, an",32,States Grants

That amount, I may say, is not additional to the amount expressed in the third column, but is included in it. It is shown separately because I want to have it perfectly understood that the residential colleges are getting this modest amount of assistance. If the amount of £877,130 shown in the third column is added to tbe amount of £828,S00 shown in the fourth column, it will be seen that the total amount involved is somewhat more than £1,700,000. We have not made any changes in the existing system, but I may tell honourable members that, during this current year, we are making a review of the present basis on which grants are determined, in the light of changes in student enrolments and changes in relative costs as between one university and another. Those considerations are very important in trying to give relative justice to each university which is one of the beneficiaries. We have put that in hand. We are having a very close examination made this year, and if it leads to the conclusion that tbere ought to be changes in the allocation, or in total, in the next financial year, we will, of course, be very happy to make those changes. adjourned.

The board will be authorized to anticipate the receipt of moneys which are expected to become due to Australia from the United Kingdom Government in respect of the minimum price guarantees in the fifteen-year meat agreement. For the information of honourable members. I shall briefly traverse the facts relating to the meat agreement. The fifteen-year meat agreement was signed by representatives of the United Kingdom and Australian Governments on the l l t h October, 1951. However, the history of the negotiation of the agreement goes back a long time before that. An understanding was ERIC HARRISON) agreed reached with the United Kingdom Government during the period in office of the Chifley Government that there should be a fifteen-year agreement for the sale of meat by Australia to the United Kingdom, but no substantial progress in the development of an agreement had been made until the present Government came into office.

120,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister forand took a direct part in those negotiations. During this period the members of the board, who in all cases represented interested parties, either producers or exporting processors, were free to, and wore in fact expected to, consult their organizations on the principles involved. Further, during this two-year period, I., as Minister, deliberately made more tban. a dozen public statements which were fully published in all live-stock and meat industry journals, and which dealt with the points raised and the progress towards agreement in the discussions with the United Kingdom Government. My intention was to ensure that all sections of the live-stock and meat industry would be aware of what was going on, and therefore able to make any contribution or criticism or, for that matter, prothe same time, a schedule of minimum test which they might desire. In short, that with adequate knowledge of the facts, industry opinion should have full opportunity to crystallize on the issue. The Australian Meat Board, by a substantial majority, approved the provisions of the agreement before it was signed. This agreement has a completely novel and unprecedentedly advantageous provision when compared with the long-term commodity agreements previously entered into by Labour governments. Those agreements provided for direct government-to-goverriment trading and did not l>er.mit trader-to-trader selling. The present meat agreement provided that when the parties to the agreement decided to revert to normal trader-totrader selling, which occurred in fact last year, then, if the average prices obtained over each year for beef, lamb or mutton separately were higher than the schedules of minimum prices provided under the agreement, Australian producers were to get the benefit of such higher prices. However, if average market prices over the year were lower than the scheduled minimum prices, then the deficiency was to be made up by way of a lump-sum payment by the United Kingdom Government. Beef, lamb and mutton are each treated separately so that if . for example, average lamb prices for a year are above the minimum schedule while average beef prices are below the .Ifr. McNwen. minimum schedule, the beef deficiency payment will not be offset by the higher lamb prices. The agreement, however, retains aU the advantages of the former straight-out government-to-government trading agreements by the provision of a guaranteed market in tbe United Kingdom for the whole of the exportable surplus of beef, lamb and mutton for fifteen years. The United Kingdom and Australian Governments decided in March, 1954, after consultations iu which the chairman and the producers' and processors' representatives on tbe Australian Meat Board took a direct part, to cease government-togovernment trading in mutton and lamb as from the 30th June, 1954, and in beef as from the 30th September, 1954. At prices for the year 1954-55 was negotiated by the board's representatives with the United Kingdom Ministry of Food. These minimum prices were considered by the board's representatives to include a reasonable, but not excessive, margin of profit for producers. Since reverting to a trader-to-trader basis, the price of frozen beef on the United Kingdom market has fallen considerably and is now below the minimum price for beef set in the schedule. This fall has been due to a variety of factors, the major ones, apparently, being the greatly increased quantities of meat available in the United Kingdom in the form of accumulated Ministry of Food stocks, high United Kingdom production of beef and pork, and increased quantities of imported chilled beef. The declared intention of both parties to the agreement in such circumstances was that special provisions would be made to ensure that a satisfactory part of the combination of sale price and deficiency payment reached the producers of the iive-stock. It will be appreciated that the precise calculation of a deficiency payment likely to be due from the United Kingdom Government cannot be made until after the end of each year, because of the averaging provisions over the full year. Tho most difficult, and possibly controversial, aspect flowing from this deficiency payment provision is the question of how the payments can be got back to the producers, in the circumstances 31st July, 1955, and exported to the that the precise entitlement is not going United Kingdom. The entitlement to to be known with certainty until months this payment will enable the exporter to after much of the meat has heen shipped. increase his offer for cattle, or his bid The bill is designed primarily to estabat auction, by an equivalent amount. lish the basis for this disbursement.

Therefore, without additional money* In case any one should feel that this fore, in those circumstances local con; I believe the days have passed when there will be any one found to argue or From the point of view of stability in value of this whole arrangement. In short, it is a device by which the The overwhelming percentage of beef exports are from. Queensland, with some from north-west Australia. These are the areas to wbich my remarks particularly apply. Prom the great stock markets of Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth, there is practically no beef export. a levy will be sought in a complementary In those markets, available supplies of 1 beef, except on odd occasions, are no greater tban the demand for local consumption, and the ordinary forces of competition establish price levels which are invariably higher than export parity. Therefore, this arrangement will have no effect capable of being measured in those areas. There is a small but increasing export of beef from New South ""Wales. Tn that State, market values are mostly determined by the forces of competition for home consumption, and the effect of this arrangement would' be nomore than to prevent fat cattle values in New South Wales from falling below the price level represented by a combination of the commercial export parity and the deficiency payment operating at the time. T'o sum up this aspect of the matter, the arrangement embodied in this legislation provides both an equitable method of getting back to primary producers the actual money received from the United Kingdom as deficiency payment, and also multiplies the advantage of this to the producers by the sympathetic stabilizing effect, on fat stock for local consumption and the whole store stock market.. The finance provided to cover the paybill also provides that consequent upon ments authorized by the measure will not be a charge against the Australian taxpayer in any circumstances. In the first instance, it will be provided by the Commonwealth Bank by means of an Australian Government guaranteed overdraft to the Meat Board. This guaranteed overdraft will later be discharged by the deficiency payments made to Australia by the United Kingdom Government. mending a rate of deficiency payment which in total amount at the end of the year exceeds the amount of money received from the United Kingdom Government, a levy on exports will be imposed to balance the ledger. That, of course, in the whole total arrangement, Afr. McEwen. could occur only if export values had returned to profitable or higher than profitable levels. Any such levy may be spread over a period of about one year unless special circumstances dictate a longer period. Authority to impose such bill and the operation of this bill, if approved by the Parliament, is conditional upon Parliament's approval alsoof the complementary bill. This system of balancing the ledger, if that should prove necessary, has. been recommended to the Government by the Australian Meat Board on tbe clear understanding that the Government would not itself assume liability if payments by tbe board should exceed the amount ultimately received from the United Kingdom Government. The board suggested that the Government might assume liability for any failure of United Kingdom deficiency payments to us liquidating the board's overdraft on this account. The Government has, however, made it clear at all relevant times that it would not involve the taxpayer in any liability in this connection. The provisions of the bill' would permit the board in its discretion to draw upon accumulated funds held by the board from profits made in early years under bulk contract trading for the purpose of adjusting any over-expenditure on deficiency payments to exporters. This could be alternate to or supplementary to the levy to which I have referred. The the Government guaranteeing the board's overdraft for the deficiency payment purposes, the accumulated profits of the board, which are separately identified on account of tbe three classes of meatmutton, lamb and beef-shal l be available against the Government's guarantee. This is considered to be a proper action to be taken to protect the general public interest. In tbe event of the board recomHowever, there will, in fact, be no intention OT likelihood of the Government exercising its rights in this regard, because the whole concept, as proposed by the meat board and approved by the Government and embodied in this bill, provides that a levy on exports, imposed when prices are higher than the minimum guarantee under the agreement, shall be tbe means of bringing the board's accounts into balance . It is the opinion of the 1 Australian Meat Board that competition between meat works and the meat operators at public utilities will ensure that they will pass on the benefit of the deficiency payment in the prices they pay for live-stock whether purchased at auction or by private treaty. I may say that this general proposal bas been canvassed in recent weeks at widespread meetings of cattle-grazier interests in Queensland. These meetings, without exception, gave their approval to the concept, thereby endorsing the view that a payment, or an entitlement to processors, will be passed on through the customary arrangements between processors and producers. Tbey are the people capable of judging that issue,, and I am advised that they are 'Ittite content on that point. A safeguard has been incorporated in clause 8 of the bill providing for the suspension of deficiency payments where tbe Minister, after examining all evidence available, is not satisfied that the prices being paid by meat exporters to producers are such as to pass, on in an equitable manner the full benefit of the deficiency payments. The export subsidy in itself -mould effectively silence such criticism of the fifteen-year meat agreement as has been based on the grounds that the benefits of any deficiency payments received from the United Kingdom Government could not be passed back to producers. I am sure that the opportunities for export other than to the United Kingdom which are incorporated with the long-term meat agreement, are not fully understood. I believe that in some cases where they are fully understood, they are misrepresented. Tbis misunderstanding is the basis for some criticism of the whole agreement. On this point, let me advise the House that in the first place, canned meats may be freely exported to any destination without restriction, because canned meats are not covered by the agreement. Canned meat exports are at tlie annual level of approximately 65,000 tons canned weight, equal to probably more than 100,000 tons carcass weight. Total carcass beef exports to> all destinations this year are estimated at about 120,000 tons. Almost half of the total exports in canned form can be sold to the best advantage by any one who wishes to export, no matter to which country he desires to export. In the second place, under this agreement, Australia has the specific right to export without limit to all British colonies, dependencies and British oil companies. The operations of the oil companies, of course, as honourable members know,, are carried out in the Persian Gulf and theIndonesian areas, &c. This trade in carcass meat normally represents 16,000 tons a year. That is on the basis of completely open trading. In the third placej the agreement reserves, to Austhat exist tralia the right of similar free export anywhere in the world of a quantity of beef, mutton and lamb^ equal to 3 per cent, of the exports totheUnited Kingdom. In the fourth place, the agreement visualizes negotiations of quantities additional to this 3 per cent, for freesale anywhere in the world. Within thesethree free export opportunities for carcass meat, it is estimated that in the current meat year about 42,000 tons of carcass meat will be available to exporters for sale in these terms at the best price they are able to negotiate in ordinary open commercial competition. Actually, this year the United Kingdom market has provided high enough returns to leavelittle inducement to' export lamb under thia free: quota arrangement. To put this position another way, the quantity of carcass meat, which may be sold omtside the United Kingdom this year would represent approximately 25 per cent, of our total exports. For the' present, no deficiency payments will be made on exports of lamb and mutton because prices received in the United Kingdom for these two classes of meat do not warrant payments. In other words,, they are above the minimum guaranteed level. I say this notwithstanding that the end of the year could show that we are entitled to some small deficiency payment on account of mutton. It would, however, not be large enough to warrant distribution, and the meat board would hold that payment against future events. However, in the event of circumstances arising in tbe future similar to those now in existence in the beef industry, this bill provides the necessary machinery for action to be taken hy the Australian meat board to make deficiency payments on the export of mutton or lamb to the United Kingdom. been included in the agreement but the Australian Pig Producers Association, at fhe time when it was known that these negotiations for an agreement were proceeding, came to the Government and asked that pig meat should not be included. The Government, having a steady policy of respecting the wishes of tbe ownership of tbe various commodities with which it is concerned, instantly said, "" All right, if the pig producers clearly do not want pig meat to be included, it shall not be included "", and so it has not been included. I say to representatives of grazing interests, and beef, mutton and lamb interests, who may regard themselves as having higher business judgment than the pig producers on the whole, and who now criticize the inclusion of these classes of meat in the agreement, that if they had had the wit to protest, or if they could have marshalled a majority of the producers of those classes of meat to protest-and that is the critical testthen those classes of meat would not have been included in the agreement. Following the most serious world-wide food shortage of the war and post-war years, a meat surplus has developed much more quickly than any authoritative person forecast. This situation has resulted in .a sharp depression of prices. It is valuable that the provisions of the long term meat agreement permit arrangements which provide a most useful stabilizing factor to support the Australian live-stock industries. If this measure is approved by the Parliament, the beef industry will directly beneh'i forthwith by approximately £700,000 in the first three months of the operation of tbe plan; and, if there is no alteration, in the rate to the Government of the Commonwealth under of deficiency payments during the balance of this "" meat"" year-the subsidy would be reduced or withdrawn only in the event of the United Kingdom market rising to profitable levels-tb e industry will receive a further £350,000, which will make a total of more than £1,000,000 by the end of the current export season. To put the matter another way, the payment of l^d. per lb. on first and second quality ox beef exported to the United Kingdom is expected to enable exporters to pay about £3 12s. a head above export parity. I commend the bill to the House. adjourned. MEAT EXPORT (ADDITIONA L In Committee of Ways and Means: 1.

But there was no connection between these representations. Apparently, each was made separately. The objections related to a very small portion of the St. Kilda area which was placed in the division of Higgins called Fawkner bution. Apparently, ratepayers did not want this anomaly to be preserved. was the time to lodge an objection preference to .having the anomaly petuated for another seven years when the next redistribution area was a small portion on the northern boundary of the division of Isaacs which stops at a 1-chain road. suggested that the commissioners move the boundary further north in order to .bring it into line with the municipal stopped incorporated tramlines, and which was an arterial road in the real sense of the word. Some few hundred electors were resident in this area. in lodging an objection was to try to make its own administration more easily, and to lessen confusion concerning the boundaries of the electoral division, because people bad experienced a great deal of confusion municipality in which they resided, particularly at the time of municipal Mr Haworth redistribution commissioners for tions. 'Some confusion had also been experienced in regard to postal districts. The letter that the council sent to the commissioners clearly indicated that its objection was a serious one. The letter commenced by statingAt a meeting of the full Council held last evening, reference was made to the proposed alteration to Commonwealth electoral divisions in accordance with maps open for inspection, and a discussion ensued on the new boundaries for the Federal electorate of Isaacs. Another part of the letter stated' It will be appreciated that the width of Dandenong-road, being three chains, forms a definite division of local interests, the interests of residents south of Dandenong Road being almost entirely divorced from the interests of those residing north of Dandenong Road. The council then referred to the diversity of interest between two municipalities and explained why it was necessary to move the proposed boundary about 150 yards. In the last portion of the letter, the council statedLastly, and I am permitted by the Council to speak from personal knowledge as a former Returning Officer for the State Electoral District of St. Kilda and the Province of Monash now (formerly Melbourne South), voters recording at a previous redistriabsentee votes in other parts of the State the council and the almost invariably gave their Electoral District as St. Kilda (naturally, being in the St. Kilda Municipality and the St. Kilda postal They felt that the present district), and as a consequence, voting officials in entered on their ballot papers the names of percandidates for the St. Kilda Electorate.

A copy of this letter has been forwarded to the Federal Member for this Electorate (The Honourable W. Crawford Haworth) in the hope that he will lend The only desire of the council his support and approval to the proposals now advanced. function The Commonwealth Electoral Act clearly sets out the circumstances under which a person may lodge objections to the decisions of the electoral commisabout the sioners. The act states that electoral commissioners shall be appointed and that electhey shall take notice of certain provisions of the act. After they have reached a decision, according t©' theact, maps of proposed new divisions must be displayed in post offices and they must remainthere for 30 days, during which time an objection may be lodged by any person who wishes to lodge one. The objection must be noted and conveyed to the Minister for the Interior. In Victoria, the commissioners made it known in the beginning that they definitely would not consider any approach by any members of the community while they were considering the redistribution of electoral boundaries. I am not objecting to that action, which the commissioners were entitled to take. There is a. lot to be 3aid in favour of it. To the best of my knowledge, no approach was made to the commissioners while they were deliberating upon this matter. But I understand that, within the period of 30 days during which the maps of the proposed new divisions were displayed at the post offices, objections were made in writing. But no opportunity whatsoever was given to councils, or other bodies whose work would be affected by the proposed new boundaries, to appear before the commisioners in order to state their objections. The commissioners accepted objections only in writing. They sent a formal notice to the council stating that they had received the council's letter. nothing more from the commissioners, and its first intimation that a decision had been made was a published statement in the newspapers that objections had been overruled. That was rather shabby treatment to taken before them, and whether the comgive to what might be described as a missioners in all of the States would do semi-government body, the officers of the same thing. I submit that a miniswhich have to work in close association terial recommendation should have been with the oflicers of the Government. It given to all of the commissioners in is obvious that the commissioners, having order that an opportunity to give evidence drawn the maps, did not intend to alter before them may have been clearly them. They did not intend to consider defined. The opportunity to give evidence any objections. If they had considered is not defined in the Commonwealtii one objection they might have had to Electoral Act and, therefore, I think consider others, and the easiest way out there should have been a ministerial was not fo consider any. In consequence, direction setting out what the commisthe ratepayers and the council were sioners should have done. denied the opportunity to place their objections before the commission in a way that objections had been placed before entirely upon that basis, and I hope the commissioners in other States. Victoria Minister will take early action to ensure and' Queensland are the: only States in that the duties of the commissioners shall which the commissioners prevented personsfrom coming before them, ami dis^ cussing with them how the maps should be drawn. I do not wish to state whether or not persons should be denied the right to appear before the commissioners;, but it seems strange that in all States;, except Victoria and Queensland,, people were allowed to appear before the commissioners and state how they considered the boundaries could be distributed to the advantage of the electors and the municipal councils. That might -be a very good procedure, but it seems strange that no direction whatsoever was given to the commissioners who were appointed for the purpose of redistributing electoral divisions in Victoria and Queensland. If the Minister for the Interior can obtain any satisfaction from the report on the distribution of Victorian electorates I shall be astonished, because it is obvious that opportunities were denied to the people of Victoria which were granted to the people of all other States except Queensland. I do not want to prolong this discussion, because I can quite understand that there will be a lot of discontent in regard to the question of whether particular areas should be included in one electoral division or another. There The council heard could be no agreement amongst members about that matter, because we would all look upon it in a different light. I do believe, however, that, before the commissioners started their job, there should have been some kind of understanding about whether or not evidence would b<? My objection to the report rests be clearly defined in the act and, if necessary, to ensure that it shall be overhauled. It seems that, in the main, the act has not been altered since 1905. It is high time that it was altered, and brought up to date, in order to give some clear definition about what the commissioners can and cannot do in relation to the taking of evidence. agree with the criticisms that have been in two lines, which read as follows:made by previous speakers in relation to the report of the commissioners for consequent thereupon your Commissioners the State of Victoria.

135,Mr Claeey,"We do not want toremain unaltered. If Bendigo were permitted to retain Maryborough, that division would preserve its community of interest of industrial activity. Those two relatively small subdivisions-smal l from the point of view of population-Ray wood and Elmore, could have been added to the division of Murray. The addition then of Kyneton to Bendigo would not detract from the physical features of that division. At Maryborough there is an exceedingly large engineering establishment known as Patience and Nicholson Limited, as well as large woollen milk and a prefabricated housing factory. There are quite a large number of other small industrial undertakings. Castlemaine exist Thompson's foundry and the Castlemaine woollen mills, in addition to smaller industries. Bendigo, the centre of the electorate, is highly inmissioners' report gives no explanation dustrialized. It contains the Commonwealth ordnance factory, railway workshops and the Bradford Cotton Mills, as well as many textile and food-preserving factories. By deleting Maryborough from the electorate the community of industrial interest is destroyed. Let us tben consider the question of the means of communication. The whole of the present Bendigo electorate is ideal from this point of view. There is direct access by rail to Castlemaine, Maryborough, and other places in the area. As far as the subdivisions are concerned, in most instances good arterial roads radiate from Bendigo to all parts of the electorate. When we turn to the proposed redistribution we find that there is no direct rail communication with Seymour. Furthermore, the road communication is not good. If one desires to travel to Seymour from Bendigo he finds that the side roads are in a very bad state. It is therefore necessary to make a very long journey. From Bendigo, one travels via Heathcote to Kilmore, and thence to Seymoura distance of about 90 miles. From the point of view of communications, the proposed redistribution does not conform with tbe requirements of section 19 of the act. I come now to the factor of physical features. Again, the requirements of the act have not been complied with. Mr Clarey. After crossing the Dividing Range, one reaches the relatively flat country running from Malmsbury right up to Echuca. From Bendigo to Maryborough and on to Heathcote and Castlemaine the country is not hilly.; it is relatively flat. But the Maryborough area, whicli has physical characteristics similar to those of the rest of the electorate, is to be taken out and Seymour placed in the division. The Seymour district is mountainous, timber country, which is entirely different from the rest of the division. When one sees these things taking place and lodges a protest,, points out the characteristics of the electorate and shows In where the community of interest is being destroyed, it is disheartening to find that, the report of the redistribution commissioners ignores those factors. The comfor their decision. The fact that objections had been lodged on behalf of eighi electorates was apparently of no consequence to them. They have submitted a bare report, and have treated the proposed redistribution of Victorian electorates quite differently from the manner in which the subject was approached in the other States, where at least the commissioners furnished explanations in relation to proposed alterations to enable those who would be affected by them at. least to understand why the commissioners acted in a certain way. I do not consider that the report of the redistribution commissioners in relation to Victoria is satisfactory. For that reason, it should be rejected. External Affairs) [3.35] I wish to address myself quite briefly to the situation that arises from the commissioners' report in the electorate of La Trobe. A discussion of this sort is really a discussion on a series of parish pumps and. like the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey), I want to polish my parish pump a little. So far as I am concerned, the situation quite briefly is that I represent the division of La Trobe and the commissioners have recommended that that electorate should, speaking broadly, have a line drawn across it dividing it into two, the north-east portion of which they recommend should be called Bruce,",44,Electoral Redistribution Of Victorian Divisions
136,Mr Casey (La Trobe,"-Minister forno doubt after Mr S. M . Bruce, now Viscount Bruce, who represented the electorate of Flinders for a considerable number of years. They recommended that the south-west portion of what is at present La Trobe should continue to carry the name of La Trobe. To this south-west portion of the present electorate of La Trobe they have added a further area to the south, which was a part of the old electorate of Flinders when it was represented by Mr Bruce. I suggest that the two names, Bruce and La Trobe, sbould be transposed for, I think, a very good reason. I recommend that the area which the commissioners suggest be called Bruce should be called La Trobe, that is, the area which has its main centre of population at Ferntree Gully. My principal reason for that is because the electorate of Flinders, as represented by Mr Bruce, had as its principal centre of population the town, now the city, of Dandenong. I think that the area which I suggest should be called Bruce contains more of the old electorate represented by Mr Bruce than does the area which the commissioners recommended should be called Bruce. I think it would be very much more logical to have this re-arrangement of names. For one thing, clearly this new electorate, which I suggest should be called Bruce, will have its political and principal centre in Dandenong, which was the principal centre of the electorate of Flinders in which Mr Bruce, as Trime Minister, made his policy speech during his term in the 1920's. For that reason, if for no other, I think that that electorate should be called Bruce. That is the only direction in which I desire to inject myself into this discussion. I hope that the House will accept the proposal for the alteration of the names of those two electorates. Unlike the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey), I do not intend to polish the parish pump for any length of time. As every one knows that redistributions are a preliminary to possible elections, it may be possible under this proposal to indulge in a few reflections. I may say at the outset that I entirely agree with the statement of the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr ClaTey). In Gellibrand gentleman says, "" swan songs "". Every the commissioners have jumped natural barriers, they have jumped the Yarra, and they have done other things. I rest content, because it is entirely irrelevant. It is quite opportune at this moment, under this heading, to draw attention to something of prime national importance, and it is most refreshing to find the obvious air of altruism with which Her Majesty's Opposition has approached consideration of these proposals. The right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) has never, during my stay in this House, better exemplified his love of natural justice and pure, abstract right, and his devotion to the eternal verity of goodness, than in his approach to these proposals. It is most refreshing that in this day and generation, in this Australia on the edge of the civilized world, statesmen could be found, the right honourable member for Barton amongst them, to tell us, in a high spirit of altruism and devotion to an ethical ideal, about the glories of physical features such as the George's River, in regard to which the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) unburdened himself last night, the smooth beauty of the Sydney tramlines, another natural barrier, and the frolics and figures of Bankstown. All these matters are drawn in to buttress this case. Such unselfishness deserves more than a passing mention. I refer again to my original statement that I do not intend to polish the parish pump. I am content to let the present constituency of GeM-ibrand he cast on the wheel of fortune and left to the dice oi chance. Not for me, and certainly not for the right honourable member for Barton, this pettifogging piffling about boundaries! Perish the thought! Shame on those followers of such a distinguished statesman, the man whose clarion tones have rung through the great halls of the United Nations, and whose thoughts range over the Pacific with the irresponsibility of a butterfly and the deadly intent of a trapdoor spider.

After all, I have to confess that every one has to try to carve as good a piece as possible for himself.

I look with nostalgic eyes on the beautiful Yarra entering the sea at Williamstown, and I tbink to myself, ""What right has the honourable member for Port Melbourne to jump the Yarra and come into Williamstown ? "" ThenI find that, as a counter-balance, there is added to my electorate, the glorious vista called North Footscray. The burden of my story this afternoon is that what seems to be of great moment now, what looms largely in our consciousness this afternoon, all the emotional stress and worry, will fade like mist in the morning air because the electors will have the final say, and the manoeuvring for Grayndler, the manoeuvring for Cunningham, and the intrigues for this and that which are so reminiscent of a mediaeval court, since the party has had the dire misfortune to follow the right honourable member for Barton the honourable gentleman to link his remarks with the subject of electoral boundaries. He has no doubt read of the Roman god Terminus. mind that the verdict of the electors is as inevitable and inexorable as the crack of doom, the easiest way out of it for my threatened friends is to divide those constituencies into three, like the shamrock, and forget the whole thing. -Although I am a Tasmanian, I desire to enter this debate on electoral redistribution in Victoria for one reason only.

At present, I am in a somewhat similar position to that of the honourable member for Corio in that my own majority has suffered. I have no complaint to make about that because the commissioners have made the redistribution as between Eranklin and Denison on a perfectly logical basis. However, being familiar with the seat of Corio, I do feel that here the redistribution commissioners have made a mistake. I want to say that very briefly fo this House, for it is something that, perhaps, the honourable member himself could not do. The adjustment means, quite literally, that many people in Barwon who work in Geelong will be denied representation while they are at work.

I listened to the discussion last night on the that, year, so far as the reports are conredistribution in New South Wales and gathered that they did not like that either. I will be interested to see wha* happens when they come to some of the other States where distributions that I do not like have been. made. I mention that because it is about time that I , as Minister, said something on behalf of the redistribution commissioners. During this and other debates on the redistribution motions' the commissioners have received a lot of criticism; and last night the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) and the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) subjected them to a smear and sneer campaign. They were accused of having produced theworst boundaries that have ever been drawn, and of the greatest gerrymandering that has ever taken place in the history of Australia. A vote has been taken on the New South Wales boundaries and the Minister is replying concerning them. HaveI the"" right to reply on that matter ? ber m:ay speak on any of the motions before the Hoiise. referring to the New South Wales boundaries, but to the generality of the criticism of the redistribution commissioners by the Opposition in States where they do not like the redistribution. I shall watch with great interest what happens when some' of the other States' come up fdr discussion.

162,. Mr Kent Hughes,"I am notBendigo( Mr Clarey) complained that those reports were lacking in as much as they did not contain the reasons for certain actions that the commissioners had taken. Who are these shocking people, these Unfair gerryiriaiiderers, who have made a mess of things and shown themselves to be the play-things Of the Government? The chairman of the commissioners in New South Wales who were criticized last night was formerly the Chief Electoral Officer when Labour was in power; and the second member of the commission, the Surveyor-General of tbe State, likewise held, that office when Labour was in power. In respect of the redistribution in Victoria, the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) in his usual gentlemanly manner, described the chairman of the commission, quite mildly, as having made some bad mistakes. On the other band, the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) did not put it so mildly, but that was just the difference in temperament between the two honourable members. The man whom they criticized was chairman of the redistribution commissioners in 1948. borough in my electorate. and he did not state his reasons for doing so.

Whatever honourable members may think of their own boundaries, or of the distribution in a State sucb as Victoria, they are playing it pretty low down in attacking the redistribution commissioners as the Labour party has done. E am not saying that this or that ought to be done. The honourable member for Isaacs( Mr Haworth) said that he joined with the honourable member for Bendigo in saying that the commissioners should have given their reasons and that the Minister should have directed them whether they should take evidence. I point out that under the act the Minister has no power to direct the commissioners. Apparently Parliament, when it passed the act, decided that the Minister should not have that power; and. I hope that it will not be given to any future Minister. If the Parliament wishes the position to be altered, let it amend the act so that the commissioners shall be required to take evidence. But it is perfectly obvious that ever since the act was first passed Parliament has considered that any objections should be stated in writing. The obvious reason was that Parliament did not wish people to go along to the redistribution commissioners and attempt to indulge in "" log rolling "". I do not suggest that that has been done by any honourable member; but under such conditions a person with the better advocate would have had an advantage. that that Avent on in some States. distribution we are bound to have people saying, "" I like this, ahd I do not like that"". Such remarks have come from both sides of the House. The Parliament, in its wisdom, or unwisdom, decided that objections must be made in writing. interpretations of that provision. be. I am not saying that I should object to it being altered if the Parliament wanted to alter it. I am just pointing out that the Minister could not issue directions. The redistribution commissioners had to receive objections in writing. Some of them asked for certain information from certain bodies.before making their first report, but they are bound by the act to receive objections only in writing. However much we may like or dislike what has been done, I appeal to honourable members not to make personal attacks on the commissioners during the rest of the debate. When redistribution commissioners are appointed, I do not think it is a fair thing for honourable members to say that they are the play-things of the Government or that they are gerrynianderers. I do not think it is fair to subject them to the smear and sneer tactics which have been used during this debate. Some honourable members think",49,Electoral Redistribution Of Victorian Divisions

I remind the House that some of the present commissioners, in particular two of the chairmen, were appointed as commissioners by the Labour party when it was in office, and apparently they did a very satisfactory job then. In those circumstances, the hollowness of the criticism to which the commissioners have been subjected becomes all the more apparent to the bonorable member for East Sydney( Mr to. Ward) and everybody else. been saying about me? saying that the smear and sneer tactics used by the. honourable member for East Sydney in trying to prove that the commissioners were biased and were playthings of the Government were not worthy of any member of this Parliament. Willis. The Minister will have something to answer then. may come up, but it has nothing to do with the redistribution. In any case, the contract was not made with this Government. It has been said that the commissioners Fairbairn. D. J5. in Victoria should not have gone on the basis of numbers, as they have done to a very large extent, and as they are required to do by the act to a very largo extent. But when we look at the 1948 redistribution, we find that, on that occasion, the commissioners in both Victoria and New South Wales acted very largely on that principle. The honourable member for East Sydney has said that electorates with 46,000 voters have been arranged in order to put more and more Labour voters in blue-riband Labour seats. If the honourable member will look at the previous report for New South Wales, he will find that the electorates with the largest number of voters then are the electorates to which apparently between 3,000 and 4,000 votes have been added now. The criticism of the commissioners is not only inaccurate and unfair, but it has been done with a. definite purpose. The intention underlying it is the intention that underlies many of the tactics that have been adopted in this House recently. Whether we like the redistribution or whether we do not, I hope that the rest of the debate will not be devoted to making attacks on the commissioners personally, attacks against which they are unable to defend themselves in this House.

174,Mr Kent Hughes,"That matterDebate resumed from the 31st May (vide page 1239), on motion by Mr with the work of the commissioners when That the House of Representatives approves nf the distribution of tlie State of South Australia into electoral divisions, as proposed by Messrs. F. B. Phillips. H . L . Fisk and A. W. finwden, the commissioners appointed for the purpose of distributing the said State into divisions, in their report laid before the House of Representatives on the l l t h day of May, ingf>, and that the mimes of the divisions suggested, in the report, and indicated on the niii|>s referred to therein, lie adopted. Honourable members of the party represented on this side of the House raise no objection to the redistribution that has been made in South Australia. In the discussions that have taken place on redistributions in other States, particularly Victoria, complaints have been made, and dissatisfaction exists. This was most evident in the remarks of the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) who objected to the fact that the decisions arrived at by the commissioners were not clarified in their report. But when we road the commissioners' report for South Australia, we see that they have clarified their report, and I think both political parties can say that there has been a great deal of satisfaction with the redistribution in that State. The duties of the commissioners, which are enumerated in section 19 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, have been mentioned before, but I shall refer to them again. There is a specific responsibility on tbe commissioners to have regard to five points, namely, community or diversity of interest, means of communication, physical features, existing boundaries of divisions and subdivisions, and State electoral boundaries. I believe that because the commissioners complied with those five conditions, a satisfactory situation has been brought about in South Australia. so far as the Labour party is concerned. the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) is unjust. If he reads the report, he will see that only one letter containing objections and suggestions was received by the commissioners within the prescribed period. The Minister himself must be very satisfied only one complaint was received, particularly in view of the many complaints that were received in Queensland, New South ""Wales and Victoria. The Minister brings criticism upon himself. I am amazed that he should make the statement that the redistribution satisfies only -the Labour party in South Australia. That cannot be so, in view of the fact that after the redistribution had been completed, only one objection was lodged. I think that would be a magnificent result for commissioners carrying out a redistribution in any State. I desire to pay great tribute to the three commissioners who were responsible for the redistribution in South Australia. I am. confident that if other redistributions had been made with the same satisfactory results, there would have been no complaints made about them in this House. I also believe that if the other reports had been as comprehensive as the one for South Australia, there would have been even fewer complaints about those redistributions. The commissioners in South Australia, in each instance, gave their reasons for making the distribution. Then they considered the objection that was received from one section of the community, and gave their reasons, in their report, why that objection was disallowed. That has not happened in all the States. I repeat that I regret that the Minister interjected that the Labour party was the only party to be satisfied with the redistribution in South Australia. I think that practically everybody in South Australia is satisfied, because the redistribution has been carried out in accordance with the conditions laid down in tbe act. The commissionershave put into operation the five principles contained in section 19, and by so doing, they have given satisfaction, not only to the Labour party, but also to Government members. As I said previously, only one objection was received, and the commissioners set out clearly their reasons for rejecting it Once more, I pay a very special tribute to the commissioners-the chairman and the other two commissionersfor the splendid way in which they",51,Electoral Redistribution Of Victorian Divisions

177,Mr Chambers,"The Minister forcarried out their duty to the great satisfaction of both Government and Labour members in South Australia. [4.23] I support the remarks of my colleague, the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Chambers), by saying that I believe tbe commissioners in South Australia are entitled to the highest praise for tbe manner in which they rejected the objection put forward by the Liberal and Country League in that State. The Liberal and Country League wanted to perpetuate the undemocratic system which operates m the distribution of the State seats, and had the audacity to ask the commissioners to incorporate in the federal boundaries some of the vicious features of the State boundaries, which enabled the Liberal Government to continue in office, in spite of the fact that a majority of 40,000 people at the last election preferred a Labour government. Playford block? Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) says, that is known as the Playford block. Another objection I have is to the name "" Bonython "", which has been given to the new seat. I , personally, would have preferred the new seat to have been called "" Chifley "", or "" Price "", after which he was able to amass for himself some really distinguished Labour man. That could have been done, if the commissioners had paid regard to men of distinction in South Australia from the Labour side. Seeing that it was not possible to get any recognition of the great Labour statesman in South Australia, surely the commissioners, if they must commemorate the name of a tory, could have selected a far more distinguished tory than Sir Langdon Bonython. I can at once think of a tory of far greater distinction than Sir Langdon Bonython ever had. I refer to the late Sir John Downer, who was probably one of the greatest and most outstanding tories that South Australia has had since federation, and even before it. I ask you, sir, to make a comparison now, paper? and I should like the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) to listen true that SirJ ohn Downer owned a newsto the logic of my case. It is not now paper. He was one of the menwho too late to change the name of the proposed new division. Let-us compare the claims of the two men to have their names commemorated. I would not wish to perpetuate the memory of either Sir Langdon Bonython or Sir John Downer, because they both were tories. However, if we must perpetuate the memory of a tory, let us choose the better of the two. who were a bad lot. It is proposed to commemorate the name of Sir Langdon Bonython, who did nothing for South Australia except hand back a few thousand pounds of the money that he thieved from the people of South Australia. We are aware that the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) uses extravagant language, but it is contemptible of him to accuse a dead man of thieving. ( Mr Bowden) -Order! I uphold the point of order, and I ask the honourable member for Hindmarsh to withdraw the remark to which objection has been taken. draw it. The fact remains that Sir Langdon Bonython gave back to the people a few thousand pounds of the money that he was able to extract from the community in South Australia by conducting a politically biased newspaper and by other devious means by a tremendous fortune. By what act for the public benefit is he entitled to have his name commemorated in the title of an electorate? On the other hand, the late Sir John Downer, as I wish to remind the House, was not only a Premier of South Australia, a very able Premier who did his duty as he saw it but also tbe representative in the South Australian Parliament for more than 30 years, of the area that is to become the federal electorate of Bonython. Moreover, he was an original member of this Parliament, for he represented South Australia as a member of the first Senate that was elected.",52,Ktsnt Hughes

185,Mr Clyde Cameron,"It is notattended tlie federal conventions and helped to draft the Australian Constitution. He was one of the fathers of federation, and it is known, also, that most of the sections of the Constitution -were drafted in his home. Here was a man who represented in the South Australian Parliament the area now to become the federal electorate of Bonython. He was & Premier of South Australia and, as a South Australian senator, a foundation member of this Parliament. He has a son who is at the present time a distinguished member of this House, the -honourable member for Angas. No matter what test is applied to his merits and those of Sir Langdon Bonython, Sir John Downer has the far greater claim to have his name commemorated. I wish to refer also to the objections to the proposed redistribution that have been made. From remarks that were made by my esteemed colleague the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Chambers), I understand that the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) made some inane interjection to the effect that supporters of the Australian Labour party are the only people who are satisfied by the proposed redistribution in South Australia. If Labour had had the opportunity to redistribute the electoral boundaries in South Australia in conformity with its wishes, it could have done a much better job for itself than was done by the distribution commissioners. Tho boundaries in South Australia have been so redistributed as to make Sturt a handmade Liberal stronghold. If the redistribution had been made in a slightly different manner, the metropolitan area of Adelaide would have returned at least six Labour members out of the seven metropolitan members. objection on that score. ""We do not want to gerrymander the electorates, and Labour has never asked that they be gerrymandered. We say simply that the distribution commissioners have done a very good job. They avoided the mistake that was made in 1949, when the electoral boundaries were so redistributed as to give the South Australian electorates approximately equal numbers of voters, without regard for the known probability of population increases in certain areas. On this occasion, the commissioners, to their 1 eternal credit it may be said, have had enough foresight to realize that the population of the proposed new electorate of Bonython will expand rapidly during the next five years, and therefore they have determined the proposed new boundaries in such a manner as to make the population of the electorate between 5,000 and 6,000 less than the quota. If this were not done, in five or six years' time the population of the electorate would probably be 10,000 or 15,000 in excess of the quota, just as the number of voter; in the present Kingston electorate is about 20,000 in excess of tbe quota, because the commissioners who made the redistribution in 1949 failed to consider future developments. I repeat that the distribution commissioners have done an excellent job. I completely disagree with their plan to commemorate the memory of the late Sir Langdon Bonython, who I think if not entitled to any special honour. [ do not think that we should commemorate the name of any tories, for they all have been well repaid by the pecuniary rewards most of them received during their life-time for any service that they have done. retained ? boundaries have been made? change was a very sensible one. The Mount Barker area has been transferred to the Angas electorate. We know that the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) has objected to I make no this change. He is a weird individual, as you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, know, and his opinions are often based on most peculiar grounds. No one has been able to find any valid basis for his objections to the proposed redistribution of electoral boundaries. One would have expected objections from him in any event. We can dismiss the honourable member and forget about him, because his opinions on matters such as this are unimportant. I content myself with saying that if it is tbe policy of tbe Government that the names of tories only",53,Ktsnt Hughes

I have no objection to the honourable member suggesting any name he likes for a new electorate. As one who has had considerable experience in the community life of Souih Australia, and as one who is a little older than is the honourable member for Hindmarsh, I should neglect my duty if I did not protest against his attack on the reputation of the late Sir Langdon Bonython. The Bonython family's record of service in South Australia knew no politics, and I am sure that the opinions expressed by the honourable member are not shared by his South Australian colleagues. It was in bad taste for the honourable member to refer to Sir Langdon Bonython as he did. Let it now go on record that that gentleman presented to the University of Adelaide tbe Bonython Hall, which is adjacent to Pulteney-street, and which has a capital value at which I cannot even guess. It is a. very handsome and attractive building. In addition, he gave to the South Australian Parliament £100,000 for the construction of Parliament House in Adelaide. If it were necessary to do ao, and if time permitted, I couid mention scores of acts that reflect very great credit upon Sir Langdon Bonython who, without any thought for political aspirations, did much for the underdog in the South Australian community. I know from my own contact with members of the Opposition who represent South Australian electorates that the name of Sir Langdon Bonython is respected and highly regarded, by all reasonable men among them. I shall not refer to the name "" Downer"" at length. We on this side of the House are very proud to have among us a descendant of a gentleman who made a substantial contribution to the national lifp of (this country. It is unfortunate that that name should be mentioned in this chamber in the circumstances in wbich it has been mentioned, and that the names of dead men who cannot defend themselves should be bandied about. The honourable member for Hindmarsh made some reference to the only objection that was made in South Australia. That objection was lodged by the Liberal party in. South Australia and it. was lodged after consultation between every member of the House of Representatives and every senator in that State. We considered that if this protest were made by the Liberal party after consultation between all honourable members and senators in South Australia, then nobody on our side of politics would have occasion to raise any objection to the redistribution. Our chief objection was that, over a period, ail electoral commissions in South Australia have considered that, there should be a margin between the rural and the metropolitan divisions. This principle has been adopted by all commissions in South Australia, whether appointed by a Labour party or Liberal party government. The commission that was appointed by tbe late Mr Curtin examined this position in association with thflate Mr Kevin MoEntee, who was a Labour candidate in South Australia, and re-affirmed the principle which had operated since 1922. In these circumstances, metropolitan electorates had approximately 8 per cent, more electors than rural electorates. Objections were lodged to that principle, which was reconsidered by tbe commission, -but the commission recommended to the Parliament that it should be retained and it has never been rejected by any government. The objection which the Liberal party lodged against the redistribution of divisions related only to that principle. We felt that the principle should be maintained. In order to support our objection, we had to suggest a redistribution of boundaries which would conform with the principle that I have mentioned. That was done very hurriedly but, speaking as one who had sometbing to do with that work, I suggest that it was done very effectively. When our proposal was",54,Ktsnt Hughes

I must say that I was not keen for an electoral division to be called Bonython. When such a proposal was made in 1949, it was rejected after objection had been made by the Labour party, [f, to-day, the Labour party said that it did not want an electorate to be called Bonython, I would raise no objection to another name being substituted.. However, in view of my lengthy period in public life, I considered it my duty to make fair and just comment on the proposal. I do not know whether an approach has been made to the Government to substitute another name for Bonython, but I believe that the honourable member for Hindmarsh has expressed an opinion which is held by many people in the Labour movement. As far as I know, there is nothing objective before the Labour party in this connection. I have grave doubts about the desirability of naming electorates after notable men. Sir Langdon Bonython was a member of the first House of Representatives. As the honourable memb.er for Adelaide( Mr Chambers) has said, the Opposition does not oppose the adoption of the commissioners'' report, but it considers that the commissioners could have given Labour a better deal. They could also bave given a better deal to the metropolitan area. However, the commissioners have done what they considered to be right. I referred a few minutes ago to the fact that, some years ago, a large area was taken from the electorate of Port Adelaide, which threw the relative position of,that electorate out of balance, which the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) [n determining the enrolment of the proposed electorate of Bonython, thecommissioners have gone a good part of the way in favour of an electoral strength 20 per cent, below the quota. Doubtless, they had in mind that when the building of the town of Salisbury is completed, the numbers will be equalized within a relatively short period. I think that that wae support the motion. it is rather a pity that discussion on the South Australian electorates has been characterized to some degree-whateve r may be tbe force of the contention of my friend, the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron)-by th* merits of the designation of the new electorate. I myself, as a small boy. remember Sir Langdon Bonython, who was, without doubt, a venerable and kindly man and, for South Australia, a generous and public-spirited citizen. I i is true that bis connection with politic? was not a very sustained one, but, nonetheless, through the columns of his newspaper, and by other means, he supported the whole course of federalism wheD federalism was an incipient movement. He was also, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) has said, a member of the first House of Representatives for two terms, from 1901 until, 1 think, 1906, when he retired. Without question, he was a philanthropist in a big way, who donated, as my friend, thp honourable member for Boothby( Mr McLeay), mentioned, £100,000 toward? the cost of the completion of Parliament House in Adelaide. He also made a munificent benefaction to the University of Adelaide, and helped many a cause, without his action being trumpeted about, in divers respects. Rather than have these arguments a? to whether electorates should be called after one man or another-in this case both of the men are dead-and trying to make an assessment of what was their relative worth, or their place in history. I think it would be better to depart from personal names. The suggestion has been made by the honourable member for Port Adelaide-and I think I am right in saying that this is a view with sympathizes-that our electorates for the most part should be given territorial designations, as is done in Great Britain.",58,Ktsnt Hughes

206,Mr Downer (Angas) [4.58],"I feelThat would overcome this controversy once and for all and avoid feelings of bitterness and embarrassment among families. This redistribution is unfavorable to the Government, as far as South Australia is concerned. It does not matter what honourable members from the other side of the House may say, when one looks at the electoral map one can see that no particular good will flow to the cause of liberalism in South Australia as a result of it. But we accept the proposed redistribution. In accepting it, I hope the House will forgive me for yielding to the temptation to refer to the attitude of the Labour party during the debate yesterday and this afternoon. Because some honourable members opposite did not like the proposed redistribution in New South Wales and Victoria, they castigated the commissioners and voted against the respective motions. I shall contrast that attitude with ours. Although we dislike the proposed redistribution and regard it as unfavorable to us, we are prepared to accept the umpire's decision, because that is what it amounts to. The Government appointed the commission, and the commission has submitted its recommendations. It is an open secret, as was announced in the House this afternoon, that the Liberal and Country League of South Australia objected to the proposed electoral demarcations, but the commissioners rejected the league's submission in to to. Having gone that far, we are not prepared to go any further. We are prepared-as honourable members opposite evidently are not-to accept the umpire's decision, without patting ourselves on the back, although I believe that this is the principle on which public life in this Commonwealth should be conducted. Nevertheless, I feel that I must join with my colleague, the honourable member for Boothby, in pointing out that the deciSpeaker, which, if I may be permitted sion of the commissioners is open to serious objections, which I classify as two-fold. First, although I know that honourable members opposite will strongly disagree with what I am about to say, from the way we see it and from tbe way a great many people in South Australia without party allegiance see it, the commissioners have virtually equalized the metropolitan and country electorates. Whatever may have been said here this afternoon, this is contrary to a practice that has. been observed in South Australia for decades. As recently as 194S, when the electorates which we now represent were propounded, an allowance of 8 per cent, was made by the then commissioners between town and rural constituencies; the present commissioners have reduced this disparity to a mere 1 per cent., which is virtually erasing it. I would say that the previous disparity of S per cent, was justified for these reasons: It is false to argue this matter in the abstract by, in effect, putting oneself in a vacuum and looking at the matter only from a theoretical point of view. I ask honourable members to recall thai South Australia, in terms of area, is a very large country. It embraces more than 380,000 square miles, which make? it territorially the third largest State in the Commonwealth. Five-eighths of tbe population of this large State is concentrated in the metropolitan area of Adelaide. Furthermore, the foundation of South Australia's wealth, in spite ol the great industrialization of the State under the present Premier, still rests on its primary industries. If we get away from that, we neglect at our peril some thing which is fundamental in our State. In the few rural electorates of South Australia the distances are immense, sometimes to the point of being fantastic. The gargantuan electorate of the honourable member for Grey( Mr Russell) immediately comes to mind. Mr Justice Nicholas, in his report of two or three years ago, classified it as a Grade V. electorate. My own electorate is a ver\ considerable one. It extends over aboui 400 miles from north to south and about 200 miles from east to west, and it is classified as a Grade IV . electorate. Your own electorate of Barker, Mr to say so, you have represented with such credit and distinction for so many years, is also one of great magnitude. I think that honourable members generally and any dispassionate student, of politics will agree that, however eminent a man may be, and however assiduous in the discharge of his duties to his constituents, it is virtually impossible for any one of us to represent these vast tracts of country in South Australia at any rate, of fewer adequately and in the way we would want them to be represented. Any country member of this Parliament knows, especially those who come from these large stretches of land, that there is a much greater diversity of interest in an electorate such as mine, which covers half the size of Victoria, than in a metropolitan electorate which embraces five, ten, or perhaps 50 square miles. SoI would say that the commissioners have been at fault in South Australia in ignoring those considerations, and it is interesting to observe that in some of the other States, notably New South ""Wales and Victoria, the commissioners have combined districts. My other criticism of the commissioners concerns the new metropolitan electorate of Bonython. adhered to their reasoning, in spite of the protests of the Liberal and Country League in South Australia, by establishing this new division with a mere 35,000 votes, which is considerably below the ejuota figure for this State. They justify their decision, sir, as you very well know, by the projected satellite town of Salisbury, which it is believed will be well under construction in the next few years, [f we are going to be fair about this matter, we must agree that this is. jusi. in the conjectural stage. This is only a project which has not materialized into reality. Therefore, we come to the conclusion that these boundaries are shoretermed, in a period of very rapid population and expansion all over Australia, and particularly in South Australia. Perhaps in five or six years Bonython may have reached the quota. It may conceivably have exceeded it somewhat, hut it seems irrefutable that for tbe next few years the Bonython electorate will be under-populated, very probably during the greater part of the existence of these constituencies. As has been stated here this afternoon, the Liberal and Country League made these protests to the commissioners, but they were rejected summarily. I feel that I must say that the commissioners are wrong in persisting in their attitude, and I hope that on the next occasion the time-honoured principle, Mr Downer. electors in rural divisions than in metropolitan divisions, will be observed. desire to speak for a few minutes on this proposal. Eirst, I should like to reply to the statement made by the honourable member for Angas( Mr Downer) about the new division of Bonython. Anybody who faces up to this new division realistically can easily foresee that within the next three years the division of Bonython, on a population basis, will be on a par with most of the other divisions. It stands comparison with my own division of Kingston, which', upon this rerural and metropolitan distribution, will lose 20,000 electors. The satellite town of Salisbury, where the South Australian Housing Trust has already started building, where schools are already built and people are already They have shifting in, will grow rapidly, and there is no doubt that the commissioners were wise .in allocating such a quota to this new subdivision. The allegation that it ia unfavorable to tbe Liberals makes one smile, becauseat the present time the proportion in this is 6:4, and it will be 6:5 with the new boundaries. How it can be bad, I do not know, because whilst Labour will probably win the new seat, it seems that Sturt will be handmade for its former member, Mr Wilson. The honourable member fb r that somebody told honourable members on this side, that it was the Liberal Country party that had objected to the commission and as the Liberal-Country party was not named in tbe report we should not know -who had objected..

The greatest commendation on the fairnessof this report arises from tlie fact that, the Sta.te boundaries are being redistributed at tbe present time.

211,Mr Johnson (Kalgoorlie) [5.16],"did not visualize that in 1955 the population in the northern part of Western Australia would be smaller than it was just after they made their recommendations. .The present position has arisen because of the neglect of successive Australian governments which failed to recognize their national responsibility for the development of that area. I have claimed in this Parliament time and time again that the development of the northern area of Western Australia is beyond the capacity of a State government and, therefore, that, in the interests of this nation as a whole, it should be accepted as a national responsibility. The sooner we can convince a Commonwealth government to take its fair share of the responsibility for developing and populating that area, the sooner we shall have in it the numerical strength of electors required to enable the electorate to be split into more than one division. I consider that the commissioners, in fied with a redistribution to suggest thai extending the electorate, have cut across the reason they have not been satisfied is the principle, by which they should have that there has been some foul play, somebeen guided, of community of interests, by where or other, on the part of a commisincluding in it rural areas which have sion or political party or somebody else. nothing in common with the major porThat seems to happen time and time tion of the electorate.

I think that one thing this Parliament, and I received very subbecomes apparent, which has particular stantial support from the rural areas on application to Western Australia, and that occasion. SoI can look forward, that is that the commissioners in the with a vcitain amount of confidence, to various States, in which they operate support in those areas, the people of under one act, are given a set of principles which I already have had the honour to to guide them, but do not apply those prinrepresent here. I have little more to say on the matter instance to which the honourable member because, as I said at the outset, the Oppofor Kalgoorlie ( Mr Johnson) has sition has no violent reaction to the prodrawn attention. His electorate has been posal. However, I repeat that, tbe act enlarged, in area, yet it is to have only should be amended to give tbe commis32,159 electors, whereas the average sioners wider power so as to allow them quota in Western Australia, is 37,000 to take into consideration the physical electors.

As I have told this Parliament on many occasions, if we are not prepared to grapple with the problems that exist there, and to use the potentialities for development that exist on the Ord, Fitzroy and other rivers in the area, we cannot blame people abroad who may cast their eyes on that land. I issue that as a warning. far as I can see the pattern of the debates on the various proposals for redistribution of electorates throughout the Commonwealth has followed closely the pattern of other debates on electoral redistribution. In other words, it is quite obvious that no redistribution of electorates can please everybody. However, there is a regrettable tendency on the part of some people who are not entirely satisThe electoral redistribution in Western ciples uniformly. We have a glaring",62,Hughes

Another aspect, which has particular application to Western Australia, is that a rigid line has been drawn around the metropolitan area. That has had the result of putting all suburban and metropolitan electorates in one group, and all rural electorates in another. principle may be good; it may be bad. I. think that it merely creates additional problems for the commissioners. makes it more difficult for them to apply fairl y the other principles laid down in the act, so far as the whole of the State is concerned. In effect, they have, in interpreting their duties, created a principle that has not been laid down in the act. Whether the principle is right or wrong, it is not applied universally throughout the States. It is appliedto a . certain degree in South Australia, but it is not applied in the other States. These things should be ironed out and, if necessary, the act amended either to provide that one body shall look at all the redistributions in the States, or lay down additional principles as a guide to the commissioners. Certain people, for very good reasons of their own, have lodged objection to redistributions. In every case but one, those objections have been overruled by die commissioners. A. great deal of the beat that is engendered during debate in this House, and many of the grievances that sometimes are quite legitimately complained of by honourable members, are attributable to a feeling that objections are not really given a f a i r hearing. I am quite satisfied that in Western Australia this plan of redistribution was formulated in the mind of the Chief Electoral Officer before the commission was ever appointed. I have been reliably informed that he actually drew all the lines on the map and justified his plan to the other commissioners. In view of the present constitution of the commission in each State, we cannot really complain about that. The Chief Electoral Officer lives with these problems year in and year out. He knows tbe position backwards, and if there is any faul t to be found with that, it is simply that he cannot see the wood for the trees. The result is that the other two commissioners are more or les? figureheads, according to the degree of personality that they may have. Whatever the position, the Chief Electoral OfiSceri n each Statei n fact draws the lines and justifies his proposals to the other two commissioners. able member suggest that there should be a new set-up? in a moment. The other two commissioners w ill , in normal circumstances, f a l l into line with the Chief Electoral Officer. We cannot overlook the importance of that gentleman in this matter, but I suggest that other interested parties should have a better hearing before a more independent commission. My proposal to the Minister is this: as the Chief Electoral Officer knows the position backwards, and is aware of all the problems that it presents, he should be an advisory officer. In most cases he knows, three or four years ahead, the sort of thing that he w ill incorporate in his next plan of distribution. It would be desirable to call upon h i m to prepare a plan and present it to a commission of which he was not a member. The commission could then have a public hearing, and discussion of this plan. Every one would then be aware of the part that that officer had played in the redistribution. The commisioners would not be infected by the somewhat rigid attitude that all of us. being ordinary mortals, adopt in regard to our own ideas. The Chief Electoral Officer may, for a long time, have certain ideas about new boundaries in a State. He may have lived with those ideas for so long that he cannot see any merit in the objections that are put to him and hi? fellow commissioners. We all dislike being told that we are wrong when we have thought deeply on something. If there is to be a sense of fairness-whethe r fairness has in fact been exercised or not-abou t the redistribution in the mind? of the public a new procedure should be adopted and the act amended. Coming now to the redistribution in Western Australia, it is obvious when onf looks at the metropolitan area that the new electorate of Stirling is merely an",63,Hughes
213,That Mr Allan Fbaser,Would the honor,64,Hughes
214,It Mr Freeth,"I shall come to thatelectorate of convenience. It is a dreadf ul electorate so far as every requirement in the act is concerned. It is long and narrow and takes in an area along the whole length, and down one side of, the metropolitan area. It has been made up from bits and pieces left over from other electorates. I am not suggesting that the commissioner has deliberately ignored the act in creating the electorate. I fully realize that in a State with only nine seats it is difiicult to apply, with precision community of interest. But what has and accuracy, the somewhat vague principles that are laid down in the present act, but it should be quite obvious to any student of tbe position that the new electorate of Stirling offends most of those principles. The numbers in the metropolitan electorates are bad because they do not take into account population growth in some areas and the waning of population in others. Turning now to my own electorate of Forrest, of which I have perhaps a more detailed knowledge, the redistribution is absurd when one considers the principle of community of interest. The eastern part of the electorate, the lower great southern, has been cut off completely from the port of Albany, with which it has a great and increasing community of interest. Some day I would like to take the Chief Electoral Officer to a lower great southern regional conference. He would then see that all the people in that area regard themselves as completely united with the Albany zone. For some reason, merely to make up numbers, the whole of the subdivision of Katanning was taken out of Forrest. All the lines of communication in the district are based on Albany. The distribution of superphosphate is based on the new works in that centre. The fat lamb trade is exported through Albany by way of the meat works there. That centre also contains a newly-established organization for the bulk handling of wheat. There is an increasing community of interest in the area. A great deal of the wool from the lower great southern goes to the London wool market through this port. A special market was developed through it, and a unique position created. Albany area is separated from the remainder of Forrest by a few million acres of State forestry reserve. There is no Mr Freeth. direct linkage such as previously existed through the great southern. The whole of the intervening area, through Bunbury, Bridgetown and Kojonop, had a growing community of interest. From Bunbury southwards the dairying was based largely on the production of butter fat whereas, northwards, it is based largely on the production of whole milk. All those things indicate that the whole of that block had a great and increasing happened? It has been cut, and the half of it based on Albany has been put into the Canning electorate. The northern half of the Canning electorate has a greater community of interest with either Bunbury or Perth so far as marketing, lines of communication ahd other matter? are concerned. I turn to .another aspect of this subject which I think is of considerable importance. It has been suggested that the size of country electorates plays some part in the considerations of the commissioners. It is quite right that i i should, because we cannot ignore the fact that people such as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Johnson) and the honourable member for Angas( Mr Downer) have tremendously large areas to serve. I suggest that it should be quite an important consideration, having regard to all other factors, that the sizes of country electorates should be kept approximately equal. The electorate of Canning has been practically doubled iu size. The subdivision of Katanning has been added to it. Although that subdivision contains a mere 6,000 voters, it extends over a width of 180 miles or more from Kojonup to Ravensthorpe, and has a depth of well over 50 miles. That subdivision has been taken out of the electorate of Forrest and added to the Canning electorate. The Forrest electorate has been reduced in area, but with the big disability that one part of it is entirely divorced from the other. I suggest that if it had been practicable, as I believe it was, to tie the great southern area with Albany, it would have been Also, the better to keep those two electorates as they were, more nearly equal in area than they will be. That would have given the people of Canning an opportunity to see their member more frequently and would have distributed more evenly the duties of the two federal representatives concerned. We cannot complain unduly about the redistribution, but I suggest that the principles applied by the Chief Electoral Officer were unduly rigid. Because he sits in judgment on appeals from his own decisions in these matters, we should examine the act with a view to arriving at a more easy method of dealing with objections and suggestions about redistribution. They are received after the Chief Electoral Officer has made up his mind, but we must all admit that he is bound to have the most firmly fixed ideas about these matters, because he lives with them from day to day. I suggest that it would be wiser to provide that he shall act merely as an advisory officer to the electoral distribution commission. Finally, I suggest that we should have a uniform set of principles which would have a better application throughout all the States. are three ways in which the redistribution of electoral boundaries can be approached. The subject can ,be approached from a purely personal viewpoint, from a party viewpoint or. from an entirely unbiased viewpoint. I suggest that because we are almost bound to approach it from either a personal viewpoint or a party viewpoint, this is the least likely place in which it will be approached from an unbiased viewpoint. . If it had been left to me to make the redistribution in Western Australia from my personal viewpoint, I could have made a jolly sight better job of it than the commissioners have made. I could have made a much better job of it from a party viewpoint than the commissioners have made; but I am not so sure that I could have done equal justice to a very difficult problem from an unbiased viewpoint. The bonorable member for Forrest( Mr Freeth) has referred to the fact that the commissioners have separated metropolitan areas from rural areas in Western Australia. Western Australia. The commissioners have applied a principle wbich is funda[49] mental to State legislative representation. The State laws with regard to electoral boundaries make a clear distinction between metropolitan and rural areas. They provide that the metropolitan areas shall be represented by so many members, and that the rural areas shall be represented by so many members. So, as I see the position, the commissioners have applied, in this redistribution, a principle which governs legislative representation in the State Parliament. They were faced with a very difficult problem. In the period between the last redistribution and this one, enrolments in metropolitan divisions increased by 8.4 .per cent. The increase of enrolments in the extra-metropolitan divisions, or the rural divisions, in that period was 15.7 per cent. At first sight, those figures indicate that the rural areas are entitled to the additional seat which has been given to Western Australia. But the fact is that the whole of the 15.7 per cent, increase of enrolments in the rural divisions occurred in the metropolitan portions of those divisions. In fact, the number of voters in the truly rural areas is smaller than it was previously. The commissioners must have taken that fact into consideration. In doing so, they looked at the matter from an unbiased viewpoint. I think they acted wisely and did quite a good job. The honourable member for Forrest has said that, in his opinion, the plan for the redistribution in Western Australia was prepared by the Chief Electoral Officer and that the other two commissioners, Mr Fyfe, the Surveyor-General, and Mr Friend, the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, were only ""yes men "". I have had a very long personal and official association with Mr Fyfe and Mr Friend. I assure the honourable member for Forrest and other honourable members that neither of those gentlemen lacks anything in personality, strength of character or ability to make a decision for himself. To my knowledge, they were the two people most unlikely to acquiesce in a plan submitted to them by the Chief Electoral Officer unless it were supported That is characteristic of by sound and solid reasons. Two of the three commissioners were appointed by virtue of their official positions and the",64,Hughes
215,Mr Leslie (Moore) [5.40],"Ther eother was chosen by the Minister. The organization to which the honourable member for Forrest belongs welcomed the appointments, because it was well known that the three commissioners were above suspicion, had minds of their own, and would say what they thought without hesitation. There are one or two matters connected with the redistribution in Western Australia to which I want to refer. First, I associate myself with the complaint that has been made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Johnson) in relation to the Kalgoorlie division. I do not believe this is a matter which can be corrected in the Commonwealth Electoral Act; I think an alteration of the Constitution must be made. It may be that, ultimately, the matter can be resolved, as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie suggests, only by the creation of a new seat in the north-west. The Constitution lays down the way in which a quota shall be established, and I believe that the Commonwealth Electoral Act has to comply with the requirements of the Constitution. In order to overcome the difficulty caused by the enormous area of Kalgoorlie, an alteration of the Constitution will be required. That matter might well be considered by the body which the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) is about to appoint to examine constitutional matters. I agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie and the honourable member for Angas( Mr Downer) that it is impossible for the representatives of large electorates such as these to give that urgent attention to the wishes of the electors which can be given only by close personal contact. A closely settled area does afford a member an opportunity to make that contact. My own electorate of Moore comprises ten State electorates and 40 local government authorities. I leave it to honourable members to picture in their own minds the physical impossibility-even were not required to be in Canberra for a. considerable period of the year-of making personal contact, even only once a week, with each of the districts of tbose 40 local authorities. valuable personal contact with tbe individual electors is lost. Many of them Mr Leslie. have valuable suggestions to make, and that can best be done by personal contact. Unfortunately, those personal discussions are denied to honourable members who represent large electorates. The relationship of area to numbers' does come into the picture. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie bas my deepest sympathy, but I assure him that he will not be detrimentally affected by the addition of a portion of my electorate to his seat. He represented it before it fell into my hands, and during my visits to that part of the country, I have found that he is held in high esteem by the people who have given me support no less than they gave to him. I say, most sincerely, that I am sorry to lose the people of that area. I am sorry to see them go, because during one's association with a district, one establishes a close friendship with the people in it. I refer to the districts of Minginew, Morowa, Mullewa and Irwin, or the Dongara road board. The people in those areas have no interest which is in common with that of the people in the remainder of the Kalgoorlie electorate. Kalgoorlie is essentially a mining area, except for the northern part, which is the forgotten area of Western Australia. The districts I mentioned are purely rural, primary-producing areas, and it will be difficult for the honourable member to give the people the adequate service that should come from the National Parliament. However, one cannot blame the commissioners for that sort of thing. They are required to carry out the provisions of the act. If anything, I should be inclined to blame the commissioners in Western Australia for a too-rigid adherence to the provisions of the act. They followed religiously the State electoral boundaries, believing that there was a community of interest in those areas, and they also held to the local government if one authority boundaries, believing that they, too, were based on community of interest. That is not always so. If the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) is willing to receive suggestions about Obviously, this future determinations of boundaries, I offer the suggestion that the commissioners should in the course of their duties, personally visit some of the disinto electoral divisions, as proposed by Messrs. tricts where they propose to effect a E. W. Dwyer, F. Miles and E. C. Botten, the change. I do not say they should necesdistributing the said State into divisions, in sarily do so in order to communicate to their report laid before the House of Reprethe people their ultimate decision, but to sentatives on the 3rd day of May, 1955, and ascertain from personal knowledge where that thc names of the divisions suggested in the real community of interest in the to therein, be adopted, except that the name respective districts lies. In the redistribution, portion of the metropolitan area has been included in Speaker, I ask for leave to continue my my electorate. It is purely a suburban remarks at a later stage. area which, at the present time is certainly included in a local authority district, but it has no community of interest.

217,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister f o rand some other countries, including Australia, laid plans to avoid in the postwar era at least the worse features of this pre-war experience. These discussions led to a series of international trade conferences, culminating in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which was reached at Geneva in 1947. The members of tbe present Government were critical of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947, when the present Government parties were in Opposition. In office, our dissatisfaction was accentuated by the trade problems which confronted Australia in recent years. With the transition in tbe United Kingdom from the system of bulk trading and long-term contracts to a system of private or commercial trading, the measures adopted by competing suppliers, such as export subsidies or exchange rate practices, assumed new and very real significance for us. The accumulation in tbe United States of huge surpluses of agricultural commodities offered a grave threat to many of our exports. At home,.the tariff commitments entered into under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade became increasingly irksome. There developed a strong ease for reviewing the system of Commonwealth preferences with a view to restoring the value of certain preferences on Australian exports. The Ottawa Agreement became marked by a serious decline in its value to Australia compared with its cost in the form of benefits extended in our own market to the United Kingdom. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was directly relevant to most of these problems. The idea of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a set of trade rules, is a good idea. But that is not to say that the particular set of rules that we found in the general agreement was necessarily better for us tban no set at all. We found that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade had been reasonably effective in certain respects, notably in inducing tariff stability and making possible some important reductions in tariffs against our exports, for example, wool in the United States. despite this, on examining the provisions and the omissions of the general agreement, the Government had very nearly reached the conclusion, a couple of years ago, that to have no set of trade rules at all would be better than to have that set of rules which bound us too rigidly in some respects, and at the same time completely failed to protect us in other important respects. However, in 1953, we demanded a review of the general agreement. Other countries also favoured a review. We wanted the whole agreement to be revised-if necessary, revised drastically-so that the problems which were fundamental to Australia would be adequately met. We put aside the suggestions from overseas. We took a clean piece of paper. We set down the things we wanted and the things that we wanted to prevent. We developed a genuinely Australian approach. Out of this, we wrote down our objectives in the review of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Our export earnings being so dependent upon a few commodities, obviously it was imperative to seek measures to protect them in the world's markets against unfair trading practices on the part of our competitors. On the other hand, our export income was vulnerable to sudden and great fluctuations. Our import bill was high and growing steadily as development proceeded. We must therefore resist -encroachment upon the right of the Australian Government to make its own decisions on import restrictions. Ottawa preferences were a great issue. The rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade shut out any practical possibility of restoring the effectiveness of those margins of preference which, through price rises, had lost their effectiveness. So we had an amendment of these rules as a major objective. Another main objective arose from the fact that to secure tariff concessions for its export products, Australia had bound, sometimes at reduced ra""tes, a number of tariff duties against increase. We had found the old agreement procedures for negotiating release from a bound rate -uncertain and irksome in Australia's parBut, ticular circumstances. Our objective was to secure procedures which would not",68,General Agreement On Tariffs And Trade
218,Mr Mcewen.,"frustrate any decision by the Government to raise a bound rate of duty in those cases where the Government adopted a Tariff Board recommendation for ahigher rate of duty. wise after the event. Air. McEWEN I am merely mentioning the disabilities that were imposed on Australian secondary industry by the Chifley Labour Government. The objective to which I have referred had to be achieved without tearing down the whole structure of tariff stability under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. These, then, were the Government's high objectives: to protect Australian exports against subsidies and surplus disposals; to resist encroachment upon the rights of decision regarding import restrictions; to obtain more flexible rules allowing some adjustments in export preference margins and to secure greater flexibility in adjusting bound tariff rates where shown to be essential. British Commonwealth discussions were held in London before the review conference proper at Geneva. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'Sullivan) and I stated the firm views of the Australian Government on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade review in special talks with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade and with other senior United Kingdom Ministers. At Geneva we won recognition of the fact that Australia had a special point of view. We had it accepted, not as an abstract principle, but as a practical feature governing Australia's position in many fields, that Australia was in a category almost of its own. Many of the other industrialized countries had much common ground in their approach to the review. They sought lower or rigidly bound tariffs and tight trade rules on such matters as import restrictions to safeguard overseas funds. The other main group were the so-called economically underdeveloped countries. These are the countries characterized by a low standard of living for most of their peoples. They have great and complex problems in their attempts to improve the economic lot of their often very large populations. We established our claim that Australia was in neither of these groups. The Australian economy is a rapidly developing one, but still dependent on a few major exports for overseas funds. There is a fast-growing population, with commensurate growth in requirements of consumer and capital goods. For geographical reasons, security considerations demand-support of certain industriesa fact that ought to be clear to everybody. Almost every country represented at the conference had its own objectives, and its own list of proposals. In such a conference, it is safe to say that no one country gets all it seeks. The final outcome is certain not to be completely satisfactory to any country. Nevertheless Australia's efforts met with very substantial success', as a brief survey will suggest. One of the ways in which we sought to obtain a more balanced agreement for Australia was to press for a greater degree of safeguard for countries exporting mainly primary products-for provisions which would assure fair trading opportunities. There were two main types of action on which we took issue-disposal s of agricultural surpluses and export subsidies on primary products. The United States of America, with its huge surpluses, is the principal source of concern in this respect, and was under great pressure by those who shared our anxieties. In the outcome, the United States fully subscribed to a conference resolution recognizing that the disturbing effects of these disposals can be substantially diminished, and the risk of injury minimized through adequate consultation with the other interested parties. The resolution sets out the consultation procedure to be followed. It represents, in effect, a commitment on the part of the countries concerned to dispose of their agricultural surpluses in such a way as to avoid unduly provoking disturbances on the world market that would adversely influence other members. It places upon them an onus to consult with other countries likely to be affected by the disposals. While not carrying as binding or as precise an obligation as we wished to see, the resolution does represent a substantial step forward.",69,General Agreement On Tariffs And Trade
219,Mr Haylen,"The Government wasWith regard to export subsidies, we pointed out that while we were building expensive storage to hold unsold wheat, wheat that was heavily subsidized to the extent, sometimes, of 8s. to 10s. a bushel was being bought in the world's markets from Argentina and elsewhere. In the event we gained new clauses in the general agreement which now recognize that export subsidies may have harmful effects for other countries, and which provide that they are not to be used on primary commodities to distort the normal pattern of trade. Tbe traditional arrangements for Australian primary industries-that is, our internal stabilization schemes and twoprice schemes-which , in the main, aim at stability in price on the domestic market, are not affected by these new provisions. Furthermore, we attacked this export subsidy problem on the importing country's side. Tbe existing text of the general agreement had permitted countervailing duties to be imposed only under very limited conditions. In layman's language, countervailing duties are additional customs duties put on to offset dumping-resulting , for example, from subsidies in exporting countries. The new clause that we secured provides that, where material injury is caused or threatened by such subsidies, permission will automatically be forthcoming for the importer to levy anti-dumping duties to protect the interests of another supplying country. ThisI regard as a distinct improvement. It is particularly relevant for Australia in the United Kingdom, where so much of our exports are marketed. Hitherto, the United Kingdom Government has had no legislative authority to impose countervailing duties. This was one of the points we took up with the United Kingdom Ministers in London. NowI note with satisfaction that the United Kingdom Government officially announced in April last that the necessary legislative powers for increases in the United Kingdom tariff will be sought. I now turn tn the Ottawa preference Belgians, the Italians and tbe Americans issue. The General Agreement on Tariffs saw our request as a proposal that they «ind Trade sets itself most strongly should accept higher tariffs in Australia against discriminatory tariff arrangeagainst their goods. Their goods were ments such ne flip Ottawa preferences. already handicapped in the Australian '/>. Mcl*< The 1947 agreement allowed then existing preferences, but barred any new ones or increases of the old ones. Members of this Government protested strongly when in opposition. We were unable to influence the then government to reject the agreement or to find any compensations for accepting this limitation on preferences. As a government, we have found that our criticism was well justified. The Government found that this rule of the general agreement-the so called no preference rule-impose d an unreasonable restriction on countries which had entered into preferential arrangements before the general agreement was framed. There have been steep increases in world price levels. But certain margins of preference enjoyed by certain Australian exports in the United Kingdom particularly, and also in some other preferential markets, are expressed in pre-war money values. Such preferences have therefore lost much of their effectiveness. For example, in 193S the butter preference of 15s. per cwt. was worth 14 per cent. To-day. due to the higher value of butter, it is worth less than 5 per cent. There are many other examples. We sought support for a measure of flexibility in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which would have enabled us to negotiate the re-adjustment of preferences which had so lost their value. From the beginning, we encountered opposition even from Commonwealth countries except from the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the new Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. We carried the issue from London to Geneva, where, besides lack of Commonwealth support, we faced strong opposition from non-Commonwealth countries. As the Dutch and the Danes saw it, for example, we were asking for agreement against their butter and bacon. From a different point of view, the Germans, the market, because of tbe existing preferences against tbem, although' claimed to be often more cheaply produced at their source than are the favoured British goods. In the outcome at Geneva, because the no new preference rule was already entrenched in the agreement, we failed to get support other than from the same three Commonwealth countries, and France. The no new preference rule therefore remains in the agreement, and it might be argued that this is sufficient reason for our withdrawing from the agreement. In fact, this is no solution, since, for example, it would not be possible for the United Kingdom to increase its preferences to us while it remained a signatory to the agreement, which it clearly intends to do. The determination to prevent preferential or discriminatory arrangements is absolutely fundamental to the trade policy of most signatory countries. This fact must be understood in any thinking about the need to correct the undoubted inbalance in the Ottawa Agreement as between ourselves and the United Kingdom. I have referred to bound rates of duty in our tariff. ""We regard it as essential to be able to modify these bound rates in order to implement Tariff Board recommendations. We wanted, at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade review, to get enough flexibility into the agreement to permit independent modifications of our tariff when necessary. Our seeking the kind of flexibility I have described raised an almost classic case. A primary objective of the agreement, as conceived at Geneva in 1947, was to achieve tariff stability by countries agreeing to freeze or reduce tariffs, or limit the scope of increases. That objective was approved by the Pnrliament when the Chifley Government was in office. All the powerful oldestablished industrial countries which had influenced the general agreement to its original form in 1947 bar! everything to gain by promoting tariff inflexibility, even at tbe cost of rigidity. While we subscribed, especiallv for our exports, to the objective of tariff stability, our task was to eain recognition for the fact that we also needed freedom to use our own tariff as an instrument for developing our own economic resource. . and our own second0 are industries. To cut short a long story of difficult negotiation, we finally obtained agreement to a formula for treating bound tariffs which gave us considerably more flexible procedures than are available to the more advanced industrial countries. In particular, two modifications of high importance to Australian manufacturing industry have been secured. The first is that, in common with all members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade we would be able every three years to review whether we wish to extend our bound schedule of tariff rates or withdraw the schedule in whole or in part. In making a decision of this kind we would always watch what might happen to our exports, for others would be free to withdraw concessions we had been accorded by them. The second great modification is a new procedure, a vital part of which by definition is almost limited in its application to Australia. During the course of each three-year period we will be free under this new provision to re-negotiate cases of bound rates as they arise, such as, for example, when the Government accepts a Tariff Board recommendation for an increase in a bound rate of duty. Our particular entitlement to do this comes from a formula and which some one described as magic words that Australia had obtained, and for which our arguments won acceptance. The formula applies automatically only to those countries which for their export earnings-in the words of the formula Depend upon a relatively small number of primary commodities and which rely on the tariff as an important aid for the further diversification of their economies. That is the definition. It is considered that those words bave an almost exclusive application to Australia, and therefore it is under tbose words that we achieve this new freedom of re-negotiating the bound items of our tariff schedule. It was clearly conceded that this practically singled out Australia among the high-standard industrial countries. But here is the point. Under this formula we virtually will not in future be denied authority to re-negotiate with bound rates. This provision is not available to the industrially advanced countries. Moreover, under the new procedure, delays which, under the old procedure of negotiation, could have been However, having stated and safeguarded unbearable or even literally interminable, our vital interest, we recognized the fact cannot deny to us for longer than 120 that import restrictions practised by days at the most the right to take essenothers, openly or covertly, for protective tial protective action.

220,Mr Mcewen.,"amendments which would permit importrestrictions to be used by them to protect industries incapable of meeting world competition. There were some countries which advocated that almost complete freedom should be given for import restrictions to protect agriculture, on the grounds that tariff protection was unsuitable for these industries. This would have placed the predominant and vital section of Australia's export trade at the mercy of import restrictions imposed in our principal markets without consultation with us, and without any possibility of real control or limitation by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Organization. Accordingly, Australia took a prominent role in insisting upon a procedure under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which would require prior approval in the form of a waiver from the organization's rules before recourse could be taken to import restrictions for protective purposes. ' [Extension of time granted.] It is clearly stated that this approval will not be forthcoming unless applicant countries can satisfy very stringent conditions relating to the duration of the controls, the internal measures to be taken to make them unnecessary, and the manner of use of controls to ensure nondiscrimination. reporting is required, and 1957 has been set as a date for removal of all such restrictions. That the Australian views on these waivers were finally adopted offers some prospect of clearing away barriers to trade in agricultural commodities in a way that was seriously lacking in the old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Until now the management of the general agreement and the secretariat have had merely a temporary and not formally authorized basis. It is now proposed, without effecting any real alteration in the way the agreement operates, to establish a formal organization, which would be called the Organization for Trade Co-operation. This, is provided for in a quite separate agreement from the agreement embodying the revised trade rules ,to which I have been referring. ; At an. earlier working session of the organization decisions were takeir which 72-[50 ] would make it possible for Japan to become a member. However, Japan's accession to the agreement is dependent upon it negotiating satisfactory tariff bargains with members. A government which has refrained from negotiating with Japan is under no obligation to extend to Japan its existing general agreement tariff arrangements. At this point I must acknowledge fully the great assistance rendered to the delegation and to the Government by the industry consultants. To these gentlemen-to Mr S. Powell, Mr J. Tivey and to Mr C. M . WilliamsI express the Government's appreciation of the great co-operation and industry with which they applied themselves to the task of representing"" the viewpoints of their organizations. The National Farmers Union, the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia and the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia were most ably served by their representatives. I must put on record the Value to Australia of the work done by the Very able and devoted public servants who accompanied the delegation. Mr J. G. Crawford, the permanent head of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, was the leader of the officials, and after the departure of the Ministers, led In addition, annual the delegation. There was very wide acknowledgment of the outstanding value of his work to the Australian case and to the work of the conference generally. Dr. W. A. Westerman led the Australian delegation for a period when Mr Crawford returned to Australia for consultation. He and the other able public servants who worked in the delegation are entitled to have recorded the great value of their contribution. I have briefly outlined the objectives set by the Government for the review of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and I have indicated the major changes proposed in the agreement which are of interest to Australia. The statement. I made on the 5th January last, on my return from Geneva, was interpreted by some as foreshadowing Australia's withdrawal from the general agreement. At that stage such a possibility was still not to be ruled out. To have expressed myself otherwise at the very time when a number of major issues had yet to be finally settled would have jeopardized hopes of obtaining further concessions to Australia's viewpoint in the delicate negotiations then in process. However, the document in its final form enables me to say that in respect of those rules that matter most to Australia, the revised general agreement is dramatically different. It has a quality of balance that did not exist before. It is not a perfect document for Australia, nor could this be expected. Yet it can be regarded as giving us more freedom to use our tariff policy to meet the real needs of Australia's development and, at the same time, real prospects of preventing what might otherwise be serious and unpredictable-eve n calamitous-interference s with Australia's export trade. Tbe new prospect of security for our export trade has been largely secured by other countries accepting new restraints upon their policies. By way of contrast, these gains for our export industries have been achieved concurrently with gains in respect of our import policies. Not only will we now have greater flexibility in the use of the tariff but our right will still be unfettered to make the essential decisions on import restrictions ourselves-to choose when to impose or when to remove import restrictions necessary to ensure sufficient funds abroad to pay for our imports. This, then, is the Government's summation of the review of the general agreement-the review which it demanded in 1953-the review which has now been carried through. The Government has closely weighed all the issues in Australia's interests. It has taken into account the attitude of other governments, Act shall bc deemed to have come into operaparticularly of those countries which are tion on thc date of commencement of thc our major markets and great friends.

The United Kingdom has announced that it proposes to accept both the new organization and the revised trade rules. The United States Government has already accepted the revised trade rules but has submitted the proposed organization for trade cooperation to Congress. The American Government, having already accepted the revised trade rules-that is, the general agreement rules, the critical part-ou r acceptance is contingent upon the United Kingdom accepting them, because in our opinion it is essential that these two great trading nations should be operating these rules if we ourselves are to be satisfied that we should operate them. For the same reason, the Commonwealth will separately accept the organization when both the United Kingdom and the United States have done so. I commend the motion to the House. adjourned. .

229,Mr Dtjthie,"As the honorableFranklin will have lost some ground politically as a result of this transfer but he revealed his good sportsmanship by not protesting about it. Both of the honormembers concerned being supporters of the present Government, they must have come to an amicable agreement over the transfer. Franklin, which had 40,400 electors, had to be reduced and the fixed figure was 30,570. Tbe electorates' of Wilmot and Bass are side by side. Bass includes tbe north-eastern corner of Tasmania, Flinders Island and 98 per cent, of the City of Launceston. I may say that it is very well represented by the new member for Bass( Mr Barnard): A few more voters had to be added to the electorate, and the only electorate from which they could be taken was Wilmot, which I represent. We had a little meeting and decided that we could straighten the electoral boundary of Launceston on the southern side. It was very crooked, awkward and unsound geographically, topographically and in every other way. We decided that a certain number of votes might be transferred to my electorate and sent the suggestion on to Hobart. I think that it was the only occasion, in any of the States, when two members made up their minds, and went before the commission with an offer that was accepted. As a result, I have lost 1,250 votes to my esteemed colleague, tbe honourable member for Bass, and the number of voters in my division has been reduced from 35,756 to 34,506. The number in the electorate of Bass has been increased from 33,927 to 35,177. Politically, I have lost a little as a result of that transfer. The electorate of Darwin has not suffered any alteration at all, and, doubtless, the honourable member for Darwin( Mr able members of all parties. Luck) will have something to say about that later. My electorate takes in 13,500 square miles, which is roughly half the area of Tasmania. The redistribution has taken about two square miles from that area, so I still represent a tremenrlr-n.s tract of country. I should like now to mention the names given tn some of the electorates. I believe that the electorate of Darwin owes its name tn Charles Darwin, but no one hns ever been able to tell me the connection between that gentleman and Tasmania, except to suggest that he might have thought us to be the missing link, or part of it. Since 1901, tbe name has been very confusing to people who do not live in Tasmania. Many have thought that the bonorable member for Darwin represented the City of Darwin in the Northern Territory. So, the commissioners, in their wisdom, have decided to change the name to Braddon. The origin of the name Franklin is obvious. Sir Benjamin Franklin was an outstanding Australian who perished, with his ship and colleagues, in the Arctic Circle. They were never found. Denison, which takes in most of Hobart, was named after Major General Sir William Thomas Denison, who was Governor of Tasmania in the late 'forties. Bass has obviously been named after George Bass, the famous explorer who accompanied Flinders on his jour j neys around our coasts. My electorate of Wilmot was named after Sir John Edrdley Edrdley-Wilmot, who was Governor of Tasmania in the early 'forties. The boundaries of the federal divisions in Tasmania have been drawn on a principle different from that operating in any other State. The State electoral boundaries in Tasmania are also the federal electoral boundaries, because the proportional representation system operates in that State. Consequently, the alterations made by the commissioners will be applied for State electoral purposes also. Each of the five State electorates is represented by six honourable members, 30 in all, in the Tasmanian House of Assembly. I do not know whether the State authorities were consulted about the changes, but they appear to have been accepted by honorI sbould like now to say a word or two about the gentleman who has given his name to the new electorate of Braddon. He had the very imposing title of the Right Honourable Sir Edward Nicholas Coventry Braddon, KC.M.B., P.O. So, when the honourable member for Darwin becomes the honourable member for Braddon he will be associated with a very distinguished name in Tasmanian and Australian history. Sir Edward Braddon was born on the l l t h June, 1S29, in Cornwall. He was educated privately and at the University College. London. In 1S47, when lie was eighteen, he went to India to join his cousin's mercantile house in Calcutta. He served in several responsible positions before joining . Sir George Yule's Volunteer Force in the Indian Mutiny. In 1862, at the age of 33, he was appointed Commissioner of Excise and Stamps and,, later, Inspector-General of Registration and Superintendent of Trades and Statistics in a province. In 1878, at the age of 49, he retired on a pension and went to Tasmania. In view of another measuru that bas just been introduced in this Parliament, that fact is of some interest. He went to the beautiful island of Tasmania to spend his retirement. Because, in his wisdom, from all the world, he chose Tasmania, he lived until 1904. I doubt whether he would have done so if he had lived in the hotter northern parts of this country at places such as Brisbane. In July, 1S79, having arrived in Tasmania only the year before, he was elected provision was to operate for only ten to the House of Assembly as member for West Devon. He was then 50 years of age. He held that seat until October, 188S, when he was appointed Agent General in London for the colony of Tasmania. Just before he left for London be became Leader of the Opposition, and on the defeat of the Agnew Ministry in March, 1887, was called upon to form a government. Amazingly enough, he declined to accept the leadership and gave the honour to the Honourable P. 0. Fysh, taking for himself the Ministries of Land and Works, and Education. The Honourable P. 0. Fysh later played a prominent part in Australian history. Sir Edward Braddon served with distinction in London for five years and on his return to Tasmania in 1893 be went straight back into Parliament. It is much easier to get out of Parliament these days than U is to get in; and it is much easier to get into Parliament than it is to stay hi. Then he became the member for West Devon in the Tasmanian again. He also became the Leader of the Opposition again. In April, 1894, ho became Premier of Tasmania and held that office until tbe 12th October, 1899, a period of five and a half years, the longest period of office of any ministry in Tasmania until that time. Mr Duthie. He played a great part in the federal movement in this country. Before going to London, he was one of the representatives of Tasmania at the second session of the Federal Council of Australia held at Hobart in January, 1S88. He was in London when the 1891 council meeting was held. When he came back to this country, he was elected as Tasmanian representative to the 1897 convention and was responsible, by his activities at the convention, for the insertion of the famous "" Braddon clause"" in the Constitution. By his opponents, it was called the ""Braddon blot"". It lasted for only ten years. It provided that the Commonwealth should return to the States three-quarters of all customs duties and excise duties collected in each State. There was a hot discussion about Braddon's motion before it was agreed to by the convention. Eventually a compromise was worked out, by which the years. It was superseded by the Surplus Revenue Act (No. 8) 1910. So the "" Braddon blot"" was removed from the Constitution in 1910, six years after Braddon died. He was elected to the first Federal Parliament of Australia as a Tasmanian member. He was an ardent free trader, so obviously he was not a Labour man. He joined Sir George Reid's party, and during Reid's absence he occasionally acted as the Leader of the Opposition. In reading his history, I discovered what to me was the most interesting thing about him. He was elected as the member for Wilmot in December, 1903, but he died suddenly at his Tasmanian home on the 2nd February 1904, before the new Parliament met. I do not know who took his place. Having been elected as the member for Wilmot, he passed away shortly afterwards at the age of 75 years. It is a good job that I have not Parliament followed in his footsteps.

After the discovery of minerals onThe Electoral B i ll was debated in Parliament in late August and early September, 1903, and Cousel's division of 'the State was accepted by both Houses. However, there was much comment on the choice of names for the electorates. Cousel had called them Denison, Darwin, Wilmot, La Perouse, and Flinders. Owing to the confusion of this last one with a constituency iu Victoria, it was changed in the House to Northcote, and La Perou<?e was changed to Franklin. In the Senate, Northcote was again changed, this time to Bass, and apparently thc House of Representatives agreed to this change. In Hansard of the 27th August, 1903, volume 16, page 4320, Sir Philip Fysh is reported to have saidNo doubt Mr Cousel and Mr Johnston, the statistician of Tasmania, have taken counsel together in the arrangement of the divisions proposed. Some alteration is suggested in the names of the electorates. prefer some of those previously selected. We have Natone Loyna, and Pateena, and other native names, but in this instance we see the influence of the Survey Department upon thc names selected. Some attempt bas been made to follow the course by which Tasmania has honoured herself in utilizing the names of Lyell, Huxley, Murchison, and others of the celebrated men of old England. Here Mr. Cousel has endeavoured to perpetuate the name of Darwin. I can quite understand why lie selected Darwin as the name of one division, and Denison as the name of ano'ther, because Denison is tlie name of a former Governor of Tasmania, who, honourable members will remember, made a name for himself subsequently in India. Sir PHILIPFISH Darwin was associated with Lyell, Murchison, Huxley and other celebrated men whose names are perpetuated on the mountain tops of Tasmania. That is the story of the name of Darwin, and since the honourable member for Wilmot has given the House a very clear picture of Braddon, and why the name of "" Darwin"" should be changed to "" Braddon "", I do not think there is any more for me to add. I commend the proposed redistribution to the House. The House is discussing the report of the distribution commissioners on the division _ of the State of Tasmania. Tasmania, Mr Speaker, is the best represented State in Australia. I say that for the following reasons:-Firstly, because of the calibre of its representatives; States which, for its lower House of secondly, because of the extent of its Parliament, adopted the same principle representation; and thirdly, because it of distribution as we have in this House, was the first State-ther e are still only two States-to base the representation in tbe lower House of the State Parliament on the representation in this House. I say that it is the best represented State in the extent of its representation firstly because it is the smallest State, but has the same number of senators as the largest State, New South Wales, which has eleven times its population. I say it also because, being an original State of the federation, it cannot have fewer than five members in this House, although on the quota which applies to all the mainland States, it would have at the present moment, only four members. When I say that a State is well represented, I refer to three principles. First, I think I that all adults should be represented without a means test; secondly, that all electorates should have the same population; and thirdly, that the Parliament should have to face the electors at regular intervals. The first principle, that all adults should have a vote without a means test, is necessary so that everybody shall be represented in Parliament. The next principle, that all electorates should have, the same population, is necessary in order that everybody shall be equally represented. The third principle of periodic W h y did he select Darwin? elections is necessary so that the ParliaI presume it was beuause ment will be representative of the electors from time to time. The amazing thing about the Australian Constitution, which is so often regarded as the guardian of liberty, is that is does not guarantee the vote for all'adults; it does not preclude a means test or' any otber test for the vote; and it does not ensure that all divisions will have, roughly, the same population or that a State shall be divided into divisions at all. Those things are provided by a statute of this Parliament, which can be altered by this Parliament. The only safeguard that the Constitution affords by way of representation is that tbe House shall continue for no longer than three years, and that the number of members for each State shall be in proportion to its population.

237,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [9.12],"All the seats there have the same name and the same boundaries as Tasmanian divisions in this House. I hope that the Tasmanian Parliament will adopt the new name of Braddon which the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) has suggested, instead of Darwin, since it is surely a more significant name in Federal and State political history than was the former name. It is true that in Tasmania, too, there is no constitutional requirement that distribution shall be on that basis, but it has been the practice for many years in the Tasmanian Parliament to adjust the distribution to bear the names and to conform to the boundaries decided for divisions in this chamber. Whatever may be said about the distributions discussed by this House yesterday and to-day, they are numerically, mathematically and statistically the best in the country, and the State parliaments would be much better representatives of their populations if they conformed to the same principles that our statute lays down. toria with two to one? remark about Tasmania still being one of the only two States which make their boundaries conform to the divisions for this House. Victoria has now adopted that system, having two State electorates for every one electorate for this House. The other four States do not enjoy the same advantages. electorates, at the last State election, varied between 15,000 and 26,000. The country electorates varied between 15,000 and 20,000, and city electorates between 22,000 and 20,000. Queensland, to take the next most populous State, is much less well distributed. A t the last election, the electorates varied in respect of numbers on the rolls between 4,500 and 20,000. Admittedly, that may give some distorted idea of the representations. There were six seats with a population of under 5,000 and tbere were only four with a population of over 15,000. The rest of the 70 odd seats were somewhere between those numbers. The next State, in order of population, is South Australia, which is much worse distributed again. It has achieved maldistribution by having no distributions since 1936, and population movements have produced a phenomenal distortion. If one wishes to refer to a gerrymander, one need only refer to the populations of electorates in South Australia. The smallest electorate has a population of 3,645, and the largest a population of more than 30,000. member mean electors ? I think that everybody over eighteen years of age should have a vote, but I am referring now to persons over 21 years of age. In South Australia, if I may give another illustration of gerrymander and distortion, there are five seats with fewer than 5,000 persons on the roll, and five seats with more than 25,000 persons on the roll. Lastly, we come to the State of Western Australia, where the numbers on the electoral rolls in the State divisions vary between 1,010 and 13.500. Admittedly, if one excludes the three north-western electorates, the distortion is only between 3,000 and 13,500. The principle is openly acknowledged in the electoral statute of Western Australia that there shall be twice as many electors on the city rolls as on the country rolls. Even so, the Western Australian distribution commissioners are the worse mathematicians in the country. bers of the legal profession. fact, but I did not intend to refer to it because I tbink one of them holds a judicial position, and I do not wish to be charged, by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr W.

243,Mr Whitlam,"I was aware of that it will some day adhere to by constitutional compulsion. That principle is to ensure that every electorate shall have approximately the same number of electors, so that the votes of all of the electors shall be equal in value. At least, on the States? the numbers should be approximately equal, within the perfectly reasonable latitude of 20 per cent, above or below the quota as allowed by the Commonwealtii Electoral Act. Country members experience difficulties in representing their electorates. Those difficulties can and should be overcome by providing them with better transport, more assistance, and bigger allowances, and not doubling, quadrupling, or, as in South Australia, decupling, the value of the vote of the country electors. member mean quintupling? than quintupling. As I pointed out before the bonorable member returned to the chamber, the disparity in some South Australian electorates is between 3,500 and 30,000. I am speaking dispassionately and without party political bias on this matter. For that reason, I shall not mention the political complexion of the honourable members who represent the seats with 30,000 electors and of those who represent the seats with approximately 3,500 electors. One can only hope that there will be a split in the Liberal and Country League in South A.ustralia to achieve the result that was achieved by means of a split in the Liberal party, and by that means alone, in Victoria. I shall -conclude my non-partisan remarks by making two suggestions. As the Minister for the Interior was gracious enough last evening to pay heed to several of my suggestions, I know that he will be impelled by the reason and the justice of the suggestions that I am about to make to accede to them also. First. I suggest that the constitutional committee which the Prime Minister( Mr are represented in tbe lower Houses in Menzies) has promised for several years to appoint and tbe appointment of which he has constantly postponed, be appointed and that it consider means of ensuring that the Australian Constitution is altered in order that no gerrymandering shall be possible and that the principles enunciated in our electoral act shall be preserved and enshrined in the Constitution. member make tbose principles binding that matte]-. I would. Secondly, I suggest that it would be better to have a body, more or less in the nature of a standing commission, to determine distribution matters in the Commonwealth and in all the States. In every instance in which a redistribution of electoral boundaries takes place, suggestions are madeI do not know whether they are well-founded -that the commissioners appointed for the purpose are superannuated public servants or junior public servants and that, the honourable in the one case, they have a sense of obligation, and, in the second case, of impending preferment. If there were a body of permanent public servants with some of the quasi-judicial standing of tbe Tariff Board or the conciliation commissioners-if there were appointed people who have nothing to fear or to expect from any government, capitalist or socialist, there would be less criticism of redistributions than there always is in this Parliament and in every other Parliament in Australia. Furthermore, I suggest that the standing commission should make redistributions of the boundaries of State electorates as well as of federal electorates, in a manner similar to that in which identical officers, in all States except one, look after the electoral rolls that are used for both State and Federal elections. Nothing is more vital to the working of a democracy than the mechanism by which the'Parliament is elected. The manner in which the Parliament is elected, that is, the manner in which the people are represented, is better in this House, despite all of its shortcomings, than is the manner in which tbe people are represented in most other Houses of Parliament in Australia, and the manner in which the people Tasmania and Victoria is better than i? the manner in which they are represented in any other House in any of the State parliaments. I hope that the Prime Minister will refer the first of my suggestions to the proposed constitutional committee, and that the second suggestion'",82,Electoral Redistribution Of Tasmanian Divisions River Or Through Some Tunnels As They

247,Mr Whitlam,"I am coming towill be referred to a conference of Commonwealth and 'State Ministers in the near future. Question resolved in the affirmative. sonal explanation. I believe that an honest mistake has occurred in the division lists for two divisions, which were incorporated in yesterday's daily number of Mansard, at page 1334. In those division lists my name is shown as a teller, and appears also as a pair with the name of the honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin). As I have stated, I consider that an honest mistake has been made. I have checked with the pairs book and have found that I am recorded there as having been paired with the honourable member for Watson. The matter is not of great importance, but I mention it because, at some future time, a reader of Hansard may see that I have apparently been paired and, at the same time, voted in a division, from which circumstance it might be concluded that I had betrayed a promise and come into the House to vote when I had been paired with a member of the Opposition. to do so at this stage, Mr Speaker, I wish, following the personal explanation made by the honourable member for Lyne( Mr Lucock), to mention that this matter brings up the question of the magnificent work that has been done by Hansard and by the Government Printer in the preparation and publication of tbe daily Hansard. You, sir, as chairman of the select committee that brought the daily Hansard into being, will realize, as we all do, that when permanent changes are made explanation, or is the honourable member the pairs book, from which the Hansard speaking upon a motion ? permitted to make these remarks. Mr was an honest one. I do not accuse any Speaker has not objected, and I was cine of anything. I wish now to emphasize addressing myself not to the Minister for that tbe fault does not lie with the Territories ( Mr Hasluck) but to Mr Hansard staff, which merely took out of Speaker. I was about to say that small the pairs book the pairs that were recorded errors will creep in under pressure. I there. think we all realize that, in order to publish daily, Hansard must work to a deadline as do the newspapers, and that sufficient time is not always available to correct every little thing. It is appropriate at this time for me to direct attention to the magnificent job that has been done in creating, from a slowly moving record of this Parliament, a lively and fresh record that is available to honourable members at noon, or a little later, every day following a sitting. I am sure that the honourable member for Lyne, to whom I spoke about the matter outside the chamber, appreciates those considerations. I am sure also that he has not raised the matter in order to criticize the new daily Hansard, and that he appreciates the difficulties under which Hansard is published and the magnificent work that is done in order to make it available to honourable members expeditiously. You, Mr Speaker, are well aware that members of the select committee to which I have referred, and of which you were the chairman, were fully apprised of the difficulties that would be involved in the change-over to the new basis of publication. I am sure that you. sir, will readily agree with me thai those difficulties have been magnificently If I may be permitted overcome by both the Hansard staff and the Government Printer. As a result, we are now able to obtain daily a fresh record of the previous day's proceedings in this House. In tbe circumstances, 1 appreciate the reason why the honourable member for Lyne has corrected the record. The record now is fresh, and the honourable member wishes to keep his record clean as well. to make one further point. The mistake that occurred had nothing to do with staff noted the pairs recorded.

252,Mr Lucock,"Might I be permittedDebate resumed from the 1st June (vide page 1291), on motion by Sir ABTHUB That thc bill bc now read a second time. Opposition) [9.29] -The bill effects a number of administrative improvements, which honourable members who are especially well versed in the administrative machinery and its operation will doubtless wish to discuss in detail. The more important amendment deals with units of pension of contributors to the fund. Under the existing legislation the number of units of pension for wbich an employee has had to contribute to the fund has been fixed according to the actual salary that he has received. As the employee's salary has varied, so adjustments have been made to his superannuation amendment proposed bas been designed to discontinue that adjustment and to provide for contributions to be payable for the number of units appropriate to the maximum salary of the position. Tbat proposal will increase tbe contributions that have to be made by employees but, as the rate payable for each unit of pension is related to the age of the employee, tbere will be no increase in the total amount contributed. It was pointed out by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) that, except in very rare cases, no increase of j>ension will result from the proposed amendment and that any additional cost that will be incurred in respect of them will be offset by reduced costs of administration. Administrative costs ""will be reduced because the numerous adjustments whicli are necessary under the existing legislation will no longer be necessary. The bill provides for a convenient alteration in the administration of the act and the Opposition approves of it. The other main amendment that bas been proposed concerns the provision that is made, not by the Government itself, but by certain Commonwealth authorities for superannuation. Auditor-General has pointed out that such authorities should make provision for tbeir accrued pension liabilities, and' this bill empowers the Treasury to makearrangements to that effect. The administrative changes which have been proposed are obviously advantageous and just, and. the Opposition accepts and supports the bill. Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has mentioned, four amendments of the existing legislation are proposed in the bill before the House. Two of these amendments concern matters of principle, and two concern minor matters of administrative machinery. The provisions relating to matters of principlewill not be of great benefit to Commonwealth public servants whom they effect.. At present, the employing authorities concerned are not required to make any provision for the payment of superannuation until pensions actually become payablewhen they are required to pay the emcontributions. The ployer's share of the pension. Under the existing legislation the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority is not required to make regular contributions to the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund although its employees contribute to that fund. Under this bill that authority will have to make regular contributions to the fund. Of course, the more money that is paid into the fund the greater will be itsearning capacity, and if it can earn moremoney it will eventually be a better fund for the employees. The Commonwealth Superannuation Fund is only 33 years'"" old, having been introduced in 1922. A period of 33 years is not a very longtime in the life of a superannuation fund. I hope that, in about 100 years' time, the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund will be a really good fund and that itsearnings will have made possible the payment of increased benefits to contributors.. Another provision of the bill requiresemployees to contribute for a number of units appropriate to their maximum salary instead of contributing for unitsappropriate to their actual salary. The classification of public servants provides for incremental advancement from a minimum to a maximum salary. In some The instances, it takes officers ten years to rise from their minimum to their maximum, salary. Under the bill, officers will be",84,Hansard Division List

254,Mr Costa (Banks) [9.32],"As the-enabled to commence paying for the number of units appropriate to their maximum salary before that salary is reached. For example, if an officer holding a certain classified office commences at 21 years -of age to pay. for the number of units appropriate to the maximum of his salary range, at the age of 26 years he will only have to pay Is. 5d. for each unit whereas, under the old system, at the age of 26 he would have had to pay Is. lOd. for each unit. In other words, the proposed amendment will save him 5d. a fortnight for each unit. That saving, if applied to ten units and spread over a lifetime of service of 50 years, would save him more than £200. So, the bill is beneficial in that respect and provides an answer to the problem of paying a bigger pension at an earlier time. The present value of each unit of superannuation is 17s. 6d., having been increased to that amount last year. The value of each unit when the superannuation scheme was introduced 33 years ago, was -lOs. Units had a greater prospective value then tban they have at present because the cost of living has increased to a greater extent than has the value of the unit. Most officers of the Public Service contribute for about eight units, and their average pension would be £7 a week. Thirty-three years ago £7 was £3 above the basic wage. At present, £7 a week is £5 less than the basic wage. So, the superannuation unit has lost the great value that it had for the employees when the scheme was first introduced. The cost of living has increased by about 200 per cent., whereas, over the same period, the value of superannuation units has increased by only 75 per cent. Thus, the standard of living of those who depend on superannuation payments for a livelihood has diminished considerably. Another class of person who will be affected by this bill is the widow of a superannuated pensioner. The act provides that the widow of a contributor to the Superannuation Fund shall receive half the pension for which the husband was eligible. The widow of a man who had been paying for a pension of £7 a week would receive only £3 10s. a week, which is equivalent to the age pension. The officers of the Public Service believe mately 57,000 public servants contribute it is time that the Government increased the amount of pension payable to the widow of a contributor to tbe fund. A Prime Minister's widow, whoever she may be from time to time, is eligible to receive five-eights of the pension that would be payable to the Prime Minister. Yet the widow of a superannuated pensioner receives only 50 per cent, of the pension which he received. That is a matter which the Government should examine when considering further amendments of this legislation. The people who contribute to the Superannuation Fund save the Government very much money, because by so doing they debar themselves from entitlement to social services payments. I understand that the Commonwealth superannuation scheme saves the Government about £6,000,000 a year in social services payments. In view of that fact, the Government could probably make the scheme more generous than it is. Another aspect of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund in which public servants are interested is the exercise of an option in relation to the Provident Account. The superannuation scheme embraces two accounts-the Superannuation Fund and the Provident Account. A number of public servants would like to have the option of contributing to the Superannuation Fund or the Provident Account. Contributors to the Provident Account are able to receive their pension in a lump sum. The superannuation benefit is paid only fortnightly. The unions have referred that matter to the Government. The Provident Fund does not provide for all public servants, but is applicable only to those persons who are medically unfit when they join the service-mostl y temporary employeesand to those employees who are over 45 years of age when they join. Contributors to the Provident Account pay Is. in the £1. Their benefit consists of a lump sum payment equal to two and two thirds times the total amount of their contributions, plus 3 per cent, per annum compound,, interest. Public servants would like the option of contributing to the Superannuation Fund or to the Provident Account. According to the last report, approxito the superannuation fund and approximately &,000 to the Provident Account. As I have pointed out, between tbem they contribute a large sum, and save the Commonwealth about £6.000,000 a year tliat would otherwise be paid in social .services benefits. Eor that reason, the Government should consider increasing the value of the unit from 17s. 6d. to 20s. A large number of retired public servants lepend on the superannuation pension for their livelihood. As a result of the rising cost of living, that pension rate is due for review, and I hope the Government will take it into consideration when formulating the next budget. The Public Service organizations also intend to ask for an amendment of the provisions in relation to age-60 contributors. Those organizations have asked the High Council to make representations to the Government for an amendment of the Superannuation Act 1922-1954 to provide that age-60 contributors who continue in the Public Service beyond the age of 60 years shall 'be paid the superannuation fund share of their pension and shall, upon actual retirement, be paid the full pension. It is further desired that age-65 contributors who retire after the age of 00 years shall be granted the full Commonwealth share of the pension. I hope the Government will give favorable consideration to that request wben it is submitted. I appeal to the Government also to consider an increase of the value of the superannuation unit from 17s. 6d. to 20s. Apart from those' matters, the Opposition agrees with the amendments that have been proposed. As I bave stated, one or two of them are somewhat, important, but the others are more or less machinery amendments. Question resolved in the affirmative.
