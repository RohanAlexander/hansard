Is it a fact that the use of Australian gramophone recordings by commercial broadcasting stations is at present inhibited by a copyright dispute? Why are difficulties being experienced by the commercial stations and not by the Australian Broadcasting Commission? Why does the dispute extend to recordings from the United Kingdom and not to those from the United States of America? stations of records which are produced in Australia. The arrangement that existed for many years Was that these recordings were played on the commercial broadcasting stations on the basis that the advertising which was given by the announcement of the record, who actuaUy composed it and what company manufactured it was regarded as the equivalent to the copyright fee or to the fee paid for its use. When the Copyright Act was amended some 12 months or 2 years ago, there was included in it",14,Petitions

12,Mr Creani Address A Question To The,,15,Broadcasting Stations
13,Mr Hulme,"There is a dispute concernreference to international arrangements or understandings. There is a reciprocal arrangement in this area between Australia and the United Kingdom, but the United States has not entered into the agreement. The arrangement between the United Kingdom and Australia is that if records from either country are played in the other country, a fee is payable. America is not a party to the agreement and therefore the arrangement does not apply as between America and Australia. I might say that the Copyright Act merely leaves to the manufacturing companies the right as a matter of business judgment to ask for a fee or refrain from doing so. But some of the broadcasting stations or networks are in fact contemplating developing their own company for the purpose of manufacturing records. The Australian Broadcasting Commission is not involved in this dispute because, under the Broadcasting and Television Act, it is not allowed to advertise. Therefore, the ABC does not announce the name of a record, who is responsible for it or who manufactured it. But the ABC does pay a substantial fee to record manufacturers in Australia. Army give the House information concerning the attack on the Queensland University drill hall? Will he advise what action is honourable member or is reflecting in any intended against those who broke into this military property? Can the Minister assure the House that every safeguard is being taken to see that arms are properly secured in all drill halls so that weapons are not available to such people? will be aware from Press reports in the last couple of days that an incident occurred at the Queensland University Regiment training depot on 2nd September when a group of persons barricaded themselves on the first floor of that depot and damaged some furniture and other property. They left when ordered to do so by the police. Although some threats have been reported in the Press, so far no further incidents have occurred. If any threat does develop, appropriate action will be taken to protect Commonwealth property. I have set in motion procedures, on the lines mentioned by the honourable member in his question, in regard to armouries and other aspects of military depots. Naturally, we view with concern any illegal occupation of Commonwealth property. The Commonwealth police are investigating the matter to see whether prosecutions should be launched against those who were involved in the incident mentioned. I will say no more at this juncture.

If the honourable would be amended to allow me to refer to 22106/70-R-[36 ] member will do me the honour of looking at the table which I placed before the House yesterday he will see that over the years the Government has given a rise in pensions at budget time in anticipation of further price rises because the real value of the base pension has been increased above what it would have been if we had taken account only of past price rises. This year the Government has held at peak level. In all years price rises in the months following the budget have reduced the real value of pension increases. This has been allowed for by the Government over many years by increasing the base rate above what it would have been had we followed movements in the price index; by increasing the pension, in effect, in advance. I can hold out no immediate prospect of a change in Government policy but I can hold out a prospect that as soon as opportunity offers the Government will resume, whether by increases in the base rate or in other ways, an improvement in the real value of the benefits which pensioners receive. This may not be done immediately but certainly it will be done in the future, as this Government has consistently done it in the 21 years it has been in office.

If my memory serves me correctly those regulations were amended about 10 days ago. When those regulations were amended 6 cases were immediately referred for determination of the status of conscientious objectors. There will be more such referrals. At the same time. I authorised my Department to give instructions to the appropriate persons for the conduct of prosecutions against those persons who had refused to render service. Those prosecutions will firstly proceed against those pergrounds was firmly rejected. sons who have over a long period of time refused to undertake service. I have seen a report1 do not know whether it is accurate or not-in which one of the persons who will receive a summons stated that the Government was picking him out because he was an activist in the anti-conscription campaign. That is not a fact. That person is being proceeded against along with the others in the ordinary way. Over the next few weeks the prosecutions will proceed. The honourable gentleman added to his question some rather colourful words relating to Mr Zaxb. 1 think he asked why the Government is continuing the persecution of Mr Zarb. I should like to remind the honourable gentleman and the House of a few salient facts. Mr Zarb made application to the magistrate to be declared a conscientious objector. The magistrate refused to so declare him. I should point out that at that procedure there is no provision for costs at all. Mr Zarb then took action under the normal legal procedures. If my recollection serves me, it was by way of a prerogative writ and went to the High Court. At that time a very great deal of publicity was given to the fact that campaigns would be held to raise funds in order to pay Mr Zarb's costs. In November 1969 a direct appeal for funds was held. It appeared in the 'Catholic Worker' and stated that any donations should be sent to the Conscientious Objectors Non-Pacifist Advisory Committee, which is an organisation known to have assisted other protesters with financial aid. In August 1969 a demonstration outside Pentridge Gaol was reported to have raised $800 to fight Zarb's case. It was Labour and National Service aware of the reported in the Melbourne Press that local very serious situation on the Darwin waterbranches of the Australian Labor Party front, where 5 ships have been held up had been asked to contribute to the cost of Zarb's appeal. When the matter went before the High Court and was dismissed the Chief Justice made some comments. I think it is worth reminding the House of them. When dismissing ZartYs appeal the Chief Justice, when speaking on one of the main grounds-that is, that Zarb had an honest belief that he had been granted exemption-sai d that the assertion that Zarb had this belief was 'markedly dishonest' and that the submission was 'not merely unmeritorious but without any foundation'. Each of the other main A bill of costs was taxed. An order for costs was made against Zarb. If my recollection serves me, the bill of costs was presented to Mr Zarb about December of last year. At the time he was informed that the Government would appreciate any information he could provide as to the distribution of the funds which were collected specifically for that purpose. The letter which was written by my colleague, the Attorney-General, to Mr Zarb has not been reported accurately in the Press. I do not say that as a criticism of the Press. I think it is a criticism which must be made of an inaccuracy of communication, perhaps by Mr Zarb. The letter which my colleague wrote in December 1969 said: You may remember that when I was first approached by Dr Cairns on Zarb's behalf I informed you about the matter. We both agreed that this is a case in which it would not be appropriate for the Commonwealth to enforce its claims for costs. As I understand the position, it will be necessary if the claim is not to be pursued for your Department to make an application. The next thing that happened was that a letter went to Mr Zarb asking for full details. So far we have not received those details. When the details are provided we will be able to determine the matter. But let me say that, if funds have been contributed for this purpose, I feel that the funds ought to be used and that Consolidated Revenue ought not to be the source of payment. PORT OF DARWIN",17,Social Services
32,Mr Calder,"I s the Minister forand one departed partly unloaded owing to the irresponsible go-slow tactics adopted by the wharf labourers which are causing great concern and hardship to Northern Territory citizens and the steady strangulation of the port of Darwin and business generally? Can he advise what action can be taken to speed up the turnround of these ships before the port is brought to a standstill? attempt to achieve a permanency situation in the port of Darwin. Because of the size of the port and some other circumstances it has been difficult to find a resolution of this question through the National Stevedoring stevedoring branch of the North Australian Workers Union has, over a period of time, proceeded with go-slow tactics, limitations on work and, at times, strikes. This is a very great tragedy because it will, I am sure, prejudice the development of Darwin as a port, as a harbour and as a channel of commerce. However, the situation at this moment is that on Wednesday last Justice Gallagher for a bans clause and he deferred that application until Monday, 7th September, in Sydney and in the meantime ordered a return to work. My understanding is that that return to work order has been complied with. The matter will come on before Mr Justice Gallagher again on Monday. It would be inappropriate for me to say anything further. LOCA L GOVERNMENT REVENUES ter a question. Did he receive a couple of months ago a letter from the Local Government Association and the Shires Association of New South Wales asking that the sources of local government revenue should be included in the survey which he has commissioned Treasury officials to make of the sources of finance for Commonwealth and State governments? Did the associations offer their fullest co-operation in any such inquiry? Has the right honourable gentleman replied to the associations? If so, did he agree to their request? If not, when does he expect to reply? Opposition is asking me about a letter received some months ago, the details of which are clearly not in my mind; nor the action taken on those matters. I do think 1 can assure him that I have not replied in terms to any such letter. But what other action has been taken as far as sending it to the Treasury or things of that kind, I cannot recollect at this period of time. General aware that the paper known as the 'Open Road' is of great educational value to motorists and is an effective deterrent to traffic offences which cause so much loss of life in this country? Is he aware that the recently announced postal Industry Council. The rates will increase the costs to the National Roads and Motorists Association, in posting this paper to motorists, from $100,000 to $275,000 per annum? As it will not be possible for the NRMA to meet all of this cost in 1 year, will the Minister consider the application of a special rate or a graduated increase in the charge to this worthy organisation? posed increase in postal charges will be at great cost to many of these organisations. On Tuesday last I received a deputation from the automobile clubs of Australia which presented certain facts to me in relation to their problem. I had to explain to them, as I did to the House in my second reading speech, that this area of postal charges has been causing a loss of approximately $9m a year. I do not just say that in relation to automobile clubs but about this total area of publications. The Government believes that we should receive a reasonable contribution for services wbich are carried out by the Post Office. I informed the clubs, as I have informed members of the public and members of the House, that we will still in this area be making a substantial loss notwithstanding the increases in charges. They pointed out to me that there has been little rise in their fees over a considerable period, but it does seem to me that as the Post Office is called upon to meet an additional wages bill of $58m this year, making necessary increased charges which have to be passed on, it may be necessary for these organisations also to increase their charges to enable them to meet a reasonable postage charge which the Government imposes.",18,Social Services

Is the Minister in a position to say when legrequested by the Minister and that he islation will be presented to Parliament to give effect to the recommendations of the Australian Wool Industry Conference for a single authority to administer the marketing and distribution of the Australian wool clip? Will the Minister make it clear now that wool will not be sold below the cost of production but so as to provide a fair profit margin for the growers? more responsible in this area than the Minister for Trade and Industry. The Government has received a report from the Wool Board Advisory Committee containing certain recommendations. The Government has already acted on some of these recommendations, such action including an announcement emergency financial assistance to wool growers amounting to a maximum of $30m. The Committee also submitted other requests that we look into the questions of the indebtedness of wool properties and farm reconstruction and adjustment. One of the aspects of the report was on marketing, as the honourable member mentions. This was a preliminary document on a single marketing authority. However, there were many areas about which it did not spell out details. Deeper investigation and consideration were needed to clarify a number of points relating to the operation of a reserve price scheme, the charter, the responsibility of private buyers, the actual financing of the arrangements and so on. At the moment my Department, in conjunction with the industry, is preparing a submission which will be circulated to the industry and the Government for consideration, and until that is done I do not think any of us are in a position to express an opinion one way or the other about a marketing authority. to the Minister for Labour and National gentleman for I cannot anticipate what will Service and relates to the inquiry being be contained in the report. conducted by Mr Justice Smithers into the conscientious beliefs of Mr Brian Ross which apparently commenced with a private meeting between the judge and Ross seas of the Minister for External AffairsI on 24th August. Did Mr Justice Smithers direct my question to the Prime Minister. have a further private talk with Ross in I preface it by saying that I am not trying Melbourne yesterday and issue a statement after that meeting to the effect that he is now in a position to make the report would report promptly? Was Mr Justice Smithers appointed by the Government to hold an open judicial inquiry into Ross's beliefs, or a series of private talks with Ross? Will the Minister give an undertaking that before any decision is reached in this matter Ross will be obliged to give his evidence on oath in open court, and subject to cross-examination in the same way as conscientious objectors have been obliged to do in the past? question I referred to an amendment of the regulations which enables matters to be referred to a court for determination whether a person in a conscientious objector even though he fails or refuses to make that there will be an application to be declared a conscientious objector. Had Mr Ross not been in prison, according to the advice given to me by my officers his case was one which would have been so regarded. But because he was in prison the act of conviction and imprisonment removed him from the statutory requirement to render service so that the changes in the regulations could not apply to him. I therefore decided that we ought to do what we possibly could to make the position equivalent. In order to do that I thought it best to appoint a judge for the purpose, because that would take care of the appeal provisions at the same time. Mr Justice Smithers was appointed to inquire into the conscientious beliefs of Mr Ross and to report. It was not a judicial procedure. I had no power to order the way in which the inquiry should be conducted. That was entirely a matter for the person appointed to conduct the inquiry. After reading the Press report, I expect to receive a report from Mr Justice Smithers very shortly. When I receive that report I will examine it with my colleague, the Attorney-General.

I refer to the credit requirements of the meat exports diversification scheme. Are meat works companies in the Kimberleys and the Northern Territory finding it difficult to establish their own credits? Is this due to a local shortage of beef suitable for export to markets other than the United States of America? Has this in turn produced a situation where meat works companies in the north are obliged to buy American export credits from meat works in the south, and has the cost of purchasing credits in the south brought about a reduction in the price paid to cattlemen for beef killed for export in the north by northern meat works? Finally, if this is so, will the Minister, in the interests of those directly concerned and also in the interests of decentralisation and northern development, use his influence or authority to grant relief from the diversification scheme to meat works in the regions to which I referred? meat industry diversification plan is to try to regulate the supply of meat to the American market. That is the most attractive market in the world and, of course, those concerned would like to supply meat to it because it is there that they can obtain the maximum return. Northern meat works have been placed at some disadvantage because of the kind of meat that they produce. Their meat is the most attractive on the United States market but probably suffers a disadvantage on other markets. As a result, they have been making a number of protests about the operation of the scheme and the proportions which apply to them compared with those which apply to southern meat works. There have been numerous discussions. I have had their requests put before the Australian Meat Board and the Australian Meat Exporters Council to see whether some alterations can be made. In fact, alterations have been made which are of substantial financial benefit to the meat works in the north. However, I am afraid that I cannot accept that they should be excluded completely from the diversification scheme for their advantage and for the disadvantage of other meat works in Australia. At present they receive consideration. It is necessary for them to buy up some of the credits that southern meat works have, but that is the only way in which a scheme, based on the voluntary agreement of the industry and by which everyone is treated equitably and fairly, can work. wish to make a personal explanation. member claim to have been misrepresented? sented by certain remarks recorded in Hansard and for it I place no blame upon the Hansard staff.

Motion (by Mr Snedden) agreed to: That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday, 15 September, at 2.30 p.m. the Public Accounts Committee, I present the 120th and 121st reports of the Committee. Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a short statement. being no objection leave is granted. recall that when I tabled your Committee's 116th report which related to a Treasury minute I reminded the House of the basis of the Treasury minute arrangements which have operated since 1953. I also emphasised that these arrangements have proved their value over the years as an important element in ensuring that through your Committee, the Parliament maintains an important and significant role in the financial administration of the Commonwealth. The 120th report, which relates to the Treasury minute on your Committee's report on expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the financial year 1967-68, affords further evidence in support of that view. The 121st report relates to your Committee's inquiry into the financial administration of the Department of Shipping and Transport. During the course of our inquiry in mid-1969 a major re-organisation took place in the central office of the Department located in Melbourne. This involved a transfer of some senior officers to Canberra, a regrouping of some of the Department's main functions, a strengthening of its top structure and the establishment of a policy group of 50 positions in Canberra. The transfer of the remainder of the Department is not envisaged before 1973-74. Regarding the transfer of positions to Canberra in 1969-70, we note the admission made in evidence that difficulties could arise in communication between the Canberra and Melbourne based sections of the branches of the administration concerned. On the basis of its experience, your Committee recognises the difficulties that could arise in this area. Every effort must be made to ensure that the efficiency of the Department is not impaired due to the geographical division of the central office between Canberra and Melbourne. Your Committee is concerned that such a physical division of central control could result in a series of duplications of positions at many levels, a heavy cost arising from necessary departmental executive travel and added expenses arising from the need for constant communication between the 2 sections of the central office, all of which potential costs and expenses could have been avoided had it been decided to transfer the central office to Canberra in a single move. The evidence taken in your Committee's inquiry shows that penalties imposed under the Navigation Act have remained virtually unchanged for many years and in some cases relate to matters that are no longer appropriate. Moreover, the manner in which some of the regulations made under that Act have been framed and the way in which cases have been presented by the Department and the Deputy Crown Solicitor have raised difficulties for the courts in deciding some cases where prosecutions have been launched. In these circumstances your Committee believes that the Navigation Act and regulations require urgent revision and that the regulations require continuous review. It also appears to your Committee that, particularly in the years prior to 1965 when the Department established an organisation and methods unit, widespread inadequacies existed in the Department's administration. This was particularly evident in the important areas of internal audit and stores management. We commend the Department for the action it has taken more recently to revise its arrangements and procedures in these areas. However, in view of the Department's history in these areas of administration, we expect it to make certain that its",22,Personal Explanations

As the improper use of telephones can prove costly, your Committee also considers that the Department should issue a staff instruction covering the use of these est. Your Committee believes that if these facilities in all circumstances. Your Committee commends the Department for its efforts, through the provision of training facilities, to solve its recruitmembers. ment problems. However, the evidence indicates that the facilities available in Australia for formal training of nautical and marine engineering officers, particularly for those requiring higher qualifications, are inadequate. The Department has considered the question of whether a nautical academy should be established in Australia or, alternatively, whether greater opportunities should be provided in universities. Any delays in solving these questions Discussion of Matter of Public Importance can only aggravate existing difficulties. Your Committee believes, therefore, that these unresolved questions should be examined promptly by all of the parties concerned, including tertiary education institumatter of public importance be submitted to tions. In relation to the Department's revenue collections, your Committee believes that the Department should re-examine the principle adopted for the identification of specific Miscellaneous items.

62,Mr Kevin Cairns (Lilley) [11.34],"Iforces in Australian politics occurred 3 weeks ago at Broken Hill. It is perfectly clear that for the first time this surrender occurred not at intermediate or lower levels of the Party but at the highest level of the Party with the Leader of the Opposition himself personally involved. When a charge of this nature is made. I would hope that he would take the opportunity to reply to it, as he can do if he likes. Why does one make such a charge? When one looks at the resolution which was passed by the Federal Executive of the Labor Party and at the third paragraph of that resolution concerning the Moratorium campaign, one sees that it reads thus: It is further requested that the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party approach the ACTU with a view to securing joint support for the September Moratorium and that the Federal Secretary discuss with the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party Leader, Mr WhiUam, and the President Old friendsthe arranging of some suitable joint activity by the ALP and ACTU during the September Moratorium in support of ALP and ACTU foreign policy. There are 3 ingredients in that resolution which are new so far as the Party opposite is concerned and which are appropriate to our considerations this morning. In the first place it is a clear instruction. In the second place there is an instruction to combine with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and Mr Hawke personaUy. In the third place there is the discovery that there is a joint foreign policy between the Labor Party and the ACTU. When one remembers that the ACTU exists not only at the interstate Executive level but at the level of the State Trades and Labour Councils, some of which are under very strong Communist influence, one can imagine what sort of joint foreign policy can be perpetrated between 2 such bodies. But this is a new attitude for the Leader of a Labor Party. The first question we have to ask is front technique the Party opposite has at simply this: What are the aims of this last succumbed to this combination. I Moratorium for which the Leader of the remind members opposite that as far back Opposition has been instructed to work? as 1928 it devolved upon members of the The aims have been set out by a number Labor Party not to combine in meetings of people. They have been set out by the pursuing Communist Party policy. There President of the Moratorium, the honourhave been subsequent resolutions concernable member for Lalor (Dr. J. F. Cairns). ing particulars, but the philosophy of that They have been set out by committees in resolution at the Executive level over 40 New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria years ago is still supposed to be appropriate, and other States. A short summary of the and it is being ignored at organisational aims is simply this: The immediate and total withdrawal of AustraUan, American and all other foreign troops, no longer from Vietnam, but from Indo China. They have widened the field. The aim is also the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all military and material support -no t just military support, material support-for the present Saigon Government, and the immediate abolition of conscription in any form. So the aims of this body are very wide. They have been widened significantly since May. They have been widened significantly to embrace, at the highest level, the leader of the alternative government in this country. We would be recreant to our duties if we did not point out the significance of this popular front that has now been developed. But before we look at the popular front, let me make this charge: It is irrefutable that the Moratorium is a body which exists on 3 supports. It exists on support at various levels from the Communist Party of Australia. That cannot be refuted. It exists on support from the various peace movements which previously have been banned by the Party opposite. It exists on support from the Australian Labor Party. They are intertwined at every level in the movement at the various State campaign committees, and this cannot be refuted. The Leader of the Opposition involved himself with Communists at the Brisbane Trades Hall earlier this year in giving support to the campaign. So when there is a body such as this and an alternative government adopting the popular front technique not only to develop its policy but to formulate its policy and to organise around this policy, it would be recreant for any government or any parliamentarian to seek to hide these facts from the Australian people. But there is a certain sadness in this type of approach, and the sadness is that after nearly 40 years of opposition to the popular",24,Vietnam Moratorium Campaign
63,"Of The Actu, Mr Hawke,","levels these days. It is important for Australia to know this also for the reason that we know from experience that the popular front techniques, whether they have been through the old councils against Fascism for peace, whether they have been through the peace movements, whether they have been through the peace campaigns or whether they now come through the Moratorium Campaign, have been used in various countries in the world-certainl y in Europe-to bring those countries to the very brink of disaster. If one thinks this is something new or something that does not mean much, let me remind the House that the influence of the popular front technique left France a prey to invasion during the Second World War. It was the principal reason why the French body politic could not respond. That very same technique is being pursued in Australia by the Party opposite, the alternative government, at the present day. How do I illustrate this? How can it be illustrated simply? I would illustrate it in this way: We know the aims of this body. They apply to Indo-China, and that inevitably and ultimately involves Malaysia. I challenge the Party opposite to examine this question. Recently an amount of publicity has been given to a document put out by the Secretary-General of the North Vietnamese Duan. In that document the Secretary-General acknowledged 2 things: Firstly, that the policy of the North Vietnamese Communists involved all Indo-China; and secondly, that they were responsible for the confrontation and the conflict from over a decade ago to the present day-the y initiated it and they continue it. That cannot be disputed. That is his strategy. I would ask honourable members opposite to answer this question: Can they demonstrate any way in which the aims of this Campaign on which they are now embarking are at variance with the aims and the strategy of Le Duan? They cannot indicate in any way in which these policies are at variance with the strategy and the tactics of Le Duan and the North Vietnamese Communist Party. That strategy applies to the whole of Indo-China; it applies far wider than Vietnam. It is embraced by the Moratorium and the Australian Labor Party. These things have to be brought out. There are already 2 charges on the books against the Leader of the Opposition, but there is another one. Why is he combining with an outside body for which he is not responsible? For some years he has attempted to evade this charge. He let the honourable members for Oxley( Mr Hayden), Capricornia (Dr Everingham), Lalor (Dr. J. F. Cairns) and Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron), before he became a right winger, become the avant-garde. They were the avant-garde and he appeared to be dragged reluctantly along. He used to write letters to Mr Chamberlain saying that the policy determinations of the Labor Party are not to be determined by outside bodies and demonstrations. I refer to his letter of December 1969. I also refer to his comments earlier this year in a debate in this House when he said he would not combine with a body which was not totally under ALP control. He said: I will not sponsor organisations created for internal political activity where those organisations are ones to which I am not responsible or for which I am not responsible. That statement appears in Hansard of 14th April. In a letter to Mr Chamberlain at a later date he had this to say: Members of the Party in matters of foreign defence policy should not give the false and damaging impressions that under a Labor Government foreign policy would be determined at mass Communist Party, Le meetings or by public petitions. Both of those positions have been eroded, and I would say that in the erosion of those positions the one who has suffered most in terms of his own personal ambition is the Leader of the Opposition. He has to be mentioned personally because he remains the figurehead of the Australian Labor Party. He is the figurehead that will be torn down as people realise the significance of the figure and the significance of those behind him. He rather reminds me of the prehistoric animal the brontosaurus. The brontosaurus had a very poor means of internal communication, and it was well known that an enemy could attack the brontosaurus and eat its way right up the tail to the head before the brontosaurus realised what was happening. Needless to say the animal went out of existence. I have merely made some reference to the traditional attitudes of the Party opposite. If these combinations are no longer outside the pale so far as the Party is concerned, that is its business. If it says that these associations are to be desired in determinations and actions concerning the highest policy, that is its business. But it can also be the business of a member of this Parliament to indicate where double standards are involved. Double and even triple standards are involved in this matter. Members of the Opposition know that what I say happens to be correct. We are not against protesters. I have never been against protests; I have never been against dissension. But the attitude to protests and the attitude to dissension ought to be the attitude to these matters of responsible union secretaries such as exist, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh knows, in the Australian Workers Union, for example, in certain States. The attitude to strikers by responsible union secretaries consists of several parts. A strike must have aims that can be pursued without harm to members; it must have some proportion to the aim to be achieved; and they must have exhausted all reasonable methods of obtaining their aims. That is the tradition of the Australian Labor Party but that is not the tradition being observed today. The Party opposite today has thrown that tradition overboard because it is throwing so many of its old principles overboard. Let me make a further comment that 1 think is appropriate. We have said that in the past there was an avant-garde in the Labor Party and that it was dragging the Leader of the Opposition along reluctantly. It consisted of the members that I have nominated. But these days we look at the Labor Party and we wonder who, in racing terminology, is the pacer and who has been set to win, because all members of the Party are racing together towards the post. This clearly is the aim of the Moratorium and clearly is a total surrender to the popular front technique of organisation and of policy administration in the Labor Party. I challenge honourable members opposite to refute that. My fourth charge against the Leader of the Opposition is that he has surrendered his own position to the left wing of his Party at the price of preserving a seeming unity. He has officially adopted and will continue officially to adopt the popular front technique in his own administration in the Party and outside the Party. I challenge him to indicate in which way the aims of this Moratorium Campaign, in which so many members of the Opposition will demonstrate, are in conflict with the aims of the Secretary-General of the North Vietnamese Communist Party concerning all Indo-China. member who is interjecting would parade himself as a right winger from time to time but let him answer the question I have asked. The Moratorium Campaign depends for its existence on 3 props: Members of the Communist Party at every level, members of the peace movements and members of the Australian Labor Party. Having made 4 charges, I invite the Leader of the Opposition to refute them because their refutation is significant to this country. If the Leader of the Opposition is ever to achieve what he hope to achieve he has to face up to these matters and not completely abandon the traditions of the Labor Party, of which he was so ignorant until he became a membei of Parliament. Suspension of Standing Orders agreed to: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition or a member deputed by him speaking for a period not exceeding IS minutes. though the Standing Orders do not provide for it, it is customary for an honourable member who intends to raise a matter of definite public importance to inform you, Mr Speaker, of his intention and to advise also the Leader of the Opposition or the Government. That practice is always followed by members of the Australian Labor Party when matters of definite public importance are submitted to the House for discussion. But today, Mr Speaker, you announced that the letter indicating that the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Kevin Cairns) desired to raise a matter of definite public importance was dated 28th August, and not until less than an hour before this House met today was any honourable member on this side of the chamber aware that the matter was to be raised today-for the very simple reason that the honourable member for Lilley knew that it had no substance. He wanted to hide it from the light of day and reveal",25,Vietnam Moratorium Campaign

67,Mr Daly (Grayndler) [11.49],"Alit in the nature of a surprise. Having listened to his speech, I think he would have done better not to write the letter. Are not members of the Liberal Party slipping on this issue of the Vietnam Moratorium? On the last occasion the Attorney-General( Mr Hughes) raised it. We were on the highest level of right wing politics in the Liberal Party on that occasion; but as we on this side of the House completely demolished his arguments, he has gone underground in the Liberal Party. The honourable member who is the most extreme member and at the furthest point of the Liberal Party politically, and who is on the back benches, has raised this matter in the Parliament today. Who raised it? The honourable member for Lilley-the disinherited Deputy Government Whip. He himself said that not even in that lowly position would he bother to serve the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) or the Government. Yet the honourable member for Lilley talks about our Leader and others in our Party. He cannot say in public what he thinks of his own Leader because even the Liberals would expel him. It is interestthat all interjections cease. ing also to note that this matter has been raised today by an honourable member who is said to be a member of the National Civic Council, an undercover member of the Australian Democratic Labor Party and to be whiteanting the Liberal Party ranks in the interests of another organisation. That is why we see him in Parliament-toda y as the protagonist of law and order. I will never forget the honourable member for Lilley when he was speaking on the off-shore oil leases legislation. He was a man of principle. He said that he would not serve under the Prime Minister in the lowly position of Deputy Government Whip. However, when he had to take the jump he found that supporting one's principles had consequences. So in speaking to the off-shore legislation he sacrificed his prinIntelligence Organisation will investigate him ciples, apologised to the House and is now allowed to raise the matter that we are discussing today, because I believe that he is the only honourable member opposite who believes in it. The honourable member questioned the aims and ideals of those who support the Moratorium. I remind him that 40 United States senators support the aims and ideals of the Moratorium. Are they Communists? Let the honourable member get up and say whether they are. Let us have a look at some of the sponsors of the Moratorium. I think a couple of Liberals will go underground when I mention a few of the names. There are thousands of them. In the list of academics who have sponsored the Moratorium are Professor Charles Birch, Professor Max Deutscher and Professor Makinson of Sydney. There is Dr F. V. Newman, a member of the executive of the North Sydney Branch of the Liberal Party. I have been told that he is the campaign director for the honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Graham) who sits behind the honourable member who raised this matter today. Does the honourable member for Lilley dare list a member of the executive of the North Sydney Branch of the Liberal Party as a Communist or Communist sympathiser? to honourable members sitting behind the honourable member for Grayndler that he does not need much assistance. I suggest of names I see that it includes Harry Seidler, who is an architect, and another man named Milo Dunphy. These are only a few. Then among the names in the literature section of the list I see Mr R. D. Fitzgerald who is no less than the uncle of the Attorney-General. Is he a Communist sympathiser? the honourable member who has been continually making an unparliamentary noise in this House this morning I will deal with him. General is a sponsor of the Moratorium. I wonder whether the Australian Security at the suggestion of the Attorney-General? Does the honourable member for Lilley really suggest seriously that these men are not men of note and are affiliated in any way with Communism? Then there are Cyril Pearl and Elizabeth Riddell who is, I understand, a writer for the 'Daily Telegraph'. Heavens above, Sir Frank Packer surely would not have a Communist on his staff. Then when I look at the",27,Vietnam Moratorium Campaign

71,Mr Daly,"The uncle of the Attorneytheatrical section of those sponsoring the Moratorium I see that it includes Lyndell Barbour, Peter O'Shaughnessy and Max Meldrum who are well known and prominent. In the music section I see names such as Ian Farr who played at a reception of Her Majesty the Queen. No Communist could be so close to Her Majesty! Every Liberal should shudder at the rot which the honourable member for Lilley has talked about these people who have sponsored the Moratorium. The honourable member for Lilley went back to the Popular Front days. They were the days of Hitler. TodayI want to quote from the writings of the man who evidently impressed the honourable member who raised this matter today. I shall quote a few extracts from 'Mein Kampf by Hitler. I ask the honourable member for Lilley not to leave the chamber because this will bring him right up to date. Hitler wrote: The Government must carry through such measures as it recognises to be necessary for the State of the Moratorium for anything that and the people, even if unreason takes the place which reason should occupy and predetermined opposition and even hatred take the place of ready co-operation. That is an extract from a book by Adolf Hitler. It could have been taken from the speech today by the honourable member for Lilley. I refer to these extracts because I think that the very basis of the speech which has been delivered by the honourable member today is the policy which Hitler introduced and which thrust war upon the world. On 19th September 1933 Hitler said: In the parliamentary system we do not recognise any true expression of the will of the people, but we see in it a perversion, if not a violation of assembly. The honourable member for that will. He also said: The watch word of democratic freedom led only to insecurity, undiscipline, and at length to the downfall and destruction of all authority. That is a quotation from his Nazi Party proclamation at Nuremberg on 1st September 1933. This is the type of policy that will be introduced into this country if matters of the kind which the honourable member for Lilley has raised today receive support. This is another quotation of Hitler: It is important that the leaders of Government should be able to make decisions with an untroubled confidence about criticism from those whom they govern. That quotation would have been taken from the gospel of the honourable member for Lilley. Let us have a look at what the kind of policy which Hitler introduced brought to Germany and to the world. He used repressive laws to outlaw the Communist Party and then used the same repressive laws to destroy all other political parties, including the Social Democrats. He used repressive laws to persecute and to wipe out the Jewish faith. Then he used the same laws to oppress and intimidate leaders of the Lutheran and other churches. I ask the honourable member for Lilley whether he subscribes to this kind of policy in this day and age. Hitler burnt the Reichstag and used the incident to justify the introduction of laws that violated all human freedom and rights in the name of law and order. The honourable member for Lilley knows that the Liberals are trying to stir up dissent in the ranks of the Moratorium supporters and then to blame the sponsors happens, when underground men may be responsible for it. In the name of law and order Hitler established the Gestapo, destroyed the free trade unions and sent millions of Jews to the gas ovens. He confiscated property, he imprisoned and murdered his political critics and he trampled on the basic and fundamental civil liberties of the German people. That is what the honourable member for Lilley and some of those who sit with him in this Parliament today would do if they could. Above all else-and I say this to the young Fascist, the honourable member for Boothby( Mr McLeay)-Hitle r destroyed freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom of Boothby knows that that is the position in Rhodesia today, and he wants to introduce similar legislation into this Parliament. So honourable members opposite should not say that there is not a danger of this happening in Australia. Then Hitler plunged the whole world into the bloodiest of human conflicts ever recorded in the history of the human race. The honourable member for Lilley, the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen), tbe honourable member for Boothby, the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Chipp), the honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Jess) and the other young Turks of the Liberal Party are the present-day vanguard Nazism in Australia, unless they are checked. I well know that their mentor is Eric Butler, who is well known for his Nazi anti-Semitism. These things cannot be allowed to go unchallenged. We all know the attitude which the Liberal Party adopted in this Parliament recently when we raised the question of stopping the Vietnam war by pulling out all Australian troops. The3 Ministers who spoke in that debate-the Deputy Prime Minister( Mr the Minister for Health, Mr Jago, said McEwen), the Minister for Defence( Mr that the wearing of the Moratorium badge Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for even expressed an opinion on the issue. We know that the Liberal Party wants to suppress everything. It is opposed to people like the Attorney-General's uncle who has sponsored the Moratorium and the member of the executive of the North Sydney Branch of the Liberal Party. Honourable members opposite should not forget that the kind of laws suggested by the honourable member for Lilley knows no barriers. Let us have a look at what happened at the time of the Communist Party Dissolution Bill. I have a pamphlet here which is headed 'Menzies SS-Men Manhandle Liberal Senator's Daughter'. It shows a Liberal senator's daughter being bundled out of the Sydney Town Hall because she was protesting about the Communist Party Dissolution Bill. Legislation which the honourable members opposite suggest should be introduced in Australia is a threat to the security of every Australian. Is swallow it,' Mr Winnel said. it not funny? The Liberal Party talks about the aims and objectives of the Moratorium. But the aims and objectives of the Moratorium are to save the lives of thousands of people in Vietnam and to bring peace to that war torn country. Is it not amazing when we remember that the Government sells wheat to China. It loves the Communists' gold but it hates their politics. This is the theory of the Liberal Party. Not once have I heard the honourable member for Lilley in this House oppose the selling of Australian wheat to Communist China or our trading with the enemies of our people, as he says the Communist Chinese are. We all know what Mr Askin, the Premier up again. I suppose that, if we live to the of New South Wales, thinks ought to be year 2,000 or so, we might see the honourdone with demonstrators. I hope you will able member for Lilley allowed to raise a excuse me, Mr Deputy Speaker, but the of the movement towards Premier of New South Wales did not muck about when, in the presence of the President of the United States of America, demonstrators showed their displeasure at what is happening in Vietnam. He said: 'Run over the bastards!'. What can we expect? This is what Mr Askin said about the way in which these people should be treated. It was a shocking remark but it shows how the Liberal mind works. In the New South Wales Legislative Assembly the other day, was disloyal and treasonable. Yet, he strutted around, done up like a pakapu ticket, with badges of every type from the Returned Services League down to his local Rotary Club. But he sought to deny to a man who stood for freedom the right to exhibit his belief on his lapel. This is the type of mentality which we see coming from the honourable member for Lilley, sitting on the Government side, who raised this matter for discussion today. The Liberal Party needs to wake up on this question. I have here a newspaper report on a statement by Mr Winnel. He is a 22 year old branch president of the Liberal Party. The newspaper report states: 'People like Jess( Mr J. D. Jess, the Victorian MHR) can rave on about the red bogey, but young people won't swallow it,' said Mr Winnel. The report continues: 'It was all right for the Liberal Party to rely on the red peril in the time of Stalin, but people who have grown up in the 60s are too wise to Honourable members opposite ought to take this home and read it carefully because it illustrates the present situation. This discussion has been introduced today at the lowest level of the Liberal Party. The Government could not find anybody in the Ministry to propose it for discussion as a matter of public importance. It could not get anybody near the Ministry to raise it. So, it was brought foward by the honourable member for Lilley, the displaced Deputy Whip of the Liberal Party, a terribly lowly position. He said that it is a lowly position. He is trying to rehabilitate himself. He is on the long march up the ladder again. He is stepping",28,Vietnam Moratorium Campaign

This is the man who is saying that the Vietnam Moratorium should be supported. He is prepared in order to gain support, to gain privilege and to provide a smokescreen for it to attack bitterly a man who, he knows, is activated by the highest motives and who on all occasions has acted with the greatest of concern for the national interests of this country. The honourable member for Lilley, in opening this debate, put 3 challenges to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). The first was: Did the Leader of the Opposition surrender his position at the meeting of the Federal Executive of the Australian Labor Party at Broken Hill? Secondly, did the ALP Executive officially adopt the popular front technique? He challenged him, thirdly, to refute that the Moratorium movement is composed of 3 groups: The Communist Party of Australia, the peace groups and now the Australian Labor Party; and that the ALP is trying to bring the Australian Council of Trade Unions formally into it. These are the 3 challenges that were put by the honourable gentleman. They were not even mentioned by the honourable member for Grayndler. I am not surprised for I believe that the honourable member for Grayndler does not support the Moratorium Campaign. Out of a misguided sense of loyalty, the honourable member for Grayndler has done what his Party has put him up to do, that is, make a speech full of attempted humour. As for the time that the honourable member took to read extracts from 'Mein Secretary were directed to talk to Mr Hawke Kampf to the House, I would say that we to plan a course of action. In May there can all remember what happened in the had been a national consultation of the past. We do not need to be reminded how Vietnam Moratorium organisers; perhaps a country can be taken over insidiously by the best description of this body is the forces which are destructive to that country. federal executive, although I do not know This is the reason why the honourable that that is necessarily the term because meniber for Lilley proposed this matter for it is a rather loose group.

They are from a wide range insidious nature of the movement which is of what one might call the far left. Everyaround us at all times. It is a direct body knows that on the far left at the descendant of the peace groups. The peace moment there is extreme competition in groups come in different forms at different militancy. Maoists, the Trotskyites, the times. When exposed, they must collapse because they cannot stand up to scratiny. The Vietnam Moratorium movement is a direct descendant of peace groups. It is imperative for members on this side of the House to raise the matter so that it can be exposed just as it is imperative for members on the Opposition side of the House to submit it to the scrutiny that it deserves; for, unless it is committed to that scrutiny, it may achieve its objectives. If it achieves its objectives, this country will not be the democratic country which we are all determined it should be. I do not accuse the Opposition, and nobody ought to accuse the Opposition, of attempting, or willingly or recklessly being willing, to submit the country to this sort of undermining influence. Today Opposition members need to examine their actions and those of the movement to see whether or not the real purpose of the movement is being kept from their view and whether they are not being fed false propaganda about it in order to give it respectability. The Australian Labor Party has officially associated itself with this Vietnam Moratorium. By a unanimous resolution which was adopted at Broken Hill-it is too important to take this point now; it is a throw away point-fh e Leader of the Opposition was directed at the Federal Executive meeting what to do. It directed the Leader of the Opposition and the Federal Secretary of the Party in combination to meet Mr Hawke, the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions', to plan some form of action. That was on 6th August. It is very important to note the date. On 6th August the Federal Executive gave that direction. In that resolution the Leader of the Opposition and the Federal Muscovites and the Peking people are in competition in militancy. They came together and they reached certain conclusions. They passed on their recommendations to the State branches of the Vietnam Moratorium committee. The Victorian State committee went further than the Federal body. The Victorian body made amendments to the recommendations. The Federal body had recommended that anti-conscription and anti-Vietnam should be the main issues. When that recommendation got down to Victoria that body adopted it with amendments and in the Richmond Town Hall on 19th July recommendations were circulated which were directed to the disruption of the execution of the law of the Commonwealth. They stated that while major attention should be given to draft resistance certain other things ought to be done. They recommended that an agent be appointed for every group to give advice as to how to avoid the draft and on how to avoid the law. They went further lhan that. They said that the National Service Act should be obstructed in every way possible so that it would not work. They said this should be done by filling iu to talk with Mr Hawke, President of the false forms. The honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Fulton) got up here the other day and asked a question of the Prime Minister in my temporary absence. He said: 'Please do not send me to gaol'-raisin g a laugh, wanting to raise publicity. Why did the organisers do it? It was to have him do exactly that thing to give publicity. It appeals to them to get that publicity. That is their purpose. I do not say this in any condescending way, but the honourable member for Leichhardt is recognised by everybody in this House as a fine member of the Parliament. But he unwittingly got up and did exactly what was expected of him, just as the ALP members on their benches are doing what is expected of them by the organisers of this Moratorium. They are all unfortunately duped into doing what is wauted of them. People are urged to provide false forms, false birth dates and other sorts of things which I will not refer to so as not to give the organisers the publicity they want me to give them. Persons ring up, ask a person in the Department to answer the phone and then walk off without hanging up the 22106/70-R-{37 ] phone, for the purpose of tying up the phones in the Department. Is this the sort of thing that the ALP endorses? Trying to bring to a standstill a Department of State? Honourable members opposite cannot say: 'We are in support of the philosophy of Vietnam but not these other things on ths side' because these other things were decided on 19th July and the unanimous endorsement of the Vietnam Moratorium by the Victorian executive was on 6th August. The same situation can be followed through. The Federal Executive had no confidence in the Parliamentary Labor Party to mount an opposition campaign against our policies. Instead of that it resorts to these other things as an alternative government prepared to ignore centuries of tradition, to ignore the interests of tbe public servants whose duty it is to carry out the law, to frustrate them and to frustrate the processes of government, and then say that this is democracy. The other thing which the Federal Executive did was to ask the Leader of the Opposition to talk with the ACTU. This was before the protest rallies on the Budget. It has echoes but it is one of these curious things of which the echoes are before the event. Why would the ALP want ACTU, if it were not to achieve industrial action to serve a political purpose? If that is the attitude of the ALP it stands condemned. The philosophy of the Vietnam Moratorium is to ignore the fact that in this Parliament are members who are elected to come here to debate, put issues, resist issues and vote on them. Every range of opinion in our country is represented here but the philosophy of the Moratorium is to take decisions out of this House and put them in the streets where the vocal minority is supreme, not in the ballot box and not in this chamber. The crowning joke of the whole thing is that the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) is declared black. Have honourable members ever heard such nonsense? This group, which describes itself as defenders of liberty, defenders of each differing view, has at times decided that it is a coaltion of opposition opinion. Ah, but let anybody say something that the authoritarianism of the driving force does not agree with. These people say: 'Our campaign is only against authoritianism by others, not by us'. In consequence the honourable member for Wills has to attempt to defend himself, with the support of the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Cohen) and, I am sure, others in this place. The final point which must be made is that those people in this country who oppose our policies on Vietnam will find ways of expressing their opinion. No matter how genuine fhey are in their opposition they ought not to be deceived into believing that the way to express that oppomember for Lilley. One of the great sition is, by their physical presence, proironies in political practice in this country viding support for the organisers of this Vietnam Moratorium who claim to represent people who indeed are totally opposed to the way in which those organisers would conduct their affairs if they ever came to power, It is a tragic thing that some people who support the campaign do so with the best of motive. The honourable member for Grayndler said that the purpose of the Moratorium is to stop lives being lost in Vietnam. That is how it is put to decent people. But that is not its purpose at all. The purpose of the Vietnam Moratorium is to take decision making out of the ballot boxes, out of this Parliaa stranger that Government spokesmen had ment, out of the debates, and put it in the streets where the vocal minority can be supreme. But it cannot be supreme here. This is the democracy that we ought to defend. Speaker, I wish to make a personal explaphony indignation and mock gravity.

Its objectives state that that Party stands for 'freedom of speech, religion and association*. Yet everything which has been said this morning by Government spokesmen has been designed clearly to intimidate those who seek freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of movement. The rather remarkable feature of the whole performance is that it would seem to just discovered that members of the Australian Labor Party and members of the industrial movement support the Moratorium movement. This is a scratchy recording. It is catching again.

We are not frightened of reform feeds upon repression and marFrom speaking with them it is fairly clear that, while they are prepared to destroy this society, they do not have any precise ideas about how they will create a new one. The correct and constructive approach to the problems of the young people in our society is not to try to hammer them down with force of authority but to understand their problems and try to respond constructively and responsibly to the great challenge that they are presenting. It is undeniable that the structure and relationships within our society are quite inequitable. Twenty years of Conservative government have only consolidated the inequity that exists. The Minister for Labour and National Service raised the point of guilt by association. T have here a copy of the 'Canberra Times' which covers an interview with the for Shipping and Transport) [12.31]I must honourable member for Boothby( Mr confess that when I heard the honourable McLeay) in Rhodesia. He was asked: How similar do you thinlc Auslralia and southwondered where this young disciple of the ern Africa ure both in climate and outlook and honourable member for Lalor (Dr. J. F. so on? He made a number of points during which to hear his comments about the Communist he said: You're much more advanced in some ways than occasion on which the Vietnam Moratorium we are. At the moment we're almost a Communist state. Sounds incredible doesn't it? There was an unintelligible question. It is appropriate to put such a question to the honourable member. He answered: Oh, I deplore it. And it's interesting to come and see the way that you've got on top of this problem. In fact, I'm taking home some of your pieces of legislation, and I aim lo introduce them as Private Members' Bills lo see if we can do something about this. We've got three Communist parties in Australia and they've subverted the trade union movement, churches, universities and, I'm afraid, some of the Press. I shall not join in the invitation extended by honourable members on the Government side to accuse other people of guilt by association. I frankly believe that most members of the Liberal Party are responsible people and would not endorse the extreme, irresponsible and irrational view which has been put forward by the honourable member for Boothby. Indeed, 1 am prepared to believe that most honourable members on the Government side do not appreciate the performance which we have seen this morning and in which the Minister for Labour and National Service has joined with such great enthusiasm. At stake in Australia today are the people's freedoms, which are being challenged by the way in which the Government is behaving. The challenge is to the people's right of assembly, their right to express themselves and their right to speak. The Government does not believe in freedom. It wants a great mass of mindless people who can be programmed for manipulation through the simplest devices. Tf it believes that that can be done, it is gravely out of step with trends in society today. Young people do, in fact, have us on trial. They are challenging us to improve the society we have created. This conservative Government is failing to respond to these challenges, and this presents a very sad outlook for the future of this country. member for Oxley( Mr Hayden) speaking I Cairns) was leading us. I was rather intrigued Party. The honourable member for Lalor, when speaking in this chamber on the last Campaign was before us, commented: In a given situation Communists can be right, lf they are right I will never say that they ure wrong. If a Communist stands for something that is right and if that thing concerns me I will stand with him for lhat thing. This morning we heard from the honourable member for Oxley very similar sentiments. He said that if a Communist stands on a platform and expresses a point of view with which he agrees he has no hesitation in supporting that point of view. There is no question in my mind that in what the honourable member for Oxley said this morning and in what the honourable member for Lalor said previously there is a direct contradiction of what I understand to be the continuing policy of the Australian Labor Party, namely, that there should be no unity of aim and purpose with members of the Communist Party. Indeed, 1 am told that since 1928 there has been a complete ban on the adoption of uniform policy with the Communist Party. Yet in the decision that was taken at Broken Hill-namely , that the Australian Labor Party would join with those associated with the Moratorium-in what the honourable member for Oxley has",34,Speaker Mr Raised To Place The Facts Before The Aus
83,Mr Sinclair (New England,"Ministe rsaid this morning and in what other members of the Labor Party have said, we see effectively demonstrated the very close rapport which, in spite of so-called policy bans of the Labor Party, obviously brings the 2 parties-the Communist Party and Labor Party-ver y close together in ways which supposedly are not to be. But we are really talking about facts. We are not talking about ideas alone. In the last 10 minutes I, frankly, was not really sure whether the honourable member for Oxley was aware of the matter that is before us, namely, the involvement of political and industrial bodies in the aims, organisation and plans of the imminent Moratorium campaign. In this House and in public in recent months we have had a great deal of argument about the quality of Australian life. The quality of Australian are the known creatures of international life does not mean just physical things; it does not mean just pollution; it does not mean just living conditions. It also means the preservation of the opportunity for the expression of ideas; it means the preservation of the opportunity to express dissent, and to express it in a peaceful way; it means something of the British traditions that we have inherited, such as the preservation of the rule of law and of democracy and not mobocracy; it means an appreciation that maturity in the individual means the recognition of the right of another to have and to express a point of view that is different from one's own; and it means the preservation of the British parliamentary system. In regard to the preservation of the rule of law and the development of responsibility by those who enact the rule of law, we have seen and are seeing demonstrated in the support for this Moratorium campaign expressed by members of the Opposition, who together with members of the Government parties are members of the legislature of this country, a preparedness to dismiss all responsibility for maintenance of the rule of law. The stated purposes of the Moratorium are in an area in which, without doubt, there is a reason and justification for peaceful disagreement. But the fact that Australia's security is at stake and there is necessarily a need for Australians to recognise that Ihey are very much alone in a world with which traditionally they have been associated means that, if we in this part of the world do not recognise that there are many thousands of people living in lesser developed countries very close to our shores and do not adopt a responsible attitude towards defence against the insurgence of Communism in that part of the world, we ourselves may ultimately be put at risk. But, be that as it may, it is an area within which there can be peaceful expression of discontent. However, what concerns me is the whole concept that has developed through the participation of members of the Opposition and those who have been associated with them in the Congress for International Cooperation and Disarmament, for example, and again in these Moratorium campaigns. In their participation in organisations which Communist front organisations, there has grown up a preparedness on the part of members of the Labor Party on the other side of this Parliament to create a climate which I believe is denying that basic freedom of dissent which is essential if we in Australia are to continue to develop under the concept of the rule of law and the concept of maturity which I believe any thinking Australian would espouse. There is one other point, and that is that the concepts that are put forward by those who support the Moratorium, including members of the Labor Party, are not things that have originated in their own minds. They are things that have descended from an idea created many miles away from Australia. They arise from the violence that has been expressed in the physical conflicts in the United States. Unfortunately, in Australia they are leading towards support of mob violence. Not so very many weeks ago I had occasion to hear an expression of the personal philosophy of some of those who belong to Students for a Democratic Society. I was somewhat surprised to hear the way in which one of the leaders of SDS spoke to a group of university undergraduates. He said that when they were looking for a cause around which they could disrupt responsibility within the university they did not particularly choose national service as a cause in which they believed; they chose it predominantly because it was a cause on which they could rally support from those who were in the age group involved. Obviously national service is something that affects university students; it is a cause that is of predominant interest to those who will serve or are expected to serve. So, rather than seek support for pensions or something else that was outside their particular sphere, they sought-no t because of its intrinsic demerits or otherwise, but because they thought it had more emotive content-som e sort of campaign mounted against national service. In explaining the objectives of SDS, this leader suggested that it was no use just in this debate with some sorrow because in rising and expressing dissent in a-peaceful way; rather it was better, if one wanted to attract the support of the PressI notice that members of the Press are not here in great numbers for this debate this morning Mr DalyI do not blame them. member participated in this debate, I can quite understand their tendency to leave the gallery. It is interesting to note that this leader suggested that the only way in which the supporters of SDS could get any space at all would be by participating to the maximum extent in violent demonstrations to the point where the forces of law and order were called on to exercise restraint. I believe that it is in this area and in this tactic that the Moratorium campaign itself-supporte d as it is by the Labor Party and supported as it is by the Communist Party-is leading Australia away from the preservation of the rule of law and the preservation of all those things that we hold dear. Without doubt there is a field within which legitimate industrial action must be preserved and I am concerned that there is an increasing tendency away from legitimate industrial action into political industrial action. This political industrial action sponsored substantially by the left and by the Communist Party is ensuring that the Labor Party and the Communist Party together are derogating from the maintenance of the rights of the individual worker. I believe that the individual worker is being prejudiced in the same way as the rule of law and the maintenance of the legitimate opportunity to dissent to the point where I hesitate not to foreshadow that those rights to dissent will be curtailed by the very actions of those who seek to express dissent. In this morning's 'Financial Review' the following quotation seemed to me to be pertinent. It reads: As any official in a Communist couniry can testify, the indiscriminate adoption of systems and administrative details designed for another national environment is as good a way as any of preparing the way for a total takeover by those for whom the system was originally designed. That is the objective of the Moratorium Campaign and of the Labor Party. the 12 years that I have spent in this Parliament I have found, whether it be on the eve of the 1959 Melbourne Peace Conference when the Attorney-General, Sir Garfield Barwick, who is now the Chief Justice of Australia spoke, or on the occasion of the conference in Sydney in 1964 when Sir Robert Menzies spoke, lhat on each occasion a statement has been made in an attempt to smear certain citizens who stand up for their inalienable rights. This action has continued right through to today where we have a discredited Government backbencher with very firm political and ideological views, bringing this matter up. I hope I can restrain myself because this is an emotional question. We must remember that we are talking about injustice and if there is a threat to justice anywhere it is a threat to justice everywhere. The question of Vietnam, where there have been millions of people killed over the years, is an emotional one. The United States, the most powerful nation in the world, continues to bomb Vietnam indiscriminately. It continues to drop more explosive bombs on that little nation of Vietnam that were dropped on the whole of the Axis powers during the Second World War. So it is an emotional question and I will strive for restraint. I place my sins on the alter. For the whole 12 years of my parliamentary career I have been a proud member of the peace movement and I am also a proud member of the Australian Labor Party. These2 movements are dear to my heart and I have struggled to uphold their policies. I sometimes disagree with the policies of the peace movement because it is a broad movement covering a very wide spectrum of beliefs. We try to bring restraint and to give leadership so that some people on some occasions",36,Speaker Mr Raised To Place The Facts Before The Aus

85,Mr Uren (Reid [12.21],"I rise to speakdo not go too far and make statements or act in a way that would probably be injurious to the peace cause and possibly to my Party which supports the peace cause. I want to answer the question asked by the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Sinclair). He asked whether we wanted democracy or mobocracy. To answer the question I will quote an editorial from a conservative journal, the Melbourne 'Age' of 9th May 1970. It said in part: It was, without doubt, the most impressive demonstration seen in Melbourne. The sheer weight of numbers alone was staggering: at least 70,000 people packed in close close marching rows across Bourke Street and stretching from Elizabeth to Spring Streets. More significantly the demonstration was non-violent. The Sydney 'Bulletin', of all papers, reporting on that demonstration said: Had it been ANZAC Day it would have been at least 150,000, but seeing that it was the Moratorium in Melbourne it was 70,000. The editorial of the Melbourne 'Age' made this statement: Tbe demonstration was a forceful reply to those MPs who described intending marchers as 'bikies who are pack raping democracy'. said by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Snedden) who spoke earlier in this debate. So let us stop these comments and get back to sanity. Let us examine the question of what we really have to do. Why do those who support the Moratorium demonstrate? Why do people with such diverse of political beliefs demonstrate? For instance, in the United States, as my colleague the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) pointed out, about 40 United States Senators have just voted to stop all aid to Vietnam by the end of 1971. Forty United States Senators, or to be exact, 39, voted to stop all financial aid to the United States forces in South East Asia. That mean that they want all troops out by that date. 1 give great credit to America even though I condemn its bombing of Vietnam. Today America has the greatest spirit of freedom in the world. The American people are struggling against their own government for the right to be heard. The American nation is split. This struggle has torn the heart out of their society. It has defeated a President and has proved that the American people have a conscience. In the United Staites we find Republicans and Democrats in both the Senate and the House of Representatives speaking out against this vile, immoral war in Vietnam, this inhuman, bottomless pit of human suffering. But not one present supporter of the Government has ever shown any doubt about the Government's attitude to Vietnam. Only one Government supporter resigned from the Liberal Party because his conscience was killing him. God bless him. He is now dead. He was Senator Hannaford from South Australia. As far as I am concerned, this is a great moral question. We must look at it in this way because the Government says that we are fighting for freedom in Vietnam. Everybody who studies the history of the struggle in Vietnam knows that the United States placed pressure on the 17 nations which make up NATO to make military forces available for Vietnam. Every one of those 17 nations refused. Where are our SEATO allies? Where is France, Britain and Pakistan? Even the Philippines, which had 2,000 men in Vietnam on construction work, has withdrawn its forces. It has now been stated that Thailand is going to withdraw her forces. So we stand alone, the lonely few Australians, like 'a lonely petunia in an onion patch'. It is this Government which has betrayed our young men. The Government is responsible for the deaths of more than 400 young men who have perished in Vietnam and over 2,000 who will carry injuries for the rest of their days. I have been to Vietnam. I was there in 1965. I saw first hand the conditions under which they lived and fought. I am sorry for every young Australian there. My Leader when speaking at the Sydney Town Hall during the last general election campaign said that if Labor were elected, by the end of June 1970 every Australian serviceman would be out of Vietnam. I was indeed proud of that statement, as I have been proud of the record of my colleagues who have struggled for peace and freedom in Vietnam. We believe that we must stop this immoral war. We do not say that all the rights are on one side and all the wrongs are on the other side. Over and over again we have called for a compromise and a negotiated peace because that",38,Speaker Mr Raised To Place The Facts Before The Aus

As honourable members would know and as they were informed earlier, the subject matter of the urgency discussion was first conveyed to any members of the Opposition a quarter of an hour before the House sat and when the Whip, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of ihe Opposition received their copies of their blue programme. Other members of the Opposition would not have heard of it until they came into the House and examined the blue programmes on their desks. Sir, it was for that reason that, when you rose to read the subject matter of the letter which you had received from the honourable meniber for Lilley( Mr Kevin Cairns), I asked you when you had received it. You said you received it last Fridaya week ago. No information was given by the Leader of the House( Mr Snedden) who. of course, intended to speak on this matter, let alone by the honourable member for Lilley, to my Deputy, to the Whip of my Party or to myself, let alone to any other honourable members. Accordingly, there could be no question of any tacit understanding in this matter. The Leader of the House and my Deputy never spoke on this matter before the House met. On other occasions there have been Deputy Speaker makes no difference. But what may be called tacit understandings. it does make a difference to the Whip While the Standing Orders do not require because after all he is the man with whom it, members of my Party in fact always we have to deal in terms of the wording of follow the practice of notifying the Leader the matter of public importance. I would of the House of any urgency motion about reeret it if either side ever had only 25 which they have written to the Speaker. minutes notificationI understand that They have to write to the Speaker an hour that is the more accurate time regarding before the House sits. At the same time today's events-and if there is a lesson to they always give the text to the Leader of be learned in this I hope that each s de will the House. On some of those occasions learn to show a litt'e more consideration there may be tacit understandings but on for the olhcr. That is the principal point T this occasion there was not: there could want to make. T think it is v»'id. 1 hope not be. PerhapsI should add, as an addithat we can achieve some benefit from this tional earnest of that, you will remember, difference of opinion. Sir, that after the debale started it was I who gave you the list of those honourable members on my side of the House lhat I make the position clear. When notification expected to be rising as well as on the of a matter of public importance is given Government side. of order, if I may I would like to correct any person or persons in this House in one or two matters that have arisen. The honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) last night, and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) on this occasion, have suggested that because of the provision to notify the Speaker at least an hour before the sitting of the Housefor Grayndler did it this morning in his speech. made by the honourable member for Grayndler and the Leader of the Opposition. But once the Speaker had been notified that was ipso facto notification to the other side in Parliament that a matter of public importance would be brought forward in certain terms. Sir, I regret it if only a quarter of an hours notice was given before the sitting of the House today. My understanding was lhat it was considerably longer, but in justice and sincerity I point out that as Deputy Whip of the Liberal PartyT have been in precisely the same position on about 8 times this session. My next point is something which the Opposition might well remember. We cannot get any information from you. Mr Speaker, or from the C'erk aboul the terms of a matter of public importance once it is lodged with the Speaker. That is to protect the rights of the Opposition. From that point of view, the time of notification to you. Mr Speaker, or to the ; to the Clerk or to me there is. tinder Standing Orders, no obligation on the part",40,Business Of The House

Thirdly, I have always undertaken to inform the Leader of the House or his assistant that sufficient to rule on the point of order. I the Opposition would be proposing for discall the honourable member for Adelaide. cussion a matter of definite public importance. I think that that is a reasonable attitude and one that I have always accepted as being the proper one to adopt. The Standing Orders require, that the terms of the motion should be available to the Speaker only, 1 hour before the debate, but we have gone further than that, and I do not think that the Leader of tbe House could dispute that he has always been advised. I , as the member responsible for the Opposition in these matters to consult with the Leader of the House on the order the debate and those who will take part in it, was not consulted in any way by any Government member. I was not notified by the Whip. I certainly was not notified by the Leader of the House. One would hardly expect the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Kevin Cairns) to notify me or anyone on this side of the House. I think this is a responsibility that one could have expected to be carried out as a matter of courtesy in view of the attitude that I have always adopted in these matters. Either the Leader of the House or at least some responsible Government member, including the honourable member for Lilley, should have public importance.

Question so resolved in the affirmative. Bill presented by Mr Anthony, and read a first time. Second Reading for Primary Industry) [2.37]I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Processed Milk Products Bounty Act 1962-1970 to provide for the payment of an export bounty of $3,379,000 on skim milk powder, buttermilk powder and casein produced and exported in 1970-71. The decision to pay the bounty on non-fat milk products formed part of the arrangements agreed to by the Government for the Australian dairy industry for 1970-71 in response to undertakings by the industry to voluntarily restrain butter and cheese production during the year to 220,000 tons and 70,000 tons respectively. The returns from the sale of non-fat milk products represent an important part of producers' returns and the bounty provisions will help to maintain the allowances made to producers by butter factories for solids-not-fat in milk at the 1969-70 level, which Jacobi. R. reflected the receipt of devaluation compensation payments. However, the bounty Keating, P. J. provisions will rule out any devaluation Kennedy, A.

Johnson, Les ENGINEERING SERVICES, Approval of Work-Public Works Committee Act Customs and Excise) [2.40]I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to tbe Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of engineering services to sub-divisions of Racecourse West, Morris Soak and Bradshaw Drive at Alice Springs, Northern Territory. The proposed work involves the construction of sealed roads, footpaths, stormwater drainage, water supply and sewerage systems to provide 920 residential lots and 31 special sites. In addition to the services within the sub-divisions, the proposal includes construction of main stormwater and sewerage works. The estimated cost is $5.25m. In reporting favourably on the proposal the Committee concluded that more serviced land than previously made available should be auctioned for private housing purposes. The Government recognises that there is an increasing demand for private housing lots and intends to make more of these available in future releases of serviced land.

113,Mr Bryant (Wills) [2.45],"I want to of members. Some are machinery quesquorum of this House to 25 out of 125 members. The argument has been advanced that honourable members are often engaged on committee meetings or on other matters, but when national issues are at stake in this chamber no other matters are more important. It could be that the House is considering a proclamation of war or the expulsion of a member from the House. Of course, some people say: It cannot happen here'. Why cannot it happen here? Of the 120 or so governments in the world that have attempted parliamentary democracy how many are still flourishing in full flight as parliamentary democracies? How many of those governments said: 'There is no need to worry about that: it cannot happen here'? No argument has been advanced to persuade me that the quorum of this House ought to be reduced. I hope that if this House abdicates its position the Senate will protect us from ourselves. I hope that this House will give this Bill serious consideration and reject it. No parliament of a nation like Australia should consider allowing 25 of its membership-1 4 constituting a majority-to make decisions of national moment. What surprises me is that throughout Australia little note has been taken of this proposal. As far as I can see there has been not one word in the Press about it-n o leading article and so forth. What is wrong with the Parliament itself that it should even consider this proposal? It is not a question of inconvenience for afternoon tea or committee meetings. This matter concerns the number of members required to establish national policies. No-one can tell me that 25 is enough. The question before the chair is, That the Bill be now read a second time'.

The amendment does not the tellers of a division of the House that one-third of the whole number of members is not present, no decision of the House shall be considered to have been arrived at by such division.' The honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham) had circulated a proposed amendment but unfortunately he has had to leave. My objections to a reduction in the quorum during debates are not so intense as those which I hold towards reducing the number of members required to pass legislation. I have a firm belief that the Parliament ought not to reduce its authority by requiring only one-fifth of members to be present to pass legislation. The Opposition Whip tells me that rarely have fewer than one-third of members passed legislation; rarely have fewer than one-third been present for a division. Therefore I do not think it would involve the Leader of the House( Mr Snedden) in any hardship if he were to accept the proposal that one-third of all members should be present for a division. If my proposal is not accepted, at some time in the future circumstances may arise where a small minority of members will make a vital decision about the nation. I believe it is important that the House exercise its authority and require the presence of no fewer than one-third of members be present when a vote is being taken on legislation, as distinct from the ordinary sitting of the House. Originally the honourable member for Capricornia intended to move that one-half of all members be requireu to be present, but I have reduced that percentage in my motion to one-third can understand the motives and sincerity behind the amendment which the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) has moved on behalf of his colleague, which requires that one-third of the number of members of the House be present before legislation can be passed in a valid fashion, if I might put it that way, nevertheless, in all logic there is a different principle involved here. NormaUy there are 2 sides of politics in a Parliament, and one side has to keep the quorum and have a quorum available before legislation is passed. One could imagine the situation, for instance, in which the Opposition for some reason or other decided virtually not to be cope with that situation. It has not been indicated how asinine that situation could be. The amendment really does nothing in terms of assuring balanced representation of Parliament at a time when a Bill is passed. Therefore I submit to the Committee that the important thing is the quorum, and it will remain so. The balance of the House is of no account. This is all that I can see in the amendment of the honourable member. support sincerely the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant). I think it is a matter of rather scathing indictment of the Parliament itself that in the division which was recently counted only 72 members were present. Fifty-three members are away. Some of them might have the best of reasons for being absent. They might have protected the relative strength of their parties by securing pairs. But the point should be made, and made very clearly, that we have just had rammed down our throats, by weight of numbers, the proposition that we should sit for 4 days a week. Here are the hard realities of the matter. Already there has been moaning by honourable members on both sides of the House who supported the 4-day week to the effect that it is too much for them and that they have special reasons for not being here today. Here are the realities. Fifty-three members are away today. In fact, if the amendment which we are considering had been embodied in a standing order and a question were put to a vote right at the moment, we would not be competent to pass a valid vote of the House. amendment had been incorporated in a standing order at the present time. Parliament is the Parliament and honourable members have to accept it as the Parliament and discharge their duties here or alter the Standing Orders to suit their own requirements.

125,Mr Connor,"It would be so if thebacked half-day at the best. If a 4-day sitting week is wanted, the proper thing to do is to sit from Monday to Thursday inclusive, I have no doubt that honourable members who are absent today have the best of reasons for not being present. I also have the best of reasons for not being present today, but I consider it my duty to stay here on behalf of my constituents, and every sober and responsible member of this House will do the same. Parliament is being progressively downgraded. The best thing that could happen to Parliament-and I have changed my opinion on this score after many years-is that it should be televised so that people can see the paucity of general attendance here. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Drury) I remind the honourable member that he is getting a little wide of the amendment before the Committee. be televised even on occasions such as that of the recent vote. That is a very valid point The whole concept of Parliament is being progressively down-graded. It suits the Executive to have fewer and fewer members in the House. It is the responsibility of the Government to keep a sufficient number of members in the House to pass legislation. It is the responsibility of the Government to have its members here to do so, but they are not here. It is our responsibility to be here to oppose legisnecessary for honourable members to be lation. But primarily it is the function of the elected government to keep the House. Government supporters are not here in sufficient numbers to do that at the present time. This situation is a standing disgrace. Either we as a Parliament knuckle down to our business on Friday or get back to fhe 3-day week. The sooner we do that the better. I strongly commend the honourable member for Wills for moving this amendment. the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) because I believe that if a fixed figure is decided on for a quorum then the House is entitled to rely on that figure as being the quorum. We should not vary it just to suit the whims of Opposition members, because they want to play hanky-panky or politics, or because they want to go home or frustrate the business of the Government. If we decide on the figure of 25 as a quorum we are entitled to say that that is the figure. Pairs are arranged so that people from distant electorates, such as those in Western Australia, can get away. This applies to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Collard) and some honourable members from Queensland. Mr FosterI rise to a point of order. Has not this matter been resolved, unfortunately in a manner about which I was not happy? Is not the matter before us now an amendment which relates to the number of honourable members that ought to be present when Bills are put through this House? We are not dealing with the question of the quorum. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Drury) Order! There is no substance in the point of order. and I make it very briefly, is that if we set on a figure as being a quorum, that should be the absolute quorum. As members of the Parliament we are entitled to rely on that number as being the quorum and to plan our business accordingly. The honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Connor) said that the Government has a responsibility to keep up the numbers in the House. I say that the Opposition also has a responsibility to be here. If it is paired so that they may go off on a day such as today then we as a government and honourable members generally are entitled to rely on the number which has been set by this House as being a positive quorum and a quorum for all time. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot have a certain number for a quorum one day and a different number another day because that suits the Opposition. I oppose the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wills. [3.7]I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wilis( Mr Bryant) which requires that at least one-third of the total number of members shall be present when a decision is being arrived at. I have bad a look at the amendment which was circulated by the honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham),",46,House Of Representatives

128,Mr Jarman,"The point I am making,",47,House Of Representatives
129,Mr Charles Jones (Newcastle),"and I was tempted to move it myself. But if we were to move that half the number of honourable members should be present at all times, it could well mean that the House would become unworkable, because all that the Opposition would have to do would be lo send one honourable member in to take a division while the remainder stayed outside. As the matter stands at the present time, thc Government would need to have only about 3 members away and no business could be put through the House. We are not dealing with this matter as Government and Opposition; we are dealing with it as individuals. It is not my desire as an individual to place this House in a position where it would be impracticable or impossible to put the business through. If the Government has the numbers in the House it has the right to bring legislation forward honourable members of the situation on and accept responsibility for it. It is our responsibility as an Opposition to oppose legislation whenever we think it should be opposed and to amend it whenever we think it should be amended, if we have the numbers to do so. SoI feel that the proposidivision on 2 measures before the House. tion that has been put forward by the honourable member for Wills is a sound and logical one. I suggest that we should have a look at the numbers in the House. I am not talking about the honourable members who are in this chamber at the moment; I am talking about those members who are available to vote. On the last vote that was taken the numbers were 43 to 27. It was not a vote of Government and Opposition; it was an individual vote. The facts are that out of 125 members only 72 voted in a division a few moments ago. We sat in this place a few weeks ago and debated for some hours the question of whether the House should continue to operate on the 3-day week-Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday-o r whether we should introduce a 4-day week. I ask: What is the result of the introduction of a 4-day week? I was severely castigated by one honourable member because of my attitude in voting for the of our membership-4 2 members-remai n 3-day week. I attended on 38 days in the last session of Parliament; the man who criticised me attended on 23 days. That honourable member voted for a 4-day sitting week. He has not been sighted in this place all this week. the House who it was. Honourable members can look that up in Hansard. I have been waiting. I do not forget, or forgive. Let us look at the attendance of honourable members in this place. If honourable members want a 4-day sitting week, let them spend the 4 days here. When the House rises-as it will this afternoon in 50 minutes time-that is the time for honourable members to leave. If honourable members believe that we should have a sitting week of 3 days, that is what we should have. I did not vote for the reduction of the size of the quorum from one-third to one-fifth of the total number of members. I think that one-third is a reasonable number to have in this place at all times. I remind 12th June 1970, the last day on which the House sat before the winter recess. The House rose for that recess, having concluded its business, at 7.27 p.m. At that stage, I could quite easily have called for a My Party was in opposition to 2 Bills that were introduced. On behalf of the Opposition I was in charge of the debate on I of those Bills. I did not call for a division at that time for the simple reason that 1 knew that a quorum of members was not present and I was not prepared to have the provisions of the legislation deferred for 2 months and run the risk of depriving the dependants of persons who might have been killed in any air fatality during that period of an additional compensation payment of $15,000. The situation was that not even one-third of the number of members of this House was present and I did not call for a vote on the measures under discussion. I do not think that it is too much to ask honourable members to stay here while the Parliament is in session. All that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wills requests is that one-third here to vote on a Bill. of 125 members. bers out of 125 members.

Are we not talking now only about whether or not the size of the quorum should be varied for the purposes of a division? The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Drury) -We are in the Committee stage of the consideration of the House of Representatives (Quorum of Members) Bill. of the honourable member for Deakin, I point out that, whilst the House has decided that a quorum shall be one-fifth of the total membership of this House, the honourable member for Wills is asking that no measure be carried unless one-third of the membership of this House is present to vote. I think that is a reasonable safeguard. As I said in my earlier remarks, I think that a quorum requirement of one-half! could create a situation in which, because of the action of whichever party was in opposition, the business of the House could not be proceeded with. I think that the proposition from the honourable member for Wills is a fair and reasonable one. I hope that honourable members will carry it. They will if they are fair dinkum and believe that members are attending to their duties here. seek your ruling on the interpretation of the wording of the amendment as it has been given to us. The honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) when moving his amendment altered 'one-halP to 'one-third'. He has assumed in his argument that this means that one-third of the whole number of members needs to be present for a division. Yet, the amendment, as moved, reads: At the end of the clause add the following I move that he be given leave to change proviso: 'Provided that if it appears on the report by the words 'two-thirds* to 'one-third'? the tellers of a division of the House that one-third of the whole number of Members is not present, no decision of the House shall be considourable member for Wills has already ered to have been arrived at by such division.'.

As I understand the wording of this amendment moved by the honourable memher for Wills, and as it has been given to me. it would require two-thirds of the whole number of members to be present. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Drury) -It appears to me that the wording is cbar enough. As1 understand the amendment of the honourable member for Wills one-third, 42 of the total number, have to be present. Mr BryantI think there is a complicated or half-baked double negative there. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN-It simply means that if 42 members are not present there can be no decision of the House. ourable member for Wills was that 42 members should be present before a decision of the House could be arrived at.

On each of those occasions a division was called on the question that the House do now which is in line with what the honourable adjourn. What happened was that the member for Adelaide( Mr Hurford) stated. adjournment debate was proceeding and I think that the amendment moved by the honourable members got tired of it and honourable member for Wills( Mr went home. When the question was put Bryant)-whic h I do not support-is that the House do now adjourn there was ambiguous. Perhaps he could be allowed to a division and there were not enough re-word it so that everyone in the House members to record the result of the diviwill be clear. I suggest that it could be sion.

141,Mr Sneddeni Am Not Being Critical.,"the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant). Honourable members have been deliberating in this chamber off and on for a couple of weeks on some form of improvement or reform. I hold the very strong view that little can be done about reform in this House until one starts to look at these 2 almost infamous documents. However, do honourable members who are debating this question realise that if they do not support the amendment 25 members will suffice for the taking of a division. Let honourable members get out on the hustings at election time and tell the people from whom they expect support that of a total of 125 elected members if 25 members vote in a division a simple majority of those who vote will suffice for an affirmative decision. One half of the Ministry could be missing. How serious would that be? I shall never give my support to such a measure as long as I sit here. 1 consider, in fact, that more serious matters which come before this House are dealt with in a most cavalier and casual manner indeed. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr or I shall seek a ruling as to whether the Drury) I ask the honourable member not to get too wide of the amendment. being required by the Chair to come to the point I do no more than reiterate that if one-fifth of the members were sufficient for a division, half of the Ministry could be missing. In view of some of the things they do all thc Ministers ought to be missing. Honourable members opposite should go out and tell the public what they intend to do. The public will not in any circumstances agree with them. Yet we had a situation in thb House this morning in which all sorts of subterfuges were adopted by honourable members opposite, including the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Standing Orders cannot be suspended Kevin Cairns). We have before us a very serious matter. Under the terms of the Bill now before us, decisions of this Parliament can be made and Bills can be passed with only a very small minority of the elected members of this Parliament being present and at the same time this Government is attempting tc give such decisions an air of legality. Bills could be passed with only a few honourable members here. If this is man, to rule whether this amendment is not a minority form of government then I would like someone to inform me what is. ourable member for Kingston, interjects and says thai it is a stacked meeting. Honourable members opposite stand up in this place and attack the trade union movement. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Drury) Order! The honourable member is getting very wide of the matter which is before this Committee. opposite would attack trade unions if they had some oc those rules and provisions in their constitutions. I deplore the proposal now before the Committee. We should at least grab some straw in an attempt to save the situation. We should support unanimously the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wills and thereby save face. will oppose the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) amendment is out of order in terms of the Bill. This Bill relates to a quorum of members of the House of Representatives. As I understand the position the Bill had to be passed because previously the quorum was fixed under the provisions of the Constitution with a proviso that it would remain at that figure until such time as Parliament decided otherwise. This Parliament is now deciding whether the quorum shall be one-fifth of the members instead of one-third. But the number of members that will constitute a valid division is an entirely different question. As I understand it these matters should be laid down in the Standing Orders of this Parliament. We already have one provision which states that the unless there is what is known as a statutory majority. A statutory majority is 1 more than half of the total members. That is the only provision which sets a minimum number of members for a division. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Wills should, in my view, be referred back to the Standing Orders Committee for further investigation.

147,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [3.27],"Iconsonant with the Bill before us which is a Bill relating, as the title says, to a quorum of the members of the House of Representatives. How can we tag on to a Bill dealing with a quorum of this House a provision as to the valid numbers in any division? To my mind this amendment is not relevant to the Bill. If any honourable member wishes to have this sort of proviso the way to do it is to have the Standing Orders amended. But of course that is not the matter now before the Committee. The subject which is before this Committee is a Bill dealing with a quorum of the House of Representatives. I ask for a ruling on this. If the ruling is against my view I propose to vote against the amendment, in any case. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr ity, those 13 people could be responsible Drury)I rule that the amendment is relevant to the Bill. I rule that the amending on the 13 million people who have ment simply fixes another quorum number required for a division. Therefore I rule that the amendment is in order. General) [3.30]Mr Chairman, as you have ruled that the amendment is in order. I would like to say that I support it. I do so because I believe that it is quite wrong to require that only one-fifth of the members should be present when an important piece of legislation is passed by this Parliament. A minimum of one-third is few enough. I would support an even greater proportion than that. This Parliament makes decisions of tremendous importance year in, year out. I therefore believe that a substantial number of members should be required to be present when a decision is made. I do not want to make a long speech in regard to this matter. I merely indicate to the Committee where I stand. [3.31]-I , too, support the amendment. I agree entirely with the Postmaster-General( Mr Hulme) on this. Some members of the Opposition are opposed to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant), but I appeal to honourable members on this side of the chamber as well as to honourable members on the other side not to make an irrevocable decision now which will stay on the statute book and will be binding on all future governments in all circumstances. I have just asked a question of the assistant Clerk. Perhaps it was not fair to ask him to answer it off the cuff. As far as he is able to answer the question off the cuff, he knows of no requirement in the Standing Orders that stipulates that a special or urgent sitting of the Parliament will require a given amount of notice to honourable members. Assuming that his impromptu reply is correct, one can easily visualise a very serious situation arisingI hope it will never arise in our time. Wc are interfering with an institution that has stood the test of time for about 600 years and which, I hope, will stand the test of time while man lives in this country. If we make the fatal decision today which will allow the Parliament to function with no more than 25 people present out of 125, of which 13 would be a majorfor putting onto the statute book laws bindsent us here. Those laws could range from penal provisions in the Arbitration Act to amendments to the Crimes Act, imposts (Petrie Postmasterupon property or intrusions into the civil liberties of our people. It is a very serious thing. I realise that governments like to have small quorums. I do not condemn them for that, but we are not at this moment thinking in terms of governments and oppositions. This is a free, non-party vote to be taken by members of the Parliament who not only want to sec the Parliament work efficiently but also want the Parliament to be a permanent safeguard for the people of Australia against tyranny, despotism and the kind of abuse of power which governments sometimes take upon themselves. For these reasons I believe that we ought to insist upon having no fewer than one-third of the members present. That is small enough. It is only 42 out of 125 who are required to be present. I cannot really visualise the situation in which this would impose a hardship upon a government, whether it is a Liberal government or a Labor government. Surely it will never be a hardship upon any government not to be able to pass legislation unless there is a mere 42 out of 125 present. Therefore, I would earnestly plead to members on both sides of the Parliament to realise that this is a very serious step we are taking; it is a step that perhaps will be with us for all time.

If we are prepared to allow 25 people to make up tbe mind of Parliament on legislation-if we are prepared to quit our jobs and leave it to them to do that-the n I do not think we deserve the respect of the public. As has already been pointed out, a handful of peoplea mere 13-coul d make national decisions here in this national Parliament. of a quorum of 25 members 13 could represent a majority. Therefore I earnestly appeal to my colleagues to make sure that the respect of this Parliament will not be frittered away on something that apparently does not matter so much anyhow in the actuality of the running of Parliament. Apparently it is on most rare occasions that legislation is passed through this House without at least a third of the members being present. If this is so then why quibble about the amendment? position on this amendment is very easily and quite quickly stated. It is on record that I am one of the members who voted against the general reduction in the quorum. I feel very strongly on this matter. This amendment gives me another chance to make the quorum as I thought it should be constituted operate on the special occasion of a vote in the House and, of course, I will act accordingly. Smith) [3.39]I am one of those also who did not want the quorum reduced. I think we are getting a bit wide of the real intention of what was carried by the House when this matter was discussed on 20th August. I am of the opinion that honourable members were of the mind, when they voted, that the calling of a quorum interrupts the business of the House. Standing order 41 says that we have to have a quorum before the House starts. A member has a right understanding orders 45 and 84 to draw attention to the state of the House. WhilstI have taken a view which supports what my colleague the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) has said, I think the majority of the House has indicated that it does not want quorums greater than one-fifth of the total number of members. However, honourable members have never said that they were prepared to have legislation passed by as little as one-fifth of the members of Parliament. Therefore, would not a solution be to leave the Constitution as it is and maintain a quorum of one-third? We could leave standing order 41, which provides that a quorum must be formed as it is. Then, if honourable members want to alter anything, they could alter Standing Orders. I have in mind standing orders 45 and 84 which set out that a debate cannot continue when a quorum is called for unless a certain number of members come. I think this is the issue. As the honourable member for Wilts said, if you are going to alter a quorum for a division you really get away into another field altogether apart from that which was discussed in this place when we debated the calling of quorums. Let us face it: When a quorum is called Opposition members do not come into the House. We are told to stay out. This is the logical thing to do because it is the responsibility of the Government to make up the numbers, not the responsibility of the Opposition. But this is not so in the case of divisions. We are here all the time. Here we have a situation in which the House is discussing a matter of principle as to whether it is just a tedious matter of delaying the Government in the course of the day or of saying: 'Well, having decided that it wiil be one-fifth it will be one-fifth for everything.' That was not the decision at all. My plea is that the Governmet have another look at the legislation it is introducing. It should leave things as they are and not introduce legislation to deal with the matter. The Government should see whether it could not get around tha",52,House Of Representatives

I see no reason to change my mind, nor do I think Parliament will be denigrated or downgraded if this proposal is put into effect. little relevance in the point made by the mon) when be compared this Parliament with other parliaments in the Commonwealth and in other countries. I think we are competent to decide how many parliamentarians should constitute a quorum to keep the business of the House going and to pass legislation. At some time in the future a contingency might arise when a government is threatened with its life. The Ministry of 24 members could be brought here to form a quorum and to carry legislation which may have some bearing on the constitutional crisis. One cannot foresee future events. There is safety in numbers. I think half the total number of members of the House plus one should constitute a quorum. That is a fair proposition. For a parliament to transact its business half its number plus one should be present. I do not agree that the number should be 42. But to reduce the number from 42 to 25 is ludicrous and would be a slight on this place and on the membership of this place and an insult to the people of the Commonwealth. I think that at least 42 members should be here to transact business. I support the amendment. cussing the size of a quorum, I do not believe that there is any right or wrong about a particular figure. The honourable member for Blaxland( Mr Keating) suggested that the quorum should be half the total number of members of the House plus 1. He suggested that if the number were fewer the Executive could constitute a quorum. Where would the Opposition be, not having answered the call to come to Canberra? If one takes that argument to its logical conclusion, the Government which, by definition, must have half the total number of members plus 1 could pass legislation and the Opposition could stay away and it would not make any difference to the result. I put that argument aside. My first point is that there is no magic about any proportion of a body of men forming a quorum. What we have before us is a Bill which seeks to reduce from one-third to one-fifth the proportion of elected members who shall constitute a quorum because, by trial and error and by experience the House has found that it is inconvenient to have quorums called, to have bells rung and to have members coming into the chamber to make up the present quorum of one-third. It is inconvenient and a waste of time, not because people are lethargic or are engaged in pursuits in which they ought not to be engaged but because, as every honourable member knows, they are engaged in other duties outside the chamber. They are seeing constituents, making telephone calls, doing research, writing speeches and spending time in the Library. Honourable members know, as well as I do, the calls made on a member's time and what he has to fit into the time he spends in this building, which I suggest is busy from 9 a.m. till midnight each sitting day. There is a need to consider the size of a quorum. Through experience we have found that there is a need to reduce the size to one-fifth in order to keep the business of the House going. We know also that when important matters are debated and when a member delivers a good speech the House fills. People are interested in the conduct of affairs in this chamber. If the quality of speech and debate is good, there will be satisfactory attendance. Many arguments have been put. The mover of the amendment suggested that the notes here could be compared with the decision made by a jury. A jury has an entirely different function from that of members who sit in a legislative chamber. A jury has to resolve its interpretation of the facts beyond reasonable doubt, whereas we sit to decide political matters and to make judgments on matters of policy. We sit for days on end and consider a wide variety of subjects. No member would claim to have special knowledge or expert knowledge on all those subjects. So, I come to the point that the amendment contains a proposal not to reduce the number of members required in a division-that is the definition of a quorumfrom one-third to one-fifth. There can hardly be any great magic about this. Somebody made an eloquent plea in which he said: 'If you reduce the proportion to one-fifth, you will need only 25 members.",54,House Of Representatives

On the other hand, if, as the amendment proposes, you need only 42 members, that means that only 22 members can decide a question. So, there is no magic of right or wrong in this question of a quorum. It is surely a figure that has to be determined by what the House knows as a result of all its experience-it has plenty of experience in these matters-to be reasonable. Someone made the plea that matters of other words, the Parliament could be great importance can be put through this called together by the Minister and a couple chamber with small numbers present. of hangers-on.

I wonder whether honourable members realise that, with a quorum of 25 and a Ministry of 27, after the Parliament had been adjourned until such and such a date the Ministry could say: 'They have all gone.

171,Bill (On Motion By Mr Snedden),"b yThe following answers to questions upon notice were circulated: Education: Payment of Fees (Question No. 82) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice: What would be the cost to the Commonwealth of paying the fees of the present number of students at (a) universities, (b) colleges of advanced education, (c) teachers' colleges and (d) technical colleges, whose fees are not already paid by Commonwealth and State departments and instrumentalities. and Science has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) The most recent figures available of fees paid by students attending universities, other than those whose fees are already paid by Commonwealth and State departments and instrumentalities, are those for the 1969 calendar year. The universities have estimated that in that year, the fees received from these students totalled $11.07m For 1970, after allowing for increased student numbers and increased university fees, my Department has estimated that fees payable by these students will be $13m. These estimates do not take into account the value of reimbursements to students who as employees of the Commonwealth are eligible for a refund of fees paid. Nor do they take account of savings to the Commonwealth from a reduction in claims for income taxation deductions which would arise from the abolition of fees. After taking account of these factors it is estimated that, if the Commonwealth were meeting the cost of fees payable in 1970 by students attending university, whose fees are not already paid by Commonwealth and State Departments and instrumentalities, that cost would be about $11.Sm. (b) With respect to colleges of advanced education, information collected indicates that in 1969 fees totalled about $3m. After allowing for rising fees and student increases, and for reductions in taxation claims and the abolition of reimbursements to government employees, it is estimated that the cost to the Commonwealth of paying the fees of students attending colleges of advanced education in 1970, whose fees are not already paid by Commonwealth and State departments and instrumentalities, would be almost $3m. (c) and (d) This information is not available to me as State authorities have not been able to provide sufficient details of the components of fee income for my Department to establish the cost to the Commonwealth of meeting the cost of fees payable by students attending these institutions whose fees are not already paid by Commonwealth and State departments and instrumentalities. Northern Territory: Education (Question No. 1037) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice: (1) What number and percentage of (a) male and (b) female teachers (i) resigned or (ii) took leave from government schools in the Northern Territory in the last year for which he can obtain the information.

Farmers: Financial Difficulties 74 64 138 180 46 226 (Question No. 1115) 2S4 110 364 Mr Collard asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) Has any consideration been given to the need to provide some protection for farmers, who are in financial difiiculties because of drought or other measures outside their control, against demands being made upon them by banks, finance companies, stock dealers, machinery firms and like concerns. (2) Has the desirability of introducing legislation to provide for a moratorium for the farmers received any consideration; if so, what is the intention of the Government. ourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The provision of protection for to provide for a moratorium, is a matter for the State Governments. I understand that a measure of protection for farmers who find themselves in financial difficulties due to circumstances beyond their control, such as natural disasters, may be far as the banking system is concerned, I am informed lhat the Reserve Bank has been assured Percentage on many occasions that the trading banks give oftotal sympathetic consideration to requests for assisteachers teachers(b) tance from rural clients who because of natural disasters including drought, experience difiiculties in meeting repayments on bank loans. The Government is examining the need for reconstruction of rural industry, including as one 4 4.3 aspect of reconstruction, the question of pro26 28.9 ducers' indebtedness, and of ways in which the Commonwealth can most effectively assist. 30 16.3 Wheat (Question No. 1293) 8 8.S 7 7.8 Mr Collard asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: ., 15 8.2 (1) Has the Bureau of Agricultural Economics carried out over recent months any survey of a comprehensive nature into the effects which a reduction in the first advance payment on wheat would have on the economic situation in predominantly marginal wheat growing districts. (2) If so, what was the finding. (3) If no recent survey has been made, will he arrange for the Bureau to commence an immediate investigation; if not, why not.",58,Northern Territory Community Schools
174,Mr Anthony,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2). No. (3) A function of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics is to keep under continuing review and to report on factors affecting the position of primary producers in the light of changing economic conditions. For the wheat industiy one method of doing this is through its periodic surveys of the industry which it undertakes at fiveyearly intervals; the last of these was carried out in 1967 and on the normal timetable the next comprehensive review of the industry may be expected in 1972. However, other examinations of the _ wheat industry are carried out from time to time to assist governments and the industry in drawing up appropriate policy measures. As an example, the Bureau is currently carrying out, at my request, an investigation into the immediate and longer term needs for debt reconstruction and farm adjustment, 2 problems of particularrelevancefo many wheat growers in Australia. The Bureau's resources are necessarily limited The organisation is already under strain in meeting the various demands placed on it for research and there is a clear need for priorities to be established in carrying out its research and investigation programme. In tbe current situation it will be generally agreed that problems of debt reconstruction and farm adjustment have high priority and that other topics which may be impoitant in themselves, have to be put on one side foi the present. Given its limited resources and the relative priorities, the Bureau does not propose at per week he should, at the beginning of each this stage to embark on the survey referred to in the honourable member's question. Income Tax Returns (Question No, 1366) Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that under the Income Tax Assessment Act, (a) notice is published in the Commonwealth Gazette requiring every individual who is resident in Australia and whose taxable income from all sources in and out of Australia exceeds $416, to furnish an income tax return, (b) the Commissioner has the power, under section 163, to demand from any person an income tax return and (c) males over 65 years and females over 60 years are allowed tax free income of $1,300 for a single person and $2,262 for a married couple. (2) Will he give consideration to the granting of an exemption to these persons from the obligation to prepare a return of income, and will he take steps to see that notice is given that exemption from the lodgement of the returns is granted to aged persons whose income is within the exempt limits. member's question is as foUows: (1) (a) Yes. (b) Yes. (c) Mules over 65 years and females over 60 years are granted freedom from tax where the taxable income does not exceed $1,300 in the case of a single person and $2,262 for a married couple. In addition, reduced rates of tax apply to(i) a single taxpayer to whom the age allowance provisions apply where the taxable income is between $1,301 and $2,275; and (ii) a married taxpayer to whom the age allowance provisions apply where tbe combined taxable income of the taxpayer and dependent spouse exceeds $2,262 and the taxpayer's own taxable income does not exceed $4,121. (2) Where the income of an aged person falls within the lax free limits, he is advised by the Taxation Office that it will not be necessary to lodge returns of income in any future year unless(a) he is desirous of obtaining a refund of tax instalment deductions; (b) it becomes necessary as a result of changes in the age allowance provisions of tbe law or increases in the income of the taxpayer or spouse which result in the exemption levels being exceeded; or (c) he is requested to do so by the Taxation Office. The taxpayer is also advised that in order to avoid tax instalment deductions being made from salary, wages or pension received by him in excess of $8 year, lodge with the person paying such income an age allowance declaration form. Customs Duty (Question No. 1372) Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Customs and Excise, upon notice: (1) What amount of Customs duty was (a) paid by or (b) exempted in respect of specific industries associated with (i) caustic soda (ii) soda ash (iii) chlorine and (iv) related products in each of the last 5 years. (2) What percentage of duty-exempt caustic soda is used for alumina production. able member's question is as follows: (1) The Commonwealth Statistician has advised that information on the amount of Customs duty paid by, or exempted in respect of, specific industries is not available. However, he has supplied the following table showing imports cleared for home consumption by type of duty, of (0 liquid and solid caustic soda (sodium hydroxide), (ii) soda ash (sodium carbonate and sodium carbonate decahydrate) and (Ui) chlorine, for each of the years 1965-66 to 1969-70.",59,Northern Territory Administration Welfare Branch Schools
