That the bill fails to recognize or provide for the equal To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House rights and responsibilities ofboth parties to a marriage, such as are provided for in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including the fights of parents to choose the type of education they desire for their children. 3.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That whereas uranium found in vast quantities in Australia is the raw material for the nuclear fission reaction. And whereas presently assuredreservesof uranium in Australia represent a potential production of over 540,000 kilograms of Plutonium 239 if utilized in Light Water Reactors overseas, And whereas the Maximum Permissible Inhalation of Plutonium 239 is 0.00000025 gram, And whereas Plutonium 239 is one of the most dangerous substances human society has ever created, causing mutations and cancers, And whereas there are no methods of safety and absolutely confining Plutonium from the biosphere for the requisite quarter of a million years, And whereas Plutonium coming in contact with the air forms an aerosol cloud of micron-sized particles, its most dangerous form, And whereas the export of uranium may return to us an import of Plutonium particles dispersed in the global environment via the circulation of the atmosphere, And whereas there are no sure safeguards against the military use of nuclear fission, and the nuclear proliferation represents a prime environmental threat to all forms of life on the only earth available to us, And that it is therefore an act of self-preservation to deand this has a divisive effect in the Australian community. mand a halt to all exports of uranium exceptfor bio-medical uses. Your petitioners humbly pray that the members, in the House assembled, will take the most urgent steps to ensure: 1. That funher mining and expon of uranium from Australia except for bio-medical purposes be banned, 2. That the Australian Atomic Energy Commission be transformed by the rewriting of its charter into an Australian Energy Commission to funher the understanding of energy flows through our society and to promote national economic independence and self-sufficiency.

That there is no certainty that any significant benefits or indeed any benefits at all will follow the use of the new weights and measures. That the traditional weights and measures are eminently satisfactory. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Metric Conversion Act berepealed,and that the Government take urgent steps to cause the traditional and familiar units to be restored in those areas where the greatest inconveniences and distress are occurring, that is to say, in meteorology, ih road distances, in sport, in the building and allied trades, in the printing trade, and in retail trade. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, .by Mr Peacock Petition received. . Taxation: Education Expenses To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble peution of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:.' That the reduction of the allowable deduction of education expenses under Section 82J of the Income Tax assessment Act from $400 to $150 is $50.00 below the 1956-57 figure. That this reduction will impose hardships on many parents who have children attending school, whether nongovernment or government; and particularly on parents with more than one child at school. That thisreductionwill funher restrict the freedom available to parents to make a choice of school for their children. That some parents who have chosen to send their children to a non-government school will have to withdraw their children and send them to government schools already over crowded and under staffed. That the parents to benefit most relatively from educational income tax deductions, in the past and even more in the future,.are the parents of children in government schools That parents should be encouraged by the Australian government to exercise freedom of choice of the type of school they wish for their children. The proposed reduction means an additional nnanciai penalty is imposed on parents who try to exercise this choice and discourages them from making an imponant nnanciai contribution to Australian education over and above what they contribute through taxation. That an alternative system, a taxrebatesystem, could be adopted as being more equitable for all parents with children at school. To compensate for the losses that will follow from the proposed reduction and to help meet escalating educational costs faced by all families your petitioners most humbly pray",17,Petitions

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That whereas the Budget Paper No. 9 titled ""Australia's External Aid 1974-75"" allocated $150,000 for humanitarian assistance to National Liberation Movements in Africa; And whereas the humanitarian needs of these oppressed people require greater assistance from Australia than the above amount allocated in the budget; And whereas such assistance is in keeping with that provided by Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, The Netherlands, Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, and New Zealand, and United Nauons Organisations such as UNICEF, UNDP, UNHCR, FAO and WHO, and such non-Government organisations as the World Council of Churches, the Australian Freedom From Hunger Campaign, Community Aid Abroad, and some Roman Catholic Aid Agencies in Europe; So therefore your petiuoners most humbly pray that the Government will take action to increase substantially the above mentioned humanitarian assistance.

It would be unusual, of course, if there were not some officers and indeed some civilians within the Defence Department who did not express opposition to the reorganisation. But the great majority of the personnel of the Defence Department-serviceme n and civilians-hav e accepted the reorganisation. I have read some statements made by journalists which have suggested that Air Vice Marshal Hurditch had resigned and that his resignation would be followed by that of other officers. The suggestion that 2 admirals intend to resign has not been brought to my attention. What the honourable member should understand is that the situation has changed. It is now much easier for officers to resign under this Government than it was previously. As a result of the changes in the Defence Forces Retirement Beneiits legislation, an officer can now retire before what would have been his normal expiration of service and can receive his entitlement. ment, he could not do that. I have been asked the question: 'How much will he receive?' Naturally, I am not in the position to indicate nor would I want to indicate to the House how much Air Vice Marshal Hurditch will receive under the DFRB scheme when he retires. However, I can say to honourable members that under the legislation, as it now exists, an Air Vice Marshal with 34 years service would receive a pension of about $14,000 a year. But because there is automatic commutation, which again was provided under the DFRB legislation, an Air Vice Marshal in situation that exists today.

17,Mr Daly,"There are many strange names ofphrase, indicate that many members are having second thoughts about walking through this Valley of Death-eve n without the hot coals. In fact I would say that the honourable member for Wannon is now an unemployed fire walker. I can also confirm that he will not be burnt at the stake. Despite the statement made in regard to the Valley of DeathI notice today some news-it has been reported and I presume it is authentic-that there was a move to oust the Leader of the Opposition this morning. So evidently in addition to the honourable member for Wannon there are a number of others also who are no longer fire walkers. It has been put to me that we should make the Valley of Death a subdivision or an electorate as the case may be. It is quite topical because there is a redistribution on and the Government has the responsibility of naming electorates. What would be better than to rename the electorate of Bruce the Valley of Death? I would ask the Distribution Commissioners to consider that proposal but I am certain to receive great objection from the honourable member for Wannon who would no doubt contradict that point of view and possibly would want the change made to the name of his electorate. In any case.I thank the honourable member for the question. It is an appropriate one. As I say it is unfortunate at this stage that so many have so quickly lost their zeal to walk over those coals for one who can always be trusted. As the Leader of the Opposition said in his statement at the time his team recognised his political judgment and knew if he said 'it must be thus' on an issue, it was that. He said: They also trust what I will achieve for this country. Is it not regrettable that so many who a few weeks ago, as he said, would have walked over hot coals today had to be dragged in to support him and to bring him back to the realisation that the Valley of Death is not the place to fight political battles? BEEF EXPORTS ister representing the Minister for Agriculture. The Minister will recall an announcement by the Minister for Agriculture recently to the effect that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics had purchased some 10,000 tons of Australian beef. Since that time it has been reported that the sale has fallen through. I ask the Minister whether he is in a position to indicate whether the report is correct. If it is correct, why has the sale fallen through? Does the Government intend to take any action to try to rectify the disastrous position in which the meat industry finds itself today? the honourable member made, but I am unaware that the Minister for Agriculture made that announcement. I am aware that there were newspaper reports that a very significant sale of approximately 10,000 tons of beef had been made by Australia to Russia. I must say that when I read that report I was somewhat surprised. I knew that negotiations were going on, but to the best of my knowledge there still has been no contract for this sale. I understand that it is purely a commercial sale, involving Borthwicks and perhaps other export meat works, of a consignment of beef in the vicinity of 10,000 tons. The honourable member will probably also learn, as I have learned, that most of the beef will before-quarters. Anybody with any knowledge of meat export would know that sometimes there are technical problems in the sale of forequarters to specific countries. I shall go into the question more deeply, but as far as I can make out the negotiations are still proceeding. Apparently the matter got into the newspapers; how I do not know. I hope, as every other person in this Parliament and in the cattle industry hopes, that the negotiations are successfully finalised as quickly as possible. Prime Minister. In view of the comments made yesterday on conditions at Johns ConsoUdated Ltd in Victoria that the firm is crippled and is sacking men day after day, will the Prime Minister give the House the up-to-date facts on Johns, bearing in mind that yesterday's statement could cause Johns serious harm? the Opposition did make such an irresponsible and damaging reference in his speech yesterday. He was, not for the first time, right behind the times. I had the previous day referred the position of Johns to the Temporary Assistance Authority. The Government is assured that there will be no sacking at Johns Consolidated Ltd in view of the reference to the Temporary Assistance Authority. Members of the public dealing with Johns Consolidated Ltd or persons employed by it should have no qualms as to its future.

The new proposals do bear comparison with good, and the best, private schemes. I think it is important that in coming to a judgment in this matter the Parliament should have available to it the actual cost to the community and to the general taxpayer.

It is well known that the Government has taken a number of very active measures in recent times to release credit which should give substantial assistance to the building industry.

(The documents read as follows)The Honourable E. G. Whitlam, QC, M.P., Prime Minister, Parliament House, Canberra, A.CT. 2600. Dear Prime Minister, One matter discussed in the Commission's annual report was the relationship between the long term objectives of industry policy, which will require some structural changes within Australian industry, and the effects of cyclical fluctuaavailability of general measures to suppon the complementions on the economy's capacity to sustain structural change tary policies being developed to facilitate structural changes, (paragraphs 138 to 144). In particular, it drew attention to the fact that there will be certain times when the economy can more readily accommodate desirable structural changes. The economy is at present slack and unemployment high, by Australian standards. In this situation, workers and resources who may be displaced by decisions designed to induce structural changes cannot readily be absorbed in other activities. The Commission has therefore given further Commission referred to above should diminish. consideration to the question of timing in formulating its recommendations for long term assistance to industry. Three factors influence the extent of structural change that is possible at any time: the general level of activity in the economy; the general mobility of the community's resources; the availability of assistance to enable industries and individuals to adjust to change. As already noted, the current level of economic activity is slack by Australian standards. Moreover, the Government's mission would relate its recommendations to the economy's measures for adjustment assistance are still being developed. capacity to sustain the changes involved, but I welcome your The present, therefore, is not a suitable time for implementing significant structural changes-howeve r necessary such changes may be to improve the welfare of Australiansbecause the immediate cost would be further temporary disother than the state of the business cycle. In this connection, I ruption to employment and a resulting increase in deprivahave noted comments in the Annual Repon in relation to the tion for employees. The Commission believes that, in this situation, its recommendations should not add to the unemployment already evident in the economy. The Commission therefore proposes that, in the present situation, when it is considering recommending a long term encouraged into areas requiring lower levels of protection, level of assistance that would be likely to bring about important changes in employment within an industry, it will include in its report on the industry a supplementary recommendation-to apply in the short term. This supplementary recommendation wUI be designed to ensure that acceptance of the Commission's report would not add to any existing shon term employment difficulties in the industry concerned. recommendations for long term assistance to panicular industries are likely to have adverse effects on employment, only some of the Commission's repons will need to contain the types of supplementary recommendadons described above). One effect of this approach will be to separate short run considerations, arising from cyclical fluctuations in the economy, from the long run objectives of industry development policy. Issues of structural change will be dealt with in the basic long term recommendation. This will leave the Government free to deal with questions of long term assistance in a way which promotes the long term welfare of the community as a whole and in accordance with the industry assistance policy expressed in the Commission's statutory guidelines. It will also remove pressures which may otherwise develop to settle questions of long term assistance in response to the pressures arising from shon term changes in the economy. The Commissioner will, during the next several weeks, 18 November 1974 examine the repons it has signed and on which the Government has yet to decide-to identify any requiring supplementary recommendations on the grounds outlined above. As far as is possible within its commitments to deadlines set by the Government for completion of individual repons, it will also now give the highest priority to those inquiries it has on hand bearing directly on general assistance measures which will contribute to the long term objective of improving the quality and mobility of resources. These general measures were referred to in paragraph 147 of the Commission's annual repon. This will provide the Government with advice on the to ease their private adjustment costs, and to develop those low cost industries which contribute most to efficient use of the community's resources and, thus, its general welfare. As the machinery now being established by the Government to assist adjustment to structural change develops, the need for the type of supplementary recommendations by the Yours sincerely, G. A. RATTIGAN 24 November 1974 Dear Mr Rattigan, I refer to your letter of 18 November 1974 about the relationship of cyclical fluctuations in the economy to longer term industrial policies involving structural change. I understood from the approach to high cost industries outlined in the Commission's Annual Repon for 1973-74 that the Comreassurance that this is to be the case. The degree of change which is sustainable by particular social groups and locations is, of course, affected by factors possibility of containing, rather than significantly scaling down, some industries in the high cost area. For example, the thrust of paragraph 144 of the Annual Reort suggests that the Commission has in mind that new investment should be whilst measures would not be recommended which would have the effect of significantly scaling down those high cost",22,Industries Assistance Commission

Having in mind the balance which the Government must hold between the national welfare and the effect of changes on individual welfare, I should like more attention to be directed to this general approach which appears to provide a sound base upon which to encourage at a. manageable rate the greater efficiency, and with this the greater prosperity, of Canberra, A.C.T. 2600 Australian industry in the interests of the community as a whole. Whatever the stage of the business cycle, the Government needs the fullest information about the social and locational implications of the Commission's recommendations. The Government has not taken decisions on a number of reports including, for example, the Man-Made Fibre Fabrics report oflast January, because of its concern for the social and locational implications of the Commission's recommendations. I note that you have in mind re-examining during the next few weeks such reports to identify any supplementary recommendations which might be appropriate. Our consideration of these reports has progressed to such an extent that it would be undesirable to delay matters further, but if the Commission can provide supplementary recommendations quickly enough the Government will consider them. Reports which have yet to be submitted to the Government are in a different category. The Government's structural adjustment measures have been developed (loan guarantees being an exception only in still requiring legislation to be passed) and you have been fully informed of the Government's non-metropolitan subsidy scheme. Whilst helpful, these measures are not designed to meet changes in the business cycle; nor indeed can they necessarily be expected to meet all the problems, whatever the stage of the cycle, which might arise from a structural change seen as in the national interest by the Commission. The Commission therefore should not make recommendations for change-on the assumption that other measures available to the Government will necessarily allow their implementation without difficulty to the community. It would therefore be entirely appropriate, as has been inployment, the Commission has made supplementary recomdicated already through the questions directed to the Commission by SIDCAI on some recent reports, for the Commission to couch its recommendations against the background of the immediate social and locational changes which might follow from their implementation. I shall publish your letter as you suggested, and also my response. Yours sincerely, MrG. A. Rattigan, CBE., Chairman, Industries Assistance Commission, Kings Avenue, Barton A.CT. 2600 26 November 1974 The Hon. E. G. Whidam, QC, M.P., Prime Minister, Parliament House, Dear Prime Minister, I refer to my letter of 18 November and to your reply, which was delivered to my home on Sunday night. The Commission has examined the eleven reports on which the Government has not yet announced a decision, and has identified five as requiring supplementary recommendations on the grounds outlined in my letter of 18 November. These are: Woven Man-Made Fibre Fabrics 17 January 1974 Glass and Glassware 23 May 1974 Polyamide and Polyester Yarns 18 June 1974 Tyre Cord and Tyre Cord Fabrics 25 June 1974 Foundation Garments 28 June 1974 The areas covered by eachreportto which the supplementaryrecommendationsshould, in the Commission's opinion, apply in the short term-and the levels of duty (including Primage) which should apply-ar e set out in the attachment to this letter. The Commission's supplementary recommendations are intended to apply to the specific areas in each report where the implementation of its original recommendations may have adverse short term effects on employment. In assessing the possibility of such effects, the Commission has taken account, not only of the data available at the time of the reports, but also of more recent changes in the level of impons. In those cases where it considers there is even a slight chance of a repon having adverse shon term effects on emmendations. I has done this because it believes that, as far as is possible, its recommendations should not add to any existing unemployment in the industries concerned. The Commission recommends that, in relation to the tariff items (or pan of items) listed in the attachment, the rates of duty applying before 19 July 1973 should, with some minor rationalisations, be the basis for the supplementary assistance. In the case of flat glass it has also recommended that Developing Country preferences should not apply to impons from the Philippines and the Republic of Korea. It funher recommends that its supplementary recommendations should apply until 30 November 1975. Before that date, the E.G. Whitlam Commission will advise you concerning its views on their possible continuance. I am writing a separate letter to you today, on the general matters raised in your letter of 21 November.

There were no great discoveries of nickel or uranium in Germany or in Italy or in France. There was no mineral boom in those countries in 1972-73. I explained that this accounted for a good deal of the difference in rates. I am surprised that with his background the honourable gentleman is not aware of economic history as well as economics, because this is part of the economic history of every boom, and the character of the boom is given to it by the impetus from its sources.

65,Calder. S.e. Mr Mcleay (Boothby) (2.15),"The Oppospeech. It is not a matter of co-operation with the States; it is a matter of confrontation with the States. I refer to clause 7 of the Bill because if this is the Minister's idea of co-operation I must have made a terrible mistake in my understanding of that word. The clause states: A State shall,'Shall' is the very third wordat the request of the Minister, furnish him with such informafrom what the Prime Minister said later at a local tion as he requires in relation to the carrying out of a program approved under section 4. That does not indicate much co-operation; it indicates confrontation, pure and simple. I give notice at this stage of the debate, Mr Speaker, that in the other place we will be moving an amendment to clause 7 which will have the effect of making it possible for a State Minister at least to participate in discussions. We probably will add such words as: 'As he may reasonably require'-meanin g the Federal Minister. We expect the Federal Minister to be reasonable about the matter. The Opposiuon believes that the clause, as presently worded, is a typical example of the way in which the present Labor Government is introducing its socialist and centralist philosophies-wit h a sugar-coated pill. We do not have to look very far to find other examples of what I would describe as State government bashing. The Prime Minister( Mr ing. We would welcome the opportunity of being invited to Whitlam) and his Party policies confirm that the Labor Party stands for the complete destruction of State governments. I should like to quote to the House-especiall y as the great man is herefrom a book written by the Prime Minister called 'Labor and the Constitution', in which he referred to the Constituuon and the role of State members. The Prime Minister said: Much can be achieved by Labor members of the State Parliament in effectuating Labor's aims of more effective powers for the national Parliament and for local governThat is the view of the Western Australian Premment. Their role is to bring about their own dissolution. What could be clearer than that? The Prime Minister and his Government subscribe to the destruction, the dissolution, of local government and State governments. LaterI read an articleand I do not have the date of it-by the Labor Leader in the New South Wales Government in which he dealt with the quesuon of what would happen if Labor were in government in New South Wales. He indicated that his Party would appoint watchdogs-that is the expression he used-to take part in the planning of local government administration. Mr Wran said: A State Labor government would place government direct messages to the honourable member Tom Uren officers in local councils to act as watchdogs on their planM.H.R. expressing our opposition to the creation of statutory ning and administration. Does the Minister for Urban and Regional Development regard this as an indication of friendly co-operation or, to use his words, 'cooperative federalism'? Those are simply standover tactics. ism later. there is a delicate difference there. I quote briefly government assembly. He said: It is not true, as some persist in claiming that: 'It would be vinually impossible to make these changes now'He is talking about changes to the local government and State government systemand the real choice is between making a federal system work by giving the existing States the means to do their jobs, and starving the States into submission . . . Those are fairly direct words. The Prime Minister seeks to starve the States into submission. Quite frankly, these are the aspects of the Bill to which we object. I have sought the views of some of our colleagues in the State Parliaments and I quote now from what the Premier of Western Australia had to say about co-operative federalism. Sir Charles Court said: Our Government'sThat is the Western Australian Governmentexperience of co-operative federalism is that it is not workconsult as equals with the Commonwealth GovernmentSurely the second reading speech implies that this will happenin the formation of policy within which States and local government are expected to perform; in the creation of ground rules for the introduction of vanous programs. There is an urgent need for the Commonwealth Government to recognise our traditional constitutional responsibilities and act accordingly to ensure that the resource of people and material is not wasted as at present. ier. He went on to give his prescription of what should happen and we entirely endorse this. He said that at the moment there is a lack of cooperative federalism, yet the Minister says there is plenty. The Premier said that there is inadequate consultation through poor recognition of the part played by State and local governments. We know the Labor Party's view on this: He said there is duplication of effort and over-lapping of functions. We are reminded of this every day. Sir Charles Court went on to say: Because of the lack of real consultation, clear guidelines are not available and programs are not integrated.

I believe also that there is still a water problem in the factory itself. I would like to know whether the land at Zetland is suitable for housing. I make the point that these things would not happen if the Government consulted closely with the States and considered their views. I would suspect that the Leyland purchase is not constitutional. The Minister might like to tell us something about this.

The honourable member for Boothby ignores the fact completely that the mere fact that the Bill is before the House today is the result of strenuous efforts and complete co-operation between officers at State and local government levels and officers of the Department of Urban and Regional Development. It is obvious that as the spokesman in this place for the Opposition on studied the Bill and he has not given consideration to its provisions. I would say that he is not really concerned with its provisions and the assistance that it will give to local government and to the general standard ofliving in our communities. Of all people, he choose to cite the Premier of Western Australia as some sort of authority on co-operative federalism. The Premier of Western Australia could very well join, in that minority of Liberal-Country Party Premiers, with the Premier of Queensland in seeking to divide the Australian people-in seeking almost to want to create farmers republics or the re-erection of the State boundary fences-whe n it is in the real interests of the people of this nation that we ought to be developing as a nation, not as individual sections of a nation. As I said, it is a pity that the honourable member for Boothby chose to follow that course.

The financial measures contained in this BiU will do much to assist councils to carry out special projects of regional need and community value-project s that are long overdue and projects which local government authorities have been unable to finance in the past because of their limited capacity to raise revenue.

That is recognised in community standards and values in the past has our concept of regionalism and the approach to been that of State centralism-the Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane based State bureaucracies. One only has to ask anybody who is serving or who has served in local government in the past 25 years to get some account of that. In Newcastle we have been seeking for 6 years to get a decision from the New South Wales State Premier on the deepening of the bar at the Port of Newcastle where ships are lined up, 20 abreast, outside the Port of Newcastle waiting to load coal and wheat. We have the Country Party members opposite complaining about the sale into the harbour. The man responsible for a decision is a Liberal-Country Party State Premier. Under our constitution, local government is a creature of the States; rather, it is a captive of the States. Our approach to local government and regionalism and the ready acceptance of it by local government refutes the claims of centralism that are made against us. We have deUberately followed a course of making local government a vehicle for our legislation. This Bill represents another step along that road.

Again this is evidence that local government has taken the initiative itself, that it wants to be involved and that house them. it fully supports the efforts of this Australian Government. As I said earlier, the Opposition is labouring in tremendous challenge to everyone concerned. It the past if it tries to continue the misrepresentation that there is conflict between the State governments and the Federal Government in relation to the Department of Urban and Regional Development programs. Area improvement programs have long been a plank of Australian Labor Party policy. We seek to provide money for projects of a regional significance to the councils of the regions concerned and to help overcome the deficiencies from which the constituent councils suffer. I know that we have the full support of local government in our endeavours in this legislation. I commend the Minister for what he has been able to achieve thus far and I commend the Bill to the House. Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Bill 1974 has 3 major purposes. Firstly, it allows the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Uren), in'consultation with the State Ministers, to approve programs of urban and regional development. Secondly, it provides that the Australian government may agreeI presume that it does not have to agree-wit h the State governments upon thefinancialassistance to be provided for expenditure by the State or an approved body in that State for approved programs. Thirdly, it provides that all agreements made with the States under this legislation be tabled in the Parliament. This Bill and its purposes have a particularly strong significance for the electorate I represent, namely Indi, as they relate to the provision of finance for the Albury Wodonga complex. The Wodonga section of the growth centre complex is in my electorate. Of course, the Albury-Wodonga area was expanding and progressing very soundly and quite quickly before it was decided to make it a growth centre. In 1971 the population of the designated area Wodonga in half. Failure to re-locate that Melwas 54,841 people and there were 16,000 dwellbourne-Sydney railway line has constituted a ings. The 1974 count shows 59,570 people and disgrace to all governments over the years. The 17,800 dwellings. So the population has Albury-Wodonga growth centre concept is a increased by nearly 5,000 and the dwellings by worth-while exercise in principle. The growth 1,800 in those 3 years. The target for the area by centre idea is not new to the world; it has been the year 2000 is 300,000 people. This means that in 25 years about 241,000 more people will have to be provided for in the area and about an extra 60,000 to 75,000 dwellings will have to be provided. My calculations indicate that approximately 10,000 people will have to settle or be settled in the area each year and between 2,500 and 3,000 dwellings will have to be erected to The achievement of these targets presents a appears that the responsible authorities face a monumental task to complete the program successfully. When one looks at the wide variety of manpower, resources and materials that will be required it seems that an extraordinary effort will have to be successfully mounted. Consideration of some of the other basic requirements-that is, apart from people and dwellings-whic h need to be met as the growth centre develops illustrates the magnitude of the task in front of the governments concerned and the individual people involved. I shall briefly list a few of them. The project means we will have to build a town the size of Wangaratta every 2 years. Thousands and thousands of jobs will have to be provided, and at present of course unemployment, particularly in Albury, is at a very serious level. The growth rate of Canberra will have to be exceeded. As I mentioned, the new population will have to be attracted and obviously the people will have to have jobs. Then there are all the other associated facilities which will be needed, such as hospitals, schools-hig h schools, primary schools and preschools-provisio n for the intellectually handicapped. I hope that the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation will give every possible assistance to the Murray Valley Centre for Intellectually Handicapped Children which was recently granted a lease on what was Army land. The organisauon has done a wonderful job and I am sure that the Development Corporation will give it every assistance. The area will also need health centres, shops, office accommodation, hotels, social planning counselling, recreation facilities, roads, an airport, houses and serviced land. Another important matter that must be attended to is the removal of the railway line which crosses the Hume Highway and cuts",34,Assistance Bill 1974
93,Mr Holten (Indi) (2.54),"The Urban andimplemented in other countries with various degrees of success. However, it is relatively new to Australia. Therefore, Albury-Wodonga must be viewed as somewhat of an experiment as well as a much-needed attempt to slow down the growth of our capital cities and to increase the population of Australia in non-metropolitan areasa factor that the Australian Country Party has supported and fought for over the years. One of the unique and difficult problems for Albury-Wodonga, in my opinion, is that the development involves the Commonwealth Government and 2 State governments. The territory to be developed is in 2 States. There are differences in legislation and conditions between these States on vital matters. I shall not cover them all, but some of the vital ones are education, health, transport, law, food supply and hospital administration. It will certainly be most interesting to see how these problems can be overcome in practical terms as the development progresses. I cannot entirely get rid of a feeling of concern that there is and will be too much government control and planning in the Albury-Wodonga growth centre. The major reason which leads me to develop this feeling of concern is the commitment to socialism which the Government has. Every member of the Australian Labor Party in this Parliament has pledged himself to support and to achieve the socialisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange-in other words government control of everything and everybody. People should know and remember that to the Labor machine which really controls the Parliamentary Party, government control means control by one government from one central place, and, if achievable, by one Party entrenched in government by electoral manipulation. To support this statement. I quote what the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) said in the House in answer to a question on 20 November, last week. He said: Of course I have signed the Australian Labor Party's pledge whenever I have sought to be its candidateThe pledge to which he referred is the one I mentioned, advocating and supporting socialisation. The Prime Minister elaborated, saying that he will support the achieving of Labor's objectives by establishing or extending public enterprises where appropriate, by nationalisation, particularly in thefieldsof banking, consumer finance, insurance, marketing, housing, stevedoring, transport and in areas of anti-social private monopoly. That policy cannot be divorced from the development of the Albury-Wodonga growth centre. On the subject of government control there are many expressions of worry regarding the future administration and administrative arrangements of the Albury-Wodonga growth centre. I quote the heading of the 'Border Morning Mail' of Friday, 8 November, which reads: 'Hamer Rebukes Planners for ""Solo"" Stand'. This refers to the administration. I do not say that I support what Mr Hamer said; I merely use this as an example of the concern that is felt in Albury Wodonga about the administration and administrative arrangements. I stress that these comments are not made in criticism of the personality of the members of the administration so much as in criticism of the administrative machinery. I stress that any statements I make here or elsewhere in no way reflect or are intended to reflect on the persons who are working towards the development of Albury-Wodonga. Naturally in any undertaking like the Albury Wodonga project there will be clashes of personality and differences of opinion, but it is the principles and the administrative set-up and the financial arrangements which must be examined continually and reviewed and revised if it is found necessary so to do. One major aspect that should be watched is the set-up and authority of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation and the method of decision-making as the program progresses. It has been suggested to me that a major weakness in the present set-up is that the same people are making policy, implementing policy and checking that the policies have been carried out. It may be found that it will be more practical to change the structure and responsibilities of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation as time goes on. All kinds of suggestions have been made. One particularly worthy of consideration is that a much larger and more representative board of management could be appointed. This board would meet regularly and receive reports from a small number of paid executive officers. The effect of this move would possibly be to give the general public and local government a more effective say in the complex. It is felt that the consultative council which exists at the moment is not quite doing the job that it was meant to do in the sense that it does not have enough bite, enough say, enough authority, enough influence in thedecisions that are being taken and implemented. The claim has been made that most people favour the growth centre plan. A survey by the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation published on 5 November in the Melbourne 'Age' indicated that 65 per cent of the people generally accepted the area as a growth centre. This anicle states: The survey, carried out by the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation, clashes with the result of a skilled survey conducted by fifth form students at Wodonga Technical School. In the results of that survey, 64.2 per cent of the 820 disabout the moving of the municipal saleyards. trict people interviewed were against accelerated growth in The Minister will be able to discuss this matter at their areas.

98,Mr Clayton (Isaacs) (3.12),"I welcomewhat Opposition speakers have said this afternoon, the work that is being carried out is being done by the States in co-operation with the Australian Government. It seems quite absurd to me to sit here and to listen to honourable members opposite criticising this Government for overcentralisation and having too much control over these projects. I wonder what would happen if we were to say to the States: 'Here is a cheque for so many hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Department of Urban and Regional Development. Do what you like with it. We are not going to ask any questions. You need not tell us what you have done with it.' I am sure that there quickly would be cries of rage about lack of responsibility on our part if we did not make sure that the States were answerable to us for the way in which they spent our money in the same way as Ministers are answerable to the Parliament for what they are doing. I want to see this Bill passed quickly and the money made available to the States. There are 2 matters which I wish to mention. One concerns the Land Commission program. I welcome the money which is being made available to the Victorian Government for the acquisition of land on the Mornington Peninsula. The city of Melbourne relies most heavily on this area for its recreational activities at weekends throughout the year. People not only from Victoria but also from many other parts of AustraUa rely on this area for their recreational activities during the summer period. It is refreshing to note that the Australian Government is taking an interest in reserving these areas for the use of the Australian public. The other matter is the national sewerage prodiaUoc Creek, the Patterson River and the gram. It is most regrettable that such a program Kananook Creek. Through this BUl we are also is needed. It is regrettable that, in the past, the providing about $3m to the sewerage authorities State governments have not been able for one on the fringe of the metropolitan area, such as reason or another to keep up with the provision the Dandenong Sewerage Authority. of sewerage services to the community, particularly in the larger cities, and that previous Australian governments have not seen the assistance effect that this sewerage program will have on of the States in this work as part of their function. the quality of life in the bayside suburbs, except The Australian Government that came into office to mention that I know one local government in 1972 has realised the need for a crash program authority which will welcome the news of the of sewerage works to reduce the backlog in the provision of this money-the MordiaUoc Council. provision of sewerage works in the major cities. It has underway at present a study for a program At a later stage this program will doubdess be to upgrade the land abutting the MordiaUoc expanded to other rural centres. Port Phillip Bay is pan of the recreational area recreational reserve for the use of Melbourne to which I alluded earlier in reference to residents if the waters of the creek on which the Mornington Peninsula. It is a necessary part of projected program is centred remain polluted. that recreational complex. It is a crying shame There is little that the MordiaUoc CouncU itself and a sad reflection on our society that that area can do about the actual pollution in the creek, of water which could be such an asset to the community is so polluted because of the lack of sewerage systems particularly in the eastern and south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. The Parliament and the population should be aware that improvements in the quaUty of the water of Port Phillip Bay wUl be helped by the sewerage programs which will be able to proceed in the bayside suburbs because of assistance provided by the Australian Government. Not only work in these areas wUl help to improve the quality of water in Port Phillip Bay, but the work in a large proportion of the eastern and south-eastern suburbs wUl also assist because the whole of the Dandenong Valley Authority area drains into Port Phillip Bay. If poUution from septic tanks and drainage easements gets into various creeks in their upper reaches, this pollution is carried ""down and compounded as other pollution gets into the creeks as they progress towards the Bay. The Dandenong VaUey Authority area contains suburbs as far away from the beaches of Port Phillip Bay as Ringwood and Berwick. It also includes suburbs such as Sandringham and parts of Moorabbin and Cranbourne. It is not only the immediate bayside suburbs of Chelsea, MordiaUoc and Sandringham which affect the quality of waters in the MordiaUoc Creek and Patterson River. In the last nnanciai year, 1973-74, the Australian Government provided $4.8m for sewerage works in the cities of Chelsea, Moorabbin, Springvale and Dandenong. It is expected that a large proportion of the money being made available to the Melbourne and MetropoUtan Board of Works this year wUl go into works in the areas which I have just mentioned-the areas which are drained by the MorI do not wish to expand any further on the Creek within its municipality. But this work wUl not achieve its aims of providing an attractive because, as I have already indicated, most of the pollution comes from further upstream and it is far too late once the water gets into the city of MordiaUoc's jurisdiction for the Council to be able to do much about it. So for its program to go ahead meaningfully and for it to be effective in its final aim, this sewerage money needs to be spent. I do not wish to take up any more time of this House, except again to express my wholehearted support for this Bill. to suppon this Bill and the contributions that within those regions.

But there are major advantages in regional planning which I believe should be retained without being the fourthtierof Government.

It would be impossible for any government to begin them now, I ask the Minister whether he could perhaps give us some indication as to when development of these other areas is expected to commence. I also question the wisdom of providing going a 40 per cent subsidy which the growth centres in certain areas when we perhaps Queensland Government was providing.

RecentlyI had an opportunity of talking to completion of the program depends upon people concerned with land development and whether the State governments and local they informed me that in some locations the authorities can afford to find the remainder of this large sum of money. I welcome the 30 per cent non-repayable grant which is provided under this Bill. The remainder has to be repaid by local government over 40 years at the bond rate. I know that there was quite a deal of criticism by this Government of local authorities for not taking up sewerage loans which were available. I inform the Minister that in Queensland a shire in my electorate which had the offer of money took up some of that money. But at that stage before the 30 per cent non-repayable grant was available that shire was forMrM c KENZIE (Diamond Valley) gram which the Government has laid down in 2 a non-repayable grant. This is important because municipalities which control sewerage programs and sewerage authorities in the major capital cities need assistance to overcome the backlog which has built up over the years. Most contained in this legislation are I point out to the House that land development development of each block of land costs about $8,000. As a community we will have to look very carefully at the way in which we develop areas of land for housing and for development generally. One of the things that I hope will result from the land commissions and the development of land for residential purposes is that people will caster and surrounding areas will make very be persuaded to give serious consideration to high density living. A quarter-acre block or a one-fifth acre block with a house on it has become the ideal of most people. I suggest to honourable members that this is not necessarily the best form of urban living and that it is possible, by the use of cluster housing, town houses andflatsof various sorts, to make the best possible use of land and to make it much less expensive from the point of view of the development costs of both roads and service connections. It will also provide a much more pleasant type of living. Areas of open space in which children can play can often be built into such areas. I am pleased that this Bill follows the Government's stated intention of making money available for land commissions because I think it is up to public authorities to set a lead in this field. I am also pleased that money has been made ary facilities in country areas to make life available under the National Estate program. pleasant there, and that we provide the necessary Australians are coming to realise that there are health and education facilities in areas such as many valuable buildings and many open space Geelong, Wangaratta and many other places in areas of interest in this country that need to be the various States.

Although it is not possible to make as much money available as many of us would like, this is a considerable increase on the expenditure last year. In my own electorate Schramm's cottage was preserved by a grant last year. I am sure that the people of the Dongood use of this link with the past. The stated intention of the legislation is to make our cities more pleasant places in which to live. As a community we are coming to realise much more that we can design cities which are pleasant. Albury-Wodonga is important-as are Monarto and other placesbecause it leads the way. I hope to see many more cities developed in the future. If Albury-Wodonga is a success-it gives every indication that it will be, and the cooperation of the New South Wales and Victorian Governments with the Australian Government leads one to believe that this is so-in the future we will see many more cities both on the State borders and within the various States. The money that has been made available to growth centres is also very important. We must make sure that we do not become a country of huge metropolitan areas, that we provide the necessWe also need to look at the possibility of developing new designs for cities that take very gratified to be able to participate in this very important debate. It is important because all the members of this Parhament approach it with a very high degree of sincerity. Nobody can live in a community and not be concerned about the people who live around him and the needs and aspirations of that community. I was pleased that the honourable member for Diamond Valley mind those people who were concerned about the cost of land and the cost of developing land. I too was concerned at these costs and the difiiculties that young people in my own electorate and throughout Sydney experience in buying land. Nobody doubts the sincerity of the honourable member for Diamond Valley in looking for a solution. Nobody doubts the sincerity of the Minister. However, one can doubt the methods they seek to adopt to achieve desirable objectives. Earher in the debate it was pointed out that everybody is aware of the need to make our federal system work. The Minister certainly went to great lengths and, in fact, one would wonder if he was ever a centralist when one reads the paragraphs contained in his speech. delightful phrase. Additionally, the Minister speaks of co-operative federalism. Every member in this House ought to want to make federalism work. I doubt that that is the intention of the Government. Notwithstanding the willingness of the Minister to accept from the Opposition a proposed amendment which, I believe, was necessary because the particular provision imposed onerous conditions upon States and local government authorities, I do not accept that federalism is being made to work effectively when one looks at the scheme of things. I refer to the honourable member for Diamond Valley because he saw the method by which the cost of land to young people could be lowered as the creation of another government organisationa further administrative expense. He mentioned that the most important aspect of the increased cost of land was, in most instances, the cost of development. I point out to honourable members the cost to this community of the duplication that is occurring with the Department of Urban and Regional Development on the one hand and, on method adopted to deal with these problems, is the other hand, with other departments which that at the moment notwithstanding all these work in this area. I went to the trouble of going grants, local government and State governments through Appropriation Bill (No. 1)I am not with limited access to funds cannot do the jobs going to speak to that Bill-and thefiguresare that they are now required to do. Councils are very telling. The cost of administration-that is in required to put up rates to enable them to carry terms of salaries and expenses and in terms of the Cities Commission which also operates in this area-to the Australian community is some $8,058,000. There are other service departments that are supposed to operate on a co-operative federalist basis and on behalf of which the Department of Urban and Regional Development previously made grants. They include the Department of the Environment and Conservation whose administrative costs alone amount to $2,730,000. Similarly, the Department of Tourism and Recreation operates in this area. It is supposedly a co-operative federalist depanment. Its cost of administration is $1,521,000. The cost of administration for the Council for the Arts, which is under the Prime Minister's Department, is $2m. That is a sum total of $ 14m that could be available to fulfil urgent needs if we did not have to have another set of depanments sitting on top of States and local governments and telling them how the job has to be done. But that is not the only cost. There is also the cost of local government and State governments having to supply information. I was in Parramatta the other day when 3 Commonwealth cars drove past me, one after the other, each containing six officers, or perhaps only four, sitting in comfort, who were leaving the local city council chambers. It would not surprise me if they were from the Department of Urban and Regional Development soliciting additional information to enable the Department to fulfil its functions. Local government officers, the mayor, the aldermen and the town clerk, have to make their time and the time of their officers available to deal with these matters, whereas if they simply received a grant they would be able to make the decisions themselves. If they have to be consulted on a matter why not let them make the decisions? These, then, are cost aspects, but not all of them. As I pointed out in the Estimates debate, there are the costs now being imposed on the community of so-called education-$450,00 0 to tell the Australian people that another department, superimposed upon all the State instrumentalities, is in fact spending their money in a proper way, and what a great and wonderful job it is doing. I cannot accept such expenditure. This is extravagance, and extravagance that we do not need and cannot afford. The problem we have, and it gets down to the",41,Assistance Bill 1974

Most of them have found it very difficult to raise loan moneys as a result of the credit squeeze. Some councils are having to consider putting off employees. The MetropoUtan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board is having to consider putting off employees because it cannot raise the money in the money markets in Australia that it was previously able to raise to meet its obligations. When we start robbing Peter to pay Paul, which is what the Government is doing, this ought to be pointed out to the Australian community. All these grants that are being provided are not even making up for the deficiency that exists when the councUs and the Water Board cannot raise the money to carry out their projects. In his second reading speech the Minister acknowledges that State governments and local government authorities have expertise in these areas. He pointed out that State Ministers have made significant contributions in the application of programs. He went further and said: We are not imposing a grand design on the States. If the objective of the Department is not to has met the needs of the western suburbs. The impose a grand design for some overall scheme Minister attempted to tell me when I saw him of things, what is its objective? I put it that that privately on this matterI hope that I am not statement was incorrect so far as the Minister is breaching any privilege; on this occasion I think concerned although it ought to be correct so far that I am not erring-that the grant of $5m as I am concerned and, I believe, so far as included grants for tourism and recreation and members of the Opposition are concerned, begrants for the CouncU for the Arts.

Until he advances a program which is going to include job incentives and certainty of emon sewerage. The Minister referred to sewerage ployment for people working in decentralised in his speech. He indicated that the Governareasa program for overcoming communiment's intention was to provide all new homes cation difficulties to make it easy for people to be with sewerage by the end of 1982.

Although a program is set out later in the Minister's speech, and mention is made of the expenditures in New South Wales and in each of the other States, there is nothing to indicate that the Minister has such a policy or program to overcome the difiiculties I have just mentioned. I want to deal with one other matter on which I had the opportunity to have private discussions with the Minister after I had made certain aUegations that the grants to the western suburbs made under the area improvement scheme had been reduced. I received a note from the Minister the other day which indicated that the western region of Sydney was now to receive only $2m. Of course, honourable members wUl recall that the western suburbs received in excess of $5m in the last financial year under the area improvement program. Great play has been made by this Government of the way in which it I have taken the trouble to go through the western suburbs. AlthoughI could find mention of community centres and so on, I could not see Finally, I would like to say a few brief words respects. The Prime Mimster( Mr Whitlam) in his original policy statement said that all homes and all premises would be sewered by 1978. This date has been extended by 4 years. The provision of sewerage has also been limited to new homes. The Minister will well know that under secuon 34(b) of the New South Wales Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board Act developers are required to make a contribution for sewerage reticulation and amplification. In other words, all new land and new homes in Sydney have to be sewered anyway. Therefore the glib promise that these homes will be provided with sewerage by 1982 is quite unrealistic. I would like the Minister to be able to reiterate that the Government will attempt to meet its initial undertakings. Of course, most of us recognise that the undertakings were quite specious, they could not be met and they were quite unrealistic and not thought out. after this speech. that what the honourable member has just said is cent is made avaUable at the long term Comknown around the Parramatta area.

108,"Boothby ( Mr Mcleay), The Opposition Spokes","member for Parramatta seems to show little understanding, I point out that the area improvement program is part and parcel of the attitude which I have just expressed because we seek from the people what they want. All the area improvement programs that we have brought forward have stemmed from the people at the grass roots level. The honourable member for Boothby( Mr We have an agreement with the Victorian McLeay) who is the spokesman for the Opposition on this matter said that I had been tough with the States; that I had put a hard hand down and that there was no real spirit of co-operation between the Federal and State governments. I want to intimate that in the short term that the Federal Government has been working with the State governments many agreements have been worked out. Such agreements can only be worked out by co-operation. We have an agreement with the States on financial assistance for national sewerage works. Every State has agreed to work on the basis of that agreement. I might say that in respect of sewerage we inherited an awful mess from the previous Government. We inherited a situation in the city of Perth in which half of the city was unsewered. This is in the 1970s. Every one in six people living in Sydney and Melbourne were living in unsewered homes when we came to office. The real cost-o n present day costs-of catching up with the sewerage backlog is about $3,800m. It will take approximately 10 years to wipe out that backlog. The real reason relates to the pressures on resourcesofVictoria and New South Wales. They allowed men and materials. The Federal Government has agreements with the States on financial assistance for the nauonal estate. What was happening to our national estate before we came to office? It was being destroyed by the bulldozer mentality of the former Government. But a new government, with new thoughts, is doing something about it. We are working with the State governments in a spirit of co-operation. Further, we have an agreement with the New South Wales and Victorian governments on the development of Albury Wodonga. This will be the first major growth centre in Australia's history. We have an agreement with South Australia on the development of Monarto. We have an agreement with the Victorian Government on the establishment of an urban land council. We have an agreement with South Australia on the establishment of a State lands commission. We have an agreement with New South Wales and Victoria on area improvement programs. We have an agreement with Victoria on Emerald Hill. What would have happened to Emerald Hill had we not been the Government? Because of the positive action taken by an Australian Government which said: 'Let us work in co-operation with the State Government of Victoria and the South Melbourne City Council to save Emerald Hill', Emerald Hill was saved. There is now a rehabilitation of that old townscape which is well over 100 years old. Government on the south-eastern sector of Melbourne. What does the south-eastern sector of Melbourne mean? It means the Mornington Peninsula which was being raped by the developers; it means the Dandenongs which, again, were being raped. Again, we indicated that we would work with the Victorian Government to preserve these areas. We have an agreement, in principle, with the Victorian Government to develop a new growth area in Geelong. We have a joint steering committee for the redevelopment of Woolloomooloo. These agreements are just the beginning of the actions taken by this Government. The only way we can achieve such programs is by a spirit of co-operation. I should like briefly to answer the points raised by the honourable member for Indi( Mr Holten) in relation to financial arrangements. The honourable member for Indi complained that the Government should do something about the debt situation in Albury-Wodonga. The backlog of the municipal services in that city was basically the responsibility of the State governments them to get into a deplorable state. One can certainly pass the buck from those State governments back to the previous Federal Government because during the 23 years in which the Opposition was in government the internal debt-the servicing debt-of this nation remained approximately the same. The debt of the States increased about sevenfold; the debt of local government increased 2,000 per cent; and the debts of semi-government authorities increased 2,800 per cent. Of course, Albury-Wodonga is a part of that local government debt structure. This Government has tried to prepare Albury Wodonga as a growth centre by making moneys available. The honourable member for Indi said that the Government is making loan money and not grant money available. In the first year we made available $800,000 to the Wodonga Shire and a little more than $lm to the Albury Shire. Onethird of the money made available was grant money-interes t free and non-repayable-and two-thirds was loan money on a long-term bond rate repayable over 30 years. In relation to the money made available for land acquisition in the do that. I do not think there will be any further development area the nnanciai terms arranged need to discuss any other clauses of the Bill. were that repayments of principal would be deferred for 10 years and then would be paid during the last 20 years of the loan.

State governments. It has been agreed that we should finish this House much longer. There has been, generally, a third time. acceptance of this Bill by honourable members. The spokesman for the Opposition on this matter indicated in his second reading speech that the Opposition intended to move an amendment to this Bill in the Senate.

This has meant that the organisations have had to direct funds to meeting the deficit which otherwise may have been used to expand their accommodation facilities and the services they offer.

113,Mr Hayden (Oxley,"Minister for SocialThe existing private health insurance scheme authorised by the National Health Act, in fact, is a system supported by extremely generous direct and indirect subsidy from the Australian Government and State governments. The health benefit organisations could not have grown to their present significance nor could they continue to operate, except for the very generous suppon that comes from Government sources, directly and indirectly. For instance, on average over 60 per cent of the cost of medical services covered by medical insurance is met by direct subsidy from the Australian Government through the health insurance scheme and by indirect subsidy from the same source through tax concessions, which of course are a cost borne by the Government. In the case of private ward treatment in a public hospital, for instance in New South Wales, the fee charged to the patient is currently $39 per day. However, the average bed-day cost of a public hospital bed in that State is estimated to be at least $60 a day. Clearly there is an explicit direct subsidy here and similarly from Australian Government sources there is a $2 bed-day subsidy paid directly to insured patients, special account subsidies which average approximately $4.50 a day over all patients, plus an indirect subsidy available through the taxation system when hospital fund contributions and net fees are claimed as a concessional deduction. The overall effect is that governments, that is Australian and State governments, are meeting in excess of 60 per cent of the average private ward treatment of a patient in a public hospital in New South Wales. Therefore it is clearly in the interests of the people of Australia that the sysAct, ultimately the only course of action availtem of a private health insurance scheme should be properly supervised by the Australian Government and it is the clear responsibility of the Government to exercise this supervision. The most important provisions in the Bill, are designed to enable the responsible Minister to exercise more effectively this supervision of the operations of the health benefits organisations registered under the National Health Act in a way that will enable the Government of the day to achieve its objectives. The present Government recognises, as have previous governments, the need for additional measures in this regard. There was established the Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance, the Nimmo Committee, which presented its repon during 1969 and the Senate also set up its own committee to inquire into medical and hospital costs. At that time a matter of major concern was the financial policies followed by some of the health benefits organisations. 16729/74-R-( 108) Another matter of concern was that hospital and medical benefits should be more closely related to the fees being charged for hospital and medical services. Following consideration of the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance, amendments to the National Health Act were introduced by the previous Government aimed at rectifying some of the unsatisfactory aspects of the health insurance scheme including the two I have already mentioned. The previous Government also announced that it would sponsor additional measures of the nature of those included in this Bill. The then Minister for Health, the Honourable A. J. Forbes, in his address to the House dated 4 March 1970, made the following statement: In addition to the new measures which 1 have just mentioned, the Government is considering the introduction of legislation providing for penalties to be imposed on funds' officers for serious neglect of their responsibiliues, and enabling the replacement of funds' officers by appointed managers in certain circumstances, as proposed in the Nimmo Committee's recommendation 37. Recommendation 37 of the Nimmo Committee to which Dr Forbes referred reads as follows: That organisations and their officers be subject to penalties for any failures to comply with the conditions imposed by and under the National Health Act. The relevant paragraphs of the Nimmo Committee Repon are 14.15 to 14.18 and I would refer all honourable members to those findings of the Nimmo Committee. It was recognised by the previous Government, and it has caused concern to me, that where an organisauon does not comply with the Act, or actions taken under the able is to cancel the registration of the organisation. This is a most unsatisfactory punitive measure as the penalty falls on the contributor who is deprived of AustraUan Government benefits. Furthermore, deregistration would effectively end any control the Australian Government could exercise over reserves. This could, in certain circumstances, be a most unhappy situation for contributors whose money has, in fact, been accumulated in reserves if, for instance, a deregistered fund no longer required to administer its affairs responsibly in the interest of contributors at the direction of the Australian Government, could direct that reserve money into some other commitment which bore no benefit for contributors and over which they had no influence or in which they held no equity. It should be borne in mind, however, that deregistration is the least preferred option. The trouble at the moment is that there are no other options and in an extreme case of a private fund flouting the reasonable directions of Government, nothing but this extremely punitive and unsatisfactory measure is really available to Government, if it wishes to ensure that funds properly discharge their responsibilities to contributors. Following careful consideration of this situation, the Government has framed provisions similar to those in the Insurance Act to protect the interests of contributors which are compatible with the intentions of the previous Government as made clear in the statement by the then Minister for Health. This Government also beUeves these to be proper measures which should be included in Federal legislation relating to aspects of private insurance to ensure that the administration of such insurance arrangements can be adequately supervised in the interests of contributors. The Bill includes provisions to enable the Minister, where he believes it to be in the contributor's interests, to request an organisauon to show cause why it should not be investigated in relation to specified matters. Where the organisation fails to satisfy the Minister, and he beUeves it to be in the contributor's interests, he may appoint an inspector to conduct an investigation into specified matters relating to the affairs of the organisation. The BUl further provides that after he has considered the report of the inspector, the Minister may take such action consistent with the Act as he considers appropriate. This may include making an application to the Australian Industrial Court for the appointment by the Court of ajudicial manager to manage the affairs of the fund or for the fund to be wound-up by the Court. Provision is included in the Bill to require ajuunder the National Health Act-so recommends. dicial manager, appointed by the Court, to conduct the affairs of the fund with the greatest economy consistent with efficiency and to report to the Court, as soon as possible, as to the course of action to be taken in relation to the fund. This could include recommendations to return the fund to its former management, to transfer aU or part of its affairs to another organisation with the consent of the other organisation, or that the fund be wound-up. The BUl provides for funds to be wound-up under the supervision of the Court upon an application and in accordance with a scheme submitted by the Minister, the judicial manager or the organisation conducting the fund. All schemes for winding-up are to be subject to confirmation by the Court which may vary the schemes. The Court is required where practicable to effect the transfer of contributors to a fund to be wound-up to a fund conducted by another registered organisation. As I stated earlier, the arrangements I have outlined are along the Unes of arrangements provided for in the Insurance Act and I believe all honourable members wUl welcome their enactment as a positive step forward in the protection of the interests of contributors to health benefits funds. The BUl also contains provisions to provide greater flexibility as to the manner in which reserves of medical and hospital funds may be utilised. There has been some controversy recently regarding the reserves of funds and it will be to the general advantage of both the funds and the Government if the rigidity at present contained in the Act regarding the reserves is removed. The rigidity arises mainly from sections 67 and 68 of the present Act which provide that the reserves must remain in the fund which has accumulated them and cannot be used for any other purpose, not even to support some other fund of the organisation that is also registered under the National Health Act. To quote an actual example, the reserves of the hospital fund of a leading organisation in Victoria stand at the equivalent of 6.4 months contribution income, whereas the reserves of the medical fund of the same organisation stand at a deficit equivalent to 2.4 months contribution income. Surely it would be a sensible approach to follow if the excess reserves in the hospital fund could be transferred to remove the deficit balance in the medical fund. The BUl provides therefore that an organisation wUl be permitted to apply to the Minister for the transfer of reserves from one registered fund to another registered fund. It also provides that the Minister may direct the transfer of reserves in this way where the Registration Committee-the expert Committee estabUshed There is an allied provision that concerns the special accounts operated within medical and hospital funds by registered organisations. These special accounts, which are authorised by Part VI Division2 of the National Health Act, ensure that contributors continue to receive medical and hospital fund benefits which otherwise they would be denied by the pre-existing, chronic or maximum benefit rules of the organisation restricting the payment of fund benefits. The Government has been very concerned at the tremendous rate of escalation of the cost of these special accounts. For medical and hospital funds combined, Government expenditure on them has risen from $22m in 1970-71 to $55m in 1973-74. The estimated expenditure on special accounts in the current financial year is $77m and this must be revised upwards due to substantial increases in hospital charges. This escalation in Government spending arising from underwriting the activities ofhealth benefits funds through the special account mechanism has occurred at the time when there were extremely large reserves accumulated by the funds. It has now reached the stage where overall 20 per cent of hospital fund benefits are met by the Government through the special account and, to quote an example, Government expenditure is now almost one-third of the expenditure of one of the major funds on hospital fund benefits. The special accounts machinery provides a hidden subsidy to medical and hospital benefits funds and the structure of the legislation is such that the system can be manipulated to the advantage of organisations. Of course, most organisations do use the special account machinery in a . responsible fashion. But I am concerned that not all approach it in this way. For example, the fund benefits paid from the special accounts for the medical and hospital funds operated by the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia in Queensland increased from $672,000 in the period July 1971 to September 1971 to $1,664,000 in the period April 1974 to June 1974. Further, the number of contributors transferred to the medical and hospital special accounts of that organisation increased from 277 and 218 respectively in the period July 1971 to September 1971 to 930 and 790 respectively during the period April 1974 to June 1974. It must be realised that the special account system was designed by the previous Liberal Country Party Government to prop up the health benefits funds. The transfer of contributors by an organisation to a special account it operates is enbeing prepared by the Attorney-General (Senatirely at the option of the organisation in accordance with its rules relating to contributors with pre-existing ailments, who exceed a maximum benefits level or who, in the case of the hospital special account, are chronically ill. The existing legislative provisions are loosely framed to permit the organisauon to take advantage of the subsidy provided through the special account arrangements to a much greater extent that this Government believes is proper. There is not even power in the Act for the responsible Minister to withdraw the special account subsidies from an organisation. What should be borne in mind in the discussion in this area is that the money being provided to prop up private health insurance funds through the special account is not money which belongs to the Government, the funds or contributors; it is money which belongs to taxpayers of Australia. That should be always a discipline exercising our mind where we are allocating this sort of money. gin of interpretation permitted organisations is particularly reflected in the statistics to which I have just referred for the Medical Benefits Funds, Queensland. Thesefiguresindicate that this organisation, since 1971, has availed itself more and more of the special account subsidies. This Bill does not propose any revolutionary change to the special account machinery but it does provide that, where it is proper for him to do so, and when he has received a recommendation of the Registration Committee that the moneys standing to the credit of a fund may properly be reduced, the Minister may direct that a portion of any excessive reserves held in a medical or hospital fund may be used to finance, in part, medical and hospital benefits for the long term and chronically ill members of the fund. The specific provision is contained in new section 74c and visualises portion of any excessive reserves being credited to the organisation's special account for the purpose of providing benefits to high drawing members who, as I have just mentioned, are usually the long term and chronically ill. In any one year in which the Minister makes a direction under this new section, the amount to be transferred is limited to 25 per cent of the amount of the special account deficit of the fund in the last completedfinancialyear. There are provisions in the Bill for direction of the Minister given under new section 74C to be subject of review. It is intended that the reviews should be conducted by the general administrative appeals tribunal, legislation for which is tor Murphy). However, if it is necessary for a review to be conducted in the interim period before the appeals tribunal is established the Bill provides for an independent tribunal to be established specifically for the purpose of reviewing directions by the Minister. I have in mind that the tribunal which may be established by this Bill will comprise 3 members. One will represent the interests of health benefit organisations, another the interests of contributors to the organisations and that the third member would be a qualified accountant. The Bill before the House also includes provisions relating to 4 matters associated with the administration and payment of nursing home benefits. The proposed new definition of 'Government nursing home' in sub-clause 3 (i) and other clauses provides for public nursing homes in the Australian Territories to be exempted from nursing home admission and fees",50,National Health Bill No 2 1974
114,Mr Chipp,Al l money.,53,National Health Bill No 2 1974
115,Mr Hayden,"Indeed. The fairly wide marsupervision under the National Health Act as are public nursing homes in the States at present. Clause 15 provides for a specific power to vary by regulation the rates of additional Australian Government nursing home benefits for pensioners with pensioner medical service entitlement and their dependants and the rates of nursing home fund benefits for insured patients. Clauses 16 and 25 include provisions amending sections 57B and 73c of the National Health Act to provide for an increase in the nursing home patient contribution from $2.55 a day to $4.55 a day. Sections 57B and 73c are machinery provisions which are invoked only where the approved fee for a nursing home patient is less than the aggregate of the nursing home benefits payable and the patient contribution. In this situation, the invoking of these provisions means that nursing home benefits are reduced with the effect that patients in all nursing homes pay the same patient contribution. This contribution will be $4.55 a day or $31.85 a week and is fixed so as to leave a patient in receipt of the standard rate single pension plus supplementary allowance with approximately $4 a week for personal spending. Clause 42 provides for the incorporation of the rates of additional nursing home benefit, as currently prescribed by regulation, into the eighth Schedule of the National Health Act with effect from 15 October 1974. There are also a number of provisions in the Bill to effect machinery amendments tp the National Health Act to delete provisions relating to the payment of handicapped children's benefits, to clarify the provisions regarding directions by the Minister under section 73B and to enable provisions in the National Health Act relating to the supervision of registered organisations to override State laws where the statutes are inconsistent.

I commend the Bill to the House. available free of charge to those who need them. This is yet further evidence of the Government's determination to provide a high quahty health care service and of its acceptance of its special reDeputy sponsibility to assist those members of the comexpects the ParUament to pass this Bill next munity who are sick or disabled. The Bill will week. allow for the preservation of the existing hearing aid scheme provided for under the repealed secwUl. tion 9A. It also empowers the Minister for Health to arrange for the provision of such medical or surgical aids, appliances and equipment as are prescribed in regulations under the Act on such conditions as the Minister thinksfit.It also provides for the making of modifications to a building, vehicle or equipment necessary for the treatment or rehabilitation of the sick or disabled. It is intended, once the necessary regulations have been made, to distribute stoma appUances free of charge through hospitals and stoma associations and home dialysis equipment through hospital dialysis-transplantation centres. The Government is at present considering extending the range of aids, appUances and equipment to be made avaUable and the Bill, as drafted, will permit the extension of the scheme from time to time as the needs of disabled groups in the community are assessed. The second matter provided for in the Bill which comes within my colleague's portfolio relates to pharmaceutical benefits dispensed through friendly societies' dispensaries. The National Health Act now restricts in some respects the services that can be given to the general public by some dispensaries run by friendly societies. At present the number of friendly society dispensaries with full approval to dispense benefits to the pubUc has been taken up in both Queensland and South Australia and there are currently 7 dispensaries in Queensland and 5 dispensaries in South AustraUa which have only a Umited approval to dispense benefits to members of the society, their wives and dependent chUdren under the age of 16 years. The BUl provides that the number of dispensaries with full approvals in Queensland and South Australia be raised to permit dispensaries with limited approval in those States as at 1 November 1974 to be granted full approval. This amendment will have the effect of improving the pharmaceutical service in those States without increasing the number of pharmacies.

117,Mr Hayden,"I am rather hopeful that itBILL 1974 Bill presented by Mr Hayden and read a first time. Second Reading Security) (4.53)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Honourable members will be well aware of the emphasis placed by the present Australian Government on all aspects of social welfare, especially those involving the more socially disadvantaged people in our society. Accordingly, on 26 February 1973, I established a working party to examine and report on the problems of homeless men and women in Australia. At their first meeting I reminded members of the working party that the problems of homelessness permeated many age groups and areas of the Australian community. I remarked that millions are spent on the enforcement of archaic laws against these casualties of society. But very little government money has been spent on providing facilities for rest, nutrition, treatment, counselling and rehabilitation which would ease the burden on the law enforcement agencies and provide a reasonable standard of support for the homeless. When I released the report of the working party on 17 July 1973, I sought public comment on the recommendations which had been made. I was pleased by the enthusiastic response to this report. The Government's decision to adopt the major recommendadons of the working party was first announced by the Prime Minister( Mr sons assistance centre or purchasing land and Whitlam) in his elecuon policy speech on 29 April 1974. On that occasion he said that the Government had decided to introduce a program to help meet the material needs and raise the dignity of homeless men and women. He went on to indicate that capital grants would be made available over a 3-year period to organisations for projects such as night shelters, hostels, flats, day centres and specialised clinics and centres for homeless people. Furthermore, the Prime Minister stated: This is a program devised in response to a much neglected need: It will be of benefit to the young as well as the old. It year 1974-75. These provisions should result in a will be of benefit to any person in immediate need: To the permanently homeless, to the deserted or disturbed woman and her children, to the Aboriginal or teenager in want or distress, to the battered woman or the battered child, to the single parent-in short, to anyone without support or an income. In delivering the Government's welfare policy ganisations may be required to enter into agreespeech on 1 May 1974,1 gave further details of ments. These agreements would provide that, in the policy the Government had endorsed. I said then that this was an area of need to which the social conscience of the Government was being directed. I outlined the basic aim of the program as being to assist, by the provision of funds, counselling and resource expertise, organisations undertaking special programs on behalf of homeless people. I described the homeless men and women we would assist as being in poverty in the sense ofhaving few independent resources and lacking a conventional home with most of the social or economic supports a home normally provides. The purpose of this Bill is to assist eligible organisations engaged in providing temporary accommodation and personal services for homeless men and women and, in one-parent family situations, their children. It proposes a program of assistance for people who find themselves without what is accepted in Australia as a normal home, through social factors such as alcoholism, inadequacy, domestic conflict or similar reasons. It is not proposed to provide emergency housing for people experiencingfinancialor similar problems in finding suitable housing. Nor is it proposed by this Bill to intrude into thefieldsof child care which traditionally have been the responsibility of the States. The Bill offers eligible organisations an apportunity to receive financial assistance to improve and upgrade existing hostels, day attendance centres and detoxification clinics, or to replace them or to establish new facilities. This parucular form of assistance will be available for 3 years. These grants may be made to meet the cost of purchasing a building for use as a homeless perhaving a centre built. Alternatively, the grant may be made to cover the cost of rent of premises used as a centre. Grants will also be available to improve premises, whether owned or rented, to upgrade the services offered to homeless persons. The purchase of fixtures, furniture, furnishings and equipment used in the operation of a homeless persons assistance centre may also qualify for a grant under these provisions of the Bill. Grants may be up to 100 per cent of the cost of the project. Provision has been made for expenditure of up to $ 1.45m for the remainder of the significant improvement in the standard of accommodation in homeless persons centres. To protect the Government funds which may be granted for these projects, participating or-",54,National Health Bill No 2 1974

This is similar to provisions in other legislation administered by the Department of Social Security and corresponds with an equivalent provision in the Handicapped Persons Assistance Bill 1974. There will also be subsidies towards other expenses, generally those of a recurrent nature. The 3-year time period mentioned previously in relation to subsidies of a capital nature will not apply to these subsidies for operating expenses.

But we have a human obUgation in this matter to do as much as we can to assist these people who are often unfortunate casualties of our social system. This Bill is designed to provide both a reasonable standard of support and increased opportunities for homeless people, enabling them to obtain a place of dignity in the fabric of Australian society. The Bill provides for the establishment of advisory committees to help develop a co-ordinated program of assistance. It is my intention to establish these committees as quickly as possible, ensuring that all involved in the welof the main health insurance legislation. At this fare of the homeless participate in the work of the committees.This then is the substance of the Bill. It is, in brief, an expression of this Governevent of some unforseen administrative complement's social conscience and its commitment to assist, in a tangible and practical way, people who have become casualties within our competitive society. The measures proposed within the Bill are based on a compassionate understanding of the needs and very real problems of homeless men and women and of their alienation, their loneliness and their despair. Many of the pleas directed at the Australian Government are loud and demanding about the needs and rights of particular groups within our society. But there are also voices which have for too long been crying in a wilderness of governmental neglect and social insensitivitya wilderness in which the as the levy will apply for the whole of 1975-76, the sertive voices of those with electoral or economic muscle have drowned out or diverted attention from the needs of groups of people who are not so articulate or who do not have ready access to government. Our Government is determined to end such areas of neglect. This Bill is one expression of that determination. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Chipp) adjourned. BUl presented by Mr Crean, and read a first time. Second Reading (5.7)I move: That this Bill be now read a second time. This Bill, and 2 others that I shall shortly introduce, came before this House earlier in thc year. The Senate rejected the BUls but we have decided to seek their passage again. If passed, the BUls wUl impose a health insurance levy of 1.35 per cent of the taxable incomes, as determined for income tax purposes, of people residing in AustraUa. The Bills complement other measures designed to implement the Government's universal health insurance scheme. Other basic features of the scheme are, of course, contained in legislation that has been before the Parliament on previous occasions. The levy proposed in the present BUls was discussed in the White Paper on the health insurance program published in November 1973, which was preceded by the report of the Health Insurance Planning Committee. Introduction of the levy is timed to coincide with the coming into operation stage we would hope to have that legislation effective as from 1 July 1975. However, in the xities which may require a sUghtly later introductory date, the BUls provide for the levy to be payable on taxable income of the 1975-76 income year, but also make provision for the annual rate to be reduced should the scheme not become operative until a little later during that year. In that event, it is intended that the rate applied to 1975-76 taxable incomes wUl be a proportionate part of the annual rate of 1.35 per cent, determined on a time basis. The levy of 1.35 per cent of taxable income wUl not apply to all taxpayers. At the upper end of the income scale, and on the assumption that maximum amount of levy payable by anyone will be $ 150. If the commencement date for the levy were not 1 July 1975 but, say, 1 October 1975, then the maximum amount payable for that year would be $112.50-three-quarter s of the sum. For low-income taxpayers there are provisions to the effect that a person whose taxable income is less than the minimum subject to income tax-no w $1,041-is not liable for the levy. There are also relieving provisions in respect of people maintaining dependants. These will apply to anyone who is entitled for a particular year of income to concessional deductions for maintenance of dependants of an amount of $100 or more. In these cases the levy wUl not be payable where a person's taxable income is not more than an amount related to the level of the minimum wage and calculated by appUcation of the formula devised by the Planning Committee and explained in its report at pages 44 to 46. If the levy were to be imposed for 1974-75, the threshold for its imposition would in these cases",55,Homeless Persons Assistance

121,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports,"Treasurer)be $2,575 and the legislation specifies this amount as the level below which the levy will not be payable by people with dependants. Provision is also made, however, for the amount to be increased above $2,575 in the light of changes in wage levels that occur before 1 July 1975. Another relieving provision related to income levels of particular classes of people concerns aged people. An aged person exempt from income tax by reason of the special transitional tax rebate will also be exempt from health levy. The actual levy-free point for 1975-76 will depend on the amount of the age rebate allowed for income tax purposes in that year. The general principle is, however, that whatever the level of the income tax rebate in 1975-76, an aged person who is exempt from income tax on account of it will also be exempt from health levy. Provision is also being made to give relief from the levy to certain classes of repatriation beneficiaries. The broad principle is that a repatriation beneficiary who is entitled under repatriation arrangements to full medical treatment for himself for all medical conditions, whether or not war-caused, but who has no dependants, will be completely free from payment of levy. If the beneficiary is entitled to full cover for himself, but has a wife or children, he will be entitled to relief from one-half of the levy that would otherwise be payable. The question as to whether a case for rehef may be made for other classes of people in situations broadly corresponding with those of repatriation beneficiaries is being examined. We are considering to what extent, if any, relief ought to go beyond the ranks of repatriation beneficiaries, and the legislation contains a provision authorising the making of regulations to confer such relief as it may be found appropriate to give. In this context we are giving special attention to pensioners who have an entitlement to free medical attention under the pensioner medical scheme and members of the armed forces. A fundamental objective of the legislation is and I commend the Bill to the House. to integrate collection of the levy with the collection of income tax. This has distinct administrative advantages which I am sure I need not labour. Suffice it to say that it is the most economical and sensible course to follow. It does, however, require a number of provisions of a technical kind. Much of what is in the Bills is contime. cerned with these technicalities and explanations of the various provisions are contained in the explanatory memorandum I have arranged for honourable members to receive. I should men(4.18) -I move: tion, however, that while the levy will be administered and collected under the income tax system and PAYE deductions from salaries and Assessment BUl 19741 mentioned that the levy is wages will be increased in 1975-76 to take account ofit, provisions in the legislation require a separate identification of the amount of a taxpayer's liability that represents health insurance levy. Thus, for example, the amount payable as the levy will be shown separately on pay-slips, group certificates and taxation notices of assessment. The various provisions of the Bill, including the technical parts that provide for levy to be payable on certain income derived by trustees and for people living in the external territories to be exempt, are, as I have already indicated, explained in a memorandum that is being made available to honourable members. In these circumstances, I think I need say no more at this stage about particular features of the Bills. I commend this Bill, the Health Insurance Levy Assessment Bill, to the House.

125,Mr Charles Jones (Newcastle,"MinisterShortly after taking office we commenced negotiations with the Tasmanian Government. In the course of these discussions the Tasmanians indicated they wished to assume direct responsibility for the operation of the service. In the interests of maintaining this service the Australian Government agreed that a loan would be provided for the purchase of a vessel. The Tasmanian Government, as honourable members will be aware, purchased the 'Straitsman' which re-entered the service in September 1973. It was agreed that the earUer undertaking to make a loan available would apply to this vessel. The Bill before the House gives effect to the agreement contained in the Schedule and thus honours the Government's undertaking. The agreement provides that a loan be made to Tasmama that shall not exceed in the aggregate $1,415,000. The loan is to be repaid over 15 years. The rate of interest charge on the loan will be the long term bond rate at the time the loan is made. Honourable members will of course be aware that the 'Straitsman' was operating in the King Island service when the tragic accident occurred in March 1973. The Tasmanian Government was immediately advised that approval would be granted for the temporary importation of a vessel should an Australian vessel be unavaUable to continue the service. Interim arrangements were made to provide the King Island area with a shipping service whilst an appropriate vessel was sought overseas by the Tasmanian Government. I have recently approved the temporary importation by the Tasmanian Transport Commission of the vessel 'Rah' which is due to enter service early in December. The 'Straitsman' is presently in Launceston undergoing repairs. These are expected to continue well into 1975. The Australian Government is concerned that adequate transport links to outlying communities should be maintained. This loan to the Tasmanian Government recognises the needs of the people of King Island. For this reason I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lloyd) adjourned. Bill presented by Mr Enderby, and read a first time. Second Reading Manufacturing Industry) (5.29)I move: That the Bili be now read a second time. This BUl seeks Parliament's approval for the first legislative expression of the Government's intention, announced by the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) on 23 April this year, to provide structural adjustment assistance to assist changes in Australian industry. VirtuaUy all features of the Government's program for structural adjustment assistance are already in operation, including the recently announced measures in relation to non-metropolitan areas which have particular difiiculties in adjusting to structural change. There is a need to give the whole program a more defined and permanent form through legislation to establish the Structural Adjustment Board. This will take sametimeto prepare, but there is, in the meantime, a particular requirement for legislative authority within which loan guarantees may be provided as part of the program. It is for that reason that this BUl is being introduced. To help progress towards the community's social and economic goals, the Government sees it as desirable in appropriate cases to promote and make easier the process of structural change in industry. There can be particulartimeswhen growth, and even strong growth, of the more viable sectors of industry may not be enough to offset weaknesses that develop in other sectors. . There are undoubtedly rigidities in the structure of industry which it takes time to overcome. The change from existing investments and existing employment patterns to others which would be more productive must be a gradual process. At the sametime,there are very great gains to be made from shifting industrial activity at a manageable pace from areas and forms which involve high costs to the community to others where industry needs less support or can stand on its own feet. Greater net value accrues to the community in this way. The costs of inadequate abUity to make these changes can be very high. Estimates have been made-and I stress that the precise figures are very much a matter of debate-whic h suggest that the total cost of support of Australian industry in its present form may run into hundreds of miUions of dollars each year. The encouragement of structural adjustments which wUl reduce this cost has been one of the central aims of this Government. Over a period, if movement into more viable industries and particular sectors of industries can be encouraged, or indeed even if their growth can be fostered while investment in other less attractive sectors is not encouraged, steady and worthwhUe progress can be made towards a more soundly based industrial structure.",59,Agreement Bill 1974
126,Mr Enderby (Canberra,"Minister forIt must be remembered that we are not talking about wholesale or overnight changes to industry structure. The larger part of the assistance I have mentioned goes to relatively few industry sectors, and within those areas there is a wide variation in the degree of dependence on that support by parucular activities and particularfirms.Indeed, in most cases, structural adjustment can be left to occur naturally as a continuing process of adaptation by individual firms. However, where the Government judges it necessary to facUitate a structural change arising from a decision in the broad national interest, but beyond the normal adaptive capacity of the economy, there is another reason for providing assistance to changes of this sort, and one that is particularly important to this Government. Such a structural change is clearly likely to involve some degree of upset to the lives of particular people and the business operauons of particular companies. The industrial structure that we have is partly a product of past policies-perhap s not always policies that have been in the best interests of the community, but nevertheless policies to which business and in turn employment have simply responded as being the policies of the government of the day. In the circumstances I have described the Government recognises that it is for the community generally, through the Australian Government, to bear the burden that these changes involve, and not for those particular businesses and employees which may be more seriously affected. I have given this background to the Bill to show the general basis for the Government's structural adjustment programs. Those programs provide for assistance in a number of ways. The Government has made generous arrangements to assist individual employees who may suffer as a result of these changes. It has also provided for assistance in a number of ways to businesses which are affected; through arrangements which the Department of Manufacturing Industry is already operating pending the estabUshment of the Structural Adjustment Board. Firms which have to cease operation or close a substantial part of their operations, in circumstances where the Government has decided the structural change involved should be assisted, can receive substantial compensation for the loss on realisation of their assets. This compensation can assist the firm, if it chooses, to start a new business with better long-term prospects. Firms can also obtain grants for consultancy studies to provide them with advice on restructuring of their activities. There is, however, an understandable reluctance on the part of manyfirms-and also of employees-to leave areas of activity with which they are farniUar, even if those activities may be costly to the community or may not be contributing fully to national welfare. Encouragement may be needed to induce thesefirmsto reorient their activities in more productive directions. If their choice of a new activity is wisely made, there is no reason why, in a country with Australia's undoubted potential for growth, they should not enjoy a prosperous future. If this can be done the community generally will benefit. Loan guarantees can be particularly effective in encouraging firms to adopt such a course, since they assistfirmstofinancethe initial cost of a significant transformation of their activities. Both the firm and the lender wUl have, of course, a strong interest in ensuring that the restructured operation wUl in fact be sufficiently productive to meet the costs of its estabUshment and to show adequate profits. The loan guarantee essentiaUy primes the pump-to start the process of restructuring which, once it is established, can be self-sustaining. The objective of the legislation providing for loan guarantee for structural adjustment proposals is set out in clause 4 of the BUl, and is consistent with the objective of the structural adjustment program generaUy. Since decisions on the provision of structural adjustment assistance wUl need to take account of the circumstances of particular cases, the BUl provides in clause 5 for the prescription of particular adjustment situations by regulation under the BUl. There is also provision in clauses 5 and 14 for details concerning particular decisions, including the class offirmsto receive assistance and the period for which assistance wUl be available, to be determined by regulation. Clause6 authorises the provision of loan guarantees, and is subject to clause 7 which sets out the broad criteria under which a firm may receive a loan guarantee. These criteria are broadly as foUows: That the firm has been or is being adversely affected by a prescribed adjustment situation to such an extent as to render a significant and distinct part of its assets incapable of economic use; that the firm itself has taken all reasonable steps to adjust to the situation; and that the loan monies are to be used in a way consistent with the intention of the Government in taking the decision which gave rise to the need for the particular structural change. Clause7 also provides, in effect, that a firm may not receive both a loan guarantee and closure compensation. Cases might arise where thc Government's intention is to encourage a particular structural change which would not, without assistance, be likely to occur at a reasonable speed and at a reasonable economic cost to the community.. In these cases the Government may wish to assist and not have the test of adverse effects on the firm applied. It would normally be the case that only one guarantee would be provided to any firm or group of associatedfirms,however, there is provision for this requirement to be waived where it would have unreasonable effects. This might be the case, for example, if 2 members of a diversified group offirmswere affected by reason of adjustment situations affecting entirely different areas of industry. A further provision is that guarantees may apply to as much as 90 per cent of the loan guarantee, but not more. This provision is intended to ensure that the lender exercises his own responsibility for assessing the viability of the proposal. (Quorum formed). Further clauses of the Bill provide for the application of conditions to guarantees, both to meet normal financial and administrative requirements in relation to the provision ofloan guarantees and to ensure that the conditions under which the assistance is provided are complied with. Other clauses of the Bill provide that payments under guarantees are to be met out of monies appropriated by the Parliament and available for the purpose, and to provide for machinery matters in relation to the operation of the Bill. Penalofficers. The Interdepartmental Committee reties are provided for misrepresentation in relation to matters concerning the provision of guarantees, and for breach of the secrecy provisions of the legislation. The introduction of the legislation provides clear evidence that the Government intends that desirable structural changes in Australian industry should not be impeded by lack of adequate measures. In the past structural change in industry has been largely a matter of chance. This has not been good enough. Structural change effects us all for good and bad and there should be the opportunity for Government to influence change for the good and not the bad. This Bill will assist in that regard. It will enable steady progress to be made towards achieving an industrial structure more attuned to the Australian environment and contributing more fully to the effective use of our human and physical resources. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Chipp) adjourned. Bill presented by Dr Cass and read afirsttime. Second Reading Dr CASS (Maribyrnong-Minister for the Environment and Conservation) (5.41)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is concerned with the provision of grants to the States over the financial years 1974-75 and 1975-76 as an interim program of financial assistance for soil conservation. The Australian Government is seeking to protect those natural resources upon which the nation's well-being is founded, in the interests of present and future generations. In particular, this Bill gives tangible expression to the importance which the Government places upon the preservation of the nation's soil resources. This subject first attracted significant Federal attention in February 1971 when the Australian Agricultural Council received a report from its Standing Committee on Soil Conservation, entided 'The Study of Community Benefits of and Finance for Soil Conservation'. The recommendations of this report provided a factual basis for the States to requestfinancialassistance for their soil conservation programs. The matter was raised at the Premiers' conference in 1972. However, the Government of the day preferred not to make a decision, and instead referred the question to the Interdepartmental Committee of Australian Government ported in July this year, after having discussions with representatives of the State soil conservation organisations, and after having examined the report of the Standing Committee. The Interdepartmental Committee agreed that soil conservation activity should be considerably increased above present levels and that it would be appropriate for the Australian Government to provide financial assistance for this purpose. The Government has now decided in principle to assist the States with a long term program of soil conservation. At the sametimeit has recognised that there is an urgent need for a collaborative, nation-wide study of soil conservation in the context of land management, involving the State and AustraUan Governments, with a view to providing a sound basis for a long term accelerated soil conservation program. This BUl provides for an interim program offinancialassistance for the States to step up their soU conservation activities over the duration of the proposed joint study, in preparation for a long-term program. Participation of the States in the proposed study wUl be a precondition for the provision offinancialassistance in the interim program. Agreement to participate in the study has been received from all States except New South Wales. The AustraUan Government recognises that gearing up for a major long term program of soU conservation will take time. For this reason it regards the interim program as essential so that the results of the joint study can be apphed to this most urgent problem without delay. WhUe the AustraUan Government's proposed contribution to each State in this first instance is smaU in relation to the magnitude of the work which is urgently required, it is a significant first about the needs in this field. I have spoken to the step in dealing with this national problem. With the completion of this essential first program, the government will then assess its responsibilities in the implementation of a national plan to protect and restore Australia's soil resources-whic h is perhaps, along with water, the most vital of all our natural resources. The sums to be made available were carefully determined after discussions with State officers and examination of the avaUable human and technical resources. The total Australian Governmentfinanceto be made available to the States under this program is $0.5m to June 1975 and $2.5m to June 1976. These funds will supplement the provisions for soil conservation already committed or foreshadowed by the States for this period. I now have pleasure in commending the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Chipp) adjourned. BILL 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 November, on motion by Mr Hayden: That the Bill be now read a second time. capped Persons Assistance BUl repeals 2 Actsthe Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act and the Handicapped Children's (Assistance) Actand consolidates and extends the Australian Government's program of assistance to voluntary organisations. The Opposition commends the Bill and it commends the amendments that are being made but in doing so we have some criticismsI hope constructive ones-to make on the way. This is another area of social reform to which the Government has made a contribution, although we think that it has not been enough and in some ways perhaps it has been made in the wrong direction. BeforeI get down to the technical aspects of the Bill and my criticisms of it, I wish to put the matter in context. The tragedy of being handicapped or of having a child who has become handicapped, who is born handicapped or who appears to be handicapped after birth is a tragedy that can never be understood unless it is personally experienced by the person who is handicapped or by the parents of that person. Therefore, although we can have much compassion about this form of tragedy, we can never really share it unless it happens to us or someone close to us. I have done some research on a personal basis parents of handicapped children. I have gone to handicapped people and asked about the crying need requiring government help or assistance or society assistance in this tragedy. I have not received a unanimous view that there should be more money for this purpose or more money for that purpose. Of course, people have put forward suggestions but there was a constant request running through my whole survey. It was that when such a tragedy happens people want full information or someone to tell them exactly what facilities are avaUable to someone who is handicapped. That seems to be a simple request but apparently there is a great need for such a document. I request this Government, which has a passion for pubUshing documents at taxpayers' expense, to prepare a simple document explaining to the parents of handicapped chUdren the kind of facilities and help that is avaUable to them. I am not talking only about the help that would be avaUable from the Australian Government. I am talking of a consoUdated document that would show the kind of assistance that is available at the Australian Government level, the State government level, the local government level and now, as the Minister for Social Security( Mr Hayden) foreshadows in his second reading speech, at the fourth tier of government which is rapidly being created in this country by the Australian Assistance Plan. This sort of publication would be extraordinarily helpful. I also join the Opposition with the remarks of the Minister in his thanks and praise for the men and women of the voluntary organisations. We would totaUy join with the Minister in his comments in that regard. It is not unusual for the Minister to spoil a good speech by an indiscreet remark. He did not let us down on the occasion of making his second reading speech on this Bill. He makes what I regard as being a rather contemptible allegation in his speech as recorded on page 3425 of Hansard of 13 November 1974. He said: The morality of the social contracts written by past governments for some of these groupsThat is, voluntary organisations-",60,Structural Adjustment Loan Guarantees Bill 1974
127,Mr Chipp (Hotham) (5.45),"The Handihas been very much open to question. All too often it has been a case of those with the most financial and political salary subsidy of up to 100 per cent for thefirst2 innuence, the most access and the most highly developed sense of their own importance to our economic and social system receiving the most attention. On the other hand the increases organisational flexibility. That the Bill modest, the humble and the handicapped have received only token attention. There was no need for the Minister to inject that kind of atmosphere into his speech. It is totally untrue. It is totally unworthy. It is a reflection on the previous Minister in charge of social security, the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr a balanced and integrated program that is Wentworth). It is a reflection on the previous Government and it is also a reflection on the organisations that received assistance from the previous Government. We reject that allegation. I return to the Bill. Without doubt the legislation wil] give to voluntary and private organisations increased nnanciai assistance that is very much needed. The evidence of this need for increased assistance is obvious to anybody who has some involvement with voluntary welfare organisations. The Minister's own Department carries out an annual national survey of sheltered workshops. He mentions in his second reading speech that income from sheltered workshops had risen to $ 16m in 1974. What he did not say, however, was that expenditure had exceeded income in 1974 by nearly $2m. In other words, the sheltered workshops ran at a $2m loss last year. Financial assistance will be increased in 2 main ways. Firstly, there will be a wider range of functions or services that will attract a subsidy. Secondly, certain existing subsidies and benefits have been increased. For example, capital and equipment subsidies have been increased by 13 per cent-no t doubled as the Minister says. I hope that I make that point very clearly. They have been increased from $2 for $ 1 to $4 for $ 1. The handicapped children's benefit has been increased by 50c from $3 to $3.50 a day and the salary subsidy in respect of approved staff will be increased in the majority of cases from a 25 per cent level to a 50 per cent level. As well as this increased level of assistance, the Act will give voluntary and private associations much greater flexibility in initiating new programs. It could be said that it is highly desirable that power, by the middle of next year, I will be more the ability of voluntary associations to respond considerate to him than my predecessors were. I quickly to emerging needs or requests for service hope that makes the Minister happy. for consumers will be enhanced by this Bill. As I see it, this increased flexibility will be mainly fosyourself to. If you give general financial allotered by 2 provisions: Firstly, the changes to the cations they will spear you both ways. rental subsidy which increase the amount of subsidy from 66 per cent to 80 per cent; remove the 3-year limit on the subsidy and sets no maximum pen to me. I was about to read a telegram from limit; and broaden the range of facilities which the Tasmanian Leader of the Opposition. It are eligible to attract rental subsidy. Secondly, states: the fact that for approved staff of new ventures a years of operation may be approved also does provide additional levels of assistance for a wider range of functions and enhances the ability of voluntary organisations to respond quickly to needs is beyond doubt. However, what is in doubt is that the provisions of the Bill fall far short of providing, in the Minister's own words, intended to serve an area of social need'. I hope that I am being constructively critical. I hope that Government speakers who follow me will not say that I was trying to make small political points. I know the difficulties of the Minister and the Government in this area. I know that this proposal is an attempt to improve an area and that it does improve the facilities and amenities for handicapped persons. But what I am trying to do-as I think an Opposition should-is to paint the counsel of perfection hoping that we may get some unanimous agreement in philosophy and practice on both sides of the House. Both sides aim for that, whoever is sitting on the Treasury bench. There can be no balance and integration when the activities of State governments in this area are specifically excluded from Australian Government financial assistance. I have a telegram from the Leader of the Opposition in the Tasmanian Parliament. I have written to all my State colleagues in the 6 State parliaments. But the speed with which the Government is putting Bills through, with only a week to consider them, does not leave us, as an Opposition,timefor consultation with our State colleagues and with the voluntary organisations. I cannot be too critical of the Government for this because we did exactly the same when we were in Government. conceding that it is a wrong practice and does not lead itself to good government.

131,Mr Chippi Am Not Used To Having That Hap,"We applaud the provision of funds but urge that it should general meeting of the Association for the Menbe made through the States or at least in full consultation with them. From my reading of the Bill and the Minister's second reading speech I cannot see that any such guarantees exist. ble that the States have both the historical and practical background in broad social welfare functions which is simply not going to be utilised. There are years of experience, know-how and background available from the States and the voluntary organisations that I believe it would be silly to overlook and to take no notice of. Not only have they got that knowledge but they have also got, I think, a greater knowledge of local needs than does a bureaucrat or a Minister in Canberra. The Minister mentioned the Australian Assistance Plan, the Hospitals and Health Services Commission and the Schools Commission as being related to and involved with this area of social need. Yet he failed to state the incongruity of excluding assistance to the States with this Bill when it is provided by two of the others. 1 should like the honourable member for Perth( Mr Berinson), whose contributions on the subject. I always respect, to address himself, when he speaks on this Bill, to how he can justify the money not going through the States or at least the States being consulted in this area of social need. As we know, State education departments receive direct nnanciai assistance for education including special education for handicapped through Schools Commission funds and also receive funds for community health and mental health projects through the Hospitals and Health Services Commission. The AAP, to my knowledge, does not provide financial assistance to State government welfare bodies and this Bill specifically excludes it. It seems to be most incongruous that States should be able to receive financial assistance for education and health programs for handicapped people but not for social welfare programs. That is my reply to the interjection of the honourable member for Perth. In my view the singling out of the States in this legislation is its most serious limitiation in any effort to achieve a balanced and integrated program. I agree with the Minister in his aims. It is quite obvious that voluntary organisations and consumers themselves do not want the vast majority of services to handicapped people to be delivered by a system based on a medical model. I hope that we have unanimity in the House on that. At the last annual tally Retarded it was agreed that the problem of mental retardation-the most common single handicap among handicapped people-wa s a social problem and not a medical one. the medical people though, is it not? Minister just made. I am glad that the Minister and I agree on that. Handicapped people themselves do not want to become part of the 'white coat syndrome'. They want their services delivered by local welfare organisations. While it is vital to increase the effectiveness of voluntary organisations, it is also important to increase the effectiveness and build on the experience and practical wisdom of the State welfare departments. I know the limitations of State welfare departments. I know the limitations of many State governments, State Ministers and State public servants. But they are there and there to stay. Why should we not take notice of what they do by a form of consultation. I doubt that local government bodies in Australia have the historical or the practical background or framework upon which to build hastily complex welfare service structures. I think practice will bear out my view that it is unrealistic to claim any material involvement of the Australian Assistance Plan in this area of social need. Firstly, both the AAP and this proposed Act will be administered by the one department and the one Minister. Secondly, as I understand it, it is departmental policy to insist that programs for handicapped people be funded by the handicapped persons welfare section of the Department of Social Security and not through AAP funds. There is also an inter-departmental committee which aims to ensure that for these kinds of programs no funds through the Hospitals and Health Services Commission are made available. Thirdly, in practice there are still a number of very woolly areas where the functions or responsibilities of one government department overlap those of another and this needs to be sorted out. One such area, for example, concerns special schools for handicapped children that were built by voluntary associations with assistance from the Department of Social Security. After many months of discussion there has still been no decision concerning the assumption of responsibility for these educational facilities by State education authorities with the aid of funds from the Schools Commission. One could go on and give a great number of examples of this duplication of services in departments which I believe has been caused by speed. In some cases one can",64,Handicapped Persons Assistance

135,Mr Chipp,"It is; I concede that point that thecommend the speed of social reform which the Minister and his Government have pursued but certainly we have paid for it in terms of duplication of bundles of muddles, as many examples could indicate. Fourthly, the Bill also specifically excludes the joint funding of programs, as I understand, the Bill. That is, Australian Government funds either will not be paid to voluntary organisations together with grants from the States, or the amount of the Australian Government contribution will be balanced out against the amount of State government contribution. To me such exclusion hardly fosters balance, integration or coordination. While I support the importance of not having duplication of funding and consistency of approach I think there is a vast difference between duplication and joint or co-ordinated funding of services and programs. The continued and expanded involvement of the States and other government departments with voluntary associations on joint bases is, I beheve, essential. Fifthly, this Bill does not recognise that many areas and groups of people within our community do not have the capacity, for one reason or another, to raise the initial funds required to commence services or facilities for handicapped people. The2 previously mentioned Acts recognised that to establish health and education welfare services is a major undertaking and too great for some communities to initiate at all or to initiate within a reasonable period. These Acts, as we know, recognise this fact by making initiating grants covering all or nearly all of the total estabUshment and running costs. To overlook such a provision indicates to me that regrettably this BUl is but another piecemeal approach and does not provide a balanced or integrated program. In his second reading speech the Minister have been more in that area rather than in the spoke in most glowing terms about the relacapital area. It is a question of judgment upon tionships between the statutory and the private which I could be challenged-whil e I am talking and voluntary sectors in welfare. It is most enon the subsidy of salaries to the extent of 50 per couraging to see these kinds of statements being cent or 100 per cent, I hope that the Minister, made by Ministers. However, it would be much whoever he is, wUl be dUigent in looking after more encouraging to see such sentiments being those faithful people in his Department and that put into practice. I suspect and I fear that the prowhen approval is given to approved subjects as visions of this Bill wUl not substantially reverse far as salaries are concerned, he wUl ensure that the presence of imbalance in this area where the long hand of the bureaucracy does not more resources are being channelled into the extend too far into the administration of those Government services rather than into the volunproblems of the voluntary organisations which in tary sector. It is all very well for the Minister to the past have acted both wisely and well. I speak for 3 pages of his second reading speech understand, if Government expenditure is to be praising the efforts of the voluntary organisations given in the form of subsidy to voluntary organand commending the job they do. The only area isations, that of course the Government has a rein which his sincerity and his belief count is when sponsibUity to the taxpayers to oversee the he administers those views into practice. I consider that the claimed integrated and program nature of these provisions can be challenged not only on practical grounds, as I have shown, but also on the ground that the apparent underlying phUosophies wUl not be consistently implemented. It seems to me inherent in the Minister's second reading speech that there are elements which advocate the principles or phUosophies of equaUty of opportunity, normalisation and integration of handicapped people. WhUe we wholeheartedly agree with the importance of these principles, we suspect that this BUl wUl implement them without any real consistency or without any real definition. This is a question of judgement, I suppose: We would commend the increased subsidies for bricks and mortar, but if one is looking at handicapped persons as a human problem, one would have thought that greater emphasis with the amount of funds that was avaUable for that particular area of need might well have been placed in the subsidy area of salaries. an emphasis on bricks and mortar. I have already commended the concept of the subsidy of salaries but I am saying that perhaps it is a question of judgment as to how much is given to bricks and mortar and how much is given in subsidising salaries. will end up sending much more money into the recurrent expense area than into the capital cost area? mend that area.

It has been indicated that organisations running day activity centres would be eUgible for subsidy to provide accommodation for persons attending such centres although this is made by no means clear by the Minister in his second reading speech. I ask the Minister when he replies to this debate whether he would clarify the position concerning that problem I have just raised. The Opposition does see some factors about this Bill which we would say are not perfect. It does not present a complete and total picture but we do commend what is in it. We have no amendments to move. The amendment which the Minister has foreshadowed to clear up a technical error in drafting wUl receive the support of the Opposition as well. later the points which the honourable member indeed are capable of working in the same jobs for Hotham( Mr Chipp) has raised. I consider as are you and I . They want to do that. They are this Bill to be another step forward in the capable of living in hostels, ground floor flats Government's 15 point program for the welfare and houses just as we do. They want a garden of handicapped people. It is with great regret too. They want more than just to walk from the that I look back on the years that this scheme has sheltered hostel accommodation to the sheltered been operating and that an overall plan for the workshop. They too want a bit of Ught and shade welfare of handicapped people was not one of in their Uves.

We have put everyone into the one category. of handicapped people has been Uke Topsy; it has just grown. It has grown through the generosity and willingness of voluntary organisestablishing sheltered workshops for handiations. Had we had enough thought or enough rerental subsidy will enable organisations with limsponsibUity many years ago, we would have had ited assets to provide facUities, and I hope among a fully integrated and balanced program for these facilities we wUl see an upsurge of half-way handicapped and disabled people. In fact, even houses where those who had no alternative but as far back as 20 years ago, if we had then to live in hostels or institutions and who want to thought of meeting the recurrent expenditure of Uve alone, can live in a half-way house for long such organisations, they would not be in quite enough to become rehabilitated to the idea of the deplorable nnanciai mess that they are in at living independently. There is no reason why we the moment. But it is a bit late, I suppose, for cannot build half-way houses, houses, hostels or recriminations. We start off as a Government of only 2 years standing, picking up a certain amount of the neglect that has been apparent over some 23 years. The BUl wUl cater for the needs ofboth handicapped chUdren and handicapped adults who do need special facUities if we are to help them to rejoin the mainstream of Uving. I acknowledge that previous governments introduced the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act, which of its kind was good, and the Handicapped ChUdren's (Assistance) Act. But it has been left to this Government to co-ordinate and plan for realism with respect to the needs and wants of handicapped people. It is not enough to introduce a pot-pourri of ideas, fragmented and static, Federal and State, councU and voluntary, without following through and expanding the plan to include the needs and wants of the handicapped people. All too often we hear about States rights and Federal rights in this area and commumty needs. But nobody ever speaks much about the wants of handicapped people themselves. They do have ideas of their own. They do have ideas of self-determination. Their needs do not stand stUl, and their wants do not stand still. What was considered necessary for the care of handicapped people 7 years ago is happUy not acceptable by the community or by them now. There is a whole new thrust from handicapped people for involvement and self-determination. Sheltered workshop employment, training and sheltered accommodauon are no longer enough. This BUl provides a subsidy of $4 for $1 for capped adults, training centres for handicapped children and hostels for chUdren and adults. The",66,Handicapped Persons Assistance
140,Mrs Child (Henty) (6.10),"I wUl answer Very many handicapped adults want to andflats with grab rails around the sink, the stove and the wash basin. There is no reason why part of rehabilitation cannot be learning to cope with lifting a pot off the stove or hanging washing on the line. It is not enough to featherbed people. We must give them the wherewithal to realise their own potential. Voluntary organisations in this nation have taken the brunt of the responsibility for handicapped people for years. Without their doing so, I just wonder what would have happened to handicapped people because, as a community, we were very happy to brush them aside. This may be because they have had very little political strength. The load of debt that we owe to such organisations is incalculable. In these days with their overhead rising, it is becoming much more difficult for them to raise funds to meet operational costs. It is easier to get donations for something glamorous or for a new building. When it comes to running costs, money is not attracted quite so easily. This Bill also introduces a 50 per cent subsidy for approved staff. I do not quite know where the honourable member for Hotham obtained his figure of a 25 per cent subsidy. With this 50 per untary organisations is irreplacable. They have cent subsidy, hostels and sheltered workshops the grass roots understanding of the needs of will be able to double their staff. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. ting for dinner I was speaking about the doubled into the one category. Some cannot work at all; subsidy that is being introduced under this Bill. I some can work in sheltered workshops but many think that perhaps the honourable member for can work just as you and I work. They should Hotham has become a bit confused about it. The have the opportunity to do so. That is why doubled subsidy applies not just to the sheltered rehabUitation centres are of such tremendous workshops but to the whole range of prescribed importance. We do not want to go into the 1980s services. It is a huge jump. The Australian offering to disabled people the same narrow Government will also in some cases subsidise choice that has been theirs during the 1950s and 100 per cent of the salaries where new ventures 1960s. The honourable member for Hotham criare being established and it will help them to beticised this Government for some aspects of the come established. The Bill will also assist voluntary organisdo what we have done and that he was ations to set up activity centres for those too disassociated with a government that could have abled to work in a sheltered workshop. It will endone a lot more for disabled people during the courage greater emphasis on the social interests 23 years that it was in office. Our opportunities of the disabled. It will allow voluntary organishave expanded and new doors are opening for ations to develop recreational centres and the us; I want the same opportunities for disabled urgently needed rehabilitation centres, which I people. also mentioned before dinner, complementary to workshops or activity centres. I would hope also that the subsidies would encourage voluntary orabled People's Week. It was quite an innovation ganisations to expand their seaside and country for Victoria, and I do not know of such a function farms and houses so that those who work in a city being held in Victoria before. It was very well can perhaps live out of the city and commute to organised and the activities were diversified. their workshop just as any other worker commutes to his job in the city. I would hope that with facilities like these, handicapped people might have the relaxation of weekends spent gardening in their own gardens, with their own pets as we do, or weekends spent perhaps on the beach. In the personal day-to-day care of the mentally and physically handicapped, voluntary organisations have shown the way and are well situated to play their role, with understanding and compassion. But we cannot have them scratching for the money for their extended facUities. To be quite honest with the House, I would prefer the money to go straight to the organisations and not, as the honourable member for Hotham suggested, through the States. The States have not shown in other areas the type of co-operation we would need to work through them. In fact, 95 per cent of the grants they received from the Australian Government for the buUding of special schools has still not been spent after one year of that program has elapsed. I would be a bit worried about the money being spent by the States within the time-table. The personal interest and involvement of voltheir people. The Australian Government has the financial resources. Working together, we have forged ahead, and with this BUl we will go even further. I make a plea to everyone to understand BUl that do not quite fall in with his line of thinking. I point out that we have had only 2 years to RecentlyI went to BaUarat and opened Dis-",67,Handicapped Persons Assistance
141,Mrs Child,"Before the suspension of the sitthat all disabled people do not and cannot fallThere were film nights, displays and open houses throughout all Ballarat services. It was mainly organised by disabled people themselves. They are not asking for pity or charity. What they are asking for is that not only employers overcome their prejudices against the disabled people, but that the rest of us who make up the community overcome our prejudice towards them. Those people who feel so much pride in their children's achievements, whether it be their winning a 100 yards dash at primary school or achieving a wellearned Higher School Certificate, will well understand the pride of parents whose mentally handicapped child finally manages to coordinate limbs and brain and climb a few steps. It does not sound much of an achievement, but the pride of his peers and his teachers is something to really share. Those who feel such pride and joy in their children's accomplishments will understand the joy of parents of a handicapped child hearing their child speak for the first time. I have been helping in a voluntary capacity in a kindergarten for mentally retarded children. One of the little girls who attends the kindergarten suffered brain damage following measles. One day she pointed to a picture in a book and identified a duck. She said 'duck'. It was the first time in 18 months that she had been able to speak. When everybody in the room heard the child speak, they almost felt as if they had scaled Mount Everest. Because of the activities which take place with the disabled there is a need for more teachers and more buildings. I think we could work together to make sure that eventually the Federal Government picks up the recurrent expenditures for all the disabled people throughout the entire nation. We will not really have come of maturity until we have done so. Success means many things to many people trade and commerce. I refer to the Mai-Wei and some successes are more easily won than Industries sheltered workshop at Maitland in my others. Believe me, that handicapped child sayelectorate where handicapped persons are ing the word 'duck' was the result of many taught to make and to restore furniture of all months of patience, perseverence and persiskinds, to repair and to make toys, to make tags tance by a dedicated band of teachers. We all and a host of other useful activities. Attached to feel a lot of pride in our family's achievements, this handicapped persons' institution is the Maiand there is nothing different in the pride of Wel handicapped children's school. It is wonderparents of handicapped children, be they ful to visit this school and to see the dedication of physically or mentally handicapped. Each child the teachers and the way in which they encourhas to have an opportunity to reach his own age handicapped children in various methods of potential. Sometimes those who are handilearning. capped need more support to be able to reach their potential. This Bill will open the way for and to see the dedicated work which is being more opportunities. The voluntary organisations have given this the handicapped persons who are working under nation a basis for magnificent care for mentally such conditions. They have dedicated tutors and physically handicapped children and adults. helping them on their way. At Muswellbrook in This Bill recognises the value of grass roots work my electorate there is a handicapped children's of voluntary organisations. It recognises their understanding, their care and their compassion. But it also recognises that they cannot be left in the 1970s to go it alone. They have to go it with us, and they have to go it with Federal finance. Mr O'KEEFE (Paterson) (8.8)-The Handicapped Persons Assistance Bill, which has the full suppon of my colleagues in this ParUament, is really a BUl to repeal the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act and the Handicapped Children (Assistance) Act. It consolidates and expands the programs of assistance to voluntary organisations that have assumed responsibUity for the welfare of handicapped people. The people who form such organisations are providing a magnificent service for handicapped persons. The Minister for Social Security( Mr Hayden) on quite a few occasions during his second reading speech expressed praise and appreciation for the work of these voluntary agencies. He said: There is a very special role for them to play for there are many people whose needs are best served by these organisations. Although the Australian Government provides for the general economic welfare of the disabled, it is the voluntary organisations that are able to help, in a way not possible for a government department, in the personal day-to-day care of many mentally or physically handicapped people. It is good to hear such praise being given to these organisations throughout Australia. In my own electorate of PatersonI have a personal interest in several of these veryfineinstitutions. I feel that there is not a member on either side of this House who would not desire to assist in providing welfare for handicapped people. With assistance and encouragement it is just wonderful how these people canfitinto the community and make a useful contribution even to It is also good to visit the sheltered workshops done there. One sees appreciation on the faces of school. It has lovely conditions and has the full support of the whole community. I note the Minister's appreciation. It is pleasing to see communities not only in country areas but also in cit$3.50 a day and also that consideration will be ies supporting these handicapped persons' sheltered workshops, homes and schools. Without public contribution and assistance these institutions would not progress and they would not provide the services which they do today. The people working there are dedicated to their job. When we were in government both the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act and the Handicapped Children (Assistance) Act were introduced and implemented. We support the action of the present Government in amalgamating both measures in the Handicapped Persons Assistance Bill. It is of great importance to note that the number of persons employed in sheltered workshops in Australia is almost 10,000. From observations made travelling about this great country of ours there is no doubt that these figures will increase as the years go by and greater assistance from the Government will be needed. Present production from the sheltered workshops is running at $ 16m which is quite a considerable contribution to trade and commerce. The honourable member for Hotham( Mr others are not reaching a source of aid?' As a Chipp) cited this figure and he indicated that there was a deficiency. One would expect a deficiency in this field. I do not think anybody on either side of the House would quibble at a deficiency occurring in these institutions for the handicapped. It is no wonder that governments appreciate the need for furtherfinancialassistance in thisfield.The Bill provides for the needs of handicapped children and handicapped adults who do not require constant medical attention but who, nevertheless, need special facilities and encouragement to take their rightful place in the community. When one visits these institutions and expresses encouragement to the people working in them it is wonderful to see the expression on their faces and to see how much they appreciate that citizens go there and offer encouragement. It means so much to these people. It is noted that the subsidy for the establishment of sheltered workshops, training control for handicapped children and hostels for children and adults has doubled from $2 to $4 for every $1 raised by voluntary organisations. The doubling of the subsidy by the Government should further encourage local organisations to get behind this movement and to provide further amenities and facilities for handicapped persons both in the sheltered workshops and in the schools for handicapped children. It is pleasing to note that in the Bill the benefit for handicapped children has been increased from $3 to given to these children being paid this amount when they are not attending the school but are at home over the weekend with their parents. I have been brief in speaking on the Bill but it has our full support. As I have said, I do not think there is a member on either side of the House who is not impressed with the help and service which handicapped persons are receiving from organisations in this country. I support the Bill. given an undertaking to try to make my comments brief because of the legislative program which has to be gone through tonight. It is good to find such warm accord for what the Handicapped Persons Assistance Bill aims to do. It aims to consolidate and to extend the help which is given to voluntary organisations which undertake the task of looking after the welfare of handicapped people. While we can congratulate ourselves in some measure because about 10,000 people are now being looked after in this way, it is salutary to ask the question: 'Yes, 10,000 people are being looked after, but how many matter of fact, recent expert studies in this field have suggested that Austraha is probably no different from most other western countries in that between 7 per cent and 10 per cent of the total population comes within the category of being either permanently or for some time disabled. With increasing longevity, medical advances and permanent traumatic injuries resulting from road, industrial and domestic accidents, thefigureof 7 per cent cannot be expected to decrease. This is clear when one looks at the road toll each weekend-no t to say what happens during the week-and at accidents in factories and so on. In hospitals one sees young men of 21,20 and younger still who have been injured for life through the simple act of diving into shallow water and breaking their spine. These are salutary experiences for anyone to undergo. It enhances our admiration for those voluntary bodies which are receiving extended help from the Government in this task. The provisions of the Bill have been referred to in some detail already. I do not think there is any need for me to add unduly to those comments. I am pleased to see that the subsidy extends to sheltered workshops for handicapped adults, training centres for handicapped children and hostels for both children and adults and that it will be doubled, as previous speakers have",68,Handicapped Persons Assistance
142,Mr Reynolds (Barton) (8.15),"I too have already mendoned. In other words, from here on as far as the capital expenses are concerned in establishing a centre, four-fifths of the money will be provided by the Austrahan Government. The honourable member for Hotham( Mr from the State. Under this Bill centres which are Chipp) took issue with us because we did not consult the States about this matter. Quite frankly, my impression has been that the States are only too glad for the Australian Government to take the responsibility. In many spheres of welfare the States have said that they have had to fill in the gap which, in the past, has been left attached to them a training centre but in the past by Commonwealth legislation. Therefore I think the States will be very pleased to know that we are prepared to provide money and to give help in kind by way of social workers, physiotherapists and the other personnel who will be necessary for the satisfactory implementation of this program. The extension of the rental subsidy will be a they will be assisted by this Bill. I hope that they big help to the various bodies. Again four-fifths may graduate to sheltered workshops in due of the money will be provided by the Commoncourse. wealth. I hope that this rental subsidy will be an incentive to people who may not be able to provide even one-fifth of the money to build institutions, sheltered workshops, activity centres or approved officers. Whilst the remarks of the recreational centres for handicapped people but honourable member for Hotham were fairly who would be capable of raising a lesser amount generous about this Bill they were somewhat of money to rent exisdng premises. Therefore, misguided on this matter. The salary subsidy is in the rental subsidy will be a great help. There is my view one of the most important features of already a rental subsidy for sheltered workshops this Bill. A very substantial subsidy is provided. I but it is limited to 3 years, as has already been have read articles by the Sub-Normal Children's mentioned. Under this Bill there will be no limiWelfare Association which state that it is all very tation of time. People who undertake to rent well to subsidise the establishment of buildings premises and equipment will be able to receive but it is another matter to keep up with the runthis subsidy without limitation of time. Similarly, the subsidy will be extended to the of the salary of approved staff. Unlike the restricmaintenance of the centres. That also is an tions on approved staff that applied in the earlier important point. One of the things about which I Bill, in this Bill approved staff can include, for am particularly happy is that the subsidy will be instance, domestics in hostels and other staff in extended to those centres which hitherto have sheltered workshops, activity centres, hostels or not been designated approved sheltered workrecreation or rehabilitation centres. All of these shops. I had something to say about this when people will qualify to have up to 50 per cent of the former Minister for Social Services, the their salary provided by the Commonwealth. honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr WentThis to my mind is a very important feature of worth) introduced a Bill in about 1970 or a little this Bill. I understand that it has been very before that, by which the subsidy was extended warmly welcomed by the workshops, the other to approved sheltered workshops. Approval was centres and the ancillary services to which I have based on the average weekly earnings of the perreferred. sons in the sheltered workshops. Until this date they could earn $4 a week. Now it has been extended to $10 a week. But those centres that do of staff in newly established centres will be pronot qualify on the basis of earnings to be desigvided by the Commonwealth, and that will connated sheltered workshops will not be debarred tinue for 2 years during the establishment period. from help under this BiH. This Bill will give them These are all very important features. As the exactly the same kind of help as it gives to shelMinister for Social Security( Mr Hayden) said, tered workshops. I am thinking here of those centres that are attached to schools for physically and mentally handicapped children. Children who have turned 16 years of age no longer qualify for aid often located adjacent to subnormal schools, as they are often called, will attract the subsidy. There will be a continuity. The very schools that train the children while they are of compulsory school attendance age or up to the age of 16 when they become invalid pensioners, have they have not been able to qualify for approval as sheltered workshops. That will not matter from now on. They will receive the help that is offered to sheltered workshops. I have two such centres in my electorate, one is the Southaven Sub-Normal School and the other is the Sunnyhurst Sub-Normal Children's School at Penshurst in Sydney. I am pleased to say that A salary subsidy is to be provided in respect of ning costs of those institutions. That is exactly what this Bill does. It provides up to 50 per cent Under this Bill up to 100 per cent of the salary this Bill consolidates and extends-to my view it extends very considerably-the help we are giving to these centres. Other measures deal with reequipment. This applies to activity centres that do not qualify as sheltered workshops. There is provision under legislation that has already been before the House for an incentive allowance of $5 a week, without any means test, for people who work in sheltered workshops. There is provision for the rental subsidy, under the means test as we have known it in the past, for the activity centres which do not qualify as sheltered workshops. There is $500 bonus given to sheltered workshops which act as a kind of training institution and which help young people or not so young people to graduate back into normal employment. This Government does not take the whole credit for that proposal. It was pioneered by the previous Government. We acknowledge that. It is interesting to note that so far 209 people have graduated from such sheltered workshops, 78 of them in the last financial year. Our hope is that, with the extension of the service, more people will ultimately graduate back into normal employment. This Bill does not just set out to help people earn a living in terms of finance. One of the greatest features of these centresI acknowledge the remarks of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Paterson( Mr O'Keefe)-is what they do for the people who are employed in them. It gives them companionship which they cannot necessarily find in their own homes. It also gives relief to the parents and the other members of the family for at least part of the day while these people are away and being cared for by professional and well meaning people. I hear the Government Whip talking about the gag so I shall curtail my remarks at this stage. I strongly Thorburn, R. W. support the Bill. I hope that in the days to come when we are not so hard pressed for time we will be able to look at what is being done in some other countries that is somewhat in advance of what we are doing in this Bill.

The simple reason for moving this amendment is that there is an amendment before the House to the National Health Act which will ensure that benefits are not paid under both that Act and under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act to the same child. The volume of business is such that it may be some weeks or even longer-on e cannot anticipate this with any complete sense of confidence-befor e the amendment to the National Health Act is passed by both Houses of the Parliament. It is not the intention that benefits should be paid for the one child under both Acts. Accordingly, to avoid double payment it is necessary, at least in the interim, to amend this Bill to ensure that this does not occur. That in the long and short of it is exacdy why the amendment has been moved. The honourable member for Hotham( Mr Chipp), who is the Opposition spokesman in these matters, has indicated to me that the Opposition supports the amendment. I will not delay the business of the Committee by speaking any further on this matter.

149,Mr Mcleay (Boothby) (8.49),"In generalthis legislation as they apply to ex-servicemen who served in the Second World War. We acknowledge that discrimination did exist against single men and widowers. Honourable members on this side of the House are pleased that the Government has recognised this deficiency in the old Act and has taken steps to rectify it. We also support the provisions in the Bill which make it possible for mortgages to be transferred from one home to another in the special circumstances described in the second reading speech of the Minister for Housing and Construction ( Mr Les Johnson). No doubt all honourable members have seen cases involving medical or other hardships such as the transfer of a mortgagee from one State to another or from one part of a State to another part of a State through circumstances, to quote the Minister, 'beyond his control'. These new provisions will ensure that such persons will not lose the very real benefit of a defence service homes loan. They will also continue to protect the legislation from abuse. The Opposition believes that there must never be any trading in property flowing from this legislation. This is purely and simply a repatriation benefit for services rendered to the nation. We also support the hardship clauses which empower the Minister to grant a measure of relief to persons in difficulty as a result of a higher rate of interest applying to the increased mortgage limit. We note, in passing, that the Labor Party seems to hold a difierent view in government to some of the views that it held in Opposition. The power of the Minister to intervene in such matters is a typical example. I should like to quote from the Hansard debates of November 1971. I should like, in particular, to refer to some of the remarks of the present Minister for Housing and Construction when in Opposition. On page 3830 of the Hansard of November 1971, when discussing the War Services Homes Bill, the present Minister is reported as follows: People do not want to be subjected to the bureacracyI am sure he will remember making these comincrease. The rate of interest will be 7!4 per cent. mentsOr the goodwill of a Minister or anybody else, and here I believe there is an obligation on the pan of the Government the intention of the Government to reduce the to look at the basic requirement of these people who can be term of the loans from 45 to 32 years. Although in most distressing circumstances. His colleague, the present Prime Minister( Mr can Whitlam) had something similar to say on this speech or in the Bill. But I understand that that is issue. At page 3813 of Hansard of the same date the intention of the Government. The combihe is reported as having said: There have been many restrictions on eligibility for war repayments. I have worked out that on a loan of service homes. These restrictions were brought in by administrative action. The first lot were introduced in the credit $12,000 at the old rate of 3% per cent over 32 squeeze of 1951. The second lot were brought in during the : credit squeeze of 1961. Both rationing schemes are still there. As an aside I think I must say that they are still here now. The present Prime Minister then referred to an amendment that was moved by the honourable member for Reid who is now the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Uren) which was seconded by the present Minister for Housing and Construction. The Prime Minister said further The amendments that the honourable member for Reid has proposed are designed to see that restrictions on the entitlement to war service homes are not brought in by Ministerial action and that at least the Parliament can pass upon restrictions which are imposed. He went on to say-and I agree with him: Surely we have reached the stage where we can enlarge the entitlement to war service homes. Mr Les Johnson-We have done that. that the Government has done that. Earlier in my speech I paid a tribute to the Government which has done a great deal in this legislation. But members of the Government, when in Opposition, said they would do a great deal more. Now that they have the power to do these things, they are not happening. I do not know how much one should labour the point but on the same date the present Minister for Urban and Regional Development moved an amendment to our legislation which incorporated the remarks that I have just quoted. I do not wish to waste the time of the House by reading them again. I wonder why it is that the present Government does not enlarge the entitlement to war service homes. In this particular Bill we have seen other examples of ministerial powers introduced and sponsored by the Minister which are in absolute contradiction to views expressed by members of the Government when in Opposition. The Government also proposes to lift the upper limit of a war service loan or a defence service home loan from $12,000 to $15,000 and charge a higher rate of interest on the $3,000 I understand-the Minister might care to confirm this although I believe that it is a fact-that it is the Minister confirms this, I do not think that I find it anywhere in the second reading nation of the higher interest rates and a shorter term will obviously mean higher monthly",73,Defence Service Homes Bill 1974
150,Mr Mcleay,"The Minister interjects, fairly,years, the monthly repayment would be $53.70 a month. Using the additional $3,0001 would think just about everybody will be doing thatat the rate of TA per cent, an extra payment will be required of $20.12. According to my calculations this will mean a total repayment of $73.82 a month. Certainly those who are making additions will use the additional $3,000. We on this side of the House have mixed feelings about the increased rate of interest which is to apply to the upper limits of ex-service loans as a result or this legislation. I believe that my colleague, the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Kevin Cairns) will be moving an amendment, on his own behalf, in the committee stage of the debate. We recognise that 7% per cent is definitely a concessional rate of interest. In fact, introducing this new rate of 714 per cent. I am not the defence services homes mortgagor on the maximum loan is being subsidised by as much as 8V4 per cent on most of the advance and by 4% per cent on the balance, which I believe is a saving of about $1,000 a year when compared to most others in the community-perhap s to people buying a home through a bank of through a co-operative permanent building society. The problem is that every time the Government tinkers with interest rates it creates anomalies. We saw that happen last week in the debate on the concessional rate for what is called the 'low income earner' in relation to the welfare housing agreement. I should like to mention at this stageI have mentioned it before-that there is becoming a real jungle of interest rates. At the moment we have a concessional rate of 5V6 per cent on the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement5 h per cent. On the second concessional rate, at l least through the Savings Bank of South Australia, there is a 6% per cent interest rate and the private banks are charging 10 to 11'A per cent. Mr Kevin Cairns-It is a real mess. real mess. I believe that the interest structure in Australia can only be described as a jungle. One is lucky to borrow from the banks at 10 per cent or 11 Vi per cent, according to whether one is going to live in the home and according to the value of the home. The Commonwealth Bank, at its most favoured rate, lends at 9V* per cent. The co-operatives lend at 1W* per cent to 12 per cent, depending on the State in which one lives. It is less than that in South Australia. Bridging finance ranges at the moment-if one can get hold of it-fro m \9Yi per cent to 24 per cent. able member is trying to make? is that every time we introduce a new interest rate into the interest structure we only add to the jungle and to the discrimination. Mr Les Johnson-Why should not there be varying interest rates? Do you think that everybody should pay the same? the House to the fact that we have 7 or 8 different rates in the market place. Now we have 9 or 10 different rates, whichever way one counts, by denying that it is a concessional rate. I am saying that it is. But it is interfering with the whole rate structure that we have in the country at the moment. In the present legislation the Government is really saying that the old war service homes rate of 3% per cent is never likely to move past an advance of $12,000. A modest home, I suggest, in 5 or 6 years time, at the present rate of inflation will cost $100,000-o r some astronomical figure. The maximum first mortgage available to ex-servicemen will still be only $ 12,000 at 3% per cent. Presumably, the balance will be payable at this concessional rate which is 2 per cent below the most favoured rate. The point that I make here is that at some time in the future ex-servicemen will be disadvantaged to the extent that the biggest amount of money they will have to find will not be for the mortgage, first or second, but for the deposit. They wUl not be in any different situationMr Les Johnson-You would expect something to happen aboutsure, because we will be re-elected as the Government and we will put some common sense back into the interest rate structure. I believe that in a neat way this is how the Government is working up to kill its obligation to ex-servicemen. It is an absolute repudiationagainst ex-servicemen.

This is not simply something that has been pulled out of a hat. This is the policy of our Party. This was accepted by the last Labor Party conference, held at Launceston, and this action was taken after an evaluation of the whole situation in regard to housing costs with a view to finding a realistic level of costs.

It is now enlistment and enlistment alone which achieves eligibility for this greatly subsidised housing loan. Many people who served within Australia during World War II, some at very great personal risk and discomfort, have been ineligible for a war service loan. The numbers are not great. I admit that I do not know what the numbers are but they cannot be great and the cost of providingfinancewould not be high. We on this side of the House believe strongly, and I believe honourable members on the other side of the House believe, that the overwhelming majority of these men and women served their country well and it was not their fault that they did not serve outside Australia.

Society is changing. Standards are changing. Values are changing. What altered our view-certainl y my own view-of this was the legislation the Government introduced which changed the basis for the loan to be granted from one of service to one of enlistment. It seems to us that people who were willing to serve in World War II and who just did not get outside Australia are as entitled to a war service loan as those who are now enlisting with very little UkeUhood of ever being shot at. The present Minister for Housing, when in opposition, had this to say: The first amendment was to provide that former members of the forces who had been honourably discharged should be entitled to war service homes. I am sure the Minister wUl remember saying that. We agree with him. We ask him to set aside any partisan political point of view and to accept our amendment to include those people as being eligible for a war service loan. I wish to refer to another matter.

Today with respect to this legislauon the Opposition has moved an amendment seeking to increase the loan from $15,000 to $18,000. When honourable members opposite were in government, a short while ago-it is not 2 years yet-$9,00 0 was considered sufficient. This Government by this legislauon increases the loan to $15,000.1 cannotfigureout the exact percentage increase off the top of my head, but the increase is fairly substantial. Now the Opposition, which is going to prune Government expenditure, seeks to increase that sum to $18,000. The honourable member for Boothby also for Housing and Construction ( Mr Les Johnson), said that housing costs had increased, as a result who said: of inflation, by 50 per cent from 1971 to 1974, as he neatly put it. I hate to remind honourable balance members opposite, but 1971 and 1972 were the quisition of another propeny in special circumstances. years of a Liberal Government.

The fundamental purpose of the Bill is to increase the amount ofloan in respect of defence service homes. That amount was increased initially from $9,000 to $12,000. By this legislation, the Government seeks to raise that sum to $15,000. There are some important and significant parts of this Bill. I refer first to the liberalisation of the legislation for single men and widows. Last year, we amended the legislation to make single and widowed females eligible for the benefit. This Bill provides a further extension to single men and widowers. I quote from the second reading speech of the Minister The Bill contains limited provisions which will enable the of an existing loan to be made available fbr the acarea, be it the central coast of New South Wales, the Blue Mountains, the Gold Coast or some other region. They find their income has diminished, they are near the age when they will I think this Bill provides a tremendous second loan will become easier to obtain. However it will still be given only in special circumstances, but nevertheless it will give a greater opportunity to people who, through ill-health or another portion of the Minister's second reading speech in which he said:",79,Defence Service Homes

I listened to the honourable member for Boothby, who made quite a Fuss about special interest rates. He was concerned that all sorts of varying interest rates exist in the community at the moment. I noticed that the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Kevin Cairns) nodded his head in agreement with him. here. But I found this quite surprising because I cannot find anything strange in the fact that interest rates vary. I think that is a desirable thing. Those honourable members who have business experience-ther e are very few on the other side of the House-kno w that it is desirable that there should be varying interest rates because of the risks involved in lending money, the social objective in the money being lent, the term of the loan and so on. This is quite clearly a matter in which there is a social objective to reward those ex-servicemen who served their country overseas and in more recent times those who enlisted in the Services but did not necessarily serve overseas. That is the objective of this Bill. I cannot quite understand what the honourable member for Boothby was on about when he expressed surprise that there are varying interest rates. There always will be because of the varying price for money. The price varies for money as it does for any other commodity in our community, and so it should do. difference between 3% per cent and 12 per cent? made is that the present rate of 3% per cent has existed since 1946. Since then the long term bond rate has risen from 3% per cent to 9Vi per cent per annum. I shall quote again from the Minister's second reading speech in which he said: It is proposed that the prescribed rate shall be 2 per cent the magnificent job he has done in regard to debelow thc most favourable rate charged by the Commonfence service homes. It is a credit to him and a wealth Savings Bank on housing loans. The most favourable rate at present is 9'A per cent and accordingly the Bill procredit to the Government that at last exvides that the prescribed rate of interest shall be TA per cent servicemen are no longer listening to the waffle per annum or such other rate as may be prescribed. rates?

I support the Bill and reject the amendhigher rate is applicable only to the amount over ment. $12,000, up to the maximum total loan of $15,000. too closely. struction complains that there is a privileged section of the community getting money very cheaply. On the other hand he now claims that they should get money cheaply. Mr Les Johnson-They are getting more at 3% per cent now than they ever had before. point that they are now getting$ 12,000 at 3% per cent. Under the previous Liberal-Country Party Government they got $9,000 at 3}i per cent. They are now able to get the other $3,000 at TV* per cent. I can assure honourable members that this is still a very handsome interest rate. It is a balance, if you like, between a special reward for service and economic responsibility. not? the last $3,000.1 am really quite staggered that a Country Party member could manage to work out that it is double the rate. It did not occur to me that the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr King) had these skills. Finally, I would like to refer to thefiguresprovided by the Minister with regard to Labor's achievements in housing. In the comparisons of expenditure, the Minister points out that in the year 1972-73, which was the year of the last Liberal Budget, $74.3m was provided for defence service homes. In 1973-74, this amount was increased to $102m. In 1974-75-for our Country Party friends, that is the year we are now in-the amount provided is $115m. are they? the honourable member for Riverina. They are $74.3m, $102m and $U5m.

(2) In what profitable ventures bas the corporauon been involved. (3) In these instances, what investment has the Corporauon made, and what proportion is this investment to total (4) Will the Minister name these other sources. provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) 1 refer the honourable member to the Annual Repons of the Australian Film Development Corporauon. (2) and (3) The Corporation receives confidential information on the profitability, or otherwise, of individual projects in its normal course of business. It would be improper for the Corporauon to disclose individual cases without the express consent of each of the other parties involved. As to 30 June 1974 the Corporauon has fully recovered its investment in one feature film and four documentaries, including pronts: this amounts to $466,972. Ai the same date, the Corporauon has had fully repaid, loans totalling $533,505 on four feature films, six television series and two animated television series. The Corporation has functioned for approximately four (4) years and, i am informed, at a total cost to the Australian community of $261,528. The Corporation is not merely concerned with nnanciai pronts, and the fact that some film producers are now sufficiently established to obtain finance totally from private sources is, in another sense, another measure of profitability of the Corporation. The Corporation has published its investment criteria in the Annual Repon for 1974, and in this regard, I would refer the honourable member to the paragraphs dealing with the Selection of Projects, Pre-production Finance and Financial Policy and Terms of Assistance. (4) This information comes to the Corporation on a confidential basis and therefore must be so treated by the Corporation. Electoral: Result of Federal Election (Question No. 818) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Services and Property, upon notice: What was the result in each sub-division in the State of New South Wales in the election for the House of Representatives held on 18 May 1974. member's question is as follows: I refer the honourable member to the answer supplied to Question No. 713.

(2) If these estimates are available, will he table the basis for them. able member's question is as follows: Whilst the Gidgealpa-Sydney pipeline will form pan of the national pipeline grid the initial carriage of gas through the pipeline will be for the Australian Gas Light Company. Estimates of the volumes to be carried in the early years of the life of the pipeline are therefore related to the AGL's estimates of sales in the Sydney Region which it would not be proper for me to disclose. Details could be sought from the Company by the right honourable member. Physiotherapy: Increased Government Benefits 1973, undertook a survey, in the form of a questionnaire (Question No. 1124) Mr Hodges asked the Minister for Social dards. The results of the Survey were presented to a meeting Security, upon notice: (1) Does the Government support the view that physiotherapy is an important form of medical treatment Society, the Australian Medical Association and physicians which is recommended by the medical profession in a frein charge of diabetic clinics resolved not to alter the present quency which is increasing as the AustraUan public rightly Australian standard insulin syringe (AS T29). seeks to obtain the best quality of medical care. (2) If so, does the Government propose to provide worthbefore use. Insulin dependent diabetics in their own homes while Commonwealth benefits for this service provided by normally boil the re-usable syringe to ensure sterility. private physiotherapists, as the distance to public hospitals makes travel to them prohibitive for many patients by virtue single use syringe (sterile) for insulin injection (AS 1077) of the condition requiring treatment. member's question is as follows: (1) The medical profession refers patients for where new diabetics are trained to use them. Because of their physiotherapy treatment presumably in the belief that the practical advantages, the demand for single use syringes and quality of medical care is enhanced. (2) The Government accepts this belief, however, as was the case with previous Liberal/Country Party Governments, pliances is currently examining insulin syringes and needles it sees real difficulties in providing Government health with a view to recommending that they be made available to insurance benefits for physiotherapy provided on a fee-forinsulin dependent diabetics. However, it is imponant that service basis by private physiotherapists. The incidence of insuring members of the population and dards for both single use and re-usable insuhn syringes and the consequential high rate of utilization under private feeneedles be agreed to for adoption as official Australian stanfor-service arrangements would undoubtedly impose prodards under the Therapeutic Goods Act. It will then be posshibitive costs on a Government subsidised physiotherapy ible to ensure that all insulin syringes and needles imponed insurance benefits scheme. To enable such a scheme to into AustraUa, as well as those manufactured locally, will remain financially viable, contribution rates would need to conform to the standards laid down. An investigation of be increased steeply. For the purposes of the AustraUan Health Insurance Program, the Government has accepted the Health Insurance Planning Committee's recommendation that Government suppon for physiotherapy services be directed to organizations which provide services on other than a fee-for-service basis. The Government will be prepared to consider contractual, sessional salaried or similar arrangements for the provision of physiotherapy services and under the Health Insurance Program will offer health services agreements to allow such services to be developed on a community basis. In this regard it will be guided by the advice of the Hospitals and Health Services Commission in allocating such grants. Additionally, private health insurance organizations will be permitted to offer benefits coverage towards the costs of ancillary and allied health services of the nature of physiotherapy provided by private practitioners where they demonstrate that such arrangements will be financially viable. Standard Insulin Syringe (Question No. 1164) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: What progress has been made with the development and acceptance of a standard insulin syringe. able member's question is as follows: The Australian standard insuhn syringe (AS T29) was approved on behalf of the Council of the Standards Association of Australia in 1963 and revised in 1968. Because of criticism of the standard, the Association's Committee MD/2Hypodermic Equipment for InsuUn Injection, in December posted to a comprehensive range of interested bodies throughout AustraUa, regarding a review of existing stanof Committee MD/2, held in May 1974 to consider the standard. The Committee, which includes representatives of the Diabetes Federation of Australia, the Australian Diabetes The AS T29 is a re-usable syringe which must be sterilised The equivalent to the AS T29 in a disposable syringe is the which was approved on behalf of the Council of the Stanadvantages, disposable single use. syringes and disposable needles have been introduced into Australian hospitals needles by insulin dependent diabetics is increasing. The Working Pany on Medical and Surgical Aids and Apbefore such a recommendation is made, appropriate stanstandards for this purpose is at present being undenaken in the Depanment of Health.

366,Mr Daly,"The answer to the honourableI refer the honourable member to the answer suppUed to question No. 479 which appeared in Hansard 31 October 1974, pages 3247-8. Regional Employment Development Scheme (Question No. 1272) Mr Malcolm Fraser asked the Minister for Labor and Immigrauon, upon nouce: (1) What projects have been approved in each Electoral Division under the Regional Employment Development Scheme. (2) What is the cost of each project. (3) Who proposed it. (4) Who is administering it. Mr Clyde Cameron-The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: (1), (2), (3) & (4) The detailed information requested is not readily available. It would take considerable time to obtain and I would not deem it proper at this stage to divert the officers concerned with the Regional Employment Development Scheme from their imponant task of getting the unemployment into employment. However, I am able to say that at 22 November, 68 Commonwealth Employment Service areas and 19 individual local government areas were declared as eligible for assistance under the Regional Employment Development Scheme in view of the level of unemployment in these districts. At the same date projects costing a total of around $ 14.5m had been approved or provisionally approved. In further general response to the honourable member's ? |uestion I can say that the majority of proposals received so ar have been put up by local government authorities. A small number has been proposed by community organisations such as Rotary and various sporting clubs and by State Government depanments and instrumentalities. Each sponsoring organisation is required to administer its own project and to furnish my Depanment with regular statements of expenditure and brief progress repons. In the case of community organisations they are encouraged to arrange for the local government authority in their area to exercise oversight of their projects. Unemployment (Question No. 1367) Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Labor and Immigrauon, upon notice: Will he provide statistics calculated on the same basis to compare the levels of unemployment for each month of (a) 1972 and(b) 1974 to September. Mr Clyde CameronI am informed that the answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: The following table provides statistics of unemployed pernotice: sons registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service for each month of 1972 and for the first 9 months of 1974. The figures for 1974 are based on the definiuon of registered unemployed which applied prior to the introduction in July 1973 of a new definition of unemployed school leavers and are therefore comparable with the 1972 figures. The practice introduced on an interim basis in July 1973 of compiling statistics on the old definition of unemployed school leavers was discontinued in October 1974 when the Commonwealth Statistician made available seasonal adjustment factors for the new series.

This policy has been published in the Labor Pany's Platform, Constitution and Rules which I commend to the honourable member's attention. Thus the Australian people have not been awaiting a statement of policy for the last 19 months. In giving effect to its policy, the Australian Government is, of course, willing to hold discussions with interested parties, including the European Economic Community, on specific issues as the need arises. 'Investigator's' Anchor (Question No. 1479) Mr Bungey asked the Prime Minister, upon (1) Has the Western Australian Government been advised that the stream-anchor from Matthew Flinders' ship 'Investigator', recovered in 1973 in Goose Island Bay, may be placed on public display in Western Australia until late in 1975, but that it is then to be permanently located in Canberra. (2) If so, have representations been received from the Western Australian Government for a review of this decision, with a request that the stream-anchor be placed in the Fremantle Maritime Museum; if so, what decision has been made.",102,Answers To Questions Upon Notice
367,Mr Connor,"The answer to the honourableMr Whitlam The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The anchor was recovered by the Department of Transpon in 1973 and was subsequently restored at the Conservauon Laboratory of the Western Australian Museum on behalf of the Australian Government. Because of the importance of Flinders' voyages and the interest of all Australians in the work of the navigator, it was decided that the anchor should be retained by the Australian Government. Following representations from the Western Australian Government seeking to have the anchor displayed permanently in Western Australia. I advised the Premier on 7 August 1974 that, while the anchor is to remain the property of the Australian Government, it would be made available for display in Western Australia until the end of 1975 when it is to be brought to Canberra for display in the National Capital. This decision was taken as a gesture in response to the State's cooperation in restoring the anchor. (2) The Premier of Western Australia wrote to me again on 18 September 1974 noting the. Australian Government's wish to display the anchor in Canberra after 1975. Also, he expressed the hope that in the meantime the Australian Government may be persuaded that the Fremantle Maritime Museum, is a suitable permanent repository for the anchor.

Murray Valley Encephalitis (Question No. 1505) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon nodce: (1) Has he received any requests from State Ministers for Health, medical bodies or private individuals to rename Murray Valley Encephalitis. (2) Has he or any medical body under his. control discussed this matter and/or made any recommendations to change the name. able member's quesuon is as follows: (1) Several such requests have been received. (2) The matter has been discussed by the National Health and Medical Research Council which has recommended that the name of the disease be changed to Australian arbo enhonourable member's question is as follows: cephalitis. 1 have accepted this recommendation. The change has now been referred to the World Health Organization for to the Prime Minister's answer to Question No. 41 on the consideration. Port Augusta, South Australia: Establishment of Office of the Department of Social Security (Question No. 1514) Mr Wallis asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: Are there any plans for the establishment of an office ofhis Depanment in Pon Augusta, South Australia. If so, when is it anticipated that the office will be operadonal. member's question is as follows: There has been no approval given for the establishment of an office of the Depanment of Social Security in Pon Augusta, South Australia. Bruce: Unemployment (Question No. 1714) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: (1) How many people in each subdivision of the Electoral Division of Bruce are unemployed at the present time. (2) How many of those unemployed are registered for unemployment. (3) How many are receiving unemployment benefits. Mr Clyde Cameron-The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: ( I ) and (2) The right honourable member should be aware that the Depanment of Labor and Immigration statistics of unemployed are not compiled according to electoral divisions. However, lam informed that the number of unemployed registered at the end of October in the 3 Employment Office areas of Waverley, Boronia and Box Hill, only pans of which comprise the electoral division of Bruce, is as follows: Waverley 309; Boronia 687; Box Hill 777. Thus the number of registered unemployed in the Bruce electoral division would be less than the sum of the above 3 figures. There is no basis, however, for quantifying it. (3) The information in the form requested by the right honourable member is not available. Ministerial Councils: Contact with States (Question No. 61) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: (1) Will he provide a list of all formal committees, councils, etc, that have been established which enable him or officers of his Depanment to maintain contact with State Government Ministers or State Government officers. (2) When was each body established and by whom. (3) What is the (a) composition and (b) function of each body. (4) On what occasions has each body met in the last 2 years and for what purpose.

Solar Energy Research Projects (Question No. 447) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Science, upon notice: (1) Will he provide a list of all solar energy research projects being undertaken in Australia which are receiving financial support from the Government. (2) What proportion does this represent of funds allocated by all sources in Australia to research projects into the applied use of solar energy. (3) What is the purpose of each project. (4) How many people are involved in each project. (5) Where is the research being undertaken. (6) What support is the Goverament providing for each project, and how is it provided. honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (6) A complete answer to the question is not possible because of difficulties in denning the limits of solar energy research, and because of the mechanisms by which some research funds are allocated. Such information as is available, relating to projects supported by the Australian Research Grants Committee, by CSIRO and in some of the Universities, is attached. In addition to the support listed, it is recognised that some part of the research funds allocated by the Australian Universities Commission and the Australian Industrial Research and Development Grants Board are used to support solar energy research, however the way in which those funds are allocated does not permit identification of projects directed to particular areas.

National Companies Legislation (Question No. 460) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice: (1) What stage has the proposed national companies legislation reached, and when can its introduction be expected. (2) What safeguards will the legislation contain to ensure (a) that shareholders and prospective investors are adequately protected from managements and promoters and (b) that the operations and activities of major corporations are such as to promote the interests of their employees and the public. (3) Will the proposed Superior Court have a compames division with adequate powers and judges skilled enough in this part of the law to ensure that such safeguards are fully and speedily enforced. vided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2)1 expect that a Bill dealing with a wide range of companies matters will be introduced in this session of Parliament. The BiU will be primarily concerned with matters of concern to the investing public and will take into account, amongst other things, the report of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange. A further Bill will follow and deal with matters concerning the structures of Consulate for a visa, and a person residing in one of the three companies such as their incorporation, voting rights and winding up. (3) I would expect that the safeguards the honourable member has in mind would be fully and speedily enforceable through the Commercial Division of the proposed Superior Court, and that the Court would have adequate powers and Judges skilled in this part of the law to enable this to be achieved. Ravensthorpe: Television Reception (Question No. 947) Mr Bungey asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Media, upon notice: (1) Have plans been approved for provision of television in the Ravensthorpe area? (2) If not, when will investigation and planning begin? (3) When can residents of Ravensthorpe expect to be able to receive reasonable reception of ABC television programs? supphed the following answers to the honourable member's question: (l)No. (2) I am advised by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board which is the independent statutory body established by Parliament under the Broadcasting and Television Act that Ravensthorpe is on the Board's program for investigation, but having regard to existing commitments it is not expected that investigation and planning will commence before 1976. (3) I am also informed that there is some doubt that a service could be provided to the Ravensthorpe area at an acceptable cost, bearing in mind that there are only 225 people in the Ravensthorpe rural area and it is 100 miles from Esperance and 150 miles from Mount Barker. If a service was approved, it would probably be installed some three years after the investigations. Baltic States (Question No. 1120) Mr Scholes asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: 1. Prior to the recognition of the USSR. as the effective government of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, what arrangements existed between those countries and Australia for (a) extradition, (b) travel to those countries by Australian citizens and (c) application for residence in Australia. 2. Does recognition by AustraUa mean support of the particular government. 3. Which Government was recognised as the government of the Baltic States prior to the recognition of the USSR. as the effective government. vided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 1. Prior to the recognition of the incorporation of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania into the Soviet Union as de jure incorporation, there was no extradition treaty in force between Australia and the USSR. Australian citizens wishing to visit the three Baltic States had to apply to a Soviet Embassy or Baltic States who wished to enter Australia as a migrant had to comply with the relevant provisions of Soviet law regarding exit permits and had to apply to the Australian Embassy in Moscow for a migrant visa. Before 1940, Australia had succeeded to extradition treaties with the Governments which controlled the Baltic States up to the time of the incorporation. After the Soviet Union seized control of the States, these treaties remained in force in theory, but in practice ceased to have any effect. The Leader of the Opposition, when Attorney-General, clearly accepted this situation in the debate on the Extradition (Foreign States) Bill 1966. The recognition of the incorporation as incorporation de jure thus simply accepts what has been a reality for over thirty years. 2. Recognition does not necessarily imply either approval of the way in which governmental control was established or of the controlling government's policies; it is rather an acknowledgement of existing realities. 3. During the period before Australia's recognition of the incorporation of the area into the USSR. Australia had no formal governmental relations with the three governments which as members of the Soviet Union were effectively administering the Baltic States. Nor did Australia have effective relations with governments in exile. Australia accepted, however, the de facto situation that the Soviet Government was in effective control of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.",105,Energy During 1974

(2) Which officers and employees took pan. (3) How many officers and employees took pan. (4) What was the purpose of each of the exercises. (5) Does he accept that this is an area where the Australian Government can give a lead to other employers. able member's question is as follows: (1) to (4) The Department of Manufacturing Industry attaches considerable importance to civil defence preparedness, which is closely linked with the safety programmes and procedures of the Government factories operated by the Depanment. Each establishment has developed plans to be put into effect in emergency situations. Staff are trained to man the plans, including in such aspects as fire prevention, fire fighting, equipment maintenance, first aid and demolition and rescue operations. Depanmental fire crews co-operate with and back up local authorities. Selected staff attend the civil defence training centre at Mt Macedon. Exercises, which vary from the occasional evacuation of buildings to frequent drilling in panicular activities, are carried out as considered necessary by each establishment. As examples, the Explosives Factories conduct exercises at least quanerly in relation to the panicular nature of their operations and the fire teams at Aircraft Factories carry out exercises at least monthly. It is not practicable to separate civil defence from general safety exercises in the establishments. As a rough estimate, the number of specific exercises carried out by the Department as a whole over the past 18 months would exceed 100, including 3 major evacuation of buildings. (5) Yes. Gurindji Tribe (Question No. 1305) Mr Hunt asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice: (1) In view of the report from the Woodward Commission of Inquiry into Land Rights for Aborigines, has the Government now determined on what basis it will proceed to provide land for the Gurindji at Wattie Creek (Daguragu). (2) Will people of tribal origins, other than Gurindji, living at Wattie Creek be able to share in the land obtained by the Gurindji. (3) Can the Minister indicate when he will make a firm announcement on this matter. Affairs has provided the following reply to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. Negotiations are proceeding in relation to thc granting of a pastoral lease for the Aboriginal community. (2) This will be a decision for the traditional owners of the land, the Gurindji. (3)1 expect to be in a position to make an announcement in the near future.

(2) If so, has this deficiency since been remedied. member's question is as follows: (1) Paragraph 195 of the Report said: 'So far as the Committee can ascertain there is not even one lawyer in the Attorney-General*s Department or in any of the Defence Group of Departments who has specialised knowledge of United States procurement law'. (2) There are officers in the Department of Defence and in the Attorney-General's Department who are knowledgeable in United States procurement law.

378,Mr Barnard,"The answer to the honourable(1) Could the Island Lagoon Tracking Station have been used to receive 'real time' data from the ERTS Satellite? member's question is as follows: (1) The possibility of using the Island Lagoon Tracking Station to receive 'real time' data from the ERTS was considered last year. It was found that considerable modification and additional equipment would have been necessary. The cost of these alterations would have been prohibitive. Members of a team of Australian scientists have recendy visited the United States, Brazil and Canada to study ERTS technology and shortly will report on its application to Australia. I envisage that, when these reports are available, the fullest discussion will be encouraged with those agencies likely to be concerned with any application of ERTS data so that a sound basis will be available for decision on any future involvement in ERTS programs. (2) The Island Lagoon Tracking Station was dismantled in late 1973 as the interest shown by the scientific commumty did not warrant its retention. Weather Forecasts (Question No. 1499) Mr Street asked the Minister for Science, upon notice: (1) What alterations will be made to existing arrangements relating to the issue of weather forecasts as foreshadowed by his reply to my question without notice of 17 October 1974. (2) Will there be any reduction in the number and/or type of weather forecasts for the aviation industry. (3) Is there any intention to make a nnanciai charge to any users of weather forecasts. member's question is as follows: (1) The Bureau of Meteorology provides a complex and Australia and overseas, with a view to establishing sole rights costly range of services for the community, public authorities to that patent. and commercial organisations. Since its budget, manpower and operations have increased markedly in recent years, I torneys. want to be assured that its services are timely and efficient, that they meet contemporary needs and that they represent the most effective utilisation of the funds provided. I have therefore arranged for a comprehensive review of people the Bureau's operauons and services to be carried out, startof ing with an assessment of community needs. Arrangements thedollars with the States for the provision of forecasts and warnings in a process will be closely examined, as will arrangements for services to Australian Government departments including Transport, Defence and the Ausualian Post Office. Also coming under member's question is as follows: scrutiny will be special arrangements with particular bodies, e.g., that with the Australian Water Resources Council in respect of hydrometeorotogy. The circumstances under systems, does not guarantee the validity of patents granted which the Bureau provides special forecasts, data and advice under it. However, by conducting searches of material to industry, other commercial organisations and private conpublished in AustraUa and by requiring amendments to be sultants, will be reviewed as will the scale of charges for made to applications and complete specifications, the Patent those services. The reviews which I have called for will not be limited to opposition proceedings by interested persons before grant, considerauon of the expressed needs of those requiring with the oportunity of appealing to the High Court, further meteorological services, but will also encompass examinreduces the number of invaUd patents granted. The question ation of the Bureau's more costly operations. Three particuofthe vaUdity of a patent is ultimately a matter to be deterlar items for study are: (i) the international commitments associated with vaUdity of a patent is rarely attacked once the patent has membership of the World Meteorological Organisbeen granted. It is estimated from Patent Office records that ation and the running of a World Meteorological since 1901 there have been only about 20 instances where Centre in Melbourne; (ii) the extensive weather observational infrastructure supported by the Bureau including the weather watch radar and the automatic weather station networks, conventional Bureau-manned stations and the use of non-Bureau observers for rainfall,riverheights, etc.; and (iii) the large data bank which is maintained on meteorological and climatological variables. (2) I would not wish to pre-empt the results of the review to which I have referred. However, if there are changes of any sort in the number and/or type of weather forecasts for the aviation industry, and I have no reason to believe there would be, this would come about solely because a more efficient and economical service could be provided with no detriment to safety. (3) Some changes are already made, as they have been for many years. For example the Department of Transport nnances the Bureau's services to aviation and makes recoveries from airUne operators to offset these charges. Total revenue for meteorological services for 1974-75 has been estimated at a little over SlOm of which approximately $8.5m will come from the Department of Transport. We will be reviewing, with AustraUan Government Agencies, the costs that should be recovered for services provided to them. Such agencies include the Department of Transport, the Department of Defence, and the Department of the Environment and Conservation. We will also be reviewing the scale of charges for services to commercial organisations to align them with commercial rates.

381,Mr Morrison,"The answer to the honourableattacked, in whole or in pan, in the Coun. This would indicate that there is a general acceptance of a patent by the public once it has been granted. In view of the opponunites that exist to prevent the grant of invalid patents and the general acceptance by the public of patents that are granted, the present system is considered to be satisfactory. (2) and (3) Under the Patents Act, Examiners of Patents, who are specially trained in patent law and searching techniques by the Patent Office, are required to conduct a search of Australian specifications and, when directed by the Commissioner of Patents, other documents published in Australia. No search is required to be made of overseas specifications or documents not published in AustraUa. Individual patent attorneys may, and I understand frequently do, conduct wider searches and often invoke the services of overseas searching organisations. Australia is one of the few countries in the world that provides searching facilities at sub-offices for use by applicants and patent attorneys. The sub-offices are located in each of the various States. (4) and (S) It is not possible to estimate the validity of patents recently granted. It is unlikely, judging by past experience, that the validity of many of the patents will ever be tested in the Coun. Of the patents that are tested, it is unterial press releases. likely that many would be held to be invalid in their entirety, although one or more claims of the complete specification of a patent may be held invalid. It is not considered that the Australian patent system is inefficient in providing adequate protection to the Australian inventor. Low Fat Butter (Question No. 1518) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, upon notice: (1) What research or commercial trials are being conducted into a low fat butter of about 40 per cent butterfat with milk protein added. (2) Can the Minister say what countnes other than West Germany have introduced a low fat butter, and what success all of these countries have had with it. has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Several years ago, a low fat butter was manufactured and sold in South Australia under the name of 'Mingle'. The product was withdrawn from the market after a shon period. Recently some experiments in the production of low-fat butter were conducted by the Victorian Depanment of Agriculture at the Gilben Chandler Institute of Dairy Technology, Werribee. A spread containing about 40 per cent milkfat was prepared and had good consumer acceptance in the Werribee district. No further development work is planned, since it is known that independent research and commercial development of a similar product is being undertaken by a large dairy company in Melbourne (Petersville). The company hopes to be able to place the product on the market in the near future. (2) Low fat butter-like products have been introduced in the following countries: United States of America: where a spread based on about 30 per cent butterfat was made, but was not widely accepted. Czechoslovakia: where a butter containing 56 per cent butterfat, has been introduced, but no further details are known. Sweden: where a spread (Latt and Lagom) based on a 2 : 3 blend of soy bean oil and butterfat with a total oil and fat content of about 40 per cent has been introduced recently. It is probably too early to consider the success or failure of this product. United Kingdom: where a spread made of vegetable oil and skim milk solids, with an oil content of about 40 per cent has been introduced and is enjoying some success.
