But to return to The first proposal-the extension of time from the proposal, it really makes no difference if the 3 months to 12 months-is absolutely essential. amnesty is extended from 3 months to 12 months As I have already pointed out, we are dealing except that it gives more time for the amnesty to with very frightened people, people to whom work and that it makes it more hkely that the every omciai represents a threat. Many of these plight of these unfortunate people can be solved people come from countries in which the buonce and for all. reaucracy does not enjoy the same reputation for I turn to my second suggestion. It is that the impartiality that our Public Service enjoys.

One cause of great concern amongst our for one, two or three of their number to surface, ethnic communities is the proviso that under the to test the response and to report back to their existing conditions the amnesty is not available friends that the offer is a genuine one. Even withto people who have committed criminal offences. out this suspicion there is still the matter of time. The great fear these people have is that because As one of my Turkish friends pointed out, news their illegal status has forced them again and travels very slowly in their community. Many of again to break the law they will be denied the the potential beneficiaries of the amnesty are benefit of the amnesty. Many of them have not working on farms and in the country. It will take paid taxes. They have given false names to buy them time to learn of the offer. What possible property and to obtain drivers' Ucences. When difference can there be if the offer is extended for one looks at the various aspects of this matter the period that I propose? one can see that it is cenainiy complex.
