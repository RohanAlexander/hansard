WOOL: RESTRICTED PURCHASES. the honourable member for New England (Lt -Colonel Abbott) asked me the following question:In view of the fact that the purchases of wool are restricted to £10 in value, will the Acting Prime Minister state why it is that brokers in Sydney and Melbourne are allowed to make advances against small and large lots of wool, and charge what interest they like? Why is it that small men in the country are not allowed to get an advance from the country broker, but have to go cap in hand to the men in the big cities? I then gave an interim reply; but am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following additional information :The wool-selling brokers in Sydney, Melbourne, .and ojtber appraising centres, charge on wool advances as interest, the usual bank rates, varying from 5$ per cent, to 7 per cent.; in the majority of cases,. the rate is 6 per cent. Country brokers are allowed to make advances, but the transactions must be bond fide, and not a cloak to illicit dealing .and speculation in wool. Generally, country advances on wool are irregular purchases at considerably below the parity of 15^d. per lb. of greasy wool, with participation in the profits above the flat rate which belong to the wool-grower, and not. to the country speculator.

It is true that the persons in question wore convicted, not in September, 1916, but in October, 1917, oi offences against the Unlawful Associations Act, and sentenced to imprisonment. As they are both aliens, orders were made under the Aliens Restriction Order for their deportation, and for tlieir detention pending deportation. Owing to the shortage of shipping, it has not yet been possible to arrange for the deportation, but it is hoped that their deportation w ill take place shortly. 3. No. 4. See answer to Nos. 1 and 2. General) [2.53] -(B y leave.)I desire to inform the House of the financial results of working the Postal Department honourable member for Dampier( Mr for the fiscal year ending 30th June, Gregory) asked the following ques1918, as disclosed by the annual profit tions :and loss accounts, prepared on commercial lines, which have just been completed, as follows:Profit and Lost Account -Results. Yeai. Loss1912-13 . . 1913-14 Loss1014-15 . . Profit1915-18 . . ProfitLOBB1916-17 . . Profit1917-18 . . It will be remembered that I forecast a surplus for 1917-18. The actual figures show that there is a surplus or profit in all branches of the Department, amounting to £387,431 for the year. This result is better than the results of 1916-17, 1915-16, and 1914-15 by £564,577, £703,421, and £973,986, respectively. I am naturally delighted with the result as shown above, and desire to express my appreciation of the way in which the officers have loyally assisted in carrying out the policy of efficiency, economy, and expedition, laid down by the Ministerial head. The good result for 1917-18 is especially gratifying, as it has been achieved during a period in which the cost of working has been continually on the increase, and in which most carrying concerns have found it impossible to prevent a falling off in profit, or an increase in loss.

It was really that experience which prompted me to provide in th is B ill for his appointment as one of the Distribution Commissioners. In my judgment, it is wise for us to appoint a representative of the Commonwealth, who is absolutely neutral, in the person of the Chief Electoral Officer, and to associate with him the Surveyor-General of each State, and some third person. During the debate upon the motion for the second reading of the B ill , I called attention to this particular clause, and I would now like the Minister to say why only two officers are specified as being eligible for appointment as Distribution Commissioners? In the principal Act I know that only one officer is specified. Tlie Government are, therefore, endeavouring to effect an improvement in the law by providing for the appointment of tha Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth and the Surveyor-General of each State as two of the Distribution Commissioners. But why is the other appointment l e f t an open question? I have previously expressed the opinion that the Commonwealth Statistician is. perhaps, better qualified than is any other official to distribute Australia into electoral divisions. does he know about it? is the basis upon which the boundaries of each electoral division are determined, obviously he is the man who possesses all the information necessary to fit him for the task.

We have, therefore, in these two officers men who are specially qualified to act as Distribution Commissioners. But having filled two Of these positions, if we allow the third to remain open, the Government will have a free hand to appoint their own nominee. In other words, his qualifications will be a matter of secondary consideration.

The Surveyor-General is the best-equipped officer in that respect. After the appointment of that official, I would suggest that the Minister pause before putting very heavy additional duties upon the' Chief Electoral Officer. We all wish to see a fair distribution. No one desires that one electorate shall have twice the number of persons residing therein compared with another electorate, which is allowed to remain as it has been simply for party purposes or upon personal considerations. It is in the interest of good government that there should be no gerrymandering in the division of the different electorates; and it is essential, therefore, to appoint really good local men. In fact, each State should have its own Electoral Commission. Take the case of Queensland, for example. It would be well for the Surveyor-General of that State and the Deputy Chief Electoral Officer to comprise two of the three Commissioners. The Deputy Chief Electoral Officer, with his local knowledge of the State, would be an infinitely better choice than the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth. occur. The Chief Electoral Officer could not go to each State. Neither could the Commonwealth Statistician. my point. A t a time when the duties of the Chief Electoral Officer would be unusually heavy, it would be absurd to expect him to travel from State to State engaged in redistribution work. He would have to appoint a deputy. Therefore, why should not the Government provide in this Bil l that one of the Commissioners in each State shall be the Deputy Chief Electoral Officer? fact, I fail to see the necessity for altering the existing provision. If the Deputy Surveyor-General and the Deputy Chief Electoral Officer in each State were appointed, together with a third officer, who should be chosen from the State concerned because of special qualifications, a far better Commission would be created than the Government have suggested.

As to the personnel of the third Commissioner, it has been suggested that the Commonwealth Statistician should be appointed. But there is no official who can take his place in each of the States. There is no actual Deputy Commonwealth Statistician. For that reason, the Commonwealth Statistician has not been included. The appointment of the third official must be left to Ministerial discretion. If we could associate with the two officials already indicated a Judge of the Supreme Court of each State, such an appointment would supply all that could be desired. There would then be two expert members, and a judicial officer. regard this clause as one of great importance. Periodically it is necessary to further subdivide various electorates.

The clair) has cited cases having to do with undue influence exercised by Ministers in connection with elections. The same sort of thing can happen with the redistribution of seats, because it is provided that the Governor General may appoint one of the Commissioners to be chairman. The measure before the Committee does not set forth the personnel of the various State Commissioners. The practice is to wait until redistribution becomes necesone. sary, and then the Government decide who shall be appointed. Two officials are indicated, but the third person is left open to choice of the Government. The Government are to recommend a certain person to the Governor General for appointment in each State, and that individual is so appointed. To prevent interference, it would be far better to settle all doubt retribution, because, after all, that often garding who the three officials shall be. The appointments should be covered specifically by the Act itself. I am not opposed to the appointment of a Judge to act with the two expert officials in each State. Failing a Judge, I would favour the appointment of a Statistician. the personnel from Commonwealth interests altogether. We do not want all State men. The appointment of the third official should be left open. Commissioners consisting entirely of State officials raises a difficulty; but we have not qualified Commonwealth officials in each State to fill the positions, and to leave appointments to the Government at a time when redistribution becomes necessary may mean that the Government can appoint a person who will hold the balance of power upon the Commission. There is always a tendency for members of Parliament to be dissatisfied with whatever redistribution may be proposed; andj when they secure copies of the first plans, if the proposals do not suit them, influence may be brought to bear so that alterations of boundaries are secured. By appointing three officials for each State, and setting out those appointments definitely in the Act, the possibility of any undue influence would be removed. But if it is left to the Government to appoint the third man, naturally the dominant party will try to have the man who is most satisfactory from their point of view put on to the Commission, because^ after all, party politics do come into these matters. I am glad the Minister is in accord with the idea of removing that aspect as far as possible. to go further and appoint three. Then when a redistribution has to take place the Commission will simply have to be notified to set to work to fix the electoral boundaries of the State concerned. We are endeavouring by this measure to prevent undue influence in elections, and we should be just as particular about redisdetermines for nine or ten years who is to represent a certain constituency. the Chief State Electoral Officer one of the three? Who is appointed, .but if -any party has the opportunity to appoint' a .person who will be amenable to its wishes, it can so fix the electorates as to ensure in many cases the return of its own nominees. Almost any electorate can be cut upin such a manner as practically to make certain what candidate will be returned. A Commission should be appointed in whom we have confidence,, and when the work has to be done they can take it in hand and perform it in accordance with the quota and other essential pointslaid down in the Act. Once that is done, there should be no interferenceon the part of the Government or anybody else. If the Commission's decision oan be upset, objections will be raised to it, beeause it does not meet with the approval of some of those concerned, influence will be brought to bear, and the whole business will have to be reconsidered. That system should not be allowed to continue.

I disagree with the contention of the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Finlayson) that another officer under the control of the Federal Government should be added to the Commission. A good feature of the Redistribution Commission in the State of New South Wales was that it comprised independent State officers, who were not looking to the favours, rather than Federal officers, who naturally look to pleasing the Government with a view to their future advancement are happily situated, in that, under If this proposal, one member of the Commission is to be the State Chief Electoral Officer, who is most concerned in getting workable electorates, while the other two are to be entirely removed from the control of the Federal GovernPossibly undue influence ment.

While I am not opposed to the appointment of a Commission to deal with the redistribution of seats, supposing the present system is to be retained, I am against the clause as it stands, becaue it proposes to perpetuate the system of dividing the State into electorates which do not truly represent the people.

I have no -objection to an alteration of the Constitution. In fact, the sooner it is done, the better, from my point of view. The measure now before tlie Committee is intended to consolidate our electoral laws, and I think I am quite in order in attacking a principle which seeks to perpetuate the existing basis of representation. The interests of the people should not be determined by any false geographical division, but by their industrial affinities, their social life, and interests. If this reform were brought about on a scientific basis, the interests of our people would be more adequately safeguarded. We would then be concerned less with legislation for the individual as such than with legislation for the development of our industries, and advancing the industrial and social life of our people.

The clause states that the Governor General may appoint three Distribution Commissioners, whose duty it will be to divide a State into electoral I imagine that the divisions for the purpose of electing representatives to this Parliament. I am opposed to the' clause as a whole, because it seeks to perpetuate the existing system, which I contend is obsolete, and I urge that we should be more concerned about evolving a scientific re-organization of the people throughout Australia. Por this purpose I suggest a Convention to overhaul our whole system of representation, and, therefore, I think .my remarks were in order. But, of course, if we are going on with the existing system of selecting representatives according to the growth of population in the various centres, and of redistributing the seats on this basis, I agree with other honourable They members that the Distribution Commissioners should be free from the possibility of being charged with pandering to any particular party that might be in power.

The Commission charged with the alteration of electoral boundaries should be one in which the community will repose absolute confidence. A Commission composed of officials dependent for promotion on the Government of the day cannot inspire that confidence. Human nature being what it is, it is reasonable to think that such persons would not act with entire independence. In saying this I do not wish to reflect upon the particular officials occupying the positions named in the clause. They may be the most honourable and estimable persons in the world, but they may be succeeded by persons of quite opposite character. To obtain the confidence of the public, the Commission must be non-partisan, and I ' shall support any proposal to make it so. It is proposed that the Chief Electoral Officer and the Surveyor-General of the State, or officers having similar qualifications, shall be two members of the Commission, and the Governor-=General is to appoint a third, and is also to appoint one of the three to be chairman.. I am not in love with the suggestion that the third member of the Board should be a Judge. A Judge might do very well, but, on the other hand, he might not. Generally he would not. My opinion, and it is shared, I think, by honourable members and the public at large, is that Judges and lawyers concern themselves too much with the splitting of hairs, and lose in the time spent in the study of the law the human feelings which actuate most other members of the community.

On the other hand, there are some Victorian divisions in which the population is decreasing. When our soldiers return, the population will not increase in the country districts; any increase which there is will take place in urban districts. The InterState Commission is already inquiring into the scarcity of houses in the cities, and we see advertisements daily which have never found an appearance in metropolitan papers previously, offering premiums to people for the keys of empty houses. I am afraid that when our soldiers return there will be an increase in tbe city populations. it . This state of affairs is not peculiar to Australia. The concentration of the great masses of the people in urban areas is world wide.

The margin of one-fifth is too wide. There is no doubt about the wording of the Act. If one-fourth of the electorates in a State have populations more than one-fifth above or more than one-fifth below the quota there must be a redistribution of seats, and if tbe law is not carried out it is only so much waste of paper to re-enact the redistribution provisions in this measure. deals with that matter. be more than one-eighth. I remember the arguments which were put forward when it was claimed in this House that a redistribution should take place when one-fifth of the electorates of a State exceeded or fell below the margin of one-fifth. It was pointed out that, as there were only five electorates in Tasmania or in Western Australia, a redistribution of seats would become necessary in the event of any one electorate exceeding or fallin g below the one-fifth margin.

If there are no constitutional difficulties' 1 in the way, the proposal made by the honourable member for Darling( Mr debate upon the second reading of the Blakeley) should receive the earnest consideration of the Government. I should like the Minister in charge of the Bill( Mr Glynn) to advise the Committee as to the constitutional aspect of the amendment. This Parliament is placed at -a great disadvantage, owing to the fact ttiat the Federal Territories, which constitute the biggest developmental problems with which we have to deal, are not represented in it. The white populations of Papua and of the Northern Territory are so small as scarcely to warrant the election of a direct representative of each Territory, but on the principle that a man cannot represent' the same number of people in an enormous and sparselysettled territory that he can in a congested community, we ought to consider how far we should go in the direction of giving special representation to the Northern Territory. I believe that for several years we have suffered seriously in not having any representation of that Territory in this Parliament. Direct representation is the only means by which we can hope to impress upon the Parliament the need for a wide developmental policy for it. I hope the Minister will be able so to amend the Bill as to give effect to some principle of responsible representation in respect of the enormous Territories under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. Residents in the Federal Territory are alsoat a great disadvantage, and, if possible, they should be included with the electors of an adjoining Federal division. So faras the Federal Territory They is concerned, however, the want of direct representation does not affect us as a Parliament so seriously as does the nonrepresentation of the Northern Terri1 tory, for which we are directly responI t should be laid down in this sible, and the development and population of which is essential to the integrity and safety of the Commonwealth. I do not wish to deprive the Minister( Mr Glynn) of an opportunity to express his opinion on the amendment just moved, but am anxious that he should deal with its constitutional aspect after he has heard others who hold certain opinions with regard to it. During the BillI expressed views similar to those just uttered by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Sampson), and I think the general feeling of the Committee is that we should honestly face the position created by the non-representation of residents of the Northern Territory in the National Parliament. There seems to be a general desire that something should be done to meet their just and reasonable requests and rights in this respect. The Minister is so well acquainted with the position and so sympathetically interested in the question, that I am sure he can help us to a satisfactory solution of this problem. I should be glad also if he would enlighten the Committee on the point raised by the sidine) when we were dealing with an earlier clause. I refer to it here because one of the guiding factors for the Distribution Commissioners is that in the iivision of each State into electorates community or diversity of interest shall be, not the only, but the primary, consideration. We have arrived at a time when we should seriously consider whether those items specifically mentioned in this clause as the guiding factors for the Distribution Commissioners are really a proper basis for representation in the National Parliament. They are the persistence of past ideas and methods, whereas we are emerging, learning, and developing. Nothing would help us more quickly to rid politics of the narrow party divisions that every mem-",42,Chairman Ther E Is An Ministerial Interference The Honourable

Mr Chairman, whether the amendment is in order? Can we refer to the Distribution Commissioners the question of the enfranchisement of the people in the Federal Territories in view of the fact that the determination of the question does not rest with them? It is for the Parliament alone to decide, quite apart from what the Commissioners may consider to be right or wrong, what shall be done in the matter.

It has 'been contended that, as a result of the recent by-election for Swan, two-thirds of the electors in that constituency are practically disfranchised, because the successful candidate represents only one section of the community. But we must remember that, although we are elected by a certain section of the community, we are, after all, the representatives of our constituencies as a whole, and whilst it may not always be easy to get a community of interest amongst the various conflicting sections of the community in any one constituency, there are some honourable members who aet so fairly and squarely in the interests of the people in their electorates as to be really represenpresent methods. The very fact that the tative of their constituencies. member give every interest the same amount of representation? honourable member suggest that we should do as Sir William Irvine did in Victoria? member refers to the fact that Sir William Irvine, when Premier of Victoria, gave separate representation to the Railway and Public Service. His scheme failed because it was only partial, and only one section of the community that had a community of interest. If we had a general scheme to divide the whole community into sections, according to community of interest, we should remove many of our present difficulties. I invite honourable members to consider what would be the development in this Chamberi f representation were based on the community of interest as I have suggested. not then be. prominent. We should not have mere political platforms separating the two parties in the House, and Bills considered only from the aspect that one side accepted and the other rejected them. We should have members representing certain interests, and those interests would receive consideration from both sides of the House, and free from party influences. parties in the House under that system. . necessary under those circumstances to alter the arrangement of the House, and I believe that if we were to adopt the system that is in vogue in the American State Parliaments, where members sit in a semi-circle before the presiding officer, and there is no division to indicate their ideas or party adherence, we should make a considerable step forward in the elimination of the party idea. Honourable members must not be alarmed at the thought that the introduction of a new principle would cause a considerable disruption of idea was new would involve an alteration of existing methods; but that is not an argument against the principle involved. If the principle is right, and if community of interest should be the determining factor in representation, as I claim it should, we would do well to consider the practicable as well as right. able member give it effect? I know of is to divide the community into its various interests, and to combine those naturally associated. If we secured recognition of mutual interest in each gave separate representation to other, which would be one of the most important results to be achieved, we should have people voting, not because they were of one shade of politics or another, but because they desired that the best men obtainable \ould represent the particular interests in which they were concerned. orable member act upon that principle Party elements would now ?

I believe that by our slavish adherence to what is called majority rule, in a numerical sense, we often iand ourselves in ridiculous positions. moted we often heard it said that a resident of New South Wales represented only the ninth part of a resident of Tasmania. In our efforts to bring about the necessary Federation of the Australian Colonies we were met with that littlemindedness which suggested that it was a monstrous injustice to permit Tasmania to enter tbe Federation on equal terms with New South Wales. same principle recognised in regard to the quota which should, or should not, be permissible. representation is based on the right of the people to govern themselves. anything in the contention of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) that men and women in the large city constituencies -and or them-possess the voting power of residents in country districts under the present distribution of divisions, it follows that political representation is not so seriously regarded by the people at large, because we find them everywhere crowding from the country, where, according to the Leader of the Opposition, they have more representation than they are entitled to into the congested centres where they will have less political power. The logical deduction from the honourable gentleman's contention is that if we disfranchise the people altogether we should confer a very great benefit upon the community, since, in my view, it is of greater iir.

Honourable members opposite have attempted to confuse the matter by referring to certain legislation introduced by Sir William Irvine in Victoria. If the people of Australia saw fit to readjust their representative institutions on the basis of industrial representation, instead of geographical divisions, that",48,Chapman Woul D The Matter And See Whether It Is Not Also
263,Mr Considine (Barrier) [5.38],"I would involve an alteration of the Constitution. I believe -that an alteration in the basis of our parliamentary representation is not only desirable, but is inevitable in this country. Under existing conditions, the people are not represented according to their community of interest. honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lynch) knows perfectly well that the establishment of such organizations as the Farmers Union and the Industrial Labour Party is not due to any lack of affinity with recognised political doctrines, but springs rather from fundamental differences in regard to the representation of tbe material interests of those concerned. ber think that the initiative, referendum and recall would alter that? that the initiative and referendum would provide machinery which could be utilized for the purpose of altering the basis of our parliamentary representation. use of that machinery would enable the people of the Commonwealth to mould our Constitution so as to make it conform to their wishes. I favour that method of achieving the result at which I aim, namely, the abolition of the present form of political representation, which has outlived its usefulness. As the honourable member for Werriwa knows well enough, agricultural and industrial in terests to-day ought not to be opposed to one another. It is the aim of the agricultural, as well as of the' industrial, worker, to get r i d of the common exploiter; and the only way in which this result can be attained without upheavals and bloodshed is by giving the people the requisite machinery to effect their purpose in a reasonable and sane fashion. If that course be adopted,' it w ill simply o mean that a popular convention w ill meet and divide the electors into industrial constituencies. having geographical electoral divisions, we should have divisions in which the people will be grouped according to their community of interest. ber does not agree w i th the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Finlayson), who says that geographical divisions are necessary. ence between the honourable member for Brisbane and myself is that the honourable The member dealt merely with what he doubtless regards as the transition stage.

But as that question is not relevant to the clause which we are now considering, I shall be obliged to defer my remarks upon it until a more .opportune occasion. The difficulty connected with a debate of this character is that the attention of the Committee is continually distracted from the business in hand to the contemplation of things which we cannot accomplish, with the result that it is almost impossible to get back to the actual work we are supposed to be transacting. In this clause, it is proposed that we shall give certain directions to the Distribution Commissioners. Two of those directions are contained in paragraphs d and e. I think that paragraph e is a new proposal which has been inserted, presumably on the advice of the Commonwealth Electoral Office. but merely a new wording of the existing law. judgment, neither of the directions contained in these paragraphs should be given to the Commissioners. I know that in New South Wales the existing electoral divisions, in a great many instances, are exceedingly bad divisions. They are not based upon community or diversity of interest, nor upon means of communication, nor upon physical features. It seems to me that if , in adtorate is very much above the quota of justing our electoral boundaries, the Comelectors. There are 46,000 on the roll for missioners are instructed to take into consideration the existing boundaries of divisions and subdivisions, and also the State electoral boundaries, they will be hampered in their work to ah extent that is altogether inadvisable. They should merely be directed to distribute the States into electorates from the point of view of community of interest, means of communication, and physical features. We should then get a more workable scheme. Why the existing boundaries of subdivisions should be taken into consideration I am quite unable to understand. Then, again, the State electoral boundaries are in some instances utterly beyond one's comprehension. These* boundaries have been adjusted from time to time, not in the interests of the people, but in the interests of parliamentary candidates themselves. My own view is that the clause would be greatly improved if paragraphs d and e were omitted. Consequently I move That paragraph d be left out. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 20 to 22 agreed to. Clause 23 (Report to be laid before Parliament). [5.56] I am opposed to the procedure which requires that the report of the Commissioners must be submitted for the approval of Parliament. It is at that stage that political interference enters. The Commissioners should be supreme in .regard to their own work. On the occasion of the last distribution, Parliament threw out the scheme of the Commissioners for purely personal and party reasons, in order to save tbe seatsof certain honourable members. The scheme was wrecked, and when the Commissioners submitted another report the whole of the circumstances reeked of .party politics.

It is clear that the Commissioners must report to somebody in order to put into operation the machinery necessary to establish redistribution. The report should be laid before Parliament, and I would not like the Commissioners to possess supreme power. We may find that an electorate has been added, for example, to the metropolitan area.

The report of the Commissioners, therefore, was rejected. It came before Parliament again later, in almost identically its original state. I once more moved for its return to the Commissioners. It has been remarked during the course of the present debate that the State Surveyor-General should be one of the Commissioners in each State. Queensland was the dividing Commissioner, and he was assisted by two other gentlemen. A deputation from the Trades Hall waited upon those Commissioners, and asked them to leave the redistribution project as they had originally fixed it. The in our legislation, I think, which compels effect of that, it was hoped, would be to exclude me altogether. It was that deputation that did the engineering. That is where the gerrymandering came in. The purpose in doing this need not be entered upon. Upon the second return of the report to Parliament, I was counselled to move that it be sent back again; and I would have taken action in that direction but for the opposition of the leader of our party, Mr Eisher. Had it been returned to the Commissioners for further consideration, no alteration could have been made before the elections, which were imminent, and Queensland would have still had nine members instead of ten, to which that State was then entitled. of the leader of my party, therefore, I refrained from following the matter up further. if whole business can be so managed that the party against whom it is aimed may be so caught that^they must simply put up with the consequences.

I direct the attention of the Minister( Mr Glynn) to what seems a peculiarity, It may well be understood, namely, that, following this clause, there re-arrangement appears to be a dead end. It provides that the ""Distribution Commissioners The objecshall thereupon reconsider the matter, and forthwith propose a fresh distribution."" But no provision is made thereafter that that redistribution shall be presented in the form of a report, or otherwise, and approved of by Parliament. There is nothing in the whole measure to say that the reconsideration by the Commissioners must come before Parliament in the second instance. Isi t to be absolutely final? Is the second consideration by the Commissioners to end the matter? I cannot see any provision The ex-Chief Surveyor in for the report to be returned to the Minister or presented to Parliament.

Home and Territories) [6.23] I can assure honourable members that this clause has received very careful consideration. In fact, it is one of the reserve clauses which I submitted to my colleagues for an expression of opinion. I cannot see what else we can do unless we leave the matter absolutely to the Commissioners, and that, I think, would be a dangerous course to adopt. Parliament should have power to check what may be done by the Commissioners, otherwise I am afraid we will be landed in the opposite position to that which we are seeking to get into. On the last occasion, what was regarded as an extraordinary blunder was made in redistribution, and therefore I think Parliament ought to have the power to determine these matters. If we do anything that is unfair the electors have an effective check.

We have provided for compulsory enrolment, and I think the natural corollary is compulsory voting, though I am not sure that even to-day people pay much attention to the compulsory enrolment provisions of the Electoral Act. Immediately after the police have completed the collection of names, the State roll is better than ours. But six months afterwards the position is reversed. All that the Commonwealth Electoral Department does is to strike people off, not put them on, as we rely upon the electors to make application for enrolment.

The only place in a metropolitan electorate in which an up-to-date roll can be inspected is the office of the Divisional Returning Officer, where the printed lists are kept with the manuscript alterations. Many persons on going to the poll have found that their names have been struck off the roll, although tbey have had no notification of the intention to strike them off. I ask the Minister to consider whether anything can be done to keep the rolls more up to dateI have been assured by the Chief Electoral Officer that no name is struck off a roll after the issue of the writ.

367,Mr Page,"The honourable member di dabout the definition that should be included in our electoral law; a matter that has nothing to do with going to the war. What does the dictionary say about the word "" live "" ? Honourable members will find that it applies to existence as a human being, and has no reference to "" residence."" In my opinion, the word "" live "" has been deliberately used in our electoral law with the f u l l knowledge of its meaning. I have had an experience of the result of the working of tbe law as it now stands. An elector of Hindmarsh, who lived with her parents in the Hindmarsh division, was engaged in teaching for four or five days in the week in another electorate, yet the electoral authorities declared that she must vote where she worked for those four or five days in the week. The decisions of Courts in. Great Britain and in America as to the meaning of "" residence"" as applied to electoral matters are very clear. What has to be kept in mind all the time is what lies behind, and is contained in the word ""home,"" and all that it means to the individual. It is where men or women have their homes that their votesshould bo recorded. If , through exigencies of circumstances, people are compelled, to move from place to place in order to earn a living, it is their business to see that they are on the rolls when they change from one division to another; but, if a man's wife and family are left in a particular spot which he can regard as his home, that is where he should be enrolled and be entitled to vote. He should not be compelled to vote simply where he lives. We shall have no satisfaction in regard to our electoral law until we lay down the clear and definite basis for electoral enrolment. As long as the alteration from "" live"" to "" residence"" is not effected, there will be endless confusion and continuous complaints about persons not being on tbe rolls. Persons have been prosecuted before being permitted to enroll in the districts where their residences are situated. It is our duty to guard the interests of the settled portion of our population as well as to turn our attention to those less fortunaie individuals who are compelled to earn a livelihood by roaming about the country. should not be worth my salt, and should be quite unfit to occupy a seat in this Chamberi f I did not promptly resent the statements made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Archibald) about the men of Western Queensland who travel f.«m sta .on to station, hawk; ing +"" eir labour.

He has proved his manho I on the battlefields of Egypt, Prance, and Palestine, and for the honourable member to come here and call such men "" vagabonds "" is beyond endurance.

As I have already said, I would not be worth my salt if I did not defend these men whom he has so grossly libelled. opposite who represent country constituencies know what a libel he has put upon one of the noblest class of men in the Commonwealth.

378,_ Mr Finlayson (Brisbane) [8.98],"the definition which I have quoted, shall, ipso facto, be entitled to vote. believe that such a provision should form a permanent part of our electoral system. But, after all, it can be effective for only a very limited period, by reason of the fact that, in a few years, every member of tbe Forces, male or female, will be entitled, under the age qualification, to be permanently enrolled. have in mind the circumstance that a large number of the men and women who are now rendering such splendid service on the other side of the world will not be afforded an opportunity of getting their names placed upon our Commonwealth electoral rolls. We are all rejoicing in the hope that the end of this terrible war is not far distant; but we have to recollect that, even when the struggle has ended, some time must elapse before these men and women can return to Australia. My amendment seeks to provide that, no matter in what position they may be placed, either in or outside of Australia, their names shall automatically be inserted upon the rolls because of the splendid service which they have rendered to this country. To me it seems but a very feeble recognition of that service. We talk glibly enough of the magnificent deeds of our boys at the Front, and of the splendid work of our girls there. But we need to put our eulogy into practical effect. Surelyi f there be any corollary to national service it is that of national privilege. As these people have rendered the greatest national service that it is possible for them to render, it seems to me only logical that we should endow them with the privileges of national citizenship which are enjoyed by other people in the Commonwealth. We make it easy for people to get their names upon the roll. An age qualification is sufficient for this purpose. We do not make their enrolment contingent upon intellectual or social qualifications. We merely provide an age qualification. NowI say that the qualification possessed by members of the Forces is superior to that which is possessed by any other class of citizens. know of no proposal that will more powerfully appeal to the people of the Commonwealth than that the members of our I Forces, all and sundry, and irrespective of age, shall, by virtue of the services which they have rendered to Australia, be given the privileges of citizenship.

It seems to me that we are in a peculiar position in having provided for compulsory enrolment without imposing on the elector the obligation of recording his vote at the ballot-box. A t present, the obligation to bring in different people to the poll rests on a few public-spirited and active persons in each constituency. There are those who will not go to the polling booth unless they postal-voting provisions. are carried, preferably in a motor car; indeed, sometimes electors declare that unless some one calls for them they will not vote. W h y should the obligation rest on a few earnest people to compel indifferent electors who are constantly W ill you postneglecting their public obligations? If every person is to have equal electoral I do not think that is rights, the obligation ought to be on him Under the circumstances, I to record his vote, and no one should be conveyed to the poll unless he is physically unfit to go otherwise.

The clause under consideration makes provision for compulsory enrolment and transfer; therefore, 1 rule that an amendment relating to compulsory voting is relevant and in order. that the Minister has not accepted the amendment. I am glad that the proportion of votes has improved since 1901, but even at the last general election, when feeling ran very high, and there was supposed to be a keener interest in the voting than on any previous occasion, the votes were only 77,69 per cent, of the enrolments. Eveni f some people were not able to vote on account of the absence of the postal provisions, the poll could not have been more than 80 per cent, of the enrolments. I know that one subdivision in toy electorate polled 80 per cent, of the enrolments, but although in that subdivision there was a polling booth within a quaiter of a mile of every elector's residence, only four out of every five persons on the roll took the trouble to vote. The time has arrived for the introduction of compulsory voting. If that system were in force we should have no more of troubles in getting people to the poll. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Sampson) has voiced the opinion of a man who has contested many elections in the country. a metropolitan member who does not know that the worry of his committee has been to get the people to exercise their franchise. They will not take the I s not government a trouble to go to a polling booth half-amile distant from their residence unless they can be carried there in motor cars. They will even go to the corner of the street in which the booth is situated, but refuse to complete the journey otherwise than in a motor car. Members of my committee have .told me that some persons have refused to be carried in a waggonette; nothing but a motor car would suit them. I am glad that the amendment has been ruled in order so that we (Hon. J. M . may have an opportunity of voting on this question. The only member apply compulsion to divisions in this House? ber, will propose such an amendment of our Standing OrdersI shall support him, and I shall not be fined very often for not voting. I regret have too much compulsion. I object to the whole clause. It is absurd. from an honourable member who a little time ago wished to apply compulsion to human life. I support the amendment as a step in the right direction, ^ind I trust that Government ' supporters will realize that the provision, if carried, will be helpful to them in the future. Compulsory voting is in operation in Queensland, and if we incorporate it in this B ill we shall l e saving candidates and their committees a lot of trouble in dragging people to the poll. opposed to compulsion in respect of either enrolment or voting. The only effect of the amendment; if carried, would be to bring people still more surely under the power of the party machine.

422,Dr. Maloney,"I have very muchasked almost every witness the question: In view of compulsory enrolment being the law of the land, does it not follow, as a natural corollary, that there should be compulsory voting? The majority of the most intelligent of the witnesses replied "" Yes."" We have had only one experience of compulsory voting in the and that was in Queensland, and it resulted in an increased percentage of the ejectors recording their votes. Every citizen owes a duty to the State, and the duty to record his vote should be regarded by every elector as sacred. The Switzer, when he walks over his hills to record his vote, considers that he is performing a sacred duty, and the sacred day of the week is in that country appointed for the performance of that duty. our Australians will also regard the duty to record their votes as a sacred duty. In my viewj it is a duty which the citizen should be per cent, of the electors in his constitucompelled to perform. bers opposite honestly held the view that young men in this community should be compelled to fight, whether they would or not. I, just as honestly, held Ihe opposite opinion; but surely the duties of citizenship, upon which civilization depends more than upon anything else, should be considered of so much importance that the citizen who fails to perform them should be liable to punishment. the older Democracies of the world-the Elder Greece and the Elder Rome-every citizen was compelled to do his duty. We may not be successful in carrying this proposal on this occasion, but, so long as I am a member of this Parliament, I shall, whenever the opportunity arises, endeavour to provide for compulsory voting. I should like to see the matter left to the vote of the people outside. doubt the consensus of their opinion would be that, voting should be compulsory. The only argument used by those opposed to the proposal that has any logic in it is that suggested by the question: ""Why should a man be compelled to vote against his conscience? "" But compulsory voting will not compel any man to do that, because, as honourable members 'are aware, a voter can render his ballot-paper inDr. Maloney. formal, and the secrecy of the ballot will prevent his identity being known. to tell men to do. for a man to deliberately record an informal vote?

I ask honourable members to consider the difficulties in the way of electors in a huge electorate such as that of Dampier, when an election is held in the winter, if on the polling day it is raining, and they have to go some distance to the nearest poll.

I am told by the Chief Electoral Officer that there has been a splendid response in the way of accuracy and everything else connected with the application of the card system in recent years. When a man wants to enroll, he fills up the card, stating that he is not enrolled, for any subdivision at present. He gives his address also. His statement is tested at the Electoral Office. If it is a transfer enrolment, the applicant states what subdivision he is enrolled for at present, and what subdivision he wishes to be transferred to. He giveshis address also. The card is examined at the Central Office of the State, to see whether the applicant has been already enrolled or not. The whole thing is tested by the card system, which, so far as my information goes, is working exceedingly well, and improving every year. am delighted to hear the Minister's explanation of a system which has always been declared in this House to be letterperfect, and has always been found by any man of experience to be as f u l l of holes as a sieve. I had experience in my own electorate recently of a case where a The opportunity to do these man who shifted a few 'hundred yards was on the roll for both subdivisions, not only for a few months, but for eighteen month's afterwards. Whole families shift from one place to another, and are on the roll for both places. The Minister gave tbe official explanation which is always put up. We are always to'd that the system is perfect, that ho n.istake ever arises, and that the cards are always compared in the card index office. A man is given a card to fill in, and, in tiie majority of cases, is not \ anxious so much about his own enrolment as to comply with bare provisions of the law, and to escape a fine. He is asked the name of his previous division, and subdivision, but the average elector does not know the difference between a division and a subdivision. In many cases he does not know the names of the men who are standing. In a big Federal electorate the names of the State electorates are the names of the subdivisions, aud they do not follow the same bounds lies. State Bendigo and a Federal Bendigo. the names of the State electorates, but do not follow the same boundaries. That",71,Fairs

I do not like it to be said that we are afraid of the competition of State members, because that is not so. Experience gained in a State Parliament is of value in Federal politics, and although in the early years of Federation State political battles were, fought over agaiu in this House, that is not a reason why State members should not be allowed to nominate for this Parliament without resigning their seats. On one occasion, the time at which the resignation should be tendered and the nomination made was fixed almost to the hour. Although men without previous parliamentary experience have come"" to the f r o n t both here and in the Senate, the knowledge of parliamentary institutions gained in the State Parliaments has proved of great value in this Parliament, and we should place no obstacle in the way of the State member who wishes to enter this Parliament.

If we were merely to consider the wants of a few politicians, the contentions of some honourable T h a t is possible; members might be potent; but surely some little consideration should be extended to the unfortunate people who send us here. I have always felt that it is rather a hardship, and somewhat of an outrage against true Democracy, to have the retiring member as a candidate travelling about his electorate on his gold pass while the candidate which other people are putting forward to supplant h i m has to foot his own b ill for travelling expenses. Of course, the sitting member receives no salary after the w r it is issued, and, nevertheless, has to carry on the ordinary work of representing the electorate, and his punishment is heavy enough if he loses his seat; but if a sitting State member be allowed to stand, a portion of his election expenses would have to be borne by people who are bitterly opposed to h i m , and who are spending their money to defeat him. The proposal to delete the clause is a most monstrous one. It means utterly flouting the people's opinions.

Some of the States have deliberately connived at making the law inoperative. In Tasmania, for instance, both parties have agreed that if a member of either State House resigns to contest a Pederal seat, the vacancy created will not be filled until prepared to resign his position, he cannot after the result of the election for the Pederal seat is made known. venience of the elocloiii. able to deal with the matter. I know the argument which is used. It was said that the honorable member's opponent in Fawkner( Mr Hannan) made a convenience of the electors when he contested tbe Albert Park seat in the State House on the death of Mr Elmslie. There is nothing in our law to prevent a sitting member contesting a Federal by-election. The honourable member for ""Wannon( Mr that the electors have a right to the widest Rodgers) could nominate for the Corangamite seat if the National party think that the Wannon seat could be easily won for them, and that the honourable member would have an excellent chance of capturing the Corangamite seat. Yet we compel a State member to resign his seat fourteen days before the nomination of candidates for a Federal seat, which usually means at least a month before polling day. The people will be the best judges as to whether they are being made a convenience of; they will be able to judge whether the candidate who happens to be a State legislator is right or wrong in the step he is taking. The deletion of this clause will give them the opportunity to select the man they deem to be best fitted to represent them. Therefore, I hope that the clause will be struck out. -Honorabl e members opposite have freely advised us not to restrict the choice of the electors in regard to their representation in this Parliament, but this clause is a very deliberate restriction on the choice of the electors. If there is one qualification which should 'be looked upon as salutary in regard to membership of this House, it is experience in a State House. A large proportion pf members of the Federal Parliament have occupied prominent positions, and have served for periods in State Legislatures. cestrict the choice of the electors? unless the member of a State House is contest a Federal seat; and I do not see any reason why he should be compelled to dp so.

Why this embargo should be placed upon the members of our State Parliaments it is difficult to understand, seeing that they possess essential qualifications which are not possessed by the members of other public bodies. At the very least, they should be accorded the same rights as are extended to other individuals in the community. Moreover, the arrangement should be one of a reciprocal character. If any member of this Parliament is desirous of contesting a seat in one of our State Legislatures, he should be at liberty to do so, without first being called >upon to resign his position here. not resign his position here, and that he contested an election, and was defeated.

I have been considering what were the reasons which moved the Legislature on previous occasions to make this part of the electoral law of the country. There are, I suppose, about four State members in each of the Federal constituencies, and I can conceive of a State member being selected as a candidate twelve or eigtheen months in advance; and using his free pass, and other advantages, to undermine the sitting member's position; and then, without any risks, using his unmanly advantages to secure a Federal seat. are you afraid of? any State memb.er, or.any member of the honourable member's party-le t them all come.

That was a matter with which the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) was associated. in the B ill , placed there by"" the Deakin Government. wards re-enacted by tbe honourable member's party. No good reasons have been advanced against the clause, and I think it should stand. I think I am about the only member who has been elected under both condiHow tions. When I first fought the Melbourne seat-whe n I fought the bricks and mortar of the city-and was beaten, I was a member of the Legislative Assembly. A t the next election, under this section of the Act , I had to resign from the Assembly, and that contest, in which £5,000 was spent by the other side, mostly in bribery, resulted in an appeal to the H i gh Court and in its being declared void. I see no reason why a member of a Legislative Assembly or a Legislative Council should not have the right of contesting a Federal seat. Why should a man, if he adopts a political life, give up one position before he can aspire to another? It is a matter in which the constituents ought to be the judge; and I think that the words of Walt Whitman are very aproposI speak the word primeval : I give the sign of Democracy. By God!

If we desire to make this a democratic measure we should not require a man to occupy a certain financial position before he can become a candidate for this Parliament. No man should be prevented from becoming a candidate because he has not £25, or cannot raise that amount. Some of those who entered the first Federal Parliament had some difficulty i u finding the deposit when required. It is sometimes said that if no deposit is required a great many persons w ill offer themselves as candidates, but that has been disproved by the experience in New South Wales, where no deposit is required for the State Parliament. All the State electorates in New South Wales are single electorates, and at the last elections, if my memory is to be relied upon, there was only one instance in which there were five candidates four instances in which there were four candidates, but in the great majorit y of the electorates only two candidates stood for election. clear, therefore, that the elimination of the provision for a deposit has not had in New South Wales the effect which some honourable members seem to think it would have if adopted for the Federal Parliament. I intend to call for a division on my amendment, that I may find out where the Democrats are. If by adopting the preferential vote we desire to permit any man wha chooses to do so to become a Candida""e for this Parliament we should go further and delete this provision for a deposit by candidates.

If , with the coming entrance fee? party system disappears, as these honourable members say it will, then this will impose a great hardship on individual candidates. If a party ran a f u l l ticket for both Houses, it would have to find, in respect of the deposits of its candidates, considerably over £3,000, which would thus be tied up, although it might otherwise be spent in forwarding their interests. But if with the inauguration of preferential voting, tlie party system disappears altoghether, this provision w ill impose a great hardship on individual candidates who have no party behind them, and who, perhaps, have not been able to accumulate £ 2 5 . member's party put up the deposits of candidates ? otherwise I should not have been here tof o r one seat.

It is It is said by honourable members opposite that if no deposit were required, we should have a multiplicity of faddists, and others seeking election. I do not think that would occur to any material extent. It has not been the experience of New South Wales. In the King, Darlinghurst, and other city electorates, for the Legislative Assembly, men who have been looked upon as freak candidates have stood for election, but in New South Wales generally, as well as in other States where a deposit is not required, there has not been a multiplicity of candidates who come within that category.

H a d there been a £25 deposit required he could not ha-e contested that election, and would not have been the sitting member. He was sent out as the Political Labour League representative, for the reason that no other candidate could be secured by that body to contest the electorate. Other instances could be cited to prove that, if this breaking up of the party system does come about, as some honourable members anticipate, on account of I the alteration of the Electoral Act, a man possessing money would have all the advantage. It will be money that will count, and not brains. This qualification is nothing more or less than a tax upon train's and ability.

645,,"I am simply drawing Mr TUDOR -The requiring of a defirst Federal elections were conducted in each State under the electoral law of that State, and the Victorian electoral law required candidates to deposit £ 5 0 . England is £150. refunded to the successful candidate until he has taken hisseat in the House of Commons. That provision was enacted to prevent the Sinn Fei.ners from turning elections into ridicuje. I realize that we have not any hope of doing away w it h the deposit, anrl I congratulate the honorson) on having succeeded in getting.one amendment made. RutI feel bound to vote against the present arrangement. honourable members are consistent, tbey will abolish tbe deposit. Ministerialists who spoke on the second reading in support of preferential voting denounced those of the Opposition who were against it as being undemocratic, because, they said, it would give every one a clear run, and would not confine candidates to those who obtained tbe endorsement of a party organization. I havq met many able men in my travels through life who, had they had an opportunity to show their ability,, might have made their mark in politics. If every one is to be given a free run under the preferential system, why do honourable members Opposite swallow the camel and strain at the gnatby insisting on the retention of the £25 deposit? If the deposit is abolished there will not'be any rush of candidates, particularly in tbe b ig Commonwealth electorates. great rush in New South Wales. have taken place in that State since the deposit was abolished there. We ought not to try to make money out of candidates. Asf o r the argument that preferential voting will give every candidate a fair run, I would point out that in a division like Maranoa a candidate who had not the support of ah organization would have no more cbainje of getting elected than he would have of flying without wings or an aeroplane. dates for this Parliament have lost their/ deposits ? date in the Swan division has lost his deposit. , cold water on his own chances-. I do not think that any Commonwealth seat could be won on the prohibition ticket. date was a prohibitionist. 1 ization behind him, and Mr Hedges had the great Win-the-war party behind h i m . The natural corollary to preferential voting is the abolition of the deposit. IfI were desirous of. standing for Parliament, and I did"", not possess £ 2 5 , I would borrow the money from friends who would have sufficient faith in me to provide the deposit for me. In fact, on many occasions, dummy candidates have been nominated.by certain people in order to enable their particular candidates to secure election on minority votes. At the present time, the parties in the .Australian political arena are the Nationalist party, the Labour party, the Farmers' party, and the Soldiers' party. The Win-the-war Government are very anxious to give the soldiers a fair "" go "" ; but the majority of the boys who return from the Front are not millionaires, and why should not the Government let them have a "" fly ""for parliamentary honours? for deposits. been no means that the organizations will find the money for them, but the returned soldier, who is outside an organization, will not No ; and several elections have any possible chance of finding it .

[1.35 a.m.J I do not think the amendment w ill remedy the existing condition of affairs. The real grievance is that, by the death of the candidate of a party, the electors are deprived of the opportunity of giving expression to their views on the current politics of the hour. In such circumstances, the election should not be proceeded with. of my amendment? cause the amendment applies.only to elections in which the number of candidates does not exceed the number of members to be elected. There are more than two parties in this country; A t the next election, there may be five-parties in the field. In this matter, we ought to consider, not the convenience of the party, but the convenience of the elector. If , before polling day, the candidate of a particular party dies, not only has that party lost their representative, hut the electors have to submit to representation by a candidate holding views diametrically opposed to their own. In my opinion, whenever a candidate dies, the election should be postponed u n t i l fresh nominations can be obtained. party that could only expect to poll about for the five Labour candidates.

In this Parliament, a party held power for a long time on one vote, and, by the death of one can; out of the difficulty would be for every didate at the elections, the whole balance party to have a reserve candidate nomiof power might have been transferred from nated. That would be possible under the one party to another. serious matter, and the right of the electors to be represented by a candidate holding their views ought to be preserved. The present conditions ought to be remedied, but the amendment w ill not do that. -In connection with the election which f o l lowed the double dissolution in 1914, Senator McGregor, who was one of the six Labour candidates for the Senatei n South Australia, unfortunately passed away after nominations had closed. It was mandatory on every elector for the Senate to vote for six candidates.

It is evident that the Committee is of opinion that something should be done in regard to the point at issue. In the Electoral (War-time) Act, which, in this I think it B ill , is to be perpetuated, definite provision is made. Under present circumstances, that provision would be sufficient for all requirements; but it is. certain that, at the next elections, there w ill be a multiplicity of parties. I am not seriously concerned about that, because, if it is left an to the leaders of the two parties at present recognised to substitute a candidate in the case of the death of a nominated candidate, there w ill be time enough then to consider the claims of any other parties.

Page, J. 1914 there was a double dissolution, when the people pronounced against the party Charlton, M. that wished to reinstate postal voting. . Brennan, F . .. Sir William Irvine, the man responsible Watkins, D. ' for tlie double dissolution, stated that the people then decided for preference to unionists and for the abolition of postal voting. If ever a general election was fought on two questions alone, that election was so fought. Prior to the double dissolution, the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) moved an am endmen t to provide for a system of postal voting, which was defeated by one vote only. He has hadto go to his electorate to attend a Labour demonstration there in connection with the miners, and he has asked me to move on this clause an amendment containing the proposal to which I refer. I therefore move That all the words after the words ""'An electorwho "" be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" by reason of illness or infirmity believes that he will be unable to attend at the polling place at any time during the hours of polling, may make application by pest to the returning officer of the division in which the applicant is enrolled for a vote after the issue of the writ for the election, and within seven (hxys preceding the day of tbe ele'-tion. The returning officer, on a day previous to the election, and after the dav for receiving applications has expired, shall instruct the presiding officer appointed at the ne.ire't polling place to call at the address of the applicant, and who shall, if satisfied th t the claimant is entitled to vote under tb,e provisions of this' section, supply a ballot-paper to the elector, who, in the presence of the officer, but so that the officer cannot see the vote, shall mark the ballot'-paper in tlie prescribed manner, and shall fold and secure the b-Hot-paper so that the vote cannot be seen. The ballot-paper shall then be placed in -a sealed ballot-box in the presence of. the presid-' ing officer, and shall be opened and counted at the scrutiny at the close of the ballot.""

[2.39 a.m.] I move That the following paragraph be inserted:""(d)he has satisfied himself that the elector is unable to have his application witnessed .and his vote recorded before a Commonwealth Divisional Returning Officer, Assistant Returning Officer, or Commonwealth Electoral Registrar."" The object of this amendment is to curtail, as f a r as possible, the collecting of votes-for that really is what it is-o r that open voting which is inevitable under the postal-voting system. member say that it is open voting? actual open voting which is provided for in the B ill ; but, as the system is carried out, witness, it may be, and very often is, open voting. We should area of that risk as much as we can, and should not allow a postal vote to be recorded other than before an electoral officer, unless tbe elector is not able to go to one. What mainly tended -towards breaking clown the postal-voting system when it was previously in force was not tbe proper use of the system, but the fact that it was found that votes could be collected from people who they could not go to a polling booth. An organized effort., was made to collect the votes of women and others who were unwilling to submit themselves to what they considered the indignity of pushing their way through the common crowd at a polling booth. In Victoria, especially, a number of women found the postal vote a loop-hole through which they could vote without going to a polling booth. In this way the system was misused, and it would be unwise to-day to allow electors to vote otherwise than We under the superintendence of officers of the Electoral Department, unless an elector is not able to go to an office where these officials may be found. My amendWill the honourable member rized witnesses specified in the B ill w ill not be able to witness postal-voting certificates or postal votes if it is at all possible for tbe regular officers of the Electoral Department to do so. I trust that the Minister( Mr Glynn) will not accept . the amendment. In my judgment, the amendment which the Minister himself intends to move to this clause will adequately protect the postal vote, and will provide for every contingency that is likely to arise. . The great evil which every houora.ble member is desirous of abolishing iu connection with postal voting is the personal canvas. Under the Minister's amendment the penalty which will be imposed upon any authorized witness who associates himself with any person in persuading an elector to make application for a postal vote certificate or a postal ballot-paper, is a fine of £ 2 5 . -NowI maintain that there can be no as between the voter and the open voting in connection with the postal vote. The elector has merely to show -limit the that there is no mark or name upon the postal ballot-paper when it is handed to him. I repeat, that it is the canvassers who have created all the trouble associated with the postal voting system, and I hope that the Minister will adhere to his amendment.

I do not exactly gather what the Minister means by his suggestion to postpone the clause. Until when is it suggested that we postpone it? Is it meant that we are to have an opportunity in this Committee to discuss the clause, or are we to leave the Bill as it stands with the two different methods of marking the voting papers? In my opinion, the right procedure would be to postpone this clause, together with the proposed amendment, until we have dealt with clause 125, which provides for the method of marking the papers in an election for the House of Representatives. If clause 125 is carried, as apparently it will be, and if the Governthe fewest places in the State for which ment adhere to the Bill as presented, they will deliberately provide for two different methods of marking the ballot-papers. I do not say that this amendment would entirely meet the position, because the Minister has pointed out that it would permit of optional marking. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) informs me that he has handed to the Clerk notice of an amendment to make the method of voting optional for the House of Representatives, and, therefore, I think we ought to waif until clause 125 is decided. Under the new standing order the Committee stages of the Bill have to be completed this afternoon, and that leaves only about two and a half hours in which to discuss the principle of preferential voting. ° If the Government insists on the Bill as presented, it will [277]2 place the Opposition in a position to point out that the Senate ballot-papers are to be marked in the old way with a cross, while in the case of the House of Government 'Representatives it is mandatory, except where there are two candidates, to vote preferentially. Let us first deal with the method for the House of Representatives, and then with the method for the Senate. a.m.] -There should be no difficulty about disposing of this amendement at once. It indicates a very laudable desire on the part of the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) to avoid informal votes. But, in trying to give effect to his desire, the honourable member would perpetrate a minor fraud upon the public. He does not pTopose to provide the electoTs with a means of recording preference, but merely a form of voting which bears all the externals of a preferential vote and has no reality about it. To impose upon the public generally a pretence that they are to make a preference between Senate candidates would be to put a weight upon their judgment almost impossible for them to bear. How can we have preferences in connection with candidates for the Senate? Honourable members are aware that the Senate candidate who secures the greatest number of votes is the man who has visited he stands. It is, after all, this House that returns the Senate. We might go to a vote at once upon the amendment, so that we may have time for the consideration of the more important mattors in the Bill. a.m.] -Unless the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition is agreed to, I shall object to the withdrawal of the amendment. If it had not been moved by the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Joweft), I should have submitted a similar amendment, because, in my view, it is almost a criminal mistake to provide, as the Government do in this Bill, for one system of marking of .ballot papers for the House of Representatives and a totally different system for the Senate.

Honourable member's opposite have made a great deal of the fact that Mr Corboy, who, I understand, will be present at the first sitting of the House next week, in order to be sworn in, has been returned 'by a minority vote. Throughout the discussion of this measure the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) has been taunted because he happens to be the only honourable member of this House at the present time who was returned by a minority vote. It is strange that some of those who have most persistently uttered this taunt were themselves at different times the representative of a minority. I took the trouble the other day to look up the honourable members of this Parliament who were elected upon a minority vote since the election of the first Federal Parliament in 1901. I find that there have been forty-four honourable members so elected to this Parliament at different times, and of that number thirty-five have been anti-Labour men. Including the new honourable member for Swan, who is not yet sworn in, nine honourable members elected upon a minority vote were candidates run by the Labour party. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr by minority votes, and they were all Richard Foster), who, with others, has on more than one occasion taunted the honourable member for Barrier in this connection, was himself returned on a minority vote. I would prefer personally tlie chance of tbe honourable member for Barrier getting back into this Parliament to the chances of a number of honourable members on the other side. gentleman is welcome to his cheap opinion. honourable member is annoyed because I have pointed out that he is one of those who has been returned to this House on a minority vote.

From the statements which have appeared in Mansard and in the press, one might be led to imagine that Mr Corboy, the newly-elected member for Swan, and the present honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) are the only men who have ever been returned Robert Harper, who was a political opponent of our party, but a man much esteemed in this House for his ability he displayed in dealing with various matters, was returned at three successive elections oa a minority vote. One would suppose from the way in which honourable member's speak that every vote not recorded for Mr Corboy in the recent Swan election was recorded against him. But that does not follow at all. Do honourable member's mean to tell me that the prohibition candidate, who was last on the poll, the Government nominee, who was second last, or the Farmers and Settlers' candidate would, but for Mr Corboy, have secured the whole of the votes polled? 95 per cent. preferential system has been operating in Victoria, and those who have had experience of its operations will not say that they would have polled 95 per cent, of the votes. Some twelve months ago an Honorary Minister in the Victorian Government retired from the representation of Jika Jika, which is part of the Federal electorate of Bourke, and the vacancy was contested by two Liberalsa Mr May, who had run the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) much closer than any other candidate had done, and Mr High Court, that a ballot-paper shall not Dennis-as well as by a Labour candidate. On that occasion a fair proportion of the second preferences cast by those We have had only the one system of votwho voted "" No. 1 "" for Mr May and Mr Dennis, went to the Labour candidate. at the result of the recent election for Swan to see the necessity for a change. Honourable members opposite contend that the only members of this House returned ' on a minority vote are the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine), and the recently returned representative for Swan. As a matter of fact, the two candidates who opposed the honourable member for Barrier only polled in the aggregate for him. Will any one say that of the 700 or 800 who voted for Mr Doe more' than twenty-eight of them would not have honesty of purpose and the given their second preferences to the honourable member? There were more members returned on a minority vote at the elections for 1910 than on any other occasion, and the number of Ministerialists so elected is four times that of the Labour members. I protest against the introduction of this system at the present time. The Committee has decided that it shall not be applied to the Senate, and the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett), who expresses surprise at my protest, joined with us in an effort to apply the system tp both Houses. We shall now have to tell the people that, in respect of the Senate elections they must put a cross opposite the names of each of the three candidates for whom they vote, but that if there are three candidates for a House of Representatives Division they must vote in the order of their preference, "" 1, 2, and 3.""

Incidentally, the system will make splendid election material for will make more useful the many, various, and weird armies of the National party. The party has quite a number of candidates bearing different names. Some are disguised as soldier candidates, others as farmers and settlers' candidates, while others again come forth under the guise of prohibition candidates. They are all at bottom members of the National party, and, if elected, would 'be abject followers of the National Government. The preferential voting system will give the Nationalist party three chances or more in respect of each electorate, 'whereportional representation for the Senate. as under the simple majority or "" sudden death"" system they will only have one. Ministerialists regard this system as a splendid one-to be grasped with both hands so to speak-so far as its application to the House of Representatives is concerned, but to apply it to the Senate is quite a different matter.

The history of the anomalous and ridiculous position in which the Government find themselves to-day in regard to this matter is particularly interesting, and our party. The Ministry desired that proportional representation should apply to the Senate, aiid that the preferential system should apply to the House of Representatives. The one is the natura 1 corollary to the other. While I believe that there should be no alteration of the electoral law until our soldiers return, I am not at all afraid of any of the more scientific electoral systems. I believe we shall do very well out of them. We cannot lose. The Government, as I have said, decided that there should be proa decision. that went forth during the by-election for Flinders. It was the price paid to the farmers and settlers' candidates. A couple of thousand pounds might have passed, but at all events I know that certain promises were given, with the result that some of the candidates that were the chances of the Nationalist candidate, withdrew. The next move in the matter was taken by members of another place.

He is only one member of the Cabinet, and one member of the parly opposite. The matter will be decided by the Cabinet or by the party, and wo one can foretell what will happen in the coming months. If the Committee carries the clause as it stands, the law will be preferential voting for the House of Representatives and the old system for the Senate. favour of preferential voting? stated that if the Government wall agree to have the system iu operation for both HousesI will withdraw my opposition to it. am greatly surprised at some of the statements made by honourable members opposite concerning the assurance that has been given by the Minister( Mr Glynn). In my opinion, nothing could have been fairer. The Minister could not be expected to say definitely what the Government would be bound to do in a month's time, but he said quite clearly that he is in favour of some improved system of voting for the Senate. While, of course, he could not speak for the whole of the Government, we know, from his actions and. the opinions he has expressed for many years past, that he is in favour, if not of proportional voting, then of some better system for the election of the Senate. the present Parliament expires, to bring He could not be expected to say more at this stage. The question to be considered is how best can the electors of the Commonwealth be benefited by preventing the that? return of candidates by the votes of the minorities at by-elections. That is the only point which we should be called upon to deal with at the present time. There will be plenty of time, in the life of this Parliament, to bring about an improvement in the method of voting for the Senate. the Minister place to do that? moment; because members of the House are not in a position to say just what is the best form of voting for the Senate. It is a big question, and should be thoroughly exploited. The Government will, I presume, want time to bring down a properly-matured scheme with that end in view. There will be no by-elections for the Senate, because any vacancies that may occur in that Chamber will be filled by appointments by the State Parliaments. Tf, ou the other hand, a member of this House dies or resigns, the vacancy must be filled at a by-election, you in and the sooner we adopt some improved system of voting, as is indicated in this clause, the sooner will we be assured of the will of the majority .being respected. It is all very well for members on the other side to get up and endeavour to put the Government in a hole over a matter like this. We know quite well that many of them are talking with their tongues in their cheeks about what they will do, that whilst in this Chamber they oppose preferential voting they actually endorse this system in connection with elections in their leagues and conferences. In their opposition to the clause they are merely seeking to embarrass the Ministry. The Minister in charge of the Bill has said all that could be expected of him. This Parliament will be strong enough, if ever the necessity arises, to force the Government to come down with an improved system for Senate elections, if the opinion of the House in. that way.

It is quite clear to me that it is not the concern of the general electors that is responsible for the introduction of this provision, but the laudable desire of honourable members opposite to set their own house in order. terests of the general electors. upon the candidates elected. not object at all to a proper preferential system of voting, including the exhaustive ballot, which I prefer, if that were financially possible. I do not oppose the preferential system provided for in this Bill on principle. My reason for opposing it is to point out that it has not been introduced for the benefit of the electors, but in order that the legislative machinery may be used to adjust tlie domestie differences in the ranks of the National party. I realize, that with the time at our disposal to-day it is impossible for us to do justice to this very important matter. At every election which I have contested since 1913 I have been ardently in favour of some electoral system which would give better representation in the Senate, and secure majority rule in the House of Representatives. I am very pleased that the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) has assured the Committee that a further and better opportunity will be afforded honourable members to discuss tlhe wider question of representation in the Senate. I hope that, when deciding the proposal to be submitted, the Government will take into consideration other systems as well as that of proportional representation. Whilst a system of proportional representation would be an improvement upon the present system, it would not take from the large centres of population the dominating influence which tbey now exercise in connection with elections for the Senate. able member's objection to the influence of the large centres if he desires to have majority rule? varied interests, as well as the people throughout the wide area of the Commonwealth, shall be adequately represented in both branches of the Federal Legislature.

We secure the return of men I should possessing special knowledge, enabling them to deal with special subjects. We get a wider representation of interests, as well as of electors. I say that the adoption of proportional representation for the Senate will not take from the large centres of population the balance of -power in securing representation in the Senate; and, therefore, other systems should be considered by the Government. The system which I advocate is not new. It was discussed in the Federal Convention, where its adoption was defeated only by twenty-one votes to eighteen.

I think it is unfortunate that this Bill will not ibe a complete measure, but I accept the statement which has been made by the Acting Prime Minister, that another and a better opportunity will be given to consider the matter more fully. In my view, it will be a disgrace to this Parliament if it permits the present lopsided system to operate at the next general elecsolved as soon as the war is over? If a tionstatement made hy the Acting Prime Minister clearly indicates that this measure is not one of urgency, but one that should be carefully considered. In view of the great problems which will confront Australia at the conclusion of the war, I am strongly of opinion that these electoral matters should not be tinkered with today. ""We should tackle a big question in a big wayI n my. opinion, it will be necessary at the conclusion of the war to put the whole Constitution into the melting pot, and with it our whole system of parliamentary representation. lieve that we shall find ourselves faced at the conclusion of the war with all sorts of limitations upon the powers of this Parliament. presenting the whole of the political opinions existing in Australia, should be called to deal with the Constitution in the light of the newer and greater problems which confront us as a result of this war. The discussion of the question of whether or not we shall elect members to the House of Representatives upon the preferential system of voting is, to my mind, mere beating of the air compared with the importance of making preparation to deal with the vastly important matters that will demand our attention as soon as the war is ovor. At the close of the war we shall discover that Parliament has not the power to legislate in regard to them as we should be able to do. Is the National Parliament to be hamstrung, as it will be unless some of the existing conmust see that the National Parliament is stitutional limitations are removed?

If we fail to take the first and sider that matter at once, rather than waste time in dealing with an Electoral Bill which in no sense of the word can be described as urgent. the consideration of the Bill to remain in abeyance until we can deal with the whole question of electoral reform in a bigger way.

It might well be asked, also, to determine whether we should continue to have the numerous State Parliaments existing to-day, or whether we should have one Parliament for the whole -of Australia, and wipe out the present geographical State boundaries. All these are questions that ought to be considered I beby the people. The Convention might determine that the electors should be represented in the National Parliament upon the basis of the communal rights A Federal Convention, reof the people; but while we are tinkering with this measure, which is comparatively unimportant, we are neglecting the great questions that are urgently demanding attention. With the close of the war our powers under the War Precautions Act will automatically cease, and we shall revert to the position that we occupied before the outbreak of hostilities. The old constitutional limitations will again apply, and we shall be unable to carry on the hundred and one commercial undertakings which the Commonwealth Government have been forced by stress of circumstances to enter upon. Are we to allow these larger war powers to be suddenly taken from us without taking precautions to avoid the commercial chaos which, in that event, would follow? We given power to deal with these great quesvital step necessary to that end, we, as a Parliament, will become impotent.

Without such powers we shall be impotent, and it is mere humbug to discuss a question of this kind when matters of national importance remain untouched. vernment should rise to a sense of their responsibility, and deal with these questions in a big way. It is an accepted political axiom that it is the science of good government to make it easy for the people to do right and difficult for them to do wrong. We cannot escape from the fact that the provisions of the Bill now before us in regard to preferential voting, the postal vote, and other matters must tend to great confusion in the minds of the electors. We have, unfortunately, a large proportion of informal votes cast at every general election. These informalities, however, are by no means confined to the class from which they might be expected to come. It has repeatedly been noticed in Brisbane that informal voting is most rife at polling booths situate amongst the more educated sections of the community. And here we are to-day introducing a system which is going to lead to much greater confusion, and to cause in the minds of the electors, when they proceed to record their votes, far more perturbation than has ever occurred before. This is to be deplored. We want the people at election times.to exercise the franchise calmly and in the most intelligent way. During the consideration of this Bill nothing has been more remarkable than the conflict between the professed principles of Ministerial supporters, as expressed during the second-reading debate, and their actions and votes in Committee. During the second-reading debate we were repeatedly assured by these honourable gentlemen that one of the immediate effects of .preferential voting would be the abolition of pre-selections. It was said by them that such a thing as machine selections by political parties would then disappear. But what is the actual position? This Bill is being rushed through under the special guillotine provisions of the Standing Orders, in order that it may be applied to a by-election that is imminent. And yet, in the Herald last night, and in this morning's newspapers, we have the first clear indication that the organizations supporting honourable members opposite are proceeding at once, in connection The Gowith this by-election, to do the very thing that we were told this Bill would render unnecessary. We have the statement in the press that meetings of the National Federation and of the Australian Women's National League are to be held to send representatives to a conference to select candidates, and that after a selection has been made by it, the several organizations represented will be bound to support the chosen man. We are told, also, that the National Labour party is about to meet to decide what action shall be taken to select a candidate, so that we find that the parties associated with honourable members opposite are doing the very thing it was said this Bill would obviate. pect them to get away at once from old been under the consideration of the Department for some time, and has also been before us for some days, so that it would seem that all the hopeful anticipations of honourable members as to the abolition of pre-selections as the result of the passing of it will fail.

1010,The Chairman,"I have already7624 again on the same subject. Clause 134, which is now before the Committee, deals with the question of informal ballot papers, and not with the principles of the Bill. The honourable member will have his opportunity, if time will permit, at a later stage. chance of stating my point of order. I accept your ruling, but it is not in accordance with your undertaking given to me last night, and it places me in a difficulty. I want to know what opportunity I will have if it is my desire to point out During the second-reading debate, I reto the Committee, before we deal with any of the other clauses, that there is no provision in the Bill to prevent bodies unknown to the Constitution intervene. The honourable member must know that he is entirely out of order. He is not stating a point of order at all. In the first place the honourable member is under a misapprehension when he says I gave an intimation that he would be able to do a certain thing. I did no such tiling. When the advice of the Chair is asked I give it freely and willingly, but beyond that I am not competent to go. I am bound by the Standing Orders of the Committee, and the question which the honourable member is dealing with now cannot be considered until the postponed clauses have been dealt with. Whether he will have an opportunity, withiu the limited time available, or not, I cannot say. I am bound to proceed in accordance with the Standing Orders; the clause before the Chair has nothing whatever to do with the matter which the honourable, gentleman is seeking to ventilate.' one of the most important clauses of the but it could be guarded against in paraBill, because it deals with the manner in graph a of this clause, which I have just which votes may be declared informal read.

Electoral [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill. for any amendment under the guillotine provisions. Unless the Minister accepts an amendmen t there will be no hope of getting one carried. However, I appeal to the Minister on this matter. The clause states that a ballot-paper will be informal if (a) it is not authenticated by the initials of the Presiding Officer, or by an official mark as prescribed. ferred to this question of the informality of votes, and mentioned cases of voters who, through no fault of their own, had been disfranchised. I think the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) interjected tliat during an election in which he was interested, over 200 persons had been disfranchised in this way. It is a mistakp to disfranchise any voter owing to the fault of a presiding officer, but this has been done in numerous cases, at all events in regard to absent voting ballot-papers. Honourable members know that during a general election, and at a referendum, a voter may go to any polling booth in the Commonwealth to record a vote for any electorate in Australia, and, as electoral officials can testify, some of these votes have been declared informal. I know also that complaints have been made about the possibility of counterfeit ballot-papers being presented. It has been suggested that persons, with this object in view, could get information as to the type to be used, the colour of the ballot-paper, the words to be printed upon it, aud then get paper, the texture of which is so close to the official ballot-paper that it could be used at an election.

1015,Mr Tudor,"I am aware of that.there is not much chance of securing any amendment to the clause unless the M in ister agrees to it;, hut I ask h i m to consider whether it is not advisable to strike out the words, "" by the initials of the Presiding Officer or."" then provide for a ballot-paper to be declared informal if (a) it is not authenticated mark as prescribed. This would get over the difficulty of any person being disfranchised by the failure to act, of any official. The next paragraph of the clause provides that a ballot paper shall be informal if (o) In elections for the Senatei t has no vote marked on it , or' has votes marked on it for a greater or lesser number of candidates than the number required to he elected. And schedule e sets out that ballot papers shall be marked with a cross against the names of the three candidates for whom the voter desires to vote. In the case of an election for the House of Representatives, the ballot-paper w ill be informal if it has no vote indicated upon it , or does not indicate the voter's first preference for one candidate, and where there are more than two candidates, his contingent vote for the remaining candidates. In Queensland and in Western Australia the contingent vote is in operation; but I think it is optional in the latter State. South Australia does not employ the contingent vote, and in New South Wales there is the second ballot, which I think is more costly. election. I think the preferential voting system is better than the second ballot, but where there are more than two candidates the exercise of the contingent vote should be optional, so tliat whether a man exercise his f u l l preference or not, his vote should not be declared informal. I re, member that, wheu I was an elector for Kooyong, I had a choice between Mr Knox, Mr Fink, and Mr Foster Rodgers. you did not tackle Kooyong. the division of Y a f r a because I was brought up in one of the cities, and served my time at the trade at which I worked in the other. I was working in a factory up t ill within three weeks of the day of election, and if I had not been elected I could have gone back to that The clause would factory. I may also mention that the newspapers predicted I would have to do this. I have not been back yet. to the by an official factory, but if I have to go I hope I shall be able to make a living. TheB ill provides that where there' are not more than two candidates the elector's vote for one candidate shall be deemed to be sufficient, and he need not exercise his second preference. In other words, while we provide that an elector shall vote 1, 2, 3, and so forth, we, at the same time, say that if there are only two candidates he may vote for only one. There is, however, a second proviso to the effect that a cross in the square opposite the name of one candidate shall be deemed to indicate the voter's first preference. It w ill be seen that a cross must be made in the case of the Senate, that if there are only two candidates for the House of Representatives the voter may please himself whether he marks with a cross or a figure, and that where there are more than two candidates the f u l l preference must be exercised. If the Government, by means of this B ill , sought to obtain uniformity, they have, therefore, signally failed, and I regard the clause under discussion as the greatest blot on the measure. The first objection I have to the B ill is that it disfranchises people for no faul t of their own, but for the act of an official"" of the It is a very bad system. Department; and my second objection is that we make preferential voting mandatory and then leave it optional. I realize that there is not enough time to deal w i th this question as it ought to be dealt with , and I submit that we are building up new machinery on an utterly wrong basis in adopting three conflicting systems of voting. I know it is hopeless to ask the Minister to make any alteration now, but I suggest that the necessary amendments to secure one method of voting be made It is a wonder in another place.

As to marking, the rule is that an elector must mark his ballot-paper 1, 2, 3; but provision is made so that where, in the case of only two candidates, a mistake is made by simply putting, a. cross opposite the name of one, the vote shall not be invalid. [2.50] I hope that tbe Minister will not abandon the proposal to accept a ballot paper if the voter makes the mistake of placing a cross opposite the name of one when there are only two candidates. But I think that it is quite unnecessary to insist on an elector exercising his preference in the case-of all the candidates that may present themselves, because, in my opinion, that can only lead to a considerable number of informal votes. The object of the preferential system is to secure at a single ballot the same result that would be attained if there were several successive ballots, the candidate lowest on the poll being dropped at each successive one. I do. not think an elector should be disfranchised because, after recording three preferences, he refuses to make a selection of all the other candidates. If , because of his failure to comprehend the system, he stops marking his paper before ho gets to the end of a long list of nondescript candidates who have no hope of winning, the vote3 he has already given should not be invalidated. In order to insure that if an elector has given an indication of what he would do if he went to the polling booth three times his vote shall not be declared informal, I movedidates "" be left out, with a view to insert ijn lieu thereof ""to the third place."" have already circulated a proposed amendment to strike out all the words after "" candidate "" in paragraph c of the clause. The whole of my case in support of that amendment is exactly the case presented by the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Lamond). We have no right to deprive any person of his vote, so long as that vote can be effective. If an elector puts No. 1 opposite the name of one candidate only, and that candidate has sufficient No. 1 votes to keep him in the ballot, we have no right to declare that vote informal. in plumping? ing; tbe meaning is that, while a vote can be effective it should be allowed. As the Bill now is it would be more fitting to describe it as a measure to declare effective votes informal. We must keep it clearly in our minds that votes Nos. 2, 3, and 4 are never counted until a candidate drops out of the ballot, and it is quite immaterial whether the second, third, and fourth preferences have been used if the elector has indicated the person for whom he desires to vote. myself have been the victim of circumstances in an election, and I am of the opinion that we cannot make the clauses of a Bill of this kind too simple. I was unseated through no fault of my own, but through' the fault of an electoral officer; and I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that the Minister should take an early opportunity to have the necessary amendments made in another Chamber to simplify the electoral procedure.

In the press we read that a returned soldier is visiting such-and-such an. electorate with the object of paving his way for selection, and that some one else is a likely candidate for. another electorate. W it h preferential voting the Ministerial party w ill probably have a number of candidates in the field.

1072,Mr Watt (Balaclava,"Acting Primedue to the fact that the all-night sitting through which we have passed has strained his nerves, as it has strained mine and those of many others. I gather, however, that his main object in rising was to complain of the principle of the guillotine. May I remind him that the guillotine standing order was discussed at great length some weeks ago by this House, which decided to impose upon it self that self-denying ordinance in the hope that public business in future would be discharged more to the public advantage than had hitherto been the case. ""When its first application was moved by me on Wednesday last, it was agreed to without a division, and apparently w i th the unanimous concurrence of the House. Whether my honourable, friends opposite, usually so vigilant and alert, were at that time unusually slumberous, I know not. D r . MALONEY properly understood, there is no salt, but much sugar. The first application of this wholesome medicine was accepted unanimously by the House, and has already proved salutary, in that we have done business. Apartf r o m the general principle of the guillotine, I take it that the Leader of the Opposition objects to the action of the Government in applying it on this occasion. which the B ill has been hurried through the House what I assume to have been the honourable member's object-if he had a definite object-in rising to speak. his secondary object was to complain about the conduct of the Government in applying the standing order in this way during this week. assented to .the limiting resolution that followed the urgency resolution, I thought there was sufficient time for the passage of the B ill ; but I candidly confess that so much time was taken up on the earlier clauses, designedly or not, that I thought a little more time was desirable, and I was successful in inducing honourable members on this side to allow more time for the consideration of the Bill than they had originally thought necessary. About five or six hours were, therefore, given last night, quite unnecessarily, in order that honourable members opposite might discuss the question as they thought they should discuss it , f u l ly and freely. Members on the Government side took the greater part of the time. majority that so small a minority should have held the House last night. It was not a question of fairness but of generosity, although, I admit, quite unrecognised. It will pass into history as one of the features of the first application of the guillotine that, quite without necessity, the Government gave more time to their opponents than the vote of the House compelled them to give. That is why we persuaded ourselves to sit here last night. The guillotine was not intended to serve D o not rub in the salt. a party advantage. I take leave to say, In the guillotine, when notwithstanding the warnings of my honourable friend, who spoke like Jeremiah in his recent speech, that even if the time should come by any tragic mischance when this party must pass over to the Opposition benches, I will still assert that the same principle applies, and that the House will hold the party responsible for the application of this timesaving order. The misuse of an instrument of this kind w ill , I admit, react on its users, and in the I object to the way in f u l l recognition of that fact the system was applied. If ever the Leader of the Opposition leads a Government with a I am dealing now with f u l l majority behind him, he will find the same sense in the community and in the then Opposition. The principle was not I think introduced for party purposes, nor was it applied on this occasion to meet a party issue. We gave almost three weeks to the second reading of the B ill . I know When the House of no B ill involving so few new principles to which so much time has been given in this House. To talk of the B ill containing 220 clauses is so much fudge. The bulk of them are consolidated clauses involving no new principle. There is in the Bill one new principle, and one restoration of an old principle. The new principle is preferential voting, which, while not as old as original sin, is as old in its acceptance and operation as"" any member of the House.

I point out that, in addition, many of the producers have, at great expense and with very great difficulty-, topped up their sheep and lambs this year. Owing to this being an abnormal season, they have had to employ tbe most skilful husbandry in topping up their sheep. an ordinary season, when sheep and lambs may be removed from one paddock to another and kept for weeks. It is a time when tbe whole of the grass and fodder resources of the producers have had to be carefully husbanded to fit and finish the stock for the works. When the demand was made by the Butchers Union, the Exporters Association met the men first of all in conference on the 25th October, next on the 28th October, and again on the 4th November. Finally, they met before Mr Justice Higgins on Wednesday last, the 6th November, when an offer was made to the men, notwithstanding the fact that an award is in existence, and has still some time to run. is referring to a Federal Arbitration Court award. standing the fact that the exporters are entitled to take advantage of the Arbitration Court award until 1921, in recognition of the exceptional weather conditions and the abnormal supplies coming forward, they decided, in order to keep the works going, and to prevent further dislocation of the business of the producers, to offer the butchers an additional 2s. 6d. per 100 for all sheep and lambs and an increase of Is. per day to all other labour engaged at the meat works. be to raise the previous minimum rate from l is . to 12s. per day, so that no person employed in any. branch of the meat works would be in receipt of less than 12s. per day.

I desire to inform the Acting Prime Minister that on Thursday morning, at two of the works engaged in the export trade, the butchers and other employees started their go-slow strike, killing, about one-third of the normal killing rate. This is probably worse in its effect than would be an absolute strike, because the men are carrying onand continuing to secure the benefit of their ordinary wages and conditions. They have appointed amongst themselves their own board of control. I do not believe that this strike is directed by the executive of the Australian Workers Union. I do not believe that the officials or managing body of that union instituted the strike. On the contrary, I believe that the strike has been initiated by a section of the men who have come over from Queensland, where the export Notwith^ season has closed, and who are openly boasting in Victoria that they intend to show the men here, who have been con. tentedly engaged in their work, how they can better conduct operations for their own benefit at a time like the present by direct action.

Suffolk w ill be here within a few* days to take away, roughly, 80,000 carcasses. They are, therefore, concerned in the matter, and I ask them to do all that is possible to have the difficulty resolved. Constitutional methods have been adopted by the employers. The Arbitratio n Court is a tribunal created by this Parliament, and an award of that tribunal is in existence affecting this industry. In the circumstances, I ask that the Government shall intervene to compel a conference and require the Arbitratio n Court to sit and determine the conditions of the industry at the present time. I ask that the Government shall not allow advantage to be taken of the present abnormal conditions to enable the men to force u n f a i r demands-upon the employers. I can in for m the Acting Prime Minister that what they demand would mean an additional cost to the producers of Is. per head all round for sheep and lambs to be slaughtered. This w ill mean a reduction on the present buying price on the top of decreases which have already taken place, because the price of lambs and mutton has already been reduced by the lack of organization to deal w it h this very prolific season's output..

More than one Minister will admit that I have endeavoured on several occasions recently to t r y to preserve industrial peace.

There are in this community, however, many who are not unmindful of the fact that it is not long since there was, if not a deliberate strike on the part of the producers, at all events, some sort of understanding, as the result of which not one sheep was yarded at Newmarket on the occasion of one or two sale days, a happening previously unheard of in the history of Australia. If the facts in regard to the slaughtermen are as stated by the honourable member for W n o n a l l ( Mr Rodgers), then it would seem that, unfortunately, they are following the bad example set by the very people on behalf of whom he makes this complaint to-day. of the eminently satisfactory European situation to-day, and the probability of the early restoration of shipping to normal conditions hands with an optimist. years, I have not been so optimistic as I am to-day; and I desire to urge upon the Acting Prime Minister( MrW a t t ) that he should carefully watch the interests of the primary producers, particularly in regard to the wheat held in the Pools of Australia. According to newspaper cablegrams, the Allies are particularly hardpressed just now in furnishing to the conquered countries of Turkey and Bulgaria a sufficient supply of foodstuffs, and I would urge the honourable gentleman not to sacrifice the interests of the primary producers of Australia by selling at too low a price the wheat now in the Pools. Farmers believe that before very long, w i th the cessation of hostilities, wheat wil l be worth 6s. per bushel f.o.b. at the various ports in Australia; and that being I feel so, the Government should not be too ready to close with any offer that may be made to them on previously existing conditions.

I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister in charge of quarantine the necessity of taking certain steps to combat an outbreak of Spanish influenza in Australia.

If the Acting Prime Minister requested the medical men to offer their services, so that they could be properly organized, with the nurses available, and temporary hospitals prepared if necessary, I am sure the response would be immediate. We should then be in a good position to meet and fight the disease after it has got over the first barricade of the quarantine. I have had a talk with the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene), and find that all possible measures are being taken in the way of quarantine to meet the emergency. I It can assure honourable members that the quarantine system will do its work, and for that I desire to thank the Minister and his officers.

It would be for the benefit of the primary producers and tbe Commonwealth generally to use all available shipping space to send our food products to the countries that are famishing for it. am shocked to find what a large expenditure is being incurred on recruiting. Yesterday 1 received a number of pamphlets of a peculiar type, that might be of value as Deadwood Dick literature. They must be costing enormous sums. This morning I saw the band playing to a big crowd in front of tlie recruiting office in the Town Hall, and at mid-day speakers from a platform in front of the General Post Office were exhorting men to join up to go to the Front. The revelations of the last few days, or even of the last fortnight, justify us in crying a halt in this direction. I raise this question now, first, because of the great expenditure being incurred, and, secondly, because I have no time for those who desire to get their names in as recruits, excepting always boys of eighteen or nineteen. I urge the Acting Prime Minister and the Government to take immediate action in this matter.

The Government have used those powers very freely in other directions; but, for some reason, the Acting Prime Minister w ill not exercise them in this direction. That, however, is his responsibility. I have heard it rumoured that to-day, despite the closing of hotel bars, certain things are being done beyond a 15-mile l i m it , in connection with the carting about of liquor, which are detrimental to, if not entirely destructive of, tbe effect desired. I hear,"" too, that the prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquor to-day and to-morrow does not affect the wine shops or the licensed grocers. , This is obviously unf a i r to the hotel keepers, who are deprived of business opportunities while competitors are allowed free and unrestricted liberty of trade.

Another Teason why a holiday should not be imposed I have not been given unnecessarily is that in most cases such holidays mean loss of pay, and this the The Acting workers can ill afford at the present time. If employers' close their workshops or warehouses, and compel their employees to take a holiday to celebrate a military victory, I hope that they w ill be honest and patriotic enough to pay for the holidav given. Yesterday the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) asked a series of questions about the Australian Dairy Produce Pool Committee and its operations. No exception is to be taken to the replies of the Minister, but there appears in this morning's Argus a paragraph regarding the Committee which is open to serious misinterpretation by those who are not aw f a it with the facts. The paragraph is as follows:In answer to questions by Mr Mackay (Ifat., Queensland), the Acting Minister for Customs( Mr Greene) stated in tbe House of Representatives yesterday that the members of the Board of control of the Butter and Cheese Pool were allowed first-class steamer and rail fares, and' f2 2s. a day travelling expenses, with an allowance of £1 la. a day when the Committee sat. Alterations in the prime of butter did not come within the jurisdiction of the pool committee. Prior to No the war the price ruling at this time of the year was Is. per lb., but it was now Is. 4$d. Producers were compelled, under the regulaMayI tions, to contribute their surplus butter and cheese to the pool. The rate of commission paid to agents had been fixed at 1 per cent. At present the average weekly quantity of butter going into cold stores or exported from Queensland was 1.400 to 1,600 cases. I wish to explain that the Minister does not draw fees, and that the £2 2s. per day travelling expenses are paid only to tbe members of the Committee who travel I have already done that. from one State to another, which reduces I am glad to the sum total of the payment very conThese allowances were not No tidings would be refixed, nor are tbey paid, by the Govern-",139,Nelles Recruiting Peace Cele Brations Prohibition Dairy Pro

"" Whilsti t is. true that we have not as to the wisdom of mobilizing a small declared certain ports outside Australia to be infected i?orts, which we have power to do under the Quarantine Act, nevertheless we have under that Act such wide powers that the Quarantine authorities are able to deal with every ship as it arrives in Australia, and there is no vessel now arriving at these shores which is not inspected by the Health authorities in the most thorough way, and every ship coming from any place where we know the influenza to be rife is immediately put into quarantine. reciprocal arrangement between the Governments of New Zealand and Australia under which persons travelling between .the two countries must submit to treatment for three days before they start their journey, and the New Zealand Government is permitting only such persons to leave the Dominion' for Australia as are required to do so by the most urgent business reasons. understand, of course, that the function of the Commonwealth Government in this matter is only the prevention of the introduction of the disease into Australia, and that the State Governments are charged under the Constitution with the duty of looking after the health of tbe people within the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Government is anxious not to do anything to invade the authority of the States in any way. We have already told them, through their Premiers, that we desire to co-operate ThePool has no with them in every possible way in dealing with this disease if it should actually break out.

In regard to the question of the mobilization, if I might so term it, of medical and nursing staffs, something of the kind has already been done, but I am not able at the moment to inform the House what form it has taken. We are consulting with the States reserve force of doctors and nurses, so that if the disease should appear we will be ready. This is a matter which concerns the States more than the Commonwealth, and whilst we are consulting them we do not pr-pose to go any further at present.
