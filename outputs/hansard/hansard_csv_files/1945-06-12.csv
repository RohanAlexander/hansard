This was done with a view to obtaining the concurrence of the Commonwealth Government in their purchase or resumption for soldier settlement.

Prime Minister and Treasurer) -by leave-An extract from a communique issued to-day by General Head-quarters, South-West Pacific Area, readsElements of the 9th Australian Division have landed simultaneously at Labuan Island, Brooketon and Muara in Brunei Bay on the western coast of Borneo, 800 miles north of Singapore and 000 miles east of the shores of Indo-China. Naval and air bombardmentlevelled the enemy's beach defences and the assault troops swept ashore with only scattered opposition. Warships of the United States Seventh Fleet and Royal Australian Navy and bombers and lighters of the Royal Australian and Thirteenth A i r Forces are supporting the operation. This landing, following our seizure of Tarakan 000 miles away by sea on the opposite side of Borneo, took the enemy by surprise, unprepared to offer effective resistance, and consequently our casualties have been negligible. Our forces already have captured Labuan town and airfield and on the mainland have advanced 4,000 yards inland from Brooketon towards Brunei town. The most powerful force of Royal Australian Air Force aircraft and men ever concentrated in tbe South-West Pacific helped to' prepare the way for the latest Australian landing in Borneo. The enemy was mercilessly hammered and harassed by Royal Australian Air Force squadrons for weeks before the actual invasion.

Does this decision apply to all members regardless of their rank, or the areas in which they are serving? Will the Acting Prime Minister take steps to ensure that such discharges shall lie effected within a short period from the date of application, such period to be specified, in order to obviate undue delay in the release of these men? tion on this matter last week I said, as I had indicated earlier to the House in n general statement, that discharges to be made On the basis referred to would be made on a graduated scale, and that the method of effecting such releases was 'being examined .by the responsible authorities. I have not yet received a report on that aspect of the matter, but so soon as it comes to hand it will be carefully examined. I do not suggest that great difficulties arise in the matter, but the releases must be effected on an orderly plan. When that report has been prepared, I shall advise the House regarding it. representing the Acting Minister for the Army seen a published statement by Major-General Fewtrell that a "" points "" system, should he established for the purpose Of determining the priority in which men shall be discharged from the services before the cessation of hostilities?

54,Mr Beasley,"The catch in tinleave-On Friday last, the Vice President of the Executive Council( Mr Beasley) invited me to tender -certain evidence concerning the proposed eviction, and dunning by the Department of the Interior of the wife of a prisoner of war. In presenting -the case now, I shall recapitulate some of the facts so that honourable members may have a full comprehension of the activities of the department in this regard. NX67681, Sapper L. J. Pedvin, was employed by the Department of the Interior as a works supervisor. He was -continuously in the employ of the department for nine years. With his wife and child he occupied a government house in Canberra, and paid a rent of 32s. 6d. a week. He was in occupation of the dlwelling for seven years, during which time the rent was regularly and promptly paid. He was a good tenant, and during his absence, his wife also has been a good tenant and has paid her rent regularly, with the exception of a certain amount which is in dispute. When Mrs. Pedvin was served with an eviction notice the amount in dispute was only £23. At the time of Pedvin's enlistment, he was in receipt of approximately £10 a week from the department. He volunteered for war service during the black days of the Dunkirk evacuation. Incidentally, a9 his department was a protected undertaking, he was not subject to call-up in the usual way. His enlistment was patriotic in the true sense of the word. He entered the Army in January, 1941, on a sapper's pay of 7s. a day, including deferred pay. This, including allotments to his wife and child, brought the total to £4 7s. 6d. a week, which represented a direct monetary sacrifice on enlistment of £5 12s. _ 6d. a week. Pedvin sailed for Malaya Speaker. Is the honourable Richmond, by reading his travening the ruling which this House recently? gentleman has been reading his speech he must not continue to do so. ment. nevertheless. the ill-fated 8th Division and was taken prisoner when Singapore fell on the 15th February, 1942. He is now, so far as we know, a prisoner in the hands of the Japanese. Prior to the fall of Singapore, he was promoted to the rank of corporal. This fact has great significance in this case, and I shall refer to it later. It is fitting to mention at this stage that the Menzies Government approved of the granting of a rent rebate to tenants of government-owned properties in Canberra who were serving in the fighting forces and whose financial circumstances were such as to warrant a concession. Pedvin applied for the concession and was granted it at the maximum rate of 1 10s. a week, his rental boing reduced from 32s. 6d. to 22s. 6d. The concession was made applicable from the time when he enlisted in the Army. In June, 1942, after the concession had .been operating for eighteen months and after Pedvin had been reported missing, his wife, in order to augment her income, obtained enjoyment in a government office in Canberra. She advised the Department of the Interior of this fact, and the concession was immediately stopped. There is not the slightest complaint about that; Mrs. Pedvin concurred in the decision. However, she was advised to reapply for the concession if she ceased work or if her circumstances changed. She continued in employment for about eighteen months, but, owing to ill-health, she decided to relinquish her employment at the end of December, 1943. During the entire period in which she had been in employment she paid her full rent of 32s. 6d. a Aveek regularly and without demur or complaint. I emphasize that there is no objection on that account.

60,Mr Anthony,"Pedvin sailed withonly a bald notification from the Department of the Interior that the concession was refused; no reasons were given. She applied again, with the same result. She then forced the issue by reverting to the payment of rent at, the concessional rate of 22s. '6d. a week, which she paid regularly. In the meantime, she strongly, and in view of all the circumstances courageously, resisted the department. precipitated a crisis, she received a letter very small sum of £23 was in dispute, an from the secretary to the Minister for the Interior stating that the reason for the refusal to grant the concession was that she was receiving increased allowance because her husband had been promoted from sapper to corporal. That was the only reason ever submitted toy the department, and I emphasize the fact in view of the inquiries and Criminal Investigation tactics that, have been loosed upon her. As I shall show, the reason was utterly fallacious. The only increase of income that the woman had received, apart from the period during which she earned money, increase made to all servicemen and their dependants. I shall now deal with tlie facts relating to the promotion of Pedvin from When, in this House on the 28th February, I mentioned the treatment which Mrs. Pedvin had received, the Minister for Works( Mr Lazzarini) made allegations concerning income that she was said to be receiving from property in Sydney, despite the fact that on two occasions she had made a sworn declaration in rebuttal, which she had supported by the production of her bank pass book. I understand that she has since produced the books to the parliamentary tee. They show that her income is derived solely from her Army allowance. This has not yet been controverted. If and when the report of the committee is placed before the House, I shall comment further on this aspect of the matter. The statement of the department that her income had increased in consequence of the promotion of her husband, is untrue; because, although Pedvin was promoted, he became a prisoner-of-war almost immediately, and no authority to increase hisallotment has ever appeared in Army records. Consequently, under Mr Anthony. Army regulations, his wife has continued to receive an allowance based on the rate of pay of a sapper. That is the position at the present time. Despite the fact that the rent not in dispute had been paid right up to date, that Pedvin was an employee of the department which owns the dwelling occupied by his wife and child, that he was a prisoner-of-war Having in the hands of the Japanese, and that the eviction notice, signed by the Minister for the Interior and directed to the soldier himself, although at the time he was a prisoner-of-war in the hands of the Japanese, was served on his wife, instructing her to quit possession of the cottage by the 15th May last. I have a copy of that notice. With rare callousness, it was dated the 14th February, the eve of the Branch third anniversary of the day on which Pedvin became a prisoner-of-war. It was at this point that I raised the matter in this House. The Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) considered it of such importance that, on the 2nd March, he said that he was the statutory would appoint a committee, consisting of members of all parties, and would ask a senior Minister to discharge the duties of chairman if he were unable to do so sapper to corporal. personally. The Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Beasley) was appointed chairman of the committee. It has had three months in which to determine fhis simple matter, but has not yet made a report. The delay is said to be due to the absence in San Francisco of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mx. Pollard) a member of the committee. The committee had ample time to finalize the matter long before the honourable member's departure from Australia. commitDespite the denials of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, the dunning of this lady still goes on. 'She has not received one line from the department, stating whether the eviction notice has been withdrawn or will be executed at a later date. Whenever she makes a payment of rent, the receipt issued to her has on it a reminder of her alleged arrears. I shall show to the satisfaction of any fair minded person that those receipts constitute consistent dunning. First, they record that she is in arrears with her rent to the amount in dispute. Secondly, they record the increasing amount of those arrears week by week. I bave four of the receipts that have been issued to Mrs. Pedvin; they cover a period of six weeks from the 27th April. Two of the amounts Mrs. Pedvin paid personally, and on the other two occasions she left money with a neighbour for payment to the collector. I emphasize the recognition by the department that the form of receipt issued personally to Mrs. Pedvin inflicted humiliation which should be kept from the knowledge of neighbours. The procedure to which I am about to refer may be regarded as the only consideration which the department has shown to this woman. The form in which the receipts were issued proves that the department recognized the doubtful character of its actions; in other words, that the receipts undoubtedly were dunning documents. The first receipt is dated the 28th April, 1945. The payment was made by Mrs. Pedvin, and the amount recorded is £2 5s., which is stated to be rent to the 18th April. But, so as to remind her that the amount in dispute is neither forgotten nor forgiven, the words "" Balance, £28 "", appear at the bottom of the receipt. On the 10th May and the 24th May, the payments were made by a neighbour. In deference to Mrs. Pedvin's feelings, the receipts make no reference to a balance being outstanding. Government members interjecting, show what consideration those making them have for the wife of a prisoner-ofwar who sacrificed a salary of £10 a week to accept a sapper's pay of £4 7s. 6d. a week. The last payment was made by Mrs. Pedvin personally, only last Thursday. The sum of £2 5s. is recorded as having been received for rent due to the 6th June. I again emphasize that this lady is right up to the minute with the payment of what she considers is her proper rent. The receipt issued on that occasion reveals greater refinement of feeling than had been shown previously, because it contains only the inscription "" £31"", not prefaced by the word "" balance "". Thus, while the committee has been considering its report the department has been piling up arrears of rent, and has lost no opportunity to stress Mrs. Pedvin's remissness in the six weeks under review. According to the department, her arrears increased from £28 on the 27th April to £31 on the 7th June. Any intelligent person can construe the form of the receipts only as an implied demand for the payment of the amount said to he in arrears. When the committee was appointed early in March, the disputed arrears amounted to only £25. The Vice-President of the Executive Council may interpret the expression "" dunning letters"" entirely to his own satisfaction, but that these receipts which I have produced are dunning intimations is beyond dispute. What is more, they are so regarded by tbe recipient of them. Since the whole of the arrears are the subject of a parliamentary investigation, all reference to them by the department should have been suspended, pending the presentation of tlie committee's report. In this view I am supported by the Vice-President of the Executive Council himself, because, in the course of his reply to my question on Thursday last, he said, "" Until the matter is finally adjusted, it should remain as it was when the committee started its deliberations."" I think that I have proved conclusively that the matter has not remained as it was sincethat time. As a matter of fact, the arrears in that period have increased from £25 to £31. Yet the department says that there has been no dunning of Mrs. Pedvin. This case has gone far beyond the responsibility of the Miiaiister for the Interior, and. the dispute will not be resolved by making a. scapegoat of the Minister. The responsibility now rests squarely on the Government as a whole. Since the attention of the Parliament has been directed to the case and the Prime Minister has appointed a committee to investigate it, the matter has been taken out of the hands of that Minister, and the delay on the part of the committee in presenting its report cannot ,be excused. No semblance of consideration appears to have been given to the fact that the tenant's ultimate fate caused harrowing anxiety to a soldier's wife. She has been in a constant state of nervous tension ever since the receipt, in February last, of the eviction notice,",22,Canberra House Tenancy Of Soldiek S Wife

They have long been prepared to do that. member advocate that? been prepared to subscribe the miserable sum in dispute, but they have refrained from doing so, believing that the principle at stake should be upheld. Mrs. Pedvin took the same view of the matter. They are prepared even to buy the house at the Government's valuation, so that the tenant may be no longer molested. A point has now been reached, however, where that principle must be sacrificed, if necessary, in the interests of Mrs. Pedvin's health. She cannot stand this strain much longer. I therefore urge that the committee should complete its report, and that in the meantime the department, which owns the house, should be instructed that this lady must not be further pestered. President of the Executive Council) by leave-On the 7th J une last, the honourable member for Richmond asked a lengthy question on this matter, and at about the concluding portion of it he used' kind, and that until a proper authority these words"" Will the Minister see that these dunning letters which Mrs. Pedvin is still receiving from the Department of the Interior shall be stopped? the conclusion of my question. the Hansard proof. I repeat the words "" dunning letters "", which left no doubt in the minds of honourable members that the department was sending letters to Mrs. Pedvin in connection with this matter, and, in fact, harassing her in the process. That is the impression created by the honourable member's remarks. I thought at the time that possibly that was happening, and I said that no such letters should be sent to her. That is how I sincerely felt about the matter. Next day I inquired from the department whether this practice was being followed, and I received a reply to the effect that no letters had been sent in the matter, because public money is by it to Mrs. Pedvin. I remarked at the time that any employee of the department who gave false information to me on the matter had better put on his coat and hat, because in matters of that kind everything must be clear and above board and truthful statements must be the honourable made. It is very clear that letters have not been sent. The honourable member for Richmond ought to be more careful in his statements, because it is common knowledge in the parliamentary lobbies that he is ""easy meat"", and that *' Larry"" Anthony can be induced to ask any question in the House, whether it relates to facts or not. That, I think, is a bad reputation for the honourable member to have earned. It is true that whilst receipts tendered to Mrs. Pedvin from time to time bore a reminder of the unpaid balance, receipts left with a lady living next door to her bore no reference to balance due. The rent collector did not wish to make any reference on the receipts to the balance unless he was handing them directly to Mrs. Pedvin. When she returned to Canberra after having been absent for some time, and a receipt was handed to her, a note was made on the butt, which I now have before me, that the balance due was £31. I have made inquiries and am informed that ordinary business principles are observed in matters of this determines whether the outstanding payments are to be made or not, they must be stated in the receipts from time to time. what the Minister said on Thursday. honourable member to know that the action taken by rent collectors in this territory conforms with an instruction issued in 1940 whenSenator Eoll was Minister for the Interior. to evict anybody. member cannot get away from the fact that "" a departmental instruction was issued in 1940, when Senator Foil was Minister, to the effect that this practice must be followed, and it has been followed ever since.

71,Mr Beasley,"The honorablemust give a receipt or acknowledgment on a printed form taken from a book of receipt forms supplied to him for the purpose. The regulations do not prescribe any form of receipt, but it is generally understood that all written receipts should include the date and number of the receipt, the name of the person from whom the amount is received, and the amount iu words and figures. The regulations also provide that, when part payment of a sum due is made, it is imperative that the officer issuing the receipt shall indicate on it that the amount has been ""received on account"". The insertion on the receipt of the amount of the balance due, while not essential for the purposes of the receipt, is not an unusual procedure, and does afford protection in the collection of public moneys. That is the instruction which was issued by the Treasury to officers of the Department of the Interior, and those instructions are folout of it very badly indeed. I do not lowed in all such cases.

Last Thursday, the honourable member for Richmond said that dunning letters had been sent to this lady. As a matter of fact, no dunning letters were sent to her.

Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.20]. I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to provide £27,000,000 out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions. Bills seeking appropriations of this nature are submitted to the Parliament periodically to enable amounts to be paid to a trust account from which the actual payments of pensions are made at rates already approved by the Parliament. balance of appropriation now remaining is sufficient to meet pension payments to the end of June, and the Parliament is asked to appropriate £27,000,000, which is approximately sufficient for next year's expenditure. The amount will, however, not be withdrawn from revenue immediately, as only sufficient funds are paid to the trust account as are required to meet the periodical payment to pensioners. This bill has no relation whatever to the rates or conditions under which invalid and old-age pensions are paid; it merely seeks the provision of funds to enable payments to be made on the basis already approved by the Parliament. the purpose of determining the extent of the debate, I ask you, Mr Speaker, whether it would be permissible to draw attention to a serious anomaly which has arisen in the administration of this legislation, namely, the amount allowed to a person who owns a home. given to-day of a bill to amend the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act.

Tbe purpose of this bill is tbe appropriation of an additional £20,000,000 of revenue for war purposes. When the budget was presented to Parliament in September last, I estimated that the total revenue would be £359,000,000. A like sum, which included £177,000,000 for war purposes and the balance for other expenditure, was appropriated from revenue. Some revenue items will exceed the budget estimate. Income tax may yield an increased amount of £15,000,000 Sales tax is expected to exceed the estimate by £2,000,000. Customs and excise and post office revenue show a tendency to buoyancy ovor the Estimates and, as other items of revenue show the same trend, the budget, estimate may be appreciably exceeded. It is anticipated that non-war expenditure will be approximately the same as the budget estimate. It is difficut at present to forecast accurately the total revenue for the f u l l financial year, but the indications are that the improvement will be from £15,000,000 to £20,000,000. It is necessary that an additional appropriation, whatever the amount may be, should be made to enable the use of that increased revenue to meet war £20,000,000 is therefore sought. In the budget, I informed the Parliament that war expenditure in 1944-45 would be £505,000,000. Owing to unavoidable delay in the rendition of accounts for heavy overseas liabilities, there has been a substantial falling off of the rate of expenditure, and it is now possible that the expenditure for the year will not exceed £470,000,000. over? not come forward we shall naturally have a heavy leewny to make up next financial year. If the improvement of the revenue amounts to £20,000,000, the effect of the proposed appropriation will be to relieve the loan fund and charge to revenue £20,000,000 without increasing our total expenditure. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) probably knows that this surplus revenue must be appropriated. reduce taxation? must 'be .appropriated. have to carry out the terms of the Constitution.

Whereas £20,000,000 would have had to be found from loan funds for war expenditure, that £20,000,000 will be found from revenue. Mi-. FRANCIS I appreciate the point clearly.

Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.39] C move That the bill be now read a second time. Tbe purpose of tbe bill is to grant Supply to carry on the normal services of government for the first three months of the financial year 1945-46. The amount is £55,557,000. The provision may be summarized under the following heads:Departments and services, other than Defence and War, Business Undertakings and Territories of the Commonwealth .. Defence and War (1939-44) services Business Undertakings (Post Office and Railways) Territories of the Commonwealth Refunds of Revenue Treasurer's Advance The provision made in the bill covers only the estimated requirements to carry on the essential services on the basis of the provision in the Appropriation Act passed by Parliament for the current year 1944-45. The amounts set down for ordinary services represent, with minor exceptions, approximately one-quarter of the 1944-45 appropriations. Excluding special appropriations, it is estimated that in the first three months of 1945-46 the total war expenditure w ill amount to £105,102,000. Thi3 amount is substantially less than one-quarter of last year's appropriation, due principally to the reduction in expenditure in England and America, to the lag in expenditure in the first, quarter of the financial year, and to some extent to a fallin g off in war expenditure in Australia. The sum of £40,000,000 provided fior war services in this bill represents the estimated amount which w ill be available from revenue receipts for the first three months of the year to meet war expenditure after making due allowance for other obligations. The balance of war expenditure will be met from loan appropriations. As in previous years, provision is made in the b ill for ""Advance to the Trea surer"", the amount being £5,000,000. This amount is required mainly to carry on uncompleted civil works which w ill be in progress at tbe 30th June, and also to cover unforeseen and miscellaneous expenditure. No provision has been made for any new expenditure except in respect of Defence and war services, and there is no departure from existing policy. adjourned. £ COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL 1945.

Indeed, this provision should be made in respect of all departments of the bank. Even in a departmental store, managers are provided in each department and they confer and act under the direct control of the general manager, who, in turn, is under tlie control and direction of a board of directors. If that method is good enough for the successful and competent management, of commerce and industry, it should be an essential requirement for the management, control and co-ordination of the basis of the whole of our financial structure, namely, the Commonwealth Bank. for Home Security and Minister for Works) [4.46] -This amendment seeks to place a department of the Commonwealth Bank under separate management. The policy of the Government, as the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) outlined in his second-reading speech, is to place entire control of the Commonwealth Bank under a governor. As the amendment conflicts with that policy, I am not able to accept it. the Opposition) [4.47] -The amendment submitted by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) will not achieve the form of management that the right honoralble gentleman would like best but represents a kind of middle course. The existing law provides that the note issue shall be controlled by the Commonwealth Bank Board. The bill provides that the note issue shall be controlled by the governor of the Commonwealth Bank, and, therefore, be under the control of tlie Treasurer. With his amendment, the right, honourable gentleman is seeking to recover something from the wreck by providing that, at least, the note issue shall have separate management from the other activities of the bank, the idea being that the note issue is of such far-reaching importance that it should be divorced as far as possible from immediate political control. It is quite true that in the long run, the note issue of a country-particularl y a country under parliamentary government-is subject to political control, because the Parliament may always pass special legislation in relation to it. But there is very great force in the view, which was argued during. the second reading debate on this bill, that to put the note issue under the direct control of the Treasury is to invite, in some circumstances and under some treasurers, a disastrous handling of tlie note issue. In his second-reading speech, the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) said that the note issue was only a reflection of credit policy, and, therefore, he rather deprecated any suggestion that the note issue, of itself, was a very significant matter. He looked at the note issue as the result of certain causes, and not as a cause in itself. In the event of inflation, he would look to central bank policy as the major cause, and would look upon an inflated note issue merely as a result of what had been done by the central bank. Similarly, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) in addressing himself to this matter (Hansard, page 803) saidThe a mount of tlie note issue is a matter of minor importance when considering the stability of the currency. T desire to say a few words about those points. It would, I think, be a great mistake if anybody gained the idea that the increase of the note issue from, about £40,000,000 to about £200,000,000 is a matter of no great significance. It is quite true that in many respects, the note issue does reflect central bank policy and, in particular, that aspect of central bank policy which concerns itself with the lending of money to the Government. If the central hank decides to advance very large sums of money to the Government, on treasury-hills, for example, the amount of money that will go into circulation will immediately be increased, and according to the velocity of its circulation, the demand for currency will be increased in the community. Quite normally, in times like these, when large sums of money are being made available to the Government by the central bank, we expect to find an increase of the note issue. But that ignores, or gives insufficient weight to, two considerations. The first of them is that, just because we cannot expand central bank",30,Seoond Beadin G

The second factor is certainly not to man seeks to do the next best thing, be overlooked.

122,Mr Spender (Warringah) [5.1],"Idegree it eliminates completely all safeguards on the amount of the note issue from time to time. Secondly, clause 9 enables any portion of the bank's policy in any of its departments, to he determined by the Treasurer -Clause agreed to. No one can deny that in this country at present, as in most countries at war, tliere arc very dangerous elements which can lead to inflation. During the war we have been able to control inflation very largely by our controls, particularly over manpower, wages and prices, but when the war ends control of man-power will be relaxed, as has been indicated by the Government's White Paper on full employment and wages will prove incapable of being pegged indefinitely. As to control of prices, I think that honourable members will concede that a continuance of existing measures will not be possible, nor do I think it desirable that they should be continued permanently. That points to the danger which we shall face when the war ends. The quantity of notes issued at any time may be of no more consequence, or oven of less consequence, as an element of inflation, than the amount of bank deposits. During the war, savings bank deposits have increased by well over £200,000,000, trading bank deposits by a similar amount, the note issue by about £150,000,000, and treasury-bills have advanced from a total of £50,000,000 to over £200,000,000. These are dangerous factors, which can lead to inflation. One of the most dangerous factors to be considered is the psychological effect of the note issue being subject to the vagaries of government policy. In my opinion, inflation springs not only from economic factors but also from psychological factors, and the most important psychological factor is the amount of notes current in the community. We ought to apply some brake to the issuing of notes, and therefore I support the amendment. The Government would not be in any way prejudiced, if the amendment were accepted, because clause 9 gives the Government overriding control in the event of any disagreement with the bank. The amendment at least provides for separate management of the note issue, so that the special factors related to increasing the note issue would be considered by a body of men specially appointed for the purpose. I urge the Government to accept the amendment, which will in no way affect the main purpose of the bill. Amendment negatived. Clause 40 agreed to. Clause 4)1Australian notes may be issued i u any of the following denominations, na-raely, Five shillings, Ten shillings, One pound, Five pounds, Ten pounds or any multiple of Ten pounds. Leader of the Australian Country party) [5.7] I move That the following proviso be added:"" Provided that the maximum l i m it of the notes so issued shall be not greater than an amount approved by Parliament"". As the bill stands, there is no provision for any restriction on the issuing of notes. In this connection, it is interesting to read the findings of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, of which the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) was a member. In paragraph 579, the commission summed up the position as follows: The present position is that the Commonwealth Bank is compelled by law to hold in the form of gold or English sterling a reserve of 25 per cent, of the notes issued. If an emergency arises, as in 1931, in which the Bank wishes to be free from this restriction, legislation is required. Wherever there is a legal restriction of this kind there is a tendency to hold a reserve in excess of the legal minimum. In the absence of such, restriction, tlie Bank would be able to use these reserves in any way it chose. Formerly, when the holder of a note was entitled to exchange it for gold, it was necessary that some gold "" bucking"" for the notes should be kept, and it was customary to limi t the amount of the note issue by reference to the gold held. Now, however, that the note carries with it no such obligation, tliere is no need for such ""backi n g "" except as a method of limiting the volume of notes. But for this purpose the reserve limitation, as at present interpreted, is of little use. For if the Bank wishes to increase the volume of the note issue, it can, .by raising the exchange rate, increase the value in Australian currency of the note issue reserve, whilst keeping within the legal limits. On the other hand, the reserve limitation may cause embarrassment to the Bank if circumstances arise in which it wishes to reduce the exchange rate. It is desirable that some l i m it should be placed on the note issue, but the issue should be capable of some expansion when necessary.",33,Seoond Beadin G
123,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"Tliis paragraph shows that the commission considered that the note issue should not be too rigidly controlled, but should be capable of expansion to meet unforeseen and extraordinary circumstances. The commission made the following recommendations:(7) The statutory provisions which require the Commonwealth"" Bank to hold gold or sterling in proportion to the amount of Australian notes on issue should be repealed. (8) The note issue should be limited by law to a iixud maximum (for example, £60,000,000) subject to the right of the Bank to exceed the maximum by a stated amount (for example £10,000,000)' with the consent of the Treasurer. The figures mentioned in the recommendations are used only for illustrative purposes. There should be a l i m it as to quantum, with a "" safety valve"" provision, to be used in the event of emergency, for fixing an amount by which that l i m it may be exceeded. Mr Sou""Li'.iM A maximum of £60,000,000 would look rather peculiar now. used only for the purpose of illustration. I have framed the proposed amendment so that Parliament may be able to meet changing circumstances. obvious to everybody that there must be some specified limi t to tbe expansion of the note issue. When all is said and done, tbe stability of the value of the Australian £1 note is of great importance to the community. The purchasing power of wages must be maintained in order to uphold the appropriate values of insurance policies, war gratuity payments, deferred pay and so forth . The Parliament has a responsibility which cannot be lightly brushed aside, and the Opposition wishes to accept that responsibility by providing that the maximum amount of the notes issued shall be not .greater thau a l i m it approved, by tbe ^Parliament. If my amendment be agreed ^to, any extension of the note issue w ill ""have to be considered by Parliament in ""the light of existing circumstances and w i th due regard to possible future conditions. ^Clause 41 is the crucial clause of this -division of the bill. Judging by the experience of other nations, it appears to be essential that, if this legislation is to operate in peaee-itime as well as in times of national emergency, such as the present state of war, there must, be some method of controlling the total issue of notes. An investigation of the laws of other countries shows that there are two main methods of applying such control. One is the establishment of a proportional reserve, against which notes can be issued to a specified number of times the value' of the gold or international exchange backing. The other is the imposition of a maximum l i m it ou the fiduciary issue, in addition to having a f u l l y covered issue, as is the case w i th the Bank of England. I notice that there is a very interesting provision common to the laws of most countries, namely that when notes are issued in excess of the legal backing, a tax in respect of that excess is paid by the issuing .bank. A good example of this is the United. States Federal Reserve Aot, under which the tax is 1 per cent, per annum if the proportion of gold reserve is between 40 per cent, and 32£ per cent., and 1$ per cent, per annum for each. 2 \ per cent, or part thereof] by which the reserve falls below 32£ per cent. Most of the acts of the It should be different countries provide for increasing taxes in similar steps, and nearly all of them have the provision in the Federal Reserve Act that the tax or a proportion of it must be added to the rate of discount. The effect of this would be that, as inflation occurred, there would be some measure of control, by reason of the tendency of interest rates to increase throughout the whole of the banking system, because discount rafes had risen. It is obvious that there must be proper control of the note issue if the Government's stated policy of having low-interest rates is to be given effect. I shall place on record the methods of issue in most countries; because it is worthwhile to remember that we must expect to get our migrants from those countries; and we shall not have a large number of migrants bringing to Australia big sums for investment unless they are assured that our banking system w i ll contain real safeguards at the end of the war. In their existing legislation there is provision for a maximum note issue in England, Finland, Japan, Norway, Spain",34,Seoond Beadin G

I emphasize the inclusion of Russia in that list of countries, because, although the Government does not always seem anxious to "" lie in the same bed"" as that country, it has adopted many of the Russian policies. There is provision in some countries for a tax if the reserve falls. count rate automatically rises, and with that rise there is an increase of the interest rates generally throughout the country. That has been found to be one of the best means of resisting inflation. Those countries are: Austria, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Czechoslovakia, Danzig, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Norway, Peru, Poland, South Africa, Spain, and the United States of America. In many of them there is provision for the raising of interest rates as the note issue increases. Let us consider the example of England, which we might well follow whilst doing away with the present system. definite safeguard against permanent inflation. rency and Bank Notes Act of 1928, the Bank of England may issue notes up to the amount representing the gold, coin and bullion in the Issue Department, plus notes amounting to £260,000,000 in excess of the gold holding a fiduciary issue. At the request of the bank, the Treasury may authorize an issue of hank notes in excess of the £260,000,000 for a period not exceeding six months. Any such authority may be renewed or varied, but no such authority shall remain in force for two years unless the Parliament otherwise determines. The Treasury minute authorizing an increase of the fiduciary note issue must be laid before both Houses of the Parliament forthwith. We have been striving to secure the acceptance of that principle Tliere is a statutory of responsibility to Parliament in connection with every vital matter of policy throughout the consideration of this measure. The Government would be well advised to consider very carefuly the insertion, if not here then in the Senate, of a provision of that sort, which the experience of practically all civilized countries has shown to be necessary if there is to be confidence in the financial structure. The matter should be viewed realistically. Inflation is merely a form of concealed tax, especially on the poorest section of the community. It does not contribute to the general fund of the Government out of which the cost of public works and services is defrayed. The tax of inflation, although invisible, is none the less real, and it does not benefit anybody in the community, except the few who are able to make fortunes by taking advantage of it. Even for the protection of the Treasury, a provision in this legislation making reference to the Parliament necessary would be a wise course to adopt.

Sir Earle Page,"We shall not the wealth produced, we are endeavouring to ensure that the Parliament shall be heard, should it be desired, for some extraordinary reason, to raise the note i .me above what is regarded as reasonable. A deliberative assembly-which , of course, this is not-woul d not in any circumstances give to the Treasurer the power to issue notes to an unlimited' value, thus vitally national economy. We have been told repeatedly that the difference between Australia and a fascist country is that this country, being a democracy, has a Parliament that is vested with complete power. Yet this supreme institution in a democracy is being asked to delegate its power to a Government! The proposal is that we should, not only abolish all conments can increase that tendency. Theretrols connected with finance, but also give to the Treasurer a blank cheque, by the use of which he might ultimately ruin the whole of our financial structure. Surely adequate control of the issue of notes is vital to the national economy! An uncontrolled note issue could destroy the value of the currency. The purchasing power of the people, and the value of the wages of working men, the return from investments, and every pension payable, could be immeasurably affected by injudicious action. The inflation of the currency could result in ruin comparable with that which has been experienced by countries on the continent of Europe. This is far too big an issue for any Government to handle alone. As the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) has argued, the bill should make such provision as will safeguard not only the people but also the Treasurer himself. The matter is one for determination by the highest authority, the Parliament of the country. After all, the Government represents only a section of the total population. The Parliament should be the supreme authority, to authorize what amount of notes shall be issued. Eor these reasons, I support the amendment. I draw the attention of the people to what is being done in this Parliament by legislation of this character. It is idle, however, to hope that the Government will accept any amendment; the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) has made abundantly clear that he will not do so. The honourable gentleman, in his second-reading speech, claimed to have the support of Lord Keynes for his proposal not to tie the note Issue to a specified reserve. That is true. But he did not tell the whole story, because Lord Keynes made it clear that the most satisfactory method for maintaining affecting the control of the central bank is to require from time to time legislative approval of the note issue. What has disturbed me most has been the continued decline of the purchasing power of the £1. That has been the trend for the last 25 years particularly, and it will continue. Whilst the impact of war is further diminishing the value of the £1, the policy of governfore, it is important at all times to assert the authority of Parliament over the action of the Executive. To-day the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) submitted certain proposed appropriations, the debate upon which has been postponed, so we shall have an opportunity later of speaking on matters affecting public expenditure. Why, however, is it regarded as less important to debate whether or not a large increase of the note issue is desirable? No opportunity is to be afforded under this bill to debate that vital issue in Parliament. During the war the valup of the £1 has fallen, according to official figures, iby over 20 per cent.; in my opinion the real reduction of purchasing power is considerably more. When the war controls are lifted, it will be revealed that the reduction has been much greater, and the effect will be serious on members of the community who have been thrifty and have invested money in liquid assets, particularly those who for many years have paid premiums regularly to life assurance societies. Those who have invested in life assurance during the last five years will receive, in real money, much less than they had expected to get. remark is applicable to those who have invested in war loans. invested in liquid assets in any form.

As the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) remarked, the tax is indirect, and people do not become aware of its effect until they wish to use their money. In the price-fixing policy of the Government, we have seen the "" profits squeeze "" being used as a means of taxing industry. In this bill. we have another example of action by the Executive in a matter the' decision of which should be the sole prerogative of the Parliament. As the Parliament substantially has surrendered its power in respect of expenditure, it is now surrendering, it in respect of taxation. I cannot see why any government should not be content to have an upper limit of 20 per cent, above ihe present issue of notes, beyond which it should not he permitted to go without parliamentary approval.

I agree that there should he no tied limit to any specific reserve, but debate of an increase of the note issue is as important as debate of an increase of taxation. Both have the same effect. Indeed, in their , economic consequences, they are very largely the same. £10,000,000 in London and build up the note issue by another £50,000,000. row, we bave to obtain parliamentary approval. Whether taxation be imposed by means of a profits squeeze, or by central bank control which affects the purchasing power of the £1, those are both matters which should be debated in this Parliament. I realize that I am as one crying in the wilderness, because the Government intends to go ahead with its policy, irrespective of any views advanced by the Opposition. I urge the Treasurer that there should be an upper limit of 20 or 25 per cent., beyond which the Government should be unable to increase the note issue without parliamentary authority. If that is not provided, one can only infer that the Government does not propose to use its powers exclusively in the interests of sound finance. Serious consideration should be given to my suggestion before the bill reaches the Senate. [5.38] -The Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) made a significant interjection when, referring to the agreement reached at Bretton Woods, he said that it was necessary to put something in before we could get anything out. So far as the note issue is concerned, after the passage of this bill it will not be necessary to put anything in before we can take out as much as ws like in the form of paper currency. There will be no limit to what the Government can do in the issue of paper money once this bill becomes law. Last week I referred to the fact that gold had reached a record price. I notice that according to the press the price has risen over the week-end to another record and is now £10 15s. 9d. per oz. In other words, the price of a sovereign at the Commonwealth Bank to-day is £2 10s. I have heard, since this Parliament rose on Friday last, that one could obtain £5 for a sovereign on the black market. I have never been to the black market, but I am told that, provided that one can produce the money demanded, and can speak the right language, one can purchase almost anything on the black market at King's Cross, Sydney. The ultimate measure of the currency will be gold. That has always been the position, and it will continue to be so. The test will come in future when the Treasury will be asked to relax the present restrictions on the sale of gold. The balance between paper currency and gold prices will be determined by a free market. When that time comes we shall witness a continual increase of the prices of commodities as compared with the value of paper currency. If the Government forces this legislation through the Parliament, as no doubt it will, it will have to carry the responsibility which goes with legislation of this kind.",37,Seoond Beadin G

138,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"the Opposition) [5.43] I had hoped, though not confidently, that the Minister for Home Security( Mr Lazzarini) might have had something to say on this matter. After all, there are two things to be done about clauses in a bill of this nature; one is to hear some criticism of them, and the other is to hear some justification of them. In this case we have heard no justification whatever. If ever a set of proposals has been thrown at the Parliament with accompanying observation that no amendments will be received, that has happened with this bill. ticular matter in my reply to the debate on the second reading. finds his reply either cogent or relevant I cannot share his view. I thought that it was a very adroit speech, but its outstanding feature was that it did not answer anybody or anything. There are three broad principles which can be apf )lied in relation to the matter of the imitation of the note issue. We may decide to go on with the system that we have had-that of having a reserve which has been made flexible enough because it is represented by either gold or sterling. The advantage of that system is that it recognizes one of the basic facts of a nation's finance, and that is that in the long run an international debt or obligation must be met in either goods or gold, or some currency which has international value. Accordingly the existence of a reserve of gold or of English sterling at all times is of importance to Australia, so long as it engages in international transactions. That is one way of doing it. The second way is that indicated in the amendment, namely, to fix an upper limit, not a narrow upper limit, but one that allows for some proper adjustment, with a provision that parliamentary anthority must first be obtained to exceed the limit. The Government rejects that method. It does not say why. Not one reason has been given why it is thought to be a good thing that the Executive uncontrolled by either discussion, or decision, in Parliament should have the right to increase the note issue at will and without limit. The third course is, apparently, the course which commends itself to the Government; and that is to have no upper limit and no provision for reserve-in other words, to have a note issue which is uncontrolled except by the mere whim of the Executive. I put this to the Treasurer as a matter which deserves his serious consideration. Is there any reason to believe that the provision which exists to-day for a 25 per cent, reserve of gold, or of sterling, has handicapped us during the war? thing. rhetorical answer. Is there any evidence whatever that during this war, when our financial structure has been subjected to the greatest strain in its history, the requirement of a 25 per cent, backing of gold, or sterling, for the currency has handicapped Australia in its war finance, or finance for civil purposes? hypothesis. AllI am asking for-and I know that even with the best intentions in the world, the Treasurer will not give it to me-is some evidence that this requirement of reserve has imposed some hardship, some limitation, some awkward consequence upon Australia in financing its war effort. If it has, this Parliamenthas never been told about it. Not once from the day war broke out until now has the Government ever come to Parliament and said, "" Alter this 25 per cent. We find it a handicap "". Of course, the truth is that at all material times, and particularly in recent years, our sterling position in London has been pretty good, and sometimes uncommonly good; and the result is that this limitation imposed by a reserve has rested quite lightly upon the Treasury. Why is it to he removed ? Is it because the Treasurer wants to reduce the note issue? Of course not; because if he does want to reduce the note issue there is no point in striking off any of the existing light shackles. Or is it because the Treasurer wants to increase the note issue? Tf he contemplates increasing the note issue at a time when war expenditure is falling, then we are approaching a period when, instead of full employment prevailing in Australia, a condition of full disaster will obtain.

However, I repeat tbe one point wbicb I rose to emphasize. Will the Treasurer show us why at this stage it is thought necessary to get rid of a reserve provision ? I have circulated an amendment, a new clause; and I do not desire to speak on it aerain. There are two ways of imposing control. I shall be quite content with either. I am quite happy with the way proposed by the right honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Fadden); or I shall be quite happy with a continuance of the present reserve provision which I have foreshadowed in a new clause. But I am completely unhappy that there shall be no restriction, no condition whathundreds of millions. ever, no parliamentary control, but utterly uncircuniscribed executive control over the amount of currency which may at any moment be put into circulation. Prime Minister and Treasurer) [5.50] I propose to deal briefly with this matter. The whole basis of a reserve is to my mind a complete sham. The fact of the matter is, as I mentioned by interjection when the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) was speaking, that the Government can borrow £10,000,000 overseas and increase the note issue by £50,000,000. borrow without parliamentary approval? need not necessarily say that it was borrowing for that purpose. suppose that any Treasurer would mislead Parliament? as the right honourable gentleman has said, is that the reserve is 25 per cent, of the note issue. memory, the note issue rose to £196,000,000. Merely because we were able to acquire London funds, and so long as we had plenty of London funds, we could increase the note issue. regarded the note issue, and I do not regard it now, as being anything more than the financial result of some happening, such as an expansion of credit. Because of great commerciajl activity there has been a demand for an increase of the note issue, and that demand has simply been met by the bank. Therefore, it is not a matter of the Government coming into the picture at all. The bank has met the demand for notes. It is apparent to anybody who has studied the matter at all that the increase of the note issue has been the result of some cause. What about Germany's experience for example? ber is correct, assuming that some government will decide to print notes by the ments similar to those now being used by the Treasurer. increase of the note issue at present has not been due to anything hut a demand for notes following increased commercial activity. Therefore, it is only an effect, not a cause. Let us see what a sham the note issue reserve can be. It is generally conceded that we do not have to hold £25 in sterling against every £100 of Australian notes on issue. A ll we have to hold in sterling is the equivalent of 25 per cent, of the Australian note circulalation. Whenever the currency is depreciated, as it was by the raising of the exchange rate, more notes can be issued on the basis of the same sterling reserve. If the exchange rate is lowered, less note currency can be issued. reason for the amendment. ever a measure is brought before Parliament with respect to banking or money, the Opposition, regardless of party political affiliations, sets out to create all sorts Speaking from of fears that government policy, again regardless of party affiliations, is absolutely unsatisfactory.

158,Mr Chifley,"Unfortunately , whenbeen a bad thing. We would not now be in the dark. some of the wild, irresponsible statements which the right honourable gentleman himself made when an earlier Labour government proposed to send abroad a portion of the gold reserve, I can imagine the sort of statements that would be made in this Parliament in any debate on a subject of this kind. I said the other night, and I repeat, that the more silently and smoothly the financial machine is working the more satisfactory it is, and fewer fears are created in the mind of the community. But, unfortunately, the public takes notice of irresponsible statements, or statements made without full knowledge of the subject-and without regard to the fact that they might create fears in the public mind; and that has been the case with respect to this measure. this Government say that the Commonwealth c.oxild not afford to pay interest on government loans. was introduced, all sorts of statements have been made about the great dangers arising under it. However, we have had a fair instance of the worthlessness of such talk. Since the Government announced its banking proposals, it has floated a loan in which all honourable members assisted. In such circumstances, could they frankly and conscientiously have gone to the country and advised the people to invest in that loan, if they thought that all these fears were going to be realized ? They could not have honestly done that; and that is the blunt fact. I repeat that in every discussion on finance in this chamber statements are made which create fears in the minds of the public going to treat the support of its war provision that in the event of a substanloans by the Opposition as public aptial increase of the note issue the matter proval by them of the Government's would automatically come before Parfinancial policy, then we shall have to liament? reconsider our position. this: Surely, honourable members would always debate the matter; but it has not not advise the people to invest in war during loans if they really believed that all the dangers of which they have spoken were going to arise. I realize that the financial machine can be used badly. There is no doubt about that. Indeed, it has been used badly in the past in order to deflate the currency. In reply to the Leader of tlie Opposition ( Mr Menzies), it is true that the Commonwealth Bank's sterling reserve in London was in danger of running very low. In 1939 it dropped to £33,000,000, and at that level would not have been sufficient finally to have provided the necessary reserve to the note issue. note issue at that stage. enable us to meet other commitments. At one time it looked as though our sterling reserve would drop to a dangerous level. The honourable member for Warringah spoke about the necessity for having sufficient reserves in London. If we had not adequate reserves what should we be obliged to do? If the note issue reserve were the only money we had available in sterling, we should have to introduce a measure to wipe out the 25 per cent, provision? Andi f we reached the position where the note reserve was high we should have a great amount of London funds immobilized behind the note issue, which we could not use withouit enacting a special measure for that purpose; and by enacting such a measure we should only create fears in the minds of the people and attract the attention of. the world to the fact that we were in difficulty, whereas we could probably overcome our difficulty by handling the matter quietly.

167,Mr Chifley,"Parliamen t cantake strong exception to the statement of the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley)' before the dinner adjournment that because we on this side support Commonwealth war loans we thereby admit that there 13 no danger in the Government's banking legislation. He might as well say that no soldier who is fighting should take any exception to what is done by the Government because his action in fighting means that he supports whatever is done. When a country is at war every true patriot is prepared to do his best, even though he may not agree with the Administration. He will not stop from resisting an enemy because he believes that in some respects the Government has acted foolishly. We are justified in pointing to the dangers of this legislation, and in assuring the people that it will be changed at the (first opportunity. I take exception to the remarks of the Treasurer because my record during the war shows conclusively that I have been prepared to assist the Government, regardless of what I have thought of some of its legislation. For nearly a year I represented the Commonwealth Government in London, and since I returned to Australia. I have continued to assist it. I suggested a stabilization scheme the greater part of which the accepted, Advisory War Council at the invitation of the Prime Minister( Mr cannot face the truth. That is contrary Curtin). The speech of the Treasurer to-night is the first that I have heard that my acceptance of these opportunities to Tender public service means that I must condone whatever action the Government takes. I am astonished that the Minister should think that safeguards which other countries have embodied, -in their banking legislation in order to protect the note issue are a sham. He would appear to be the. only man occupying a responsible position who holds that view. This afternoon I gave a list of countries which had provided the safeguards that I advocated. No one can say that there was anything in my speech but constructive attempts to improve the bill. I showed how in other countries limits had been placed on the note issue by the Parliaiment, that various safeguards had been provided and that there had been an increased discount rate on any excess note issue. The Treasurer said that 1 spoke in an irresponsible way sixteen years ago, but events have shown that what I said then was correct. This bill will affect the lives of every person in the community. Although supporters of the Government have little to say regarding the bill, they describe constructive suggestions from this side as so much sham. I remind the committee that when Mr Theodore was Treasurer he introduced a Central Reserve Bank Bill which provided for a reserve to be placed on the note issue. The record in Hansard will show that he insisted on having a reserve of gold or sterling, if only for psychological reasons. To-day the Acting Prime Minister, who is also Treasurer, says that a provision that the people should be told of any extraordinary increase of the note issue would undermine public confidence in the Commonwealth Bank. In Great Britain Parliament has provided that the volume of the note issue shall not he altered without the consent of Parliament. That is the view Gf a country which financed about twenty Allied governments during the war. In Great Britain any proposed increase of the fiduciary note issue must be laid before both Houses of Parliament forthGovernment ultimately with. The remarks of the Acting Prime and I have sat on the Minister can be interpreted only to mean that Australians are cowardly people who to our experience. Honourable members know that when the people of Australia realize that there is a real obstacle to overcome, or danger to face, they face it bravely as true Britishers; and generally they overcome it. The difficulty confronting us cannot be met by attempts to sidestep it, or by the making of adroit speeches, or by deciding to handle it silently and secretly. As I pointed out earlier, harmful germs which destroy the human body work silently and secretly. All that we on this side ask is that our well-reasoned arguments shall be given .due consideration. Government supporters seem to take no notice at all of the views expressed by honourable members on this side, but that is not the way to get the best legislation.

The Treasurer reiterated that the note issue was only an effect from other causes. That may be so to a limited degree, hut, as a matter of fact, the excess note issue was the direct cause of the inflationary conditions in Germany and other European countries after the last war when the monetary units of certain smashed. Al l the precautions, if one can so describe them, in this bill and the Banking Bill to prevent inflation will be useless without the precaution sought in the amendment moved by the Leader of the Australian Country party. As Lord D'Aibernon writes, if the fundamental error exists none of the correctives will have any effect. Though our voices may be ineffective, we are particularly concerned iu asking that the Government protect the currency against the possibility of Australia's utter ruin. We are speaking, to a larger audience than tlie Government benches. We are speaking to the people of Australia in the hope of imiplanting in their minds the will to make it clear to the Government that they will not stand for the depreciation of the value of the currency that is possible from the unrestricted note issue envisaged by this clause. I was astonished to hear the Treasurer state to-night that the currency of Australia had been depreciated by the pegging of the exchange rate at £130 to £100 sterling, at first, and, later, at £125 to £100 sterling. He spoke as if it had been a bad thing. So did the honourable member for Calare( Mr issued by the Commonwealth Government Breen). But the Treasurer spoke as if something terrible had happened. SoI refer honourable members to paragraph 551 of the report of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, to which, not eight years ago, in July, 1937, the Treasurer was a signatoryThe movement in the exchange rate in January, 1931, was one of the major contributions of monetary policy to recovery in Australia. The honourable gentleman subscribed to that and the following sentences in the report:It increased the returns to exporters in terms of Australian currency which tended to increase the volume of export productions, and it tended to restrict imports. Had the income would have been less, and the task of recovery easier. The depreciation of the Australian £1 in terms of sterling stopped the rapid appreciation of the currency and fall of prices that were causing disastrous unemployment. I am, therefore, astonished that honourable gentlemen opposite should European countries were talk about a wrong having been done to this country by raising the exchange rate. A racehorse which showed such a reversal of form as the Treasurer has shown would be the subject of an inquiry by the stewards into his form. The member of the royal commission, who, in 1937, ran a dead-heat with its other members straightly, truly and determinedly in saying that there should be a limit on the note issue seems now to have been ""got a t"" by some insidious influences in caucus, deliberate in their intention that at some time the Australian currency shall be smashed to pieces. I do not believe that the Minister assisting the Treasurer is responsible for his reversal of form. I hope that members of the Government are big enough, strong enough and brave enough to flout caucus and think only in terms of the financial security of Australia. [8.21] A good deal has been said on this cla.use about the currency, but one of the most important aspects has been overlooked. In my opinion, a note issued by the 'Commonwealth Bank is in the same category as any other paper money a debt due by the Commonwealth Government, through one of its instrumentalities, to the person or corporation for the time being in possession of it. kinds of currency. but one would not think so from the fact that the note issue is to be the only exception in which there shall be no parliamentary control over the extent to which indebtedness may be incurred by",43,Seoond Beadin G

178,Mr Archie Cameron,"I know,the Government. That is the important point. If the Executive proposes to borrow money or raise money 'by taxes, it must ask the Parliament for the right to do so; but, once this bill is law, there will be no obligation on the Government to ask Parliament for the right to increase the note issue. The position was infinitely clearer before the issue of paper currency was handed over from the Treasury to the Commonwealth Bank. The Treasury notes bore the inscriptionThe Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia promises to pay .the bearer gold coin on demand at the Commonwealth Treasury. The note was signed by the Secretary to the Treasury and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. changed? we went off the gold standard. that? dealing with a serious matter, not kindergarten things. When the issue of notes was transferred, to the Commonwealth Bank under authority conferred upon it by this Parliament, the inscription was altered and there is now no reference to redeemability in gold. All the inscription says isThis note is legal tender for Commonwealth and in all territories under the control of the Commonwealth. The position was clearer still when, before the Australian Note Act was passed, the currency bore an intrinsic value equal to the value represented thereon. Every one knows what he is handling when he handles gold, but when he gets token money-silver , bronze or paper-the position is entirely the opposite. This clause enables the Commonwealth Bank to create as much paper currency as it likes. The history of the world, not ancient but modern history, the history of the period between the two world wars, shows that wherever this authority has been issued it has ended in disaster followed by complete reconstruction of the currency of the country concerned. Any honourable member who has studied the affairs of countries like Greece, Italy, .France and Germany after the last war must realize the disaster that overtook them because there was no legislative control whatever of the limits of the note issue. Consequently, a state of affairs occurred which is best illustrated by what took place in Germany, where, after the note issue had been inflated to the stage at which it took about a barrow-load of notes to buy a loaf of bread, the political leaders and financiers of the country got together and devised the Reichsmark, which was backed by a 5 per cent, tax on land values and by the big industries on a in ratio of 50: 50. I raise this because I want the committee to realize that the basis of the stability of any currency is its backing. When we had a gold or sterling currency every one knew that there was a gold, reserve of at least 5s. was that for every £1 note issued.. It is physically impossible for every note to be presented at the Commonwealth Bank or the Treasury at the one time. So we had a was system under which the value of the paper money in circulation was much I am greater than the value of the gold reserve.

The fiduciary issue of Great Britain is definitely limited, but here the Government is asking us to give the the Commonwealth Bank untrammelled power to issue fiduciary money to an unlimited extent. I am surprised that the Treasurer, or one or two of his noble henchmen, have not come to light with a declaration that the foundation upon which the Australian note issue will rest is to be the credit of the Commonwealth. I anticipate that declaration by saying that the public credit of this country has been seriously impaired by the conduct of the war.

187,Mr Burke (Perth) [8.33],"I nIn the Macmillan report, at page 123, it is statedThere is also a further principle of central banking of a somewhat different character which must be observed if central banks are to be in complete control of the situation, namely, that central batiks must not be unduly limited in their power to expand their deposits otherwise than against a corresponding increase in their holdings of gold or the equivalent of gold. Such undue limitation may result if the class of assets which the central bank is entitled to hold is too narrowly prescribed by law. Similarly, it should lie within the power of a central bank to restrict the volume of its deposits otherwise than by decreasing its holdings of gold. Everything indicates that a reserve hehind the note issue is powerless to achieve the end which it is supposed to promote. In order to expand the note issue without raising prices, the issuing authority must watch the situation very closely. It must note how production is affected, and keep constantly in mind the relation between the volume of the note issue and the production of: consumable goods. Even if the Australian note issue had been based £1 for £1 on gold it would still have been necessary, during the war, to increase its value very greatly, and prices would have risen because there was not in the country a sufficient volume of goods to match the increased issue. Thus, we come to the point that a reserve behind the note issue is merely a survival, a tradition, which experience has proved to be of no real value. The honourable member for New England( Mr in the mind of the public are historically Abbott) said that currency inflation in Germany after the last war had been brought about by an increase of the note issue. It has been established, however, that bank deposits expanded first, and the note issue was increased in order to catch up with them. It has not been proved that the movement was begun by 1 an expansion of the note issue. Actually, although the note issue expanded, the value of! the currency in terms of gold dropped by far more than the expansion of the note issue. We have been told that a note reserve has both a practical and. a psychological value. A great point was made of this when the 'Scullin Government was in office, but when the gold reserve was finally exported there was no psychological reaction whatsoever. was found that the people were not in the least worried whether or not there was a gold reserve behind the currency. Mr Burke. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) suggested that a reserve had a practical value, but I fail to see wherein it lies. A reserve of gold earns no interest. It is valueless to the country. It would be better employed in the purchase of foreign securities, because they would, at least, bear interest. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) said that even though it might not be necessary to hold a reserve in Australia against the notes in circulation, it would be advisable to hold British or foreign securities. That is probably true, but at the same time it would be foolish to hold a rigid amount against the note issue. If we were able to provide foreign currency for the purchase of capital goods, it would seem paradoxical to have a large reserve of foreign securities, sterling or otherwise, tied up in such a way as to prevent us from using them for our immediate needs. A reserve of gold, as a backing for the note issue, has been proved by history to be valueless and a definite loss to the country. A reserve of securities, if tied rigidly to the note issue, would also be a disadvantage and would have to be suspended in the same way as the gold reserve has had to be suspended from time to time. The Government is dealing with the problem in a realistic manner. The fears which members of the Opposition have attempted to instil baseless and will not affect the value of Australian currency. Leader of the Australian Country party) [8.48] I understood the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) to say that the gold and sterling reserve was in a precarious position in 1939. Mr 0HII*XEY -No, I said that the reserves amounted to £33,000,000. the total value of notes in circulation at the 30th June, 1939, was £47,530,124.

There are two points upon which Statutory Rules 1945 No. SO can be attacked"". First, is it a valid exercise of the defence power under the Constitution? Secondly, as 1 have stated in the press, sub-regulation 2 places upon the Commonwealth Bank an obligation to give notes of small denomination in exchange for the larger notes, at any time, even after the 31st August. There is no compulsion upon the holder to give his name and address, and he need, not necessarily exchange his notes of a high denomination at any particular time. Also the exchange of such notes between individuals will not be curtailed as the bank will not be able to ascertain whether or not they are being cashed by the original holders. honourable member is not permitted to read his speech. notes. The subject is of such a technical nature that in my opinion the use of full notes should be permitted. It is not my intention to move for the disallowance of regulation 135, as under section 10A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1904-1934, .after the disallowance of a regulation, no regulation which is the same in substance can be made for six months. It would be far more preferable for the Government to repeal this regulation and submit a more carefully prepared one carrying out the Government's real intention. If it is the intention of the Government to force holders of bank notes . of high denominations to relinquish them, that object is not being achieved, and the matter is one which should, be carefully considered. for Home Security and Minister for Works) [9.7] -The Grown Law authorities are examining the question that has been raised by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden), and the Government will take whatever action may be necessary.' the Opposition) [9.8] I am glad to note that the Crown Law authorities propose to examine the matter which has been raised by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden). It is quite true that section 18 of the National Security Act gives effect to National Security Regulations notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any enactment other than the National Security Act; but it would bo a most unusual principle if an act of Parliament passed this year were to fetter the hands of the Parliament a year or perhaps two years hence. The normal rule of course is that where there is a provision in an act of Parliament inconsistent with a provision in an earlier measure, the earlier one is repealed to that extent. No doubt the Crown Law authorities will' come to the conclusion that if the Government wants the effect of National Security (Supplementary) Regulation 135 to be maintained this clause should be altered. The The alteration would be quite simple. I suggest to the Minister( Mr Lazzarini) and through him to the legal authorities, that all that need be done is to add at the beginning of clause 42 the words, ""Subject to any regulation made under the National Security Act"". Then, if it is desired to preserve any exclusion under the National Security -Regulations, that can be done. I cannot support the argument advanced by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies). It goes further than he intended. The Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) pointed out that the regulation was intended to deal with a certain condition of affairs in which people held notes of high denominations, and provides that those notes shall be returned to the Commonwealth Bank before the 31st August, after which date they will not be legal tender. It is possible that the Government may desire to make a regulation going far beyond that. The amendment should state definitely at what regulation it is aiming.

Actually, the government of the day had to borrow for the exigencies of the Napoleonic wars much more than could be redeemed by means of the sinking fund, but the existence of that first sinking fund that had been introduced by any government in the world enabled loans to be raised at a much lower rate of interest than otherwise would have operated.

Whatever argument could be advanced in favour of it when made, has been greatly reinforced since, because the royal commission recommended among other things the continuance of a backing for the note issue up to a specified limit. Under this legislation, there is to be no such limit; consequently, the recommendation of the commission in that regard has been totally ignored. Surely some degree of confidence must be instilled in the minds of the investing public particularly.

Rural mortgages in Australia must amount to approximately between £400,000,000 and £500,000,000. £150,000 per annum obtained from the profits from the note issue is only about one-fifteenth or oneTsixteenth of the total profit made from the note issue, which exceeds £2,000,000. That contribution should be made permanent, in order that the interest-free money available in the Mortgage Bank Department may be as large as possible, and ultimately have the effect of reducing the rate ofi interest on long-term mortgages. instituted the Rural Credits Department in 1925, I attached a similar stipulation to the provision in relation to its capital, until £2,000,000 interest-free capital had been provided. The effect has been that that department has been able to charge a lower rate of interest than any other institution in Australia that lends money. It deals with commodities in process of being marketed; therefore, the loans that it makes are redeemed practically within a year and a smaller total may suffice for a revolving captial fund. On the other hand many of the loans made by the Mortgage Bank Department are outstanding for from 30 to 40 years: therefore, it must have very large capital funds at its disposal.

The committee has already decided not to require a minute to be drawn up on the matter, wbich means that nothing about it will appear in writing. The central bank, which for many years has acted in the interests of economic and financial stability, may well become a mere tool of the government of the day. Amendments by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) with regard to the note issue have been rejected, and, therefore, one of the last barriers which prevented the exercise of political pressure behind the scenes has been removed. Under this clause, the note issue could to some degree be concealed, because it merely provides that the number and amount of notes at issue shall be made public, but there is a wide difference between the amount of notes held by the public and the amount issued, [n his second-reading speech, the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) drew attention to the fact that the note issue is merely a "" reflection of credit policy "", and in his speech before the suspension of the sitting he used these words, "" The note issue is an effect of something else that has been done "". It is true that the potential source of inflationary finance is central bank iiiflation, but that cannot take place unless it is reflected in the note issue, particuLazzarini) will not merely ask the larly the note issue in the hands of the public. From the days preceding the war until recently, the note issue, which was once £4S,000,000, has been increased to £196,000,000. That, of course, is an indication of the inflationary tactics which in many respects had to be adopted because of the exigencies of war. We were told in January last that the central bank inflation amounted to about £340,000,000; to-day it is possibly about £400,000,000. This credit expansion has been associated with the many controls which have been imposed on the public, and if those controls had not been screwed down we should have witnessed a much greater depreciation of the Australian £1 than has The Governor, in turn, will be occurred. A t present, the value of the £1 has depreciated by about 25 per cent. This has to be considered in conjunction with the present high taxation rates which are having a marked effect on the present production and output of the individual. The note issue is a reflection of credit policy and shows the effect of what has been done. Under this clause the indications are that the real extent of any inflationary policy could be concealed by the mere issue of a statement giving the amountof notes on issue, but the number of notes in tbe vaults of the banks may have little bearing on the e'eonomic position. The notes in the hands of the public are those which count, because they imply purchasing power. From 15' per cent, to 20 per cent, of all payments are made by means of notes. As the note issue is split into notes in the hands of the public and notes in the hands of the banks, it gives an indication to the public of the financial policy being carried out by tbe Government. Under this bill it would be possible, by a verbal arrangement, for the economic policy of the country to be influenced by the Government, and that could lead to further inflation; but if the amount of notes in the hands of the public were made known we should have an accurate picture of what is happening. That picture should always be apparent to the Parliament and to the country.

Unless the amendment of the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson) is accepted, the Government will not be under any obligation to make such information available. Evidently, the Government wishes to obtain full control over the currency, and does not want to tell the public what it is doing. Leader of the Australian Country party) [9.49],I cannot understand why the Government will not accept the amendment, unless its purpose is to keep the public in ignorance of what is happening to the note issue. Up to the present, statistics have been published regularly showing the proportion of notes held by the public and by the banks, and these figures have been included in the Budget each year in the form of an annexure. This has always been regarded by the Commonwealth Bank Board as a financial barometer. Now that the safeguard of a reserve behind the note issue is to be removed, the Government does not propose to let the public know the position of the note issue. The Government should have nothing to hide, and there is no reason why it, should not accept the amendment, but trying to got the Government to accept an amendment is like trying to push an elephant up hill. However, we shall go on trying to defend the interests of the public. The argument of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Burke) falls to the ground because the whole structure of the Commonwealth Bank Act 1911-43 is being altered by this legislation, as is shown by the fact that many parts of that measure shall continue to be published ? Now that are being re-enacted.

If he cannot do so, only one interNow that there is to be no reserve behind pretation can be placed on his action. He the note issue, and no limit above which it shall not go, it is more than ever necessary that the public should be informed from time to time just what is going on. For many years past, these periodical analyses of the position of the note issue have been a feature of budget statements, and they show how and in what way the note issue has expanded since 1989. In that year, the public held notes to the value of £34,000,000, while the banks held notes to the value of £14,600,000. In 1944, the figures were £170,000,000 in the hands of the public, and £16,100,000 in the hands of the banks respectively. In practice, a large part of the holdings of the banks was in £1,000 notes. These did not circulate, and therefore did not represent part of the spending power of the community, nor did they affect the speed of currency circulation. By January, 1945, the value of notes held by the banks had increased from only £14,600,000 to £17,700,000, but the value of notes held by the public had increased from £34,000,000 ,to £179,000,000. It is important that information of this kind should bo available to the public, and its publication should not depend on the goodwill of the Treasurer of the day. The refusal of the Government to accept this amendment makes one wonder what is the value of committee work in the Parliament. The purpose of the amendment is to provide for doing something which the Minister( Mr Lazzarini) agrees ought to be done, yet for some reason not explained he refuses to accept the amendment. He says that these particulars about the note issue are already being published.

235,Mr Hutchinson (Deakin) [10.0].,"has told us that since 1921 it has been the practice of the Commonwealth Bank to publish the figures in the way that I have indicated they should be published, in that year, the Commonwealth Bank was under the control of a governora system of one-man control, to which the Government proposes to revert. Since 1924 the bank has been under the control of a board, but under both forms of control the central banking functions have at all times been paramount. Under this bill, the control of the Commonwealth Bank is to be completely altered; the Governor will be told to go out after the business of the trading banks. In another measure which is to come before us there are provisions which, with those in this bill, will sound the death-knell of the Rankin, G. J. private banks. Obviously, the Government wishes to conceal its intentions, but [ have no-doubt that its policy will be one of increased inflation. So long as the published figures distinguish between notes held by the public and notes held by the banks, there will be an indication of the financial policy that is being followed. If the Government intends to follow the custom which has been in operation for many years it should embody a provision to that effect in the bill. If it does not do so, we must form our own conclusion as to its reasons. Question putThat the words proposed to be added ( Mr will be known of the volume of the note3 The committee divided.

249,Sir Earle Page (Ccv.per) [10.19].,"rural credits, but alterations bave been made in others. The Minister( Mr because such a provision deprives the Lazzarini) should explain why these alterations have been made because, whatever can be said about other departments of the Commonwealth Bank, the Rural Credits Department has been one of the most successful in Australia. J understand that up to the outbreak of the war no less than £125,000,000 had been advanced by the Rural Credits Department, and that since the outbreak of war a total of more than £^00,000,000 has been advanced by the bank against primary production. Therefore, there must be some reason for those alterations, but none has yet been given. The Treasurer ( Mr Chifley), in his second reading speech did not give any reason for these alterations. I point out that at present, under the Commonwealth Bank (Rural Credits) Act the department may make advances to "" other banks "", whereas under this measure "" other banks"" are omitted from the bodies to whom the department may make advances. One complaint against the department has been that it has not used as fully as it might its opportunities to handle these particular advances by issuing short-term debentures, because these advances, which are made against primary produce in the course of being sold, aro the safest that can possibly be made. For instance, wheat is sold against delivery in London. A farmer wants to be paid immediately he delivers his wheat and under the existing arrangement he can obtain an advance and thereby obviate waiting until actual payment is made by the purchaser of his produce. That payment is collected by the bank. Under this measure, the department will not be able to effect such transactions through other banks as it is able to do at present. I can see no reason for this limitation, parto pay for his crop, and. organizaticularly when clause 66 provides that the department may make advances to "" such bodies, whether corporate or unincorporate, formed under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State or territory of the Commonwealth as are specified by proclamation"". As most trading banks are corporate bodies under State laws they could be brought within this provision by proclamation. Therefore, I fail to understand why they should be fir liarlc J'nge. eliminated under the measure itself primary producer of the advantage of being able to obtain finance at the very low rate of interest provided. No explanation has been given why the words "" other banks "" have been deleted. My second point is that the provision in the original rural credits legislation for the issue, if necessary, of debentures or trading bills bas been eliminated. That provision enabled advances totalling from £16,000,000 to £20,000,000 to be made at a very cheap rate of interest. ""When I discussed this matter with some of the members of the Commonwealth Bank Board, I discovered that it was only recently that they had come to realize the extraordinary value of this provision in helping to provide an Australian market. For instance, our wheat crop in any one year may be valued at from £25,000,000 to £30,000,000 The crop is harvested in from two to three months. The farmer desires to be paid as soon as he has harvested his crop because he has been waiting a long time for his money while tbe crop is growing. However, the crop may not be disposed of throughout the markets of the world until twelve months later. .In these circumstances, some system of finance must be provided to enable the farmer to be paid as soon as he has harvested his crop. That is one aspect of the matter. On the other hand, organizations such as the Sydney City Council or the Melbourne City Council collect the whole of their rates practically within one month, but spread the expenditure of that revenue over a period of twelve months. We should utilize an institution like the Commonwealth Bank to provide a link between the producer who requires ready finance, tions such as I have mentioned, who have surplus funds to invest. Such a system. would promote orderly marketing of primary produce and, at the same time, enable such organizations to invest surplus funds. This facility is to be eliminated under the measure, and it is not being deleted because it has proved useless. I believe that it is being deleted simply because the original provision used the word ""debenture"". I recall a debate in this Parliament about three or four years ago when, to the amazement of members of the Labour party they discovered that the original authors of the Commonwealth Bank Bill used the word "" debenture"" in the original act. To-day, however, members of the Labour party are frightened of that word and through sheer fear have eliminated it in. the way I have indicated. I was also hoping that the Eural Credits Development Fund, derived from the profits of the department, would be applied not merely by the Rural Credits Department, but that that body would be empowered to call into consultation the Department of Commerce and Agriculture in order that the fund, which amounts to from £30,000 to £40,000 a year, might be used to the greatest advantage to stimulate research in urgent matters of concern to primary industry, the need for which is pronounced at present. Clause agreed to. Clause 63 agreed to. Clause 64 (Loans by Treasurer). I assume that the rate of interest which will be charged by the Rural Credits Department will be approximately the same as it is to-day, namely, 3$ per cent. I do not know whether honourable memibers realize that the rate of interest is extremely high for first class self-liquidating securities such as primary products that are moving towards their ultimate markets of consumption. The trading banks, which have been maligned in this chamber during this discussion as grasping organizations that always seize everything they can for their own selfish interests and let their customers down, charge for this kind of advance a rate of interest of 1 per cent, or less per annum for 90 days' accommodation on shipments of goods overseas. ""Within 48 hour3 of wool being put into the ships' holds at Newcastle or Sydney, before the war, bills of lading were discounted by/the trading banks, and an advance paid into the customers account at a rate of interest, on Bank of England discount rates, of 1 per cent, or less per annum for 90 clays' accommodation. [Ml This clause will impose a high rate of interest on that class of accommodation. clause does not mention interest rates. The Treasurer may, from time to time, out of moneys legally available, lend to the Bank, for the purpose of the Rural Credits Department, such amounts, and subject to such terms and conditions as are agreed upon between the Treasurer and the Bank, but the total of the sums so lent and not repaid shall not at any time exceed Three millioa pounds. If the Treasurer borrows money on long terms from the Commonwealth Bank at high rates of. interest he will not be able to lend it at the shortterm rates that the Bank of England does on the rediscount rate. The Commonwealth Bank might well consider, in connection with the Rural Credits Department, establishing a bill market on the lines of the bill market operated by the Bank of England for the handling and financing of primary products in Australia onfirst-classpaper. The Commonwealth Bank should be prepared to discount that first-class paper at the same rate as the Bank of England will discount it overseas. Private enterprise is not popular with the Government, but when it shows the way in which, to assist primary producers with extremely low rates of interest, the Government should not be so pig-headed as to refuse to follow its example. I have been very interested in the Rural Credits Department of the Commonwealth Bank, and in my second reading speech I eulogized its work, in assisting primary producers and cooperative organizations. Since the establishment of the department, primary producers, through organized industries, have been able to obtain, to my knowledge, the lowest rate of interest operating in Australia. I was interested to hear the contention of the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) in reference to accommodation from another source for 90 days, at the rate of 1 per cent, per annum, but that term would not be sufficient. Under the Rural Credits Department, as we shall see in another clause, advances are made for one year only. However, an interest rate of 3±",58,Chairman Mn W J F To My Mind This Is To Cover The Actual

253,Mr Adermann (Maranoa) [10.35].,"per cant, is still somewhat high. After all, the primary producers have to wait for payment for their crops during the period of growth, and until realization. Sometimes twelve months elapse before the final payments are made. Payments up to a maximum of 80 per cent, of the value of the produce are made as a first advance, and from, that amount is deducted the estimated expenses of the crop. Therefore, in effect, the growers at first receive about 50 per cent, of the net return 'from their crops, and. on the balance they have to pay interest from their own income. I suggest to the Government, in all seriousness, that the interest rate, when fixed by tbe Commonwealth Bank, should be only a nominal amount and not necessarily one that would make large profits. Clause agreed to. Clause 65 (Advances to Department by Bank). [10.37] -This clause is another example of the kind of matter about which members of the Opposition have complained in their second-reading speeches and in committee. The Government has stated repeatedly that various clauses of the bill have been taken from the existing act, and has suggested that the committee should accept them without criticism or amendment. This clause, which has been taken from the existing act, readsThe bank may make advances to the Rural CreditsDepartment of such amounts, and subject to such terms and conditions, as the vided for by the Industrial Finance DeGovernor determines. I detect a vital difference between the clause in this bill and the comparable section of the act. Under the existing act, control by the Commonwealth Bank Board, an independent body, guarantees that political interference shall not be exercised in connection with the Rural Credits Department. But when this clause becomes operative, the Governor of the bank will be under the direction of the Treasurer of the day, and the guarantee against the exercise of political interference will not operate. This provision re-opens the whole subject of political interference. On the surface the clause may be all that it purports to be, but the fact remains that, as long as the Rural Credits Department is likely to be subject to political interference, some safeguard should be inserted in the bill for the purpose of removing that danger. I also direct attention to the words "" such amounts, and subject to such terms and conditions, as the Governor determines "". I ask: "" What amounts, and how much? "" The amount that'may be determined by a particular Treasurer for the necessary development of rural industries, may well interfere with the central banking fund, and destroy one of its functions. Tbe central banking fund will be held for the purpose of meeting a possible crisis in the banking system, and if such amounts that may be determined are not specified, the central banking funds may be seriously interfered with. This clause has possibilities entirely different from those of the section of the existing act. Independent control of banking has 'been removed by vesting full powers in the Treasurer (Wentworth) of the day, through the Governor of the bank, and a safeguard should be included in the bill against political interference. Clause agreed to. Clause 66 (Advances by Department). -This clause is self-explanatory, but I should like some information in regard to the financial accommodation that is to be made available to organizations such as co-operative marketing boards which desire to enter the realm of manufacture. Probably these organizations will be propartment, but I should like to know where ,the line of demarcation is to be drawn. Some marketing boards which to-day are engaged solely in marketing activities may wish to engage in secondary production. Butter factories, of course, may be regarded as being in that category now, and they are provided for under the rural credit portion of this legislation. Expansion of the activities of co-operative marketing boards may be most desirable, and provision should be made for financial accommodation. ter for Home Security and Minister for Works) [10.42] -Speaking off-hand, I should say that the organizations to which the honourable member refers are",60,Chairman Mn W J F To My Mind This Is To Cover The Actual

I have seen crystals of it as big as my first. Feldspar is being mined in certain places, and out of it false teeth are made. Does the term ""metals"" include feldspar?

Is beryllium included? The Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) has heard a good deal from me in the last twelve months about mica, and wrote to me to-day concerning it. I do not think that it can be classed as a metal. being an encyclopaedia, I cannot say. I know that in many cases it is transparent, is fairly precious. I saw some in a government depot in Melbourne which I inspected recently, priced at no less than £15 per lb., which is practically £1 per oz. It must be considered fairly precious. But I do not know whether it is me. In some States, there is a gem industry. Do gems come under the classification of ""metals""?

The earlier impression was that the attempt was being made to expand it too widely. The Parliamentary Draftsman, and the bank authorities are confident that the definition of "" primary produce"" in clause 5 covers not only the primary produce mentioned in the second schedule but also such other primary produce as is prescribed. I understand that from time to time in the history of the bank goods associated with the production of primary produce have been prescribed. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) is always propounding conundrums for the Government to answer. I should imagine that the metals mentioned by him are covered. In regard to the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) it is possible that the Government had in mind that these facilities should not be utilized by other banks.

Clause agreed to. Progress reported. That the House do now adjourn. for Home Security and Minister for Works) [11.1] -On the 27th April the honourable member for Barker( Mr chosen representative of the proletariat, Archie Cameron) stated in the House that my department was attempting to turn a widower and his three children out of their home at Alice Springs. That is not correct. The children of the officer concerned are not at Alice Springs and are not living with their father. They returned to Adelaide approximately last November with the officer's mother. After the departure of the children, the officer took another officer to share the house, and they have continued to occupy it. The housing shortage at Alice Springs is very acute, and it is not considered desirable that a house should be occupied by men who have not their families living with them, particularly when there are other families waiting accommodation. As this officer bas sent his children to Adelaide, where they are living with his mother, it is rightly considered by my department that he should live at the men's hostel at Alice Springs, and allow his house to be occupied by another man who has n wife and family. [11.2] I am pleased to hear the remarks of the Minister for Works( Mr Lazzarini). This man's wife died a couple of years ago, and as he was unable to get anybody at Alice Springs to look after his children he was forced to send them to Adelaide. I have a copy of a letter which he addressed to me on the 22nd May, in which he said that he had arranged to be married on the 9th June. This fact is known to the authorities at Alice Springs. He desired them to bring his children back on his second marriage, but, notwithstanding that fact, and my protest in the House, he has been turned out of his home. house. should like the Minister to reconsider the matter, in view of a letter received from the Department of Works at Alice Springs. I advised this man by telegram to remain in the house. I eould mention other cases in which men. have been informed that they must vacate their premises in order to make way for senior men. This Government claims to be the but its policy seems to favour the "" tall poppies"". In a letter signed "" W . H . Coop, for the Director-General of Works, Department of Works"", the following appears:I refer to your request of this morning that you should receive some written indication that it is not proposed to proceed with the notice given to you on .the 18th April last, which required you to vacate by the 18th May the governmental cottage at present occupied by you. It would appear that you misunderstood the correct position. The notice already served on you stands and it is still the desire of the Deputy Director General that the cottage be vacated. However, as you or some one on your behalf has seen fit to place the facts before the Minister for Works, it is my duty to inform you that until receipt of instructions from the Minister, no further action will be taken by the Deputy Director-General in connection with the tenancy of the cottage.

If there is one place in the Territory which has buildings to burn it is Alice Springs. been there and have seen them. I know of certain other orders that were cancelled. Protests were made against people having to vacate their houses in order to make way for senior officers. When through the loss of his wife, a man has been forced to send his children away, but is now prepared to bring them back, the least that should be done is to enable him to retain possession of his home. If this man does uot get. the deal to which I think he is entitled I shall have occasion to refer to it again. Something should be done to recognize the services of tbe forgotten men of this war, the members of the Volunteer Defence Corps. During the dark and early days of the war, the Volunteer Defence Corps was our first line of defence. It was composed mostly of men of middle ago and young men who were unfit for strenuous military service. The members of the corps prepared for action round the coastline of Australia, and did very good work without much publicity. They were mostly employed in essential industries, or in jobs of an important nature. Their training involved leaving their jobs on Friday evenings and spending their week-ends relieving garrihimself that they were of Army issue. He sons on the coast, and returning to their normal duties on Monday mornings. The people were consoled by their presence during the early period of the Japanese thrust southwards, but as the war effort increased in volume, the importance of the Volunteer Defence Corps diminished. Yet the people owe their home guard the same measure of appreciation as the Government of Great Britain has decided to give to the home guard in the Old Country. A service ribbon should be awarded to the Volunteer Defence Corps for its efforts in the war. Here is an opportunity for this Parliament to reassert its Australianism, and do something for the men who were prepared to defend the mainland of Australia. J suggest that a Southern Cross star could be provided in recognition of services rendered on the mainland. A wards in the past have been conditioned by British awards, but surely it would be competent for the Commonwealth Government to provide an award for those who defended the mainland, and who were prepared to undertake the last ditch fighting if the war actually came to this country. Veterans of the last war, and others who were not called up, formed the Volunteer Defence Corps whose training was comparable with some of the toughest jungle training that is given to Australian troops to-day. Members of the corps were submitted to a gruelling test, because it was not known in those days whether they would not have to face the enemy on our own shores. To adapt the phrase of Mr Churchill, they might have had to face the enemy on the beaches and in the streets of Australia. Now we have forgotten these men. It would be a gracious thing for the Commonwealth to provide some specific decoration to commemorate their services. I commend the suggestion to the Minister for consideration in the right quarter -The Minister for Munitions ( Mr Makin), when replying to a question this morning, flagrantly misrepresented what I had said on Friday afternoon last. This is what I said, as recorded in HansardAlthough the Minister stated that such weapons iu the hands of the police in Sydney had been examined, he had not yet satisfied mentioned only four weapons. In the press to-day, there is a report by a high police officer that tliere are 24 sub-machine guns in the hands of the police. I do not know the types of these weapons, but it ie evident that they are from Army sources, munitions factories, or some other government source. I repeat that these weapons must be coming from the Army authorities, munitions factories, or from some other government source. They are not privately manufactured weapons so far as we know. They have been manufactured for the Army. Every weapon so produced bears a serial number, and it should not be a difficult task to trace the channels through which the weapons now in the hands of the police have passed. The Minister for Munitions completely avoided my point that it was possible to trace these weapons by the serial numbers.

The Minister made a scurrilous attack on nie based on a lie. It is possible to find out where the weapons were obtained. Some of them, I presume, were used for illegal purposes against citizens. If they are of Australian manuEacture it can be discovered where they came from. There is a serial number on each machine gun, sub-machine gun, rifle and pistol by which it is possible to trace where the weapon came from, and even the very man to whom it was issued. By co-operation between the Department of the Army, the Department of Munitions and the police it should be possible to curb this growing danger.
