Chair would be replica of that in our House of Commons. Telegraph whether this presentation would be acceptable. J. H. WHITLEY, Speaker, House of CommoiiB. Joint President, United Kingdom Branch, Empire Parliamentary Association. Because of the all-night sittings immediately preceding the adjournment, which honourable members have probably net yet forgotten, and for other reasons, I was unable to announce the receipt of the cablegram immediately it was received; but during the adjournment I sent the following reply to the Speaker of the House of Commons:Have much pleasure in accepting, on behalf of the House of Representatives, Speaker's chair, so gracefully and generously offered for House, Canberra, hy United Kingdom Branch of Empire Parliamentary Association. Besolution pf House will be proposed when House re-assembles in about three weeks. W. A. WATT, Speaker. 21st July, 1025. I understand thut the Right Honourable the Prime Minister will submit ft motion of acceptance of this welcome g if t , and I content myself, therefore, with saying, as the presiding officer of the House, how keenly I am sure honourable members appreciate this characteristic act of cordiality and friendship by the members of the parent branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association. trust we all hope, that this giftwill adorn our Housef o r many a generation, and that it will always be regarded as a visible link between the imperial mother of parliaments and the daughter institution in Australia. ter and Ministerf o r External Affairs) 1}. August, 1925. |*11.3] -Every honourable member w ill cordially endorse your action, Mr. Speaker, in replying, on behalf of the House, to the cablegram sent by the President of the United Kingdom Branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association, which conveyed this most generous and -welcome offer to the Parliament of Australia. We are all desirous of haying, at Canberra, a replica of the Speaker's chair in the House of Commons, because all our parliamentary institutions are based upon those of the mother if parliaments, and because we are all anxious to maintain those constitutional principles which have for so long guided ihe land from which we have come. Th's is but another example of the beneficial work which is being done by the Emj/ire Parliamentary Association in promoting the interchange of visits between members of the various parliaments of the Empire, an instance of which was the recent visit paid to South Africa. I understand that it is the intention of the Australian Branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association to invite every other branch of the association to send representatives to Australia next year. We may, therefore, hope that if this visit is brought about it will provide an appropriate occasion for the presentation of this chair to the Parliament of Australia. The motion, which I now submit, will, I am sure, commend itself to every bonorable member. I move That the offer of the United Kingdom Branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association, to present to the Commonwealth Parliament, a Spenker's chair for use in the Parliament House, at Canberra, bp most cordially accepted, and that Mr Speaker be requested to convey to the Speaker of the House of Commons. Joint President of the United Kingdom Branch, the sincere thanks of the House for such a valued gift, and its warm appreciation of this expression of good will towards oar Commonwealth from the members of the Home Parliament. I hope, as T have great pleasure in seconding the motion. We all greatly appreciate the generous offer that has been made by the United Kingdom Branch of thu Empire Parliamentary Association.

I have been associated with it since its in ception, and recently, when I visiied London, although many members of the United Kingdom Branch were absent in South Africa at the time, the secretary immediately got in touch with me, and made my stay in the Motherland as pleasant as possible. We ought to do everything we can to foster such a valuable institution, and I think that all honourable members should become nssociated with it . I join with the Prime Ministeri n hoping that, as a result of the invitation extended to other branches of the association to visit Australia, we shall, in the near future, have another opportunity to thank the United Kingdom Branch more f u l l y than we can at the present moment.

It concerns the privileges of honourable members and others associated with this House, and has reference to the control of the steps in f r o n t of this House when any taking place. On some occasions, during processions, the naval or military authorities take over the control of these steps, and honourable members of this House, as well as officers of the House, huve been subjected to gross insults from them. I protest against either the naval or the military people being given control of Parliament House steps, and T should like you, Mr Speaker, to say why the steps are from time to time handed over to them, and why the President of the Senate and you, sir, who are the custodians of the privileges of honourable members in this regard, should allow it? -Honorabl e members are, no doubt, aware that the Joint House Committee controls this building as a whole. When requests are made for the use of the steps in f r o n t of Parliament Houso on important public occasions they are referred to the committee, if it is possible to get a meeting, and, if not, to the President of the Senate, who is its chairman. The President usually confers with the Speaker, who is the vice-chairman of the committee. In connection with the march of the American sailors through the streets of Melbourne, the Government asked the President of the Senate, through its Eeception Committee, for the use of the steps, and the request was granted in the ordinary way. I doubt if such a request from the Government has ever been refused. However, in view of what has recently happened, a»d more particularly because of the statement that honourable members have been subjected to insults, I shall take an earlv opportunity of conferring with the President of the Senate, and probably with the Joint House Committee, to prevent a recurrence of complaints in the future.

MAXWELLANDTHE I desire to make a personal explanation. During the debate on the Immigration B ill , the honourable member for Ballarat report in Hansard, at page 1120The honorahle inember for Fawkner was chairman of a wages board, which, on his casting vote, decided that 14s. per week was suiiicient to maintain a woman and her little children.

I shall place before the House a short statement of the facts connected with that wages board. In 1897 the wages board system was in troduced in ""Victoria, and I had the honour of being invited by its members to preside over the board appointed to deal with the whitework trade. One of the duties of the board was to f i x a minimum wage to be paid to workers over eighteen years of age. A t that time the trade was very disorganized and irregular, women entering it at various ages for various reasons. tracted discussion as to what would be a fair minimum wage for girls of eighteen years of age and upwards, the board came to a deadlock, the employers expressing their willingness to vote for 13s. a week, and the representatives of the employees contending for 16s. a week. As chairman of the board, I said that I was not in a position to give a casting vote without making further investigations, and, with a view to informing myself of the existing conditions in the £902,791 trade, I carefully investigated the books .. 927,198 of various reputable firms in Melbourne, .. 932,103 .. 1,010,906 and consulted with the then ChiefI n spector of Factories ( Mr Harrison Ord). I found that the then ruling minimum wage for girls of eighteen years of age was 7s. 6d. a week. A gir l might possibly have entered the trade a week before attaining the age of eighteen years, and, having no experience, she had to start at the beginning, and learn the trade. That accounted for the low minimum wage then obtaining. I told the board that I could not be a party to raising the minimum wage-not the living wage-fro m 7s. 6d. to 16s. per week at one bound, but that if the employers' representatives would agree to a minimum of 14s. per week I would give my casting vote in favour of that wage. That was done, and 14s. per week was, by my casting vote, fixed as the minimum wage to be paid to any girl over eighteen years of age, however inexperienced. Subsequently, the board came to Subsequently, the honourable another deadlock in regard to the piecework rates, and was dissolved. A new board was appointed, and applied itself to the same task as its predecessor had faced.

Whereas by my casting vote the wage had been fixed at 14s. a week for girls over eighteen years of age, the new board unanimously specified a minimum wage of 16s. a week for any woman over twenty years of age. I find on inquiry of the Federal Statistician that 14s. per week at that time was equivalent to 28s. I d . to-day. That means that if the board of which I was chairman were to-day assessing the miniA f t e r a promum wage to be paid to an inexperienced girl of eighteen y\ears of age, employed in the whitework trade, it",14,Winter Sessions

Girls under the age of 21 years have to serve four years before they can claim the minimum wage. They have to learn their trade. The wage for the first year is 10s. rjer week, for the second year 15s., for the third year 22s., and for the fourth year ,30s. per week. Those are tlie wages ruling to-day. My action 28 years ago, when we were pioneering in this matter, was called in question, and I leave it to every unprejudiced mind in the House to say whether my determination on the facts before me was, as the honourable member for Ballarat said, a. decision that 14s. a week was sufficient for the maintenance of a woman and her little children. The honourable members for Ballarat and Hindmarsh, in their attempt to vilify me. have been guilty of the grossest and most wanton misrepresentation.

Downs-Attorney-General) lay upon the table of the House the report of the Australian delegation to the F if t h Assembly of the League of Nations, and I propose to conclude my remarks by moving that tbe paper be printed. I desire, in the first place, to express my appreciation, not only of the privilege enjoyed by me in representing my country at the F if t h Assembly of, the League of Nations, but also of the hearty cooperation of the delegates and substitute to represent Australia at that Assembly. I assure honourable members that the task placed upon us was no light one, and that the delegates' and substitute delegates found the whole of their time closely occupied with the consideration of the many problems that came before them during, the sittings of the Assembly. I shall commence my remarks by dealing with the matter whose importance, to some extent, overshadowed other work: I refer to the Protocol for the pacific settlement of international disputes. Hadi t not been for the Protocol, the other work which was accomplished by the F if t h Assembly during its sittings would have been sufficient to attract considerable public attention. The most pressing question at the Assembly was undoubtedly that of the l i m i tation of armaments. The subject is not new, but from the very inception it has been regarded as one of the most important of the League's problems. The Treaty of Versailles contains the following article dealing with the position of Germany: In order to render possible the initiation of a general limitation of the armaments of all nations, Germany undertakes strictly to observe the military, naval, and air clauses which follow. Article8 of the Covenant of the League of Nations declares thatThe members of the League recognize that the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to thc lowest point consistent with national safety, and the enforcement by common action of international obligations. The article requires the Council, taking account of the geographical circumstances of each state, to formulate plans for such reduction for the consideration and action of their several governments. As soon as the League of Nations was organized, obligation to' reduce armaments. Before [11.33] I the meeting of the First Assembly of the Leaguei n November, 1920, the Council constituted the permanent commission under the obligation contained in article 9 of the Covenant. The Financial Conference, which was summoned by the Council just prior to the meeting of the First Assembly, met at Brussels, and recommended that the Council should confer at once with the various governmentsWith a view to securing a general reduction delegates who were appointed of the crushing burdens, which on their existing scale armaments still impose on the impoverished peoples of the world, sapping their resources and imperilling their recovery from the ravages of war. The First Assembly instructed a temporary mixed commission, consisting not only of the technical, naval, military, and air experts, but also of representatives of employers and employees, financial experts, aud men of political experience, to prepare reports and proposals for the reduction of armaments, as provided in article 8 of the Covenant. In 1921 the matter came",15,Whitework Trade Personal Explanation

No other indication committees which they should work. to accept the position of I felt that the request was an honor t to Australia, sponsibility of that office. I ask honourable members to consider the problems with which the committees were faced, ancl would remind them that, although the Protocol has not been accepted, problems are still facing the world and demanding a solution. For that reason I feel that any person who can make suggestions of a constructive character will render a service to the whole world. The heavy burden of armaments was recognized by the representatives present, ancl a real desire to do something in the direction of a reduction of armaments was evident were not composed of visionaries or idealists, but of meu of experience, prime ministers, bassadors, and leading jurists, many of whom had had actual experience of the horrors of the great war, and were anxious, if possible, to avert another sucli catastrophe. them. I do not hesitate to say that there was a real desire on the part of the delegates to arrive afc some scheme would secure the peace of the world. To give honourable members an indication of the situation as it presented some of the delegates, I cannot do better than quote the remarks of Dr. Benes, who was one of the keenest men at the conference, and largely responsible Sir Littleton Groom. the Protocol. When speaking at fche council meeting, in March last, he saidI shall take the liberty of putting opposite these important facts certain other facts which are of no less importance, and whose significance seems to rae prophetic for the future. The war destroyed four great empires in Central and Eastern Europe, demolished ancient frontiers, established some ten new states, upset dynasties, unchained social revolutions, destroyed communications and financial systems, put down whole ruling classes and so forth, and produced a most incredible intermingling and incredible cross-currents in the interests of states, nations, and classes. The war sot nations against each other iu this part of the world, and created problems of hitherto unknown complexity. From Finland in tlio north, through the Baltic Republics, Poland. Germany, Czecho-Slovakia, and Austria, down the valley of the Danube to Constantinople and Southern Greece, you have regions where thouwas given to the sands of conflicts may break out, beginning today by the murder of a frontier guard or the as to the lines upon desecration of a flag, and easily ending toI was asked morrow in a terrible war. To-day all these of chairman countries are tired of this state of affairs. the First Committee, and as They long to be at last delivered from this intolerable position. They know that they have many problems that are almost insoluble psyI undertook the heavy rechologically through direct negotiations, and have wished to find methods other than violence and direct action to solve tliese problems. A great deal was accomplished in a very those short time. The First and Third Committees worked both night and day. I remember that on one occasion I remained in the chair for six hours without a break. It was realized that the Protocol produced under such conditions must contain imperfections. D r . Benes in this connection saidWe were in no way unconscious of the fact that there were some rather important imperthroughout. The committees fections and shortcomings in the work that had been performed so rapidly in a few short weeks of feverish labours. including foreign ministers, amThat describes exactly the feverish rush to which the delegates were sirbjected. Problems arose one after the other with amazing rapidity, and the marvel is that at such conferences a Protocol could have From my knowledge of been evolved which should receive such a measure of support as has been accorded to this one. which I should like to give a brief outline of the Protocol to show the manner in which ib attempted to deal with the various itself to problems which arose. The primary object was to get a conference to agree to the reduction of armaments. But certain nations contended that before they could for agree to any reduction of armaments they must have some guarantee of security. It was pointed owt for instance that a nation might have as its neighbour a manufacturing people, capable at short notice of utilizing their factories for the manufacture of munitions of war. A nation with such a neighbour would realize thafc it could nofc agree to disarm unless some guarantee of security were given. But that alone was not sufficient. thing in the nature of the pacific settlement of disputes was also necessary. The problems of disarmament, security, and the pacific settlement of disputes were so closely interwoven that they could not be considered separately. The general aim of the Covenant is to establish thc solidarity of the members of the international community. This the Protocol recognizes. tocol sets this forth , and asserts that a war of aggression constitutes a violation of this solidarity, and is an international crime. It expresses the desire to facilitate the complete application of the system provided in the Covenant for the pacific settlement of disputes between States, and for ensuring the repression of international crimes. The purpose desired to be realized, as contemplated by Article8 of the Covenant, is the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety, and fche enforcement by common action of international obligations. There is no obligation under the covenant in "" n o "" case to resort to war.. Under Article 12, the members of the League agree "" in no case to resort to war u n t i l three months after the award by the arbitrators-o r the judicial decision-o r the report by the Council."" Again, under Article 15, if a dispute comes before the Council, and the Council Fails to reach a report which is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the members of the League reserve to themselves the right to take such action as they shall consider necescourse, been functioning since the returns sary for the maintenance of right and justice. The Protocol seeks to reduce the area of possible conflicts-to close gaps in the Covenant. Under Article2 of the Protocol, the signatory states agree in no case to resort to war, either with one another or against a state which, if the occasion arises, accepts all the obligations of the Protocol. There are, however, two exceptions: first, when a state is acting in resistance to acts of aggression,and, secondly, when it is acting in agreement with the Council or the Assemblv of fche League of Nations in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant and of the Protocol. An addition to the Covenant is also contained in Article3 of the Protocol, under which the signatory states agree to accept the compulsory provisions of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justicei n the cases covered Someby paragraph 2 of Article 36 of thaiStatute. This acceptance is without prejudice to the right of any state, when acceding, to make reservations compatible with the clause. The legal disputes covered by this Article are-(a ) the interpretation of a treaty; (6) any question of international law; (c) the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of an international The preamble to the Proobligation; («7.) the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach of an international obligation. These disputes were regarded in the nature of legal disputes, and it was felt that the proper body to settle them would be thc Permanent Court of International Justice. In connection wifch this court, I should like to remove a little misapprehension that exists. The question has been asked, "" Who will comprise tliis court V I remind lionorable members that the court has been i u existence lov some time. It was created on the 16th September, 1921, and was opened on the 16th February, 1922. The court operates in two ways-it may deal with cases between parties, and ifc may give advisory opinions. Up to the close of the F if t h Assembly, three judgments had been given in cases between parties, and no less than ten advisory opinions had been expressed by the court afc the request of the Council. Of these thirteen cases Great Britain was concerned in three, one of which was a case between parties, and two of which were advisory opinions. The court has, cf were prepared. The court consists of eleven judges and four deputies, who are selected, not as representing individiial nations, but for their special qualifications. The aim is to secure representation of the main forms of civilization and the principal legal systems of the world. Lord Finlay, a Britisli subject, is a mem-' bev of the court, and Mr John Bassett Moore, one of the greatest international lawyers of the United States, is also a member, is not a member The Article advantage of the compulsory of the court.

The Protocol provides that in the settlement of disputes there is first the matter to conciliation by the Council. That method Those will probably be the most generally used.

If he disregards it he becomes an aggressor under conditions which I shall explain presently. Nations which accept this article in the Protocol agree that if the court gives a decision they will honour the obligation they have accepted. The question has been raised of the right of nations concerned in a dispute to be represented court. Court provides that if it includes on the bench a judge of the nationality of only one of the parties, the other party may select from among the deputy judges a judge of its nationality. If there is not among the deputy judges a judge of that nationality, the party may choose a judge, preferably from among persons who have been nominated as candidates. court includes on tlie bench no judge of the nationality of the contesting parties, each of these may select or choose a judge. Thus, every litigant before the court may have upon tbe bench a member of its own nationality. The question arises as to a deeisiou by the court on matters affecting domestic jurisdiction. For instance, is immigration a matter which, by international law, is solely within the domestic jurisdiction ? I looked into the matter very carefully beforehand, and the view I held very strongly was that it was inconceivable, on the authorities, that any court could possibly hold, or any lawyer could possibly advise, on the existence of international law as it is to-day, that immigration was not a matter which, by international law, is solely within the domestic jurisdiction. My honourable colleague is aware that this question gave him and myself a very great deal of anxiety. opinion of one of the most eminent The party raisauthorities we could get, and that opinion, which was in agreement with our own, has been confirmed by other outside opinions. stated definitely in the Protocol? jurisdiction covers an exceedingly wide range of questions, and the attempt to inThe decision of the permanent clude one or two in the Protocol might lead, through the non-inclusion of others, to an interpretation which might prove to W h a t is the effect upon be embarrassing. It seemed quite clear that immigration is a matter of domestic jurisdiction. On this question I should like to refer honourable members to an opinion given by Professor Charteris, Professor of International Law in the University of Sydney, who is an authority of very high repute in Australia. Dealing with this aspect of the matter, he saysAs to the two points upon which the Protocol has heen adversely criticized in the Australian press, it is conceived that the autonomy of Australia in respect of her immigration policy on the is not endangered hy either. Hostile critics have not infrequently betrayed ignorance of the The Statute of the Permanent present rights and liabilities of Australia under the covenant, and have compared the Geneva proposals with the present state of unchallenged autonomy (which is due to the vir tual acquiescence of Japan in the White Australia policy), and not (as they should have done) witli the position in which Australia would find herself under the covenant if Japan were to raise an "" acute dispute"" over this policy. There seems, indeed, to be no reason to If the dissent from the legal opinions which the Australiau delegation was reported by Mr Bruce in Parliament to have received in Europe to tlie effect that the White Australia policy u; exposed to no new risk under the Protocol as compared with the covenant. Later on he addsHaving regard, then, to the limited function of the court and to the practical certainty of a favorable opinion, it is conceived that Australia would gain an advantage in the right which the Protocol would give her of demanding, first, arbitration of the dispute, and thereafter an opinion of the court, on her plea under Article 15 (8) of the covenant, which would be automatically binding on the arbitrators. Honourable members will see that this matter was watched very carefully by my colleague and myself, and our opinion on the subject has been confirmed. Article 10 of the Protocol deals with the conditions under which a state refusing to accept a decision that a matter is one of domestic jurisdiction becomes an aggressor.

The court decides simply as to the matter of poweris it or is it not within the power of the state, that is, is it , or is it not, within its or the good understanding between domestic jurisdiction according to international law ? The matter to which I have referred having been taken before the court, it expressed the opinion thatThe question wliether a certain matter is or is not solely within the jurisdiction of a state is an essentially relative question; it depends upon the development of International relation. Thus, in the present state of international law, questions of nationality are, in the opinion of (lie court, in principle, within this reserved domain. The court decided that, so far as nationality is concerned, the conferring of nationality rights is a matter within the jurisdiction of the country concerned. great jurist, agree with that? not his opinion on that particular point, but I have it on another aspect of the Protocol, which I shall quote presently. I want, at this stage, to make some reference to a difficulty which arose during discussion mittee. ment which gave rise to considerable apprehension at the time. was stated in terms which seemed to suggest the possibility of constituting the Council a court of appeal from a decision of the Court. On that occasion I had to leave the chair, and address the Committee on the amendment. the position very clear so far as I feel Australia is concerned-that if the court gave its decision we should be entitled to hold to that decision very strongly. However, the matter was finally reconsidered, and practically the terms suggested by the British delegates were accepted. I direct the attention of honourable members to the last part of article 5 of the Protocol, which says that if the question is held by the Court or by the said that the matter in Council to be a matter solely within the domestic jurisdiction of the state, this decision shall not prevent the consideration The dispute went of the situation by the Council or by the I want honorAssembly under article 11 of the Covenant. I point out that this does nothing court does not consider the more than simply preserve all existing rights that are to-day contained in the It has no authority to Covenant. It does not carry the matter any further. Under article 11 of the Covenanti t is the right of any particular nation to bring before the Assembly or the Council any circumstance whatever affecting international relations which threatens to disturb international peace, nations upon which peace depends. The view put by the British delegate before the committee as to the meaning of this last paragraph of article 5 was accepted unanimously, as shown in the report of the rapporteurs. If under paragraph 8 of Article 15 of the Covenant a unanimous decision is given by the Council that decision stands and is binding. If , in the exercise of fche right which a nation possesses under Article 11 of the Covenant to bring the matter again before either the Council or the Assembly, the same question is raised, neither the Assembly nor the Council can interfere with the decision previously given. So that the position under the Protocol would be that if a country has been given a verdict in its favour on a question of domestic jurisdiction, and the nation adversely affected by the verdict exercises its right under this particular article to bring the matter again before the Counbefore the First Comcil or the Assemblyi n order to have it Japan moved an amendreconsidered, all that could happen would be that there might be friendly suggesIt tions, friendly intercourse, a suggestion for instance to the nation in whose favour the verdict had been given that its policy was not being carried out in a humanitarian way, and that ifc might consider whether it could not come to some agreement.",21,Australia S Delegates Steps Were Taken To Give Effect To This

There is agreement not to resort to war, and there is to be arbitration or judicial proceedings or inquiry by thc Council of the Leaguei n substitution. The Protocol has declared that a war <.f aggression is an international crime. That leads us to the next problem, which is one of the most difficult which the nations have had to face, and that is to determine what constitutes aggression. The question had been before experts, and they reported practically it constitutes aggression, because of the peculiar complications of international relationships. It is very difficult to determine in the course of the international relations between two nations nation is guilty of aggression. The Treaty of Mutual Assistance did not satisfy, and the to see if it was not possible to iay down certain rules, rules of presumption, and say that in the event of certain things happening, a particular nation should be deemed to be an aggressor. The Protocol by Article 10 lays down as a -general proposition what constitutes aggression, and says that every state which resorts to war in violation of the undertakings in the Protocol If? is an exceedingly difficult problem for the Council to define who is or is not an aggressor, and, accordingly, certain auto[62] matic rides were laid down. In the event of hostilities having broken out between two countries, the position is that, unless the Council unanimously decides otherwise, a state is presumed to be an aggressor under the following circum(1) Refusal to submit the dispute to arbitragiven is the only one that tion, judicial settlement, or inquiry by the Council; the decision in any If it objects and insists upon its That is to say, if a nation has refused to submit a dispute to the procedure for the pacific settlement of disputes provided They cannot be taken for by articles 13 and 15 of the Covenant as amplified by the Protocol, if it has gone to war after having definitely agreed Honourable members .will to submit all disputes to arbitration or to a judicial settlement, or to inquiry by the Council, in other words, if it has The position in regard to violated -its international undertakings and gone to war without submitting the dispute to pacific settlement, it is deemed to be an aggressor.

Buti f , instead of going to war at that stage, a nation which has had an award given against it takes the matter to the Council or Assembly, and the point is not settled there, it is not "" presumed "" to be an aggressor if it then goes to war, although it is still open to the Council to exercise its ordinary powers and declare it to be an aggressor. If the Council cannot agree upon the question as to who is the aggressor, instead of depending on the unanimity which is necessary in the case of the rest of the provisions of the Covenant, it is open to it , acting if needs be on a two-thirds majority^ to enjoin upon the belligerents an armistice, and fix the terms of it , and supervise its execution, and the belligerent which refuses to accept the armistice or carry out the terms fixsd by the Council is then presumed to be an aggressor. clause there was some difference of opinion in the committee. I had better explain exactly the position which arose. Japan moved the omission of the words that a nation which disregarded an arbitral decision that a matter in dispute was one of domestic jurisdiction was to be deemed to be an aggressor. Australiau delegates were opposed to that proposal. We could see no reason why that award should be any different from any other. It was in connection with that matter that trouble arose. after a meeting of certain delegates, the First Committee agreed compromise on the lines contained in the Protocol. that I am satisfied with it as it is now, because I think that no discrimination should have been permitted: hut at the same time it is clear that if there is a war of aggression in violation of the undertaking of the Covenant and Protocol, the Council mav find the aggressor in the wrong, and the country attacked may secure the support gf the League of Nations. The next point to be considered is the matter of sanctions or securities in the event of a war of aggression. Tn the event of hostilities having broken out, and rhe I shall fact of aggression having been presumed When a decision has been or found, the Council must call on the signatory states to apply forthwith against the aggressor the sanctions provided for by Article 11 of the Protocol. W. Bamford) -The Minister's time has expired. Isi t the pleasure of the House that he have leave to continue his speech ? Leave granted. Sir LITTLETONGROOM I thank honourable members. The Protocol provides that these sanctions shall apply immediately, and they are contained in Article 16 of the Covenant. They are what are known as the economic sanctions; that is to say, the right of blockade, and also obligations relating to military or naval movements as set out in the Covenant itself. I do not wish to go into details. I merely wish to make it clear that this part of the Protocol adds no new sanctions, but simply makes existing sanctions more precise and definite. Sir Frederick Pollock sets out the position very clearly. He says, Upon that particular "" Articles 10 to 13 do not purport to create any new substantive duty, nor do more than point the way that every loyal member of the League would wish to follow. Loyal and effectual co-operation against any aggressor is the tenor of Article 11. I find there only a more explicit declaration of what is already The implicit in the Covenant."" On a breach of the Covenant occurring, this Protocol applies, and the sanctions are put into operation forthwith. The sanctions provided by the Covenant are, first, the Finally, severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of intercourse beto a tween nationals, and the prevention of all financial, commercial, or personal in1 do not say tercourse between States; secondly, it is the duty of the Council to recommend to the several governments concerned what effective naval, militarv , or other forces the members of the League should severally contribute to the armed forces necessary to protect the covenants of the League.

When the Protocol came before the First Committee for its final stages, I made it clear that neither the Australian Government nor the Australian Parliament was committed to a single paragraph contained in it . The committee was of opinion that the best thing the Assemby could do would be to adopt a resolution which, while welcoming the Protocol, would recommend its acceptance to the earnest attention of all the members of the League. have ratified it? Australian delegation left Geneva ten countries had attached their signatures to it , and since then seven others have done so, but. only one country, Czecho-Slovakia, has yet ratified it . The idea seems to have got abroad that the Governments represented at the Assembly were committed by the mere passage of the r Nations Assembly. 1459 Protocol by the Assembly. That is not so.

A country is accepting a serious obligation when it binds itself The beforehand to accept the finding of arbitrators, no matter what may be the matter in dispute or the nature of the controversy. Moreover, I recognize that the circumstances of the British Empire are peculiar. It is made up of many nations, and the bearing of the Protocol upon thc Empire generally must be carefully thought out before the document could be signed. The article regarding presumptions as to aggression needs careful revision. Australian experience of industrial arbitration has shown the difficulty of deciding whether or not an award has been broken. Another important provision which calls for the closest scrutiny is that which declares that, in the event of war, the aggressor nation shall be made to pay all the costs of military action and reparation; but its territorial integrity and political independence shall remain intact. could have been met by amendments suggested by the Commonwealth Government. to decide whether or not we should accept the Protocol, and so enable a. conference to be held.

Even the representative of It a l y , who was so strongly in favour of the Protocol, pointed out at the meeting of the Council of the League last MarchTlie too rigid legal structure of the judicial procedure for the definition of disputes between states is certainly a defect, for those disputes are not always essentially legal disputes. ViscountI s h i i , the head of the Japanese delegation, saidThe Japanese Government has not yet completed its study and examination of this all important question of the pacific solution' of international conflicts. It is, therefore, not yet in a position to define its attitude one way or another. Mr Unden, the representative of the Swedish Government, saidThe Swedish Government has submitted the Geneva Protocol to a thorough examination by a sub-committee appointed for this purpose. The committee, whicli was instructed to study the question, both from the legal and political points of view, has not yet finished its work. My government, which attaches the greatest importance to the work which was done at Geneva last year, and especially to the introduction of the principle of compulsory arbitration into the framework of the Covenant, cannot give a final opinion on the Protocol before the report of the committee has been delivered. I have indicated to honorahle the attempt which was made to solve those many difficult and problems. sembly this endeavour was advanced further than ever before, and that there will be found in the Protocol principles which will find their place in the final document by which nations will ultimately be pledged to the pacific settlement of disputes. sideration of the draft Protocol has not been lost. solved only by progressive and by presenting and examining after plan. duction ofarmaments, must be general; and the United of America and Germany must be parties to the agreement. the position of that other great speaking nation, and endeavour to facilitate its entrance into this In the Protocol is an article which provides that if a dispute arises between a signatory state and another state which is not a signatory, and not a member of the League, the latter is required to Sir Littleton Groom. adopt the procedure accepted by the signatories; if it fails to do so, if it resorts to war, it is practically in the position of an aggressor. It was suggested that this provision might prove to be an obstacle to some states, for example, the United States of America.

I wish to deal briefly with a few of these matters. lectual co-operation is a very institution in the affairs of the League of Nations. remedies for the evils from which (he intellectual world has suffered since the war, and to stimulate and establish intellectual co-operation between National committees have been set up in many countries to co-operate with the international committee. lications havs been sent to many tions in Europe. ment offered to grant a million francs to establish in Paris an international tute of intellectual co-operation. I realize how necessary it is for the work of the League of Nations to be a success, and to that end I contend that all of an international located in what might be termed neutral territory, so that they would have an international tution is established country, whether it be in Great Mr Clinrllov. Australia, or any other, it loses its inConsequently the delegates ternational aspect, and becomes a national project. Therefore, if the work of this committee is to be successful, the centre of international institutions should be at the seat of the League of Nations, which is in Switzerland. Until this is done we shall not obtain the healthy co-operation that should exist between the different nations to make these institutions a success. The establishment of an international institution in any particular country at once gives that country an additional prestige to the detriment of other nations who are endeavouring to co-operate in the work. BecauseI hold that view, I opposed the offer of France. A t present we are spending over £6,000 per annum at Geneva itself on international institutions. The sum offered by the French Government, which was 1,000,000 francs, may seem a lot of money, but at that time it represented only £12,500 in our currency, because the value of the franc was 85 to £ 1 . Since then the franc has furthe r depreciated, and to-day 1,000,000 francs would be worth something between £8,000 and £9,000 in our money. This offer was discussed by the committee. Quite a numher of representatives including British, Dominion, and Swedish representatives came to me and admitted that my contention was correct, yet The committee on intelstrange to say, the only vote recorded important against this proposal was my own. One thing to which I object in regard It is endeavouring to find to the procedure at the League of Nations is the feeling that all proposals that are brought forward should be agreed to. They are not debated as they nations. would he if before this deliberative assembly. There is too much give and take between the representatives of the Books and pubvarious nations. This is a distinct weakness, instituand if it continues the work of the League The French Governwill lose weight among the nations. If an institution of intellectual co-operainstition were established in Australia, would the other nations of the world consider it an international institution, and would they co-operate with it as they should ? I institutions venture to say that they would not. An character should be international institution of intellectual co-operation established in France w ill not be a success, because the other nations significance. Once an instiwill not wish to give undue prestige to in any particular that country. Britain, tellectual committee purely theoretical, or Joesi t deal with specific international problems ? specific international problems, such as scientific investigation. France came before the Assembly. Tho practice there is to drop any question that is not carried unanimously. I again voiced my view, although I did not have a vote. The Attorney-General approved of my contention, but he was not prepared to vote against the proposal. Sir James Allen, if the matter had come to a vote, was prepared to vote with me. I am not finding fault with the French Government ; I wish to see the League of Nations grow aud flourish, and I cannot see how that can happen if nations are permitted to establish international institutions in their own territories. All that will be gained by the acceptance of the offer of the French Government, if the institution succeeds at all, will be simply an addition to the prestige of France. She will practically be the seat of culture, in vention, and so for t h , in the eyes of the world. The League of Nations cannot succeed if we carry on along these lines. After this proposal was approved by the Assembly, in fact, on the 26th September, two days afterwards, the Italian Government offered to subscribe 1,000,000 lire, representing £8,000, to found at Rome an institution for the unification of private law. Important work had already been done in this respect hy Great Britain, France, and Italy, but because the offer of France had been accepted a similar privilege could not be withheld from It a l y . These institutions when established in Paris and Rome cannot have an international aspect. To bo international, and to gain the co-operation of all the nations, such institutions must be located in the territory of the League of Nations, to disseminate from there throughout the world information of benefit to mankind. the manner in which we are carrying it out wili defeat the object that wi' have in view. scheme for the protection of scientific property will be dealt with hy the In ternational Intellectual Institution to be established at Paris. This matter was evidently discussed at the conference held I s the work of the inin 1922, because a report concerning it was dealt with at the conference in 1923. The committee on intellectual co-operation requested Senator Ruffini to draw It deals w it h up a report dealing with the protection of scientific property. In that report, The offer of which was submitted to the League of Nationsi n 1923, Senator Ruffini recommended that provision should be made for the discoverer of a patent to receive the f u l l benefits of his discovery, and for the prevention of the exploitation of his idea by individuals, companies, or syndicates. That recommendation was adopted, and a convention submitted to the various nations which are members of the League. Dp to last year only twelve nations had replied. Some of the replies were favourable; other nations, while expressing sympathy with the principle, pointed out that they could not accept the whole of the recommendations. The League is desirous of obtaining an expression of opinion from the various countries regarding this convention, so that the work can be carried on from year to year u n t i l a recommendation acceptable to the nations of the world is evolved. So far as I am aware, Australia has not yet considered this matter. This and other matters should be dealt with, and the League of Nations informed of our views; otherwise it is idle for us to send delegates to the League of Nations from time to time. Another matter dealt with by the committee was the loan to Hungary, to which thc Attorney-General has referred. Honourable members w ill remember that Austria received a loan which stabilized her finances. In her case several other countries provided security for fche loau. The loan to Hungary was 250,000,000 gold crowns, but, instead of other countries providing the security, Hungary earmarked certain taxes on sugar, salt, and tobacco to meet the interest on the loan, and also to provide a sinking fund . The arrangement, which is working satisfactorily, has had Our intention is good, but the effect of stabilizing the currency in Hungary. Sufficient revenue Las been obtained from the taxes to pay the inSenator Ruffini's terest, provide a sinking f u n d , and allow a small margin. The League of Nations has already done excellent work in connection with many European countries. A report was submitted to the League dealing with the work of the organization",27,Littleton Groom The Stances

I desire now to refer to the excellent work done by the committee appointed to deal with budget and financial questions. The expenditure of the League of Nations this year is estimated at about 22,658,13S gold francs. Every item constituting that total is brought before the committee, and is carefully scrutinized. On page 477 of the report the following appears: The examination of the budget for 1925 as the services of the League of Nations are campaigns for economy; the departments themselves endeavour by well considered League.

It has, in addition, established a working capital fund of nearly 4,000,000 gold francs. That, in a nutshell, is the financial position of fche League of Nations. Many of fche nations forming the League are unfinancial, eight of them being in arrears with their contributions for 1923 to the extent of 2,SS2,031 francs, or £144,101 -honourable members ask for the opinion Requests have been made to the League for a reduction of the contributions, as it is claimed that in some cases they are too heavy. These matters are all investigated by the finance committee. The International Labour Office will be paid off by the end of 1925. The erection of an assembly hall, at a cost of 4,500,000 gold francs, spread over three years, has beeu decided on, and already the expenditure of 250,000 francs f<tr preliminary expenses has been approved. The plans fortius office will be open to competition throughout the world. The expenditure of fche League of Nations is divided into a total of 932 units, of which Australia is responsible for 26. Tliere are 35 units available owing to the resumption of payments by the Argentine. These will bo distributed by the Committee on the Allocation of Expenses. Last year Australia paid £25,500, and I anticipate that a similar sum will be required this year. I now wish to refer to a more important matter emanating from the recent conference of the League of Nations which has already been dealt with by the A t torney-General. traverse all that the honourable gentleman has said, but I want to place before the House my view of the Protocol, and especially of those clauses dealing with domestic jurisdiction. I can only say that I endorse what the Attorney-General has said regarding the interpretation placed upon those clauses. From many of the articles which I had the privilege of perusing I am convinced that a good deal of misapprehension in regard to those clauses existed in Australia when they were written. That that was so is not surprising, because when the statements offered the terms of the Protocol had not been made available, and, consequently, [63] Because of that, wrong judgments were formed in Australia in connection with matters of domestic jurisdiction, and particularly with respect to the White Australia policy, which, it was said, would be jeopardized if the Protocol were adopted. I do not think that there is the slightest justification for that statement. If the Protocol were put into operation, the White Australia, policy would be very much strengthened. I have heard some of D r . Benes. On page 494 of the text of the debates, D r . Benes states the position as clearly as it can be stated, and expresses views that I hold myself. He saysAccording io the system laid down by the Covenant:1. The dispute arises. 2. In cases where neither the arbitral .procedure nor thejudicial settlement provided for in Article .13 of the Covenant is applied, thc Council meets and discusses the dispute, attempts to affect conciliation, mediation, <fee. 3. If it be unsuccessful and war breaks out, the Council, if unanimous, has to express an opinion as to which party is guilty. The members of the League then decide for themselves whetlier this opinion is justified, and whether tlicir obligations to apply economic sanctions become operative. 4. The Council then has, by a unanimous decision, to recommend military sanctions. 5. If unanimity cannot be obtained, the Council ceasing to take action, each party is practically free to act as it chooses. That is what would hajipen under the Covenant, aud I feel sure that no one will contend that it is satisfactory. We cannot hope to get disarmament and peace I do .not intend to under a covenant which leaves the nations to decide whether they will take action. The Protocol, in the words of Dr. Benes, will apply in thc following way:According to the new system defined in the Protocol, tlie situation is as follows:1. Thc dispute arises. 2. The system of peaceful settlement provided by the Protocol comes into play. 3. The Council intervenes, and. if after arbitration has been refused, war is resorted to if the provisional preventive measures are not observed, &c , the Council decides which party is the aggressor, and calls upon the signatory states to apply the sanctions. 4. This decision implies* that such sanctions as the case requires-economic , financial, militarv, naval, and air-shal l be applied forthwith, and without further they were based on recommendations or decisions. We have therefore the following new elements:(a) The obligation to apply the necessary sanctions of every kind as a direct result of the decision of thc Council. (6) The elimination of the case in which all parties would be practically free to abstain from any action. The introduction of a system of arbitration, and of provisional measures which permits of the determination in every case of the aggressor. (c) No decisioni is taken as to the strength of the military, naval, and air forces, and no details are given as to the measures which are to be adopted in a. particular case. None the less, objective criteria are supplied which define the obligation of each signatory; it is bound, in resistance to an act of aggression, to collaborate loyally and effectively in applying the sanctions in accordance with its geographical situation and its particular situation as regards armaments. That is why I said that the great omission in the Covenant has been made good. It is true that no burden has been imposed on States beyond the sanctions already provided for in the Covenant. But, at present, a State seeking to elude the obligations of the Covenant can reckon on two means of escape:(1) The Council's recommendations need not be followed. (2) The Council may fail to obtain unanimity, making impossible any declaration of aggression, so that no obligation to apply military sanctions will be imposed, and every one will remain free to act as he chooses. We have abandoned the above system, and both these loopholes are now closed. That is the position in a nutshell, and it shows that the Covenant is tory. proved unsatisfactory have occurred since the League of Nations was created. principle of compulsory arbitration; we cannot have compulsory unless penalties are imposed upon those who refuse to obey the decisions reached. I have heard honourable members to the imposition of penalties; but I fail to see how the nations of the world cau bring about disarmament unless there is power to enforce decisions. tralian arbitration are penalties awards. It has heen urged that the Protocol will place Australia at a great disadvantage in enforcing its White tralia policy. honourable members will see if they read it, we cannot depend upon the assistance of other members of the League if an Afr.

The Council must first decide unanimously which country is the aggressor; and even if it does so decide, the other members of the League cannot be compelled to assist the country attacked. If a i l to see that the position of Australia is better under the Covenant than under the Protocol. The Covenant confines us, in the event of a dispute about our i m m i gration policy, to such assistance as we can get from within the Empire. Some honourable members contend that we should not refer such a question as the White Australia policy to an international court of justice. What obligation is there upon us, they say, to refer a question of domestic concern to an international court? If we accept that view, how can we solve the problem of disarmament? I s it not essential that there should be some authority to whicli to appeal? To-day it is left to the Council of the League of Nations, which must be unanimous. It has been said that, as Great Britain has a representative on the Council, nothing injurious could be done to Australia. It is possible, however, that exception would be taken to Great Britain having a representative on the Councili f the White Australia, policy were in question, because, technically, Great Britain would be involved. Asi t is provided that no representative of a country interested shall participate, Australia would probunsatisfacably have no voice in the decision. Even The Covenant has, in fact, been if that objection were not taken, we should in the disputes that not get any assistance from members of the League. Under the ProThe Protocol includes the tocol, the dispute would first be subbut mitted to the Council, and then to arbitration arbitration.

57,"Under The Covenant, As Mr Charlton","We should not boancl it is then left to each nation to decide whether it w ill send a force, having regard to its geographical position. The international court has been in existence for a number of years, and has already given a decision in this matter. It is well known that international law is not concerned with immigration. If the international court reports that a dispute is a question of domestic concern, the arbitrators are bound to award accordingly, and no action can be taken. The Council can mediate, but it cannot upset the decision of the international court. I took the trouble when in England to consult Sir Cecil Hurst, for I was not prepared to advocate the Protocoli f it would endanger the White Australia policy. should be the last man to do that. The members of the Australian delegation did their best to prevent any interference with that policy, and it was due largely to them that the Japanese amendments were accepted in the for m they were. Sir Cecil Hurst is the legal adviser to the British Government. thought of the matter, and he said, speaking of paragraph S of article 15 of the Covenant, "" t he matter is to he decided by international law."" imagine that judges who are chosen because of their merit, and who are men of integrity, would do anything contrary to the law? If international law clearly sets out that immigration is a matter of domestic concern, the court can give but one decision. We put the matter in this waySupposing that an Asiatic nation picked a quarrel with Australia on the White Australia policy, and when the latter came before the Council, Australia claimed that the matter was one of domestic jurisdiction. If the Council unanimously decided that Ausapproved of by many delegates, including tralia was in the right, its decision would be binding on the Asiatic nations; but if thc Council failed to arrive at a unanimous decision, then the aid of the League could not be invoked. He explained that the International Court of Justice came into existence in 1921, and first met in 1922. The President is elected for three years, and his term of office has just come to an end. The court consists of fifteen members, and the necessary quorum for a sitting is eleven. The members of the court are selected as in dividuals on their own merits, but there must not be two drawn from the same country. They are elected equally and simultaneously by the Council and the Assembly of the League. The British Judge is Lord Findley, who was Lord Chancellor, and for years Attorney General. In Sir Cecil Hurst's view, immigrationlegislation does not come within the province of international law, and Australia cannot be worse off under the Protocol than under the Covenant. That is the considered opinion of a man who should know, and who is charged with very heavy responsibilities. Australia is really in a better position under the Protocol than under the Covenant. Why is this ? It is because if an aggressor I failed to comply with the provisions of the Protocol, the sanctions would be immediately brought into operation, and other countries must then do their part. They must cut off trade relations with the aggressor, and must come to the assistance of Australia in her hour of need. That is a very different oosition from thafc which we occupy under the Covenant, beI asked h i m what he cause under it we could get absolutely no assistance in this particular matter. Yeb we are told that the White Australia policy is endangered under the Protocol. Does any one I say that our position is infinitely stronger under the Protocol than it is under the Covenant. The Protocol would secure us the protection of other nations of the world, whilst under the Covenant we are given no guarantee of such protection. I shall say something with respect to the amendment submitted by the Japanese delegation, because I want to let honourable members know that the Japanese saw the position in which Japan would be placed under the provisions of the Protocol. It had been drawn up and our Attorney-General, who was on the committee. I had not seen it at this particular time. Honourable members must understand that my knowledge of it was gained from what happened in the Assembly and at the meetings of the British Empire delegation. I want to make clear the purpose of the amendment moved by the Japanese delegates to Article5 of the Protocol. It readsThe provisions of paragraph 8, Article 15, of the Covenant shall continue to apply in proceedings before the Council. If in the course of an arbitration, such as is contemplated in Article4 above, one of the parties claims that the dispute, or part thereof, arises out of a matter which by international law is solely within the domestic jurisdiction of that party, the Arbitrator shall on tliis point, take the advice of the Permanent Court of International Justice through the medium of the Council. The opinion of the Court shall be binding upon the Arbitrators, who, if the opinion is affirmative, shall confine themselves to so declaring in their award. The Japanese delegates wanted to amend that article by adding the following words, and honourable members will note the significance of the proposed amendment:The above provisions leave unaffected the Council's duty of endeavouring to conciliate the parties so as to ensure the maintenance of peace and good understanding between the nations. If that amendment had been accepted we should have been brought right back to the position under the covenant. amendment. Japanese saw the position in which they were placed by the Protocoli n regard to this question about which we are so much concerned, and it was in order to escape from that position that they moved their amendment. According to the in formation conveyed to me at the meeting of the Empire delegation which I attended, in speaking to their amendment the Japanese delegates urged that the International Court of Justice should he eliminated from the Protocol altogether. They did not want the International Court of Justice. In view of this statement, what will now be said by those people in Australia who are so anxious that we should not go to the International Court of Justice? were beaten in that contention, they took up another ground, and talked ahout calling a f u r t h er convention of the nations to alter international law. This plainly indicated that the Japanese delegates recognized clearly fche position in which Japan would he placed under the Protocol. I am sorry to have to refer by name to the Japanesei n . this connection, because I have no desire to create any ill feeling, hut a reference to the action taken by the Japanese delegates is unavoidable. As the amendment was finally accepted it lef t the Japanesei n no better position than they were in before their amendment was submitted. Now under Article5 they can still go to the Council, which can still use conciliatory measures, but it cannot interfere w i th a decision of the international court, and that court has already given a decision that immigration is a matter of domestic jurisdiction. That was a unanimous decision, there being no dissentient from it . The only thing which could prevent its operation would be the action of nations concerned in entering into separate agreements abrogating the provisions of international law. Australia has not done thafc. It has not entered into any agreement to abrogate the provisions of international law so f a r as its domestic jurisdiction in the matter of immigration is concerned. In the circumstances I quite f a i l to understand the strong exception taken here and elsewhere to the Protocol. This matter It was a very subtle was discussed in the open Assembly. I knew at the time that I would not be a member of either of the committees. The Attorney-General( Sir Littleton Groom) was rightly appointed a member of them, and I took no exception whatever to that. I realized, however, that it was necessary that I should make my views known, and in order to do so I had to get my name down on the list of speakers in the Assembly. A delegate could not rise in his place there, and expect to be called upon to speak. If he desired to speak to any question he had to give in his name beforehand, ancl he could then speak if an opportunity were afforded h i m to do so before the discussion of the particular question was concluded. In the early stages of the debateI think I was the third speaker on the subjectI made my When the Japanese position as clear as I possibly could. I pointed out that it was my object, as I thought it was the object of the people of Australia, that something tangible should be done towards bringing ahout a reduction in armaments, and providing some method of settling international disputes without recourse to war. I pointed out that five years had elapsed since the war, and that we were in exactly the same position as at the time the League of Nations was formed. Whilst very much good work in connection.with European affairs had heen done hy the League, I pointed out that so far as the world generally was concerned,",32,Littleton Groom The Stances
58,Mr Coleman,,34,Littleton Groom The Stances
59,Mr Charlton,"Yes, it was. Theand so far as Australia was concerned, something tangible in the way of disarmament was required to relieve the nations of the heavy burden they had to carry. I urged that there should be a world's conference, without any conditions whatever, to discuss the position. I realized that so long as Germany, America, Russia, and Turkey were outside the League we could not expect that anything satisfactory in the matter of disarmament or maintenance of peace could be accomplished. Prime Minister( Mr Ramsay MacDonald) pointed out very clearly that he was in favour of arbitration, and also was prepared to have a world's conference. M . Herriot said that so far as France was concerned she must have security before she could enter into any agreement with regard to the matter or could take part in any conference. He pointed out that France had nations ou her borders who might become aggressive at any moment, and said that in the circumstances he could not possibly agree to anything in regard to disarmament without some guarantee of security. As the Attorney General mentioned this morning, the difference between these two views is what rhe committee had to consider in preparing some draft which might lead to a conference. The only way in which the question can be successfully dealt with is by having a world's conference of the nations without any conditions being laid down. Let the nations meet and discuss the position. Let them go into all the details of the matter, and see if they can jecting a proposal for the arrangement devise a scheme which can be submitted to the Parliaments of the respective countries. It is only in that way that something can be done. It was because this could not be agreed upon that it was. are we to settle international disputes eventually decided to deal with the matter in the manner provided for by the Protocol. press, when criticizing the Protocol, would lead people to believe that if we accept it Australia will be committed to everything contained in it . members look at the provisions of the Protocol. They will find that everything is dependent on a world's conference, and that at such a conference some plan must be devised. That plan must be put into operation by all the nations simultaneously. They must agree to disarm. Whatever is accepted at the conference [64 ] must be put into operation, and if disarmament is approved there must be general disarmament throughout the world. Howi n the face of these facts can it be urged that Great Britain will have to supply a navy for the purpose of defending the rest of the world. Great Britain would have to disarm along with other countries. would disappear. posed disarmament conference were brought to a satisfactory conclusion. Honourable members will see that there are no grounds for the adverse criticism of the Protocol which has been made. It is only a basis for a world's conference for the discussion of a common agreement in regard to disarmament and peace. It; was made necessary because of the action of France and Great Britain. What view did Great Britain take of the treaty of mutual assistance that was carried in 1923? The Prime Minister of Great Britain said that he rejected the treaty of mutual assistance because he believed it would lead to pacts and alliances such as were formed in 1914. That was the ground given by Mr MacDonald for Great. Britain's rejection of the treaty of mutual assistance. Yet. the present British Government, which has rejected the Protocol, is now endeavouring to arrange a pact with four other nations, and is getting back to where we were in 1914. Where is the consistency of reof a conference and then going back to a position which the Government previously opposed ? If we say we object to arbitration what are we to substitute for it? How without the establishment of some t r i bunal for the purpose? They will not Honourable members and the settle themselves.

But Great Britain occupies a very position If Great Britain is to uphold its prestige and influence as a nation it must give a lead to the other nations. jected the Protocol it should have put forward some alternative proposal, or at least have asked for a conference to be held. sign the Protocol, and ten have done so, but it was also necessary to have the signatures of four of Ihe nations represented on the Council of the League, those nations being Great Britain, Italy, and Prance. them, France, has signed it. the signatures of the others there can be no conference such as was intended June last, and so far there is no proMr Charlton.

It is that of It was rejected by the Commonwhich I complain. Something intelligent ought to be laid down to guide our delegates when they are discussing this Protocol at the next meeting of the Assembly. The Protocol will be the basis for further discussion at that meeting m order to improve it by eliminating feaconference of tures which may be considered objectionable. But our delegates will attend without instructions from this ParliaOther honourable memment. It is nearly eight months since the last delegates returned to Australia, yet. until the present moment they have not beeu asked to furnish their report to Parliament. It is now being considered loo late, because our delegates to the next Assembly have already left Australia. Parliament should have been Government. They called together earlier to deal with the matter. I am an admirer of the League of Nations.

If Great When it re-Britain would only take the step of convening a world conference other countries would fall in behind it . It has not done so, and as the League of Nations cannot Only ten nations were needed lo succeed because one or two powerful nations remain aloof from it , the position is hopeless. If Great Britain had ratified the Protocol, other countries would have followed its lead, but because :t Japan, would not do so other nations would not.

The only way in which to get all the nations together is to caJJ a conference at which the Protocol would assuredly be put forward as a basis for discussion.
