SPEAKER -Before I call for questions Avithout notice, I wish to say a few words about the procedure that will be adopted in reference to them. Questions may be directed to a Minister of State on matters affecting the administration of that Minister's department. No question may be based on a newspaper paragraph. A. question may not be directed to a Minisand then, if necessary, raise the subject ter representing a Minister in the Senate. Such' a question must be placed on the notice-paper, as, obviously, the Minister in this House to whom such, a question is addressed cannot know the answer to it without making inquiries. Questions may not contain any debatable matter, and should be as brief as possible. I point out to the House that in the House of Commons, according to the Select Committee on Procedure which sat two or three years ago, members ask and Ministers answer about SO questions an hour. Older members of this House will understand the difference between that procedure in the House of Commons, and the procedure in this House. Later : to you, Mr Speaker, in the belief that I must have misconstrued something that you said at the commencement of this sitting. I_ understood you to say that you would not permit questions to be addressed to Ministers in their capacity as representatives of Ministers in tlie Senate. If that be so, I ask whether it is your intention to deprive members of this House of the opportunity to make representations directly to Ministion ters on the floor of the House. Mr .SPEAKER -It is not my intenAdelaide has referred. I have already tion to deprive members of any of their made it my business to investigate the privileges. Questions asked at this stage notification that is given in Europe f. of the day's proceedings are asked without notice, and it is not to be expected that a Minister will understand the details of procedure in a department administered by a Minister in the Senate sufficiently to be able to give answers without notice. Each honourable member has an opportunity, of which I hope he will make use, to ask questions concerning departments administered by Senate Ministers by placing such questions on the notice-paper. If a matter of urgency should arise, he may discuss it on thc motion for the adjournment of the House. I should say that, if an honourable member is concerned about a matter affecting a department administered by a Senate Minister, the proper course for him to take would be to have a talk with the Minister representing that Senate Minister in this House during the adjournment debate, when he could ask his question and obtain a prepared answer. It is obvious that a satisfactory answer could not be given to such a. question asked without notice. The object of asking questions is to elicit answers. mentation of policy regarding displaced persons at Finsbury North, in South Australia, will the Minister for Immigration take action to ensure the carrying out of a promise given to me by a previous Minister to the effect that, generally, married couples, and not a preponderance of single persons, are to occupy that centre? I understand that the Minister bas received a telegram from 35 men there in which they request that their wives and children, who are at Bonegiiia camp in Victoria, shall be sent to Finsbury North. I ask the Minister whether he has given consideration to that matter, and whether he will announce that his policy is to keep families together, if that is possible? at the moment the request whicb has been received from the gentlemen to whom the honourable member for Port",9,Setup

4,Mr Holt,"I have under examinamigrants who intend to come to Australia, and I am. assured by my department that very strict instructions have been issued that prospective migrants shall be warned in specinc terms of the probability that, during the course of their employment in Australia, they are likely to be separated from their families for some considerable time, and that it is even possible that they may be so separated until the husband is able to secure accommodation of his own. In order to make sure that that warning is given, instructions have been issued that the selection officer must note, in writing, the application form, to the effect that he has issued such a warning. It is the desire of the Government to make this period of separation-thi s inevitable period, in some cases-as short as is practicable, and so far as lies in our power, we are doing what we can to ensure that these families are not separated for any greater period than circumstances require. The matter that the honourable member for Port Adelaide has raised is under active consideration at the present time. i'or Immigration whether he wishes to purchase the site at Mildura, Victoria, formerly used for university purposes, for the use of his department.

The loyalty of my colleague, the Minister for Defence, to His Majesty the King has been proved under various circumstances and is not in question. ter endeavour to prevent the disparagement of Australians appointed to high and responsible positions overseas? I refer to a very strong statement in the Sydney Morning Herald, and also in the Sunday Herald, about the complete unsuitability of the Minister for Defence, Mr Harrison, for appointment as Resident Minister in London. In conformity with the Standing Orders, I vouch for the complete accuracy of the statement, as all who know the Minister will do. I wish to know whether it is possible to prevent such facts from being cabled abroad so that some value may be got from the representation of this country in London by the Minister, before the been made for the people there "" wake up "" to him, as no doubt they will do soon enough. deep earnestness of the question. All I can suggest to the honourable member is that before he raises the topic again he should go into close conference with the honourable member for Hunter, because a little consistency in the approach made to the same topics by honourable members opposite would be of great advantage to all of us -",13,Immigration

Therefore, I think that the be laid before this House. time is premature for considering questions of this sort.

I believe thc Minister for the Army to a report that some procedure that will obviate the that Japanese generals held on atrocity necessity for local governing bodies to charges are to be released on orders from write direct to the Commonwealth Australia.

Minister for the Navy a question relating 1:0 an incident that occurred during the tenure of office of the Labour Government, and to another incident that has occurred since thc present Government has been in office. The first occurrence was the sinking of a corvette that was engaged in mine-sweeping operations, as a result of which some men were accidentally killed. The second instance was the recent Taralcan disaster. On both occasions, representations were made to the authorities to have the bodies of men killed returned to their relatives in their home States, but it became clear that it was not the practice in the Royal Navy or in the Royal Australian Navy to do so. Would it not be possible to adopt in Australia the practice of the. navy of the United States of America as being more humane in the interests of relatives? at present reviewing the regulations relatyears expires? ing to the disposal of the bodies, of members of the armed services who meet their deaths in Australia. As for the tragic Tarahan disaster, it ought to be put on record that very substantial assistancewell above what is provided for in the regulations-wa s given to the relatives and friends of those men who suffered death or injury. Telegrams were sent to relatives informing them that if they wished to visit men who were injured their fares would be paid by air or rail to Sydney ancl back. Incidental expenses incurred while they were in Sydney were met for as long as they were required to remain, and their hotel expenses were also paid for the period during which, in the opinion of the naval medical officer, their presence in Sydney would be helpful to the injured persons. Thus, all the expenses incurred by relatives were readily met by the Government. When the injured men were able to return to their homes, they were accompanied' by sick bay attendants, whose duty was to a result of the extraordinary shock they had sustained. the dead. that the regulations are being reviewed. In the case of the one person whose remains were taken to Queensland, a grant has been made comparable with the expenses that would have been incurred if the burial had taken place in Sydney, as I indicated when this matter was first raised. of the Minister for the Navy concerning young men who, having enlisted in the. Royal Australian Navy, find that life in the service is entirely opposed to their inclinations and does not offer them what they consider to be a satisfying career. Numbers of such cases have come to my notice, and honourable members are probably aware of others. Will t;he Minister consider making some arrangement whereby men who make application during the first two years of their service in the Navy can have their periods of service reduced so that they may be released before the normal term of twelve to deal with an unusual number of applications for discharge from the Royal Austvalian Navy that have been carried over from the administration of the previous Government. I have replied to many requests for release that were addressed to my predecessor, indicating whether or not it will be possible to accede to them. I am pleased to say that such applications are not coming in at the same rate to-day as obviously they did previously. The proposal to-day is that men may enlist, iu the Navy for either six years or twelve years according to their choice. I believe that this scheme has given a great fillip to recruiting. The honourable member may rest assured that everything possible will be done to make sure that men who enlist in the Navy will remain enthusiastic ancl be contented in their work. I hope that recruiting will be accelerated and that men who join the service will decide to remain in it.",17,Dried And Canned Fruits

If the honourable member wishes, he may peruse the details in my room this afternoon. The Government has adopted a policy of resuscitating all important aerodromes that have been allowed to fall into disuse and disrepair.

'Ihe inability to secure sufficient storage for large quantities of grain and the inability to obtain early export licences, have caused losses to fanners in previous years. Some of the grain,, at least, could be sold as it is brought in from harvest. attention to the question of export licences for grain sorghum. I find, that the position which obtained last season and the previous season was that one co-operative organization had been given the sole monopoly right to export grain .sorghum. I had representations made to me by another important and numerically strong co-operative organization in Queensland, which asked to be given an export permit. Tha.t was in addition to the request for a renewal of the monopoly permit that I first mentioned. The decision that I have made is to grant a permit to' each of those organizations, indicating to them that the quantity of grain sorghum that finally will be exported will be fixed having regard to the total volume of the crop and local, requirements of grain sorghum and, in the case of each applicant for an export permit, having regard to the quantity of grain sorghum placed in its custody by growers for disposal. I have also bad requests that export permits be given to individual exporters of grain sorghum, and I have intimated that I will not place any intending exporter in possession of a document which, in itself, could be of value in soliciting the purchase of grain sorghum. Any merchant who has purchased a quantity of grain sorghum may apply for an export permit, and consideration will then be given to the application in the light of the principles that I have outlined. OIL AND PETROL. Mr ""WARD I ask the Prime Minister whether it is a fact that, in 1941, a government of which he was the Prime Minister refused to give permission to a Mr David A. Craig, business consultant, of Sydney, to erect an oil refinery near that city? Did the Tariff Board make a report on the application and, if so, what was the nature of its finding? Did Mr Craig inquire whether the government of the clay supported the claim of the Shell Company of Australia Limited that no outsider should be allowed to enter into competition with the cartel companies in the establishment of refineries? If 30, what was the reply given to him? carry those details in my mind because 1 understand that the question relates to something that happened, or is alleged to have happened, nine years ago.

There is a constitutional limit to the authority to the Commonwealth Parliament in this connection, with which the honourable member is no doubt familiar. The primary producers in certain industries, such as the banana industry, have it within their power to establish co-operatives. Also, under State marketing legislation, compulsory pools may be established for primary products to enable producers to get what they consider to be fair and necessary prices. I am sure that if the banana-growers, or any other producers in primary industry, felt that they were in the position that the honourable member has described they would avail themselves of the opportunities of the State legislation to which I have referred. Debate resumed from the 22nd February (vide page 30), on motion by That the following Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General lie agreed to:MAY We, the House of Eepresentatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for thc Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. the Opposition) [3.34] -First, I shall refer briefly to the honourable member for Corio( Mr Opperman) and the honourable member for Riverina( Mr to be exclusively for the information of Roberton), the new members who proposed and seconded the Address-in-Reply. I congratulate the honourable member for Corio on tbe modesty with which he delivered his first speech in this House. The honourable member for Riverina sounded a little dogmatic in his statements upon a very controversial subject. I sball leave it to the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) to deal with that matter. Both honourable members said that Australia might hope to have a visit from human cousumption is being Their Majesties the King and Queen and the Princess Margaret during 1952. Most honourable members know that an invitation to Their Majesties to visit Australia was extended by both the New Zealand Government and the previous Australian Government, and that an itinerary had been arranged. Unfortunately, the illness of His Majesty prevented fulfilment of the arrangements. I join with the honourable member for Corio and the honourable member for Riverina in expressing the hope that it will be possible for the visit to be made in 1952. It may be necessary to limit drastically the heavy programmes that were submitted by the States on the last occasion. I know that there is great anxiety on the part of the States and public bodies to welcome Their Majesties. In the Speech delivered by His Excellency only a limited amount of information could be supplied. Otherwise, the delivery of such speeches would occupy too much time. The Speech delivered yesterday, however, was a little more vague and hazy than most of its predecessors. Because there are many new members in the House, I shall deal briefly with some.of the matters that are mentioned in it. The Government proposes to set up a standing committee on IT PLEASE YOTJR EXCELLENCY: foreign affairs. The Opposition will be prepared to examine that proposal on its merits. If the committee is to be given more than merely stereotyped accounts of what is transpiring in relation to foreign affairs, it may serve a useful purpose. I know that there is great difficulty in deciding what access shall be given to reports of a secret or semi-secret nature that are received by the Government. Some of the reports are intended the Prime Minister or the Minister for External Affairs. Unless the committee is given a wide range of information it will not be able to serve a useful purpose. I do not condemn the proposal, but merely say that if it offers to honourable members on this side of the House, particularly those who are keenly interested in foreign affairs, opportunities to gain further",23,Primary Production

92,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Leade r ofenlightenment, we shall be prepared to examine it on its merits. There has been a great deal of shouting about Communists, subversive activities and the like. Some wild and violent statements have been made by the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden), who has even gone to the length of proposing that persons who might be Communists or have Communist affiliations should be deported. The Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) also has had some very strong things to say. Therefore, I was amazed at the vagueness of His Excellency's Speech on this particular subject. Not much indication of policy has been given. Statements have appeared in the press, but I gathered, from answers to questions given to-day by the Minister for External Affairs tihat the press is not a reliable source of information. Apparently that honourable gentleman now shares the view which I , in common with many other persons, have held for some time, that a great deal of reliance cannot be placed on most press reports. It is apparent that, improving the economic conditions of the the Minister for External Affairs now shares the view held by myself and others that it is impossible to place a great deal of reliance on press reportsor on most of them, at any rate. I quote the following from the Governor General's Speech:My advisers intend taking strong measures ment was made many years ago by Mr to protect the community against the activiPandit Nehru, the present Prime Ministies ot subversive organizations and indiviter of India. I am pleased to have disduals, and in particular they have in mind thc Communist party and its members. The Speech then goes on to say that legislation will be introduced to deal with subversive activities. I remember hearing the Minister for Transport ( Mr people. I have studied the statements Beale) say with an air whicli would lead one to conclude that he had just stepped out of the pages of one of Dickens's books, that communism could be dealt with under existing legislation. I think the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) said the same thing. I can still hear echoing in my ears some reference by him to section 31 (/) of some act. I assumed from what Ministers said when' they were in Opposition that there was ample provision in existing legislation to deal with subversive activities. As honourable members know, certain persons were prosecuted for seditious statements, and, indeed, some were convicted. The Speech of the Governor General gives no indication of what the Government really proposes to do about communism, but. we can assume that some consideration has been .given to the matter. There is an old Chinese adage which says, "" Soup is never taken as hot as it is cooked "". The Government's present attitude towards communism seems to be an apt illustration of the truth of that adage. There is no need for me to labour the point further. We of the Labour party believe that communism cannot be destroyed by legislation, or by administrative action. I propose to recall something said on this subject by the Minister of External Affairs in Colombo, or somewhere in the East. Again my authority is only a press report, no doubt a quite unreliable one, and I apologize to the Minister if the report is incorrect. However, he was reported as having said that only by people was it possible to stay the spread of communism in the East. That had been said many times before. It was said by my colleague, the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt). I think I myself have made the remark a number of times. The same statecovered a convert to the creed that the only way to cure communism-for , indeed, it is already a disease-is to improve the economic conditions of the of the leaders of governments in Western Europe on this subject. I myself have heard the Prime Minister of India state his opinion. Whether we agree with Mr Nehru or not, it cannot be denied that he is to-day the most powerful and influential figure in the whole of Asia, and he has made it clear for yearseven, I think, when he was in gaol-that the only way to cure disaffection and discontent is to improve the conditions of the people. That is as true to-day as it was then. The same opinion has been expressed by many of the great statesmen of Europe. No Western European government has banned communism. It has not been banned in the United Kingdom, the home of liberty, nor in New Zealand, although some action has been taken in Canada. During the election campaign, we made it clear that we regarded the banning of the Communist party as completely futile. I have always believed that this subject was very wisely dealt with in a statement which is reported in Hansard for the 15th May, 1947. I have never read a more clearly expressed opinion on the subject. I quote as follows:Or.c reason why I have repeatedly expressed statements I accept its repudiation, be the view that those people should be dealt with in the open is that I have complete confidence in the basic sanity of our own people. If we deal with these people openly we shall defeat them; but we cannot deal wit h them openly unless their operations are known, unless tliey themselves are known. I do not think that I could wish to add one word to that statement which, by the way, was made by the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). I ask honourable members, and particularly the Treasurer, who really let his hair down when discussing the subject, to study the statement by the Prime However much I differ from him on some matters, and however much he may be compelled to do certain things because of political expediency, I believe that the Prime Minister is a Hberal with a small "" 1"". Unfortunately, he is officially a Liberal with a big "" L"". Of course, it is passible to bring in legislation directed against radicals or Communists, or people on the left with whom you disagree. If you are a bit of a Eascist yourself, you regard those on the left as Communists. We have no more sympathy with the Communists who oppose us than we have with the Fascists who support the Government-and there are many of those. It is not always possible to keep one's skirts clean. There are Communists who oppose us, and then attempt later on to cling to the Labour movement. As I have said, I do not know what legislation the Government proposes to introduce. It may be something in the nature of a political gesture, but I am certain that if the purpose be really to prevent the spread of communism, its introduction will be a waste of time. We shall study the legislation when it is introduced, and comment Ur. Ohifley. on it then. I shall do no more now than make this general statement of my opinions. I was interested to hear the reference in the Governor General's Speech to the dollar position. His Excellency said it was not possible to deal with the dollar position in isolation, without reference to the rest of the sterling area. I think I have been saying that for a long time past.. On this point, I have seen some statements in the press purporting to set forth the Government's attitude on the matter. Of course, if the Government repudiates those cause I have not found press reports to be very reliable. However, for this particular statement there appears to be some authority, because it is supported by statements broadcast by the Prime Minister himself about petrol rationing. In this connection, I wish to make clear that I have studiously refrained from trying to obtain information from my friends in England or anywhere else on any matter touching Government policy. I do not think that it would be playing the game to do so. I have many friends in England, Minister. but I have not asked them for information, and had I done so they might not have thought that it would be lionorable to give it to me. I understood from the speech of the Prime Minister that the British Government did disagree with the views of the Australian Government. I have seen it stated in the press that Sir Stafford Cripps and Mr Attlee had said to the Australian Government that it should not spend more dollars on petrol. When I was Treasurer I did not suspect that Mr Attlee, Sir Kingsley Wood, Sir John Anderson, Dr. Hugh Dalton, or Sir Stafford Cripps ever dreamed of saying anything like that. I am sure that they did not do so. They always believed that the countries that were using British dollars to make up their own dollar deficits should decide how the dollars allocated to them should be expended. What they were concerned about was the overall expenditure of dollars. I am glad to see that admission in the Governor General's Speech because it confirms what I have said so often in this House on other occasions. I have always maintained that no government, irrespective of its political colour, could carry on without serious disruption of its economy while the dollar crisis lasted. I understand, again from the press, that the dollar position has not greatly improved. Unless the Government can obtain from the British Treasury more dollars than Australia is able to earn, our economy must continue to be seriously disturbed. It is of no use merely to indulge in idle words. There is a reference in the Governor General's Speech to co-operation. Idle words are poor things when we want to help people and to preserve their goodwill. When we talk about co-operation we must be prepared to extend it to others. I surmise that when the Government looked into this matter of sterling petrol, which the Treasurer is to produce from here and therelie mostly found it was not either here or there-it learned that its purchase would involve the expenditure of additional dollars, and that until we could earn as much as we expended in dollars we should have to draw on the depleted British dollar reserves. -Something was said by His Excellency about the necessity for providing an ample supply of petrol for transport purposes. Let me say in passing that during my term of office not one bushel of wheat or one pound of agricultural produce was left on the farms as the result of the shortage of petrol. The people know that that is so, just as they know that the only time when there was difficulty about petrol supplies was when petrol was unrationed. EecentlyI took the opportunity to travel through some of our country districts in order to ascertain how the wheat harvest was being shifted and how cement was being transported from the factories to the users. I found that no essential services were held up because of the shortage of petrol. Those who were short of petrol were those who in a period of grave difficulties I should regard as non-essential users. It is all very well to talk about helping the British Government and the British people. That help can be given by actions and not by words. It certainly cannot be given by idle words or by promises recklessly made. As all honourable members are aware, I have been greatly troubled by the grave economic difficulties that face the British Government and the British people. They are by no means yet out of the wood. A long hard road lies ahead of them. Nobody at the moment can foresee the solution of the dollar problem. Certainly nobody can yet see any light at the end of the tunnel. I have always thought that it was not very good policy to do anything which mightin any way embarrass Great Britain, our best friend and greatest ally, when that country is battling to rehabilitate itself and remains in dire straits because of tlie dollar problem. During the eight and a half years in which I was Treasurer of this country my relations with the British Chancellors of the Exchequer were of the most friendly character. I should be very greatly disturbed if I were to hear that our good relations with the Britisli Treasury had been disturbed by reckless promises made on the basis that ample sterling petrol is available to us and that most of the petrol we use has to be paid for in sterling. An investigation of the situation will prove that basis to be completely wrong. The next matter that I wish to discuss is the statement that the Government intends to put more value into the Australia f l . I shall be very interested to see how that task is essayed. I am not one of those who do not realize that the present inflationary spiral represents a very grave problem. Every government, whether it be a Labour government or a Liberal-Country party government, must be disturbed by it. I do not pretend for one moment that a government, whatever may be its political colour, should be able to find an easy solution of it. No one knows better than I do the extraordinary difficulties that it presents. Those who say recklessly that they will bring value back into the f l , and lead the electors to believe that it can be done quickly and reasonably easily, are merely deceiving the people. Some of the supporters of the Liberal party-the press which wants to get its requirements of newsprint a little cheaper than it does at present-ar e aware that the appreciation of the Australian Â£ 1 presents a very thorny problem for the Government. The Government will find it hard to pacify the king-makers, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Melbourne Herald and other newspapers which have rendered it many favours by printing so many lies, mis-statements and distortions of the truth on its behalf. I understand that a broadcast statement in relation to the appreciation of the f l was made this week by a former very distinguished member of this Parliament, Sir Walter Massy-Greene. I have read a copy of his statement. It contained some truths that could well be studied by those people who talk about the appreciation of the f 1. I have observed that it was not given much publicity in the press which favours the appreciation of the f l . Sir Walter Massy-Greene pointed out that in hie opinion the appreciation of the f 1 would be economic folly. but not for economic reasons, I should like to see the Government try to appreciate the f l . The previous Government made its decision to depreciate the f l for economic reasons. know of no economic reasons that would warrant its appreciation at the present time. I realize that one may argue the pros and cons of this matter, but thinking of the good of the country and balancing the advantages against the disadvantages, I consider that there is no warrant for appreciating the value of the Australian f l at the present time. However, that is a problem which the Liberal party, the Australian Country party, and their supporters, the big newspapers, may argue among themselves. I note in the Governor General's speech a reference to the intention of the Government to repeal the Banking Act 1947. As I understand the position, that legislation has been killed by the decision of the Privy Council in relation to it. legal implications of that because the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) may examine that aspect. However, there may be a few provisions of the Banking Act that should be preserved in the interests of the community. It may be only a matter of removing a dead horse from the field of play, but if any of the remaining provisions of the act are, in our opinion, of real value to the community, we on this Mr Chifley. side of the House will fight to retain tliem. His Excellency also forecast the introduction of legislation to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945-1948 by providing for the establishment, under the control of the Parliament, of a board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank, of which the Governor of the bank will be the chairman. The amending legislation, has not been introduced, and I do not propose to anticipate its provisions. Perhaps the Government will appoint to the Bank Board a number of prominent public servants and economists who have no interest in private enterprise. There is already in existence an advisory council which tenders advice to the Government on various financial matters. I For political have only to say that if the Government proposes to appoint to the CommonwealthBank Board representatives of outsideinterests, as was done in the old days, the Labour party will oppose the legislation, I l n the past, some persons were appointed to the board because they had certain social or business affiliations. If the Government intends to appoint such a board as that to take charge of the financial affairs of the country, it may rest assured that it will have the full opposition of the Labour party. We do not intend to allow, without a struggle, the people of this country to be placed in thraldom to a bank board, as they were in 1928-29. I do not suggest that the Commonwealth Bank Board at that time could haveprevented the financial and economicdepression that occurred in Australiaindeed, it could not have done F.Obut it could have alleviated the effects by perhaps 75 per cent. A few days ago^ I read a statement to the effect that as a result of the depression Australia has 50,000 fewer children of working age at the present time than it normally would I shall not deal with the have had. The explanation is that, during judgment, the depression in the early 1930's, people could not afford to have children. A great deal of the responsibility for that situation may be laid at the door of those who then directed financial policy, including people who were not elected to the Commonwealth Bank Board by the general public or even by this Parliament,, but were appointed hy the government of the day. Why some of thosepersons were ;;ppointed to tlie board, I do not know. .! can only surmise that they were very pleasant fellows at cocktail parties and similar functions. The point that I desire to make is that most of them were definitely associated with private enterprise, and their business was to restrict the operations of the Commonwealth Bank. That institution, I remind the House, expanded greatly while the LabomGovernment was in office. Ths mortgage bank department and the finance department of the Commonwealth Hank have ""cut the tripe"" out of hire purchase operators, and have been of great benefit to the man on the land. I note with some amusement that the Governor General's Speech contains the following words in reference to the proposal to re-appoint the Commonwealth Bank Board:It will also bu provided that any policy issues which are the subject of this agreement between the Government and the Bank Board shall be referred to Parliament. If I . did not have some knowledge of parliamentary procedure, I might accept that statement quite seriously. In theory, the proposal to refer to the Parliament the subject of any disagreement between the Government and"" the Bank Board may be satisfactory, but, in practice, it is complete bunkum. Although the Governor of tbe bank may be appointed chairman of the board, the other directors will be able to override his opinions at will. When the Bank Board was in existence, the Governor was not given even a voice in determining the policy of the Commonwealth Bank. On some occasions he was not asked to express his opinions about various proposals. Eveni f he is chairman of the board, his views may be swamped by the opinions of the other directors. The statement is made very loosely that a "" subject of disagreement between the Government and the Bank Board shall be referred to Parliament"", which may resolve the dispute. Of course, that is utter nonsense. The Treasurer and the Government are the authorities who should decide the economic policy of the country, not private individuals who are dragged in from outside industry. Many of them may be excellent citizens personally, and I do not make any suggestion of dishonesty in reference to them. Some of them, at least were misguided, and did not know anything about the job that they were appointed to do. I do not desire to labour that point. I merely say that the Labour parity will oppose any attempt to re-appoint the kind of board that I have described, and when I say "" oppose "", I mean "" oppose "". [Extension of time granted.] I thank the Prime Minister and the House for their courtesy in allowing me to continue my remarks. The time that is allotted to me to review the many matters in the Governor General's Speech is rather short. His Excellency also statedMy advisors believe there is a pressing need not only for reducing the burden of taxation but also for simplification of the various taxing' acts, and an expert committee has been appointed to examine the report upon the issues involved. The views that are expressed by financial editors and by some politicians about the simplification of taxation arean unfailing source of amusement to me. People in nearly every country have been endeavouring for a long time to simplify taxation, but none of them have succeeded in doing so. The Bruce-Page Governmeut appointed a royal commission, of which Mr Justice Ferguson was chairman, and an eminent accountant, Mr E. V. Nixon, was a member, to examine and report upon the taxation system in Australia, but the majority of their recommendations did not produce simplification. I know some of the members of the expert committee that has been appointed to examine and report upon the simplification of the various taxing acts. At this point, I desire to make it perfectly clear that I have the highest regard for those gentlemen personally, and for their professional ability. Mr Gunn, one of the members of the expert committee, has written a book on taxation and I think that he used the nom-de-plume, Ned Kelly. He has set out to show how the payment of taxes has been or can be evaded in this country, and the information that he gives should be most useful. Mr Gunn is a very fine man. Many of us have worked with Mr Eric Spooner, a former member of this House, and we know his ability. I know Mr Turner very well, particularly in his official capacity. Mr Hannan is undoubtedly most capable. But almost without exception, the members of the expert committee are accountants who are concerned with tlie interests of big business. I -emphasize that point. I state again that all of them are very able men, and I am not making the slightest personal reflection upon any of them, but I point out that four of the six experts are interested in big business. Another member of the committee is the ""Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in New South Wales, Mr Hughes. His qualifications are high, and I have had an opportunity to appreciate his ability. But, largely, thc members of the expert committee are the representatives of vested interests in this country, and, therefore, one would naturally look with some suspicion on any findings that they might make on taxation. Again, I state clearly that I do not make any suggestion of dishonesty against any of those gentlemen. Years ago, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer had an opportunity to simplify taxation. I expect they will claim that the Labour Government, in the course of eight years' administration, succeeded in complicating the taxation law. taxation existed when the right honourable gentleman was in office. to the advisory council on taxation. I have paid-a tribute to the professional ability of the members of that body. I have only stated that they are largely representatives of big business. When I refer to child endowment, I realize that I may easily trespass on sacred ground. The Labour party wil! not oppose the Government's legislation to provide endowment of 5s. a week for the first or only child under sixteen years of age in every family. However, there is one matter that I desire to make perfectly clear. I am not able to go deeply into this subject, because it may be sub judice. During the election campaign, the Prime Minister announced that if the Liberal party were returned to office, it would provide endowment of 5s. a week for the first or only child under sixteen years of age. I understand that throughout the Commonwealth there are between 400,000 and 450,000 families with only one child, and approximately 600,000 families with more than one child. After the right honourable gentleman had made that announcement, the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration adjourned the hearing of the basic wage case, and, therefore, the only inference that I could draw was that the court at least proposed to take into account the endowment of os. a week for the first child under sixteen years of age, when determining the basic wage. If that is so, every adult worker under federal awards, every worker under State awards which adopt federal awards, as has been done in New South Wales and elsewhere, and all females working on a percentage of the male rate will receive a lower basic wage than they would get if endowment were not paid in respect of the first child. Of course, I cannot anticipate the decision of the Arbitration Court, but I emphasize that the court adjourned immediately the Prime Minister made his announcement. The implication is that the court proposes to take that payment into account when it determines the basic wage. I do not say that the basic wage will be lower; the court may decide to raise it. AllI am saying is that it should be understood clearly that it will mean, in my opinion, a lesser basic wage for all those workers whom I have mentioned. His Excellency has forecast "" an effective programme in relation to health"". Apparently the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) has talked about the matter, but, according to press reports, he has not talked to the right people. He has announced his intention to confer with State Ministers for Health, but when I saw two of them a few days ago, they had not, at that stage, been in consultation with the right honourable gentleman. The Prime Minister has said that the matter has never been considered by Cabinet; yet all sorts of proposals are supposed to be floating around amongst chemists and doctors. matter had not been discussed in Cabinet.

I believe that to be true, because I have been out of this Parliament for the last ten years almost to the day. You were good enough to mention lately, Mr Speaker, particularly for the benefit of completely new members of the House, the privilege that they might be expected to enjoy in their maiden speeches. That leaves me in somewhat of a quandary as to whether I should regard myself as a new member, or as a new old member. I expect that, a3 I go along, I shall discover to what degree the traditional benevolence of the House is to be extended to me. If I may regard myself as a not completely new meniber, perhaps I may be allowed, with great respect, to give my very hearty congratulations to the honourable member for Corio( Mr Opperman) and the honourable member for Biverina( Mr Eoberton), who moved and. seconded the adoption of the Address-in-Beply.

It seems to me to be very clear-cut, specific and far-reaching. It saysMy advisors intend taking strong measures to protect the community against the activities of subversive organizations and individuals, and in particular they have in mind the Communist party and its members. A bill will be introduced early in the Parliament to deal with this matter. I consider that, in four lines, His Excellency could not have dealt more specifically and more committedly with a matter of that sort. After all, the Governor General's Speech is not a second-reading speech on all the manifold matters with which it deals. It must deal briefly and succinctly with matters which the Government intends to. deal with in greater detail. I expect that legislation",30,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

105,Mr Casey (La Trobe,"Minister fordealing with communism will be before the House in a relatively short time, and I believe that any fear that we may not be sufficiently strongrminded in our views on communism will be laid at rest when honourable members see what it contains. The right honourable gentleman quoted a Chinese proverb which I have noted for future use and of which I had not previously been aware: "" Soup is never taken as hot as it is cooked"". The inference was that during the general election campaign the Prime Minister( Mr of the rate of exchange of the Australian Menzies) and honourable members who siipport him spoke emphatically on the Communist problem but that the action we are about to take will not be nearly so strong. I think that that will be answered when honourable members see the bill on this subject whicli will come down to this House very soon. I do not think they will be able to complain that it is lukewarm. I shall try to match the right lionorable gentleman's proverb Avith another AvhichI believe is Brazilian. It is this: "" You can't Avhistle and suck an orange at the same time"". In the last month or two, Ave have been trying, as a Cabinet, to deal rapidly and effectively with a great many subjects, of which communism is one. While sucking those oranges Ave have not, perhaps, been, able to Avhistle sufficiently to satisfy the Leader' gentleman ground for saying what he of the Opposition. The right bonorable gentleman claimed that communism could be cured only by improving economic conditions. I venture to disagree with him. I believe that to be true in the overcrowded countries of the old Avorld where there are distress, poverty and slums on a grand scale; but I should like the right honourable gentleman to say Avhether he considers that the unexampled growth of communism in Australia in the last four or five years has been due to poor economic conditions in this country. I do not believe that it has been. Nobody would claim that economic conditions in Australia are perfect; but I Avould not believe any one who said that the tremendous groAvth of communism during the right honourable gentleman's period of administration had been caused by distress in the community.. been a sharp decline in the membership of the Communist party. Mr Casey. munism cannot be gauged by the membership of the Communist party. I endeavoured to follow what the right honourable gentleman said.about the depreciation of the f l and putting more value back into the f 1. It seems to me that he became a little confused; at any rate, I became confused while listening to him as between putting more value into or appreciating the value of the Australian Â£1 within Australia, and the appreciation Â£1 vis-a-vis the Â£1 sterling. The appreciation of the Â£1 within Australia, as Ave have heard from the Prime Minister, is to be one of the principal matters towards which the Government will direct its attention. So far a3 I know, there has been no proposition in regard to appreciation of the exchange rate of the Australian Â£1 in relation to the Â£1 sterling. The right honourable gentleman cited a speech in Avhich, according to the newspaper report of it, Sir Walter MassyGreene opposed any appreciation of the Australian Â£1. I read the report of that speech. I know of nobody on the Government side of the House or elsewhere Avho has raised this subject so positively as to give the right honourable said, in an apparent attempt to pin on our side some desire to alter the relationship of the Australian Â£1 with -the Â£1 sterling. AllI shall say about the proposal to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act is that the right honourable gentleman will get the shock of his life Avhen the bill is brought down in a relatively short space of time. The right honourable gentleman went on to say that one cannot simplify taxation. WbenI Avas Treasurer of the Commonwealth, in the middle 1930's, a commission investigated the subject and I believe that we simplified the taxation law to a very considerable degree. Nearly fifteen years have since elapsed. Everybody knows that an Income Tax Assessment Act becomes out of date fairly rapidly. People find loopholes in it and Avays of circumventing it. Also, the economy of the community becomes more complicated. Further provisions have to be cobbled into the existing act and, after ten years or.",31,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

107,Mr Casey,"The growth of comat the most, fifteen years, it is more comof the population by about 200,000 indiplicated than it had been hitherto. I think it has been the experience of every government that in the course of every ten, fifteen or twenty years the Income Tax Assessment Act has to be overhauled and simplified. ""We have done it twice before and now we are to do it a third time. I have no doubt that we shall simplify the act and that it will last for a. further ten years, when the job will have to be done again, by, I expect, a future Liberal party and Australian Country party government. I believe that members of the Opposition are in some disagreement among themselves in the matter of child endowment for the first child. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) dealt with this matter in his usual very forceful and conclusive way in 1941, when child endowment was first introduced by the Menzies Government. He went to great lengths then to explain most lucidly that the Arbitration Court no longer fixed the basic wage by reference to the needs of the basic wage worker and his family, but considered the national income and what industry could afford to pay. Within the limitations of the time at my disposal, I propose to deal with a number of matters mentioned in the Governor General's Speech with which I am either currently or prospectively concerned in my ministerial capacity. I need not remind honourable members that the circumstances of Australia have changed tremendously during the last ten years. Without discussing the broad facts, which are familiar to all of us, it is clear that Australia's circumstances to-day demand that we achieve a large, rapid, and annually consistent increase of our population. We all know very well the reason for that. In turn, this necessity makes it essential for us to effect a similar large, rapid and consistent acceleration of the rate at which we expose, develop and use the nation's natural resources and exploit our industries. We must employ our resources to the full if we are to accommodate adequately and provide good means of livelihood for the annually increasing number of citizens for which we are planning. As honourable members know, the Government is planning for an annual increase L3] viduals by means of immigration. That figure, together with the natural annual increase of nearly 50,000, envisages an expansion of the population by 250,000 souls each year. In other words, we shall attempt to double our population within one generation. The task of welcoming and providing opportunities for earning good livings for all of those new citizens is tremendous and I have no doubt that it will strain our resources to the utmost. In fact, I am sure that we cannot achieve the programme entirely off our own bat and from our own resources. We must have the active assistance of the only two countries that can help us in this workour Mother Country, Great Britain, and our great friendly neighbour, the TJnited States of America. The magnitude of the problem that confronts us can be gauged from one simple figure. Our oificers calculate that, in order to provide for the increase of 250,000 souls annually that we contemplate, we must have a rate of public and private investment in Australia of approximately Â£200,000,000 annually, a rate that we have never achieved yet or even begun to achieve. That would be a vast amount of money for any country, and particularly for one that is still in the developmental stage, to find from its own resources. Indeed, I do not believe for a moment that we could find so much money in Australia. But we need something more than money and men; we also need the "" know-how "" of the experts in the older countries and of many of the world-wide companies, which can bring to the aid of our economy the most modern developments in equipment and industrial practice. Help of that sort can be obtained in any important measure only from Great Britain and the TJnited States of America. The figure of Â£200,000,000 annually that I have mentioned includes the money that must be expended to provide houses, and the water, gas, electricity, sewerage, roads and other public services that will be demanded by the increasing population, together with schools and public buildings of every sort. In addition, we shall need great investments in hoth primary and secondary industries, mining and other activities. For investments of that character, we can look only to Great Britain and the TJnited States of tion project under which we must provide America, and, in order to obtain from reasonable basic amenities in areas where them the rate of investment required to such amenities do not now exist. "" The supplement our own savings, we must drift from the country to the cities "" has gain, if we do not already command it, become a truism on the lips of everybody, and maintain the confidence of the people and I believe that we all know the causes of those two countries. We must imbue of that drift. In the minds of a very them with confidence in our aims and large number of people, life is not nearly faith in the future of Australia. If we so agreeable in the country as it is in the have their confidence, and there is some great capital cities.

A tremendous task lies ahead and unless we succeed to a reasonably high degree the possibility of Australia remaining an independent British country indefinitely will be limited. This matter has therefore been placed high on the Government's programme. I welcome the absence of party politics from it. A programme of national development must necessarily be of such a nature as to be above such considerations. The only feature that could justifiably come within the ambit of criticism on party political lines is the detail of how the programme should be carried out. I am convinced that probably no section of the community, with the possible exception of the Communist party, is apposed to the proposed programme. Our objective is to make this country year by year a more important unit among the English-speaking countries of the world. Sitting suspended from ^.55 to 8 p.m. Cameron) I desire to call the attention of the House to Standing Order 52, which was disregarded this afternoon by honourable members on the front Government benches, and those on the front Opposition benches, as well as by other honourable members. There are four matters of very real concern to the people of Australia, to which this Parliament must address itself immediately. They are of the most vital importance. Tbey are, first, the cost of living; second, housing; third, social services; and, fourth, full employment. It is not too much to say that the cost of living is rising alarmingly, and that it has risen very greatly since this new Government took office. In response to that observation I hear the vacant laughter of fools. If honourable members opposite had to live, as do the working women and working men of this country, on something near the basic wage they would know that what I say is true. The cost of living has risen 10 per cent, at least doing so. The Government is here to since this Government assumed office. Not only has the Government failed to put more value into the Â£ 1 ; it has actually allowed more value to be drained out of the Â£1. That remark applies to the Â£1 the people earn as well as the Â£1 they have saved. There are, apparently, a few shell-backed tories who have not yet realized that eggs are costing at least 3?., and sometimes 3s. 6d. a dozen; that the price of lamb chops is 2s. per lb., or about 6d. each; and that the price of pork is 3s. per lb. How anybody can be expected to live under those conditions is one of the mysteries that will have to be solved, and it might be solved through industrial disturbances in this country very soon. You know something about the Scriptures, Mr Speaker. At least, you have created the impression that you do. Therefore, you must know that somewhere in the Scriptures tliere is a statement to the effect that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God. That does not hold out much hope for honourable members on your right. However, if it is almost impossible for a rich man to get into Heaven, it is certain that, since the (Hon. Archie Menzies Government came into power, in Australia, it is almost impossible for a poor man to remain on earth-and the position is getting worse. Mr .SPENDEB -What is the honourable member doing here, then? sently with the activities of the new Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender), with his new-found friend, the Japanese collaborationist, Dr. Soekarno. The new Government that occupies the treasury bench, the Menzies Fadden caretaker Government, came into power by promising the people that it would put value back into the Â£1. I have before me one of its propaganda sheets, paid for by the banks, of course. You do not attend party meetings, Mr Speaker, but you are probably cognizant of that fact. "" This is what we offer you "", say the forces of reaction. "" Lower prices . . . Â£l's worth for every Â£1 you spend "". The Government has not put any value back into the Â£1, and it is not concerned with serve the interests of wealthy classes, of whom Ministers are the political stooges.

131,Mr Calwell,"I shall deal prethe people. He uses his ability to pretend that he is something he is not. The people of this country expect their money to buy full value in goods. If they do not get full value for their Â£1, if they cut no costs. It only fooled the people see their children denied those things which are essential to their well-being, if be that devaluation has accounted for they have to go on paying 5d. for a peach and 8d. for an apple, if they have to go on paying exorbitant prices for everything they need, they will raise their voices in protest. We on this side of the House will lead their protest in this place, on the street-corners and in public places, wherever demands are made for better conditions, or for something equivalent to the conditions which obtained under the last Government. We should be failing in our duty as Australian democrats if we did not lead the people, and galvanize opinion in such a way that ultimately it will destroy this Government, and destroy it sooner than many expect.

The Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) can be depended upon to kill anything. He killed a former Menzies Government by intrigue when its leader was away in England, and he then killed his own government by incompetence within 40 days of its taking oflice. He should be the last one to talk about funerals or deaths. Members of the Government cannot run away from the fact that they promised the community that they would put value back into the Â£1. I have here a copy of the newspaper published by my friend, Keith Murdoch, on the l l t h November, the date Ned Kelly was hanged. ought to remember that. the Minister for External Affairs will share his fate. In this so-called organ of opinion we were told on the l l t h -W last that the policy launched by the then Leader of the Opposition, the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies), was a "" cut-living-costs policy"". Actually, this Government has when it said that it would do so. It may some of the increased cost of living, but it is much more likely that the rapacity and greed of the wealthy classes are now finding expression in a more helpful atmosphere than previously existed, and that those classes are now taking it out of the people. The right honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Casey) has made his re-appearance in this House. We do not know whether he is a new Australian or an old Australian, but we do know that he walked out on Australia on three occasions, and it will not be long before he is voted out of the Parliament for failing to give effect to what he said about his affection and concern for the people of this country.

As an honourable member has just interjected, it will be something to its credit if f l since the Menzies Government took it does. But the age of mirades is nearly past. Certainly the workers of Australia are not going to be fooled by the flapdoodle and nonsense that has been talked about, co-operation between the workers and the employers of this country^ The workers of Australia will give this new Government as much co-operation as the British Medical Association gave the Chifley Government. Why do the workers distrust this Government? We do not need to tell them to distrust it. They know that the right honourable member for La Trobe was Treasurer of the Australian Government during the economic depression and asked the workers to live on starvation rates of pay. He told them to pull their belts in. Honourable members interjecting, the democracy of Australia through these them an increase of 5s. in the preliminary microphones to-night.

I quote the following passage from the Governor General's Speech:My Government realizes tliat the increase in the cost of living is accentuating the difficulties with which age and widow pensioners, in particular have to contend. The Government leaves it at that. Age pensioners can manage as best they can on the reduced purchasing power of their office. If they cannot manage, that is just too bad for thern. There is nothing in Ihe Governor General's Speech which gives them the faintest ray of hope that pensions will be increased. But the Speech does say, in relation to the Government, if this will appease them iu any way or help them to assuage tbeir hunger or thirstI t believes . . . that the application of its financial and economic policy will result in improvement in the purchasing power of the currency, so that pensioners, as well as other fixed income groups, will benefit.

Words, words, words! What consolation are they to people who are suffering from this ever-increasing spiral of inflation which will some day go through the roof, with the result that the Australian people will be faced with mass unemployment? Perhaps the right honourable member for La Trobe, having demonstrated his capacity to preside over famines, is just the man big business wants to preside over the next depression in this country. The Governor General's Speech statesMy Government will take all possible steps to stimulate the building of homes What doss that mean? It does not mean anything! If the Government would not take all possible steps it ought to resign immediately. The taking of "" all possible steps "" may mean something and it may mean nothing. The cost of living, the provision of homes, and the expansion of social services are far more important tp this country than the foreign policy of this Government or any other policy that it might devise.

152,Mr Calwell,"I assure you, MrMinister for Health( Sir Earle Page) has made three or four attempts to reach agreement with the doctors, the chemists and the friendly societies, but all that he has got up to date is a blank page. He has done nothing yet except to say that if one is half dead one will have the choice of 40 odd drugs, and that if one is nearly dead he will throw in a few more. He is not the Minister for Health; he is the minister for disease. What this couutry wants is a national health scheme something like the scheme we tried to bring into force with the assistance of the medical profession. I used to hear talk about the watersiders "" bailing up "" on the Dutch in New Guinea. I have not heard yet from the Government side about the doctors "" bailing up "" on this Government. I wager that we shall not hear any more about the Government's medical scheme during this session of the Parliament. Indeed we may never hear any more about it at all. That reminds me that the Labour Government in Great Britain brought down a very good health scheme which operated very efficiently and gave general satisfaction. A noted English doctor, the Bight Honourable Lord WebbJohnson, KC.V.O., CBE., D.S.O., F.B.C.S., who is the president of the Royal College of Surgeons, recently had something to say about it. He visited Montreal, Canada, a little while back. The newspaper reporters there asked him a lot of questions because they had been concerned about the "" family doctor"" propaganda that had been spread around Canada. They asked himWhat do you think of the socialized medical services in England, my Lord? Lord Webb-Jtohnson's exact words in reply wereSocialization of medical services is a laudbut we plan to return to office again. able aim and objective. These parvenus opposite, none of them lords-thoug h you, Mr Speaker, may have a hope in that direction, none of them has will doubtless disagree violently with what the noble lord has said. And that reminds me that to-day in England is a very fateful day for the English people, for to-day is election day. The result of that poll will greatly affect the destinies not only of England and the British Commonwealth, but also of western civilization itself. I hope-and I think that I can speak for the democracy of this country democracy of this country tossed the honourable gentleman out of office two months ago. about a democracy is that people have the right to go wrong. In this instance they will repair the wrong that they have done when they realize the mistake they have made. I am prepared to trust democracy even if honourable members opposite are not prepared to do so. I know that the democracy of this country hope3 that the Attlee Government will be returned to continue its splendid work of liquidating monopoly capitalism. May the England of to-morrow be an England of Aneurin Bevan and Herbert Morrison and the England of the little people, and not the England of the Churcliills and the Edens. That England-the England of class and caste and privilege-is happily passing into history. We want the people of England to survive, but there can be no hope of England surviving the onrush of European communism except under a Labour government. I trust that what we hope for for the people of England will come true. If it does, things will not be so good for the people who sit opposite to us in this Parliament and who, for the time being, have snatched an electoral victory. Maybe we did too much for too many too soon, to adapt a Churchillian phrase, but the trouble about this new Government is that it will take too long to do too little, and then only for too few-and they will be a favoured few. We were beaten at the polls and we acknowledge our defeat, We shall use all our constitutional powers to persuade the people of Australia that their destiny is safer in the hands of a government led by the right honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Chifley), the greatest Prime Minister this country has ever seen, than it would be in the hands of those who form the present coalition.

In the State from which you <come, Mr Speaker, there applies the most iniquitous form of electoral disable member for Melbourne. tribution which operates anywhere in the British Commonwealth. In the South Australian Parliament, thirteen sitting members representing city electorates represent approximately 260,000 electors, the four most strongly held Labour electorates each containing about 22,000 elecaway from a law suit. tors. These thirteen city seats representing approximately 260,000 electors are matched by 26 country seatsrepresenting only approximately 160,000 electors. Is it any wonder that the Liberal Premier of South Australia should send his economists and officials into the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to oppose the granting of any increase of the basic wage at present under consideration and to argue for its reduction ? Is it any wonder as an acknowledged Communist, trained that the Liberal governments of South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria should all send representatives to the court to oppose the application for an the Japanese Emperor for services he renincrease of the basic wage and to argue for the worsening of the conditions of the working classes who, with the working farmers, are the wealth producers of this nation?

He left this country without an idea, without even a clue to an idea of what he was to talk about. A man named Francis Stuart, of the Department of External Affairs, wrote his brief and the Minister is used to reading briefs. Out of it all came the "" Spender plan "". Following the publication of that plan, the "" Baron of Bardia"" became the "" Colossus of Colombo "". You know, Mr people. I hope that when we aretold Speaker, that the only things that are colossal about him are his nerve and the thickness of his hide. The people with whom the Minister discussed many affairs in Djakarta claim Dutch New Guinea for themselves. According to the Melbourne Sun of the 17th January, Dr. Soekarno said that Dutch New Guinea is part of thc Indonesian fatherland; and several other speakers said the same thing later. Even Dr. Usman, who is in Canberra, said, ""Dutch New Guinea belongs to us"", meaning to the Indonesians. Tlie Indonesians have no claim whatsoever to Dutch New Guinea whether on ethnical, historical or any other grounds. They have no more claim to Dutch New Guinea than they have to Siam, Colombo, or anywhere else. Any government that did not immediately indicate to the Javanese that if they intend to walk into Dutch New Guinea, we shall walk in there before them, does not deserve to last five minutes. abusing the British Government because Tbe Minister made no claim for that territory for the Dutch. The Government should at least ask the Dutch, if they cannot hold Dutch New Guinea, to surrender their sovereignty of the territory to the United Nations and then accept a trusteeship; and if the Dutch wanted to share the trusteeship with this country we should accept it. [Extension of time granted.] We can no more let tlie Indonesians into Dutch New Guinea than we can let them into Darwin, and we can no more trust an Indonesia that we have recognized under Soekarno than we could trust an Indonesia that was lead by the same Soekarno when he was a Japanese puppet premier. If we allow the Indonesians into Dutch New Guinea there will be no hope of our holding the northern portion of Australia and the fate of this country would then be sealed and certain. I hope that when the promised statement on foreign affairs is presented to the House it will be more informative and have more blood in it than the Governor General's .Speech contains. I hope that we shall be able to see from it what we are going to do with regard to Australia's responsibilities overseas and that they will not be any greater than we are prepared to assume in the interests of our own what the Government proposes to do with regard to the whole per imeter of Australia there will not be any attempt to ap peasecertain people who are living near uson the ground that they will be commonallies with us against communism. I do not think that the Asiatics care one iota^ about communism. They are not half as ; much concerned about communism as we: think they should be. And the Asiatics are not worried abcjut Japan either. I think that they feel the Japanese did a good job in the last Avar when they lowered the prestige of the white man. I do not believe that we can cooperate with such people in any matter concerning the safety of this country. The only way to ensure our safety is to make certain that our relationships with the British Government and the American Government are sound. We shall not do any good, by doing as some honourable members opposite are doing, it has no dollars for petrol for us when it has no dollars for food for its own people. I hope that the statement to be presented to the House on the Government's policy on foreign affairs will be much better than the story that has been told to date. I shall finish with a quotation from Sir Bichard Acland, a inember of the British Parliament, who recently published a book entitled Nothing left to Believe. His views epitomise my views in regard to Avhat is happening in Western civilization. He saysI t seems to me, that we are living in one of the great historical crises thrown up by the recurrent fact that the "" solution "" to the problem of yesterday turns itself into, or creates from out of itself, the problem and challenge which we have to meet to-day.

Individualism, for a l l its bright achievements, did not f u l f i l , and never could have fulfilled, the over-optiinistic promises whicli it held out to mankind; on the contrary, it has created paradoxes, tensions, unsatisfied aspirations, inequalities and titanic world forces against which some kind of revolt has been, and ie, inevitable.

Indeed, he said that the O'Keefe case was a conspiracy on the part of the Dutch against the Indonesians. During the last three years, the honourable member for Melbourne, and the Labour party, did their utmost to bring about the Eepublic of IndonesiaI am not for the moment criticizing that-but , having brought it about, it does not lie in the honourable member's mouth to criticize a Minister in the present Government if when away from Australia on an important mission he happens to call upon the President of the Indonesian Eepublic. On that aspect .alone tbe Government is supported by the previous observations and conduct of the Labour party. -say to Dr. Soekarno.? with Dr. Soekarno were conducted in decent language, and not in the kind of language that the honourable member for employs. I now desire to make a few observations about the case that the honourable member for Melbourne has sought to make. His first observation was that since the present Government took office the cost of living had risen by 10 per cent. has risen by 10 per cent., that is because of the ineptitude and bungling of the Labour Government. I shall establish that fact, too. At a period when the whole community urgently required man-power and materials, and when people were seeking honies, the Labour party embarked upon a programme of most extravagant governmental expenditure, and competed for man-power and materials. Year after year, the budget became greater, and, indeed, exceeded the peak figure in wartime. That was because the Labour Government showed no regard whatever for public finance. Competition for materials and labour was brought about by the Labour Government that pretended to represent the workers. During the election campaign, the contentions that the Labour party has advanced in this debate were rejected by the people, and the Chifley Government was defeated. who put this Government into office. nonsense that new members will hear in this House from people who were bred in the old out-worn school of politics and who use phrases such as "" boodleiers"", "" moneybags "" and all that kind of drivel.

182,"Mr Spendee,","A t the last electiontruth, is that the Labour party has let the people of this eountry down. The first cause of the increased cost of living Ls that the Labour Government engaged in extravagant expenditure. Because of governmental expenditure, there was competition for man-power and materials. That is the primary cause of the increased cost of goods and services. The second cause, about which the public is fully aware, is that when the referendum on rents and prices was defeated, the then Prime Minister, Mr Chifley, immediately suspended thc payment of subsidies which, until that time, had been keeping the co3t of living down. In a moment of pique, because the people had defeated the Government's referendum proposals, the then Prime Minister withdrew the subsidies. He decided to make the people pay for their adverse vote. They have had to pay in increased costs of goods and services. Somebody once said that when tides run out we must wait for them tp come back. The tide ran far out whilst Labour occupied the treasury bench, but it will return in full flood while we are here. draw a few crabs, too. honourable member for East Sydney( Mr the House, and to the people, that the Ward) will probably be one of them. The next subject with which I wish to deal is devaluation. If the increase of the cost of living in the last few months can 'be attributed to any one factor, it -is the devaluation of our currency by the Labour Government. I sliall not discuss the reasons for devaluation at present, but it is fair that the people of this country sbould know that ,the f u l l force of the effects of devaluation has not yet passed. Devaluation will continue to have a substantial innuence on spiralling costs for some time to come. I come now to the innuence on the cost of living of doctrines preached by the Labour party for six or seven years. Mi-. CAI-WEIX -Eight years. years too long. Labour preached the doctrine tliat the less a man works the more he is entitled to receive for his labour. So to-day, we find that bricklayers, for instance, are laying only a very limited proportion of the number of bricks that they are fairly capable of laying in a day's work. They either do not realize, or ref use to realize, that their action is increasing the cost of living and making it almost impossible for the ordinary man to own a house of his own. A serious problem now confronting the Government is that of providing houses for the people of this country at reasonable prices. Let me tell honourable members what the Government has already done in the eight weeks during which it has held office. At our first Cabinet meeting, we discussed the wheat industry. The previous Government had shelved its responsibility by refusing to grant to Australian wheat-growers an additional 5d. a bushel to which they were entitled. We decided to make that additional payment in the form of a subsidy so that there would be no consequent increase of the cost of living. We acted similarly with the dairying industry. Therefore, in eight weeks, we have done two positive things that the preceding administration refused to do. This Government is under no misapprehension about the magnitude of the task that lies Government may ahead of it. It has also inherited a legacy from the ineptitude and bungling of tlie Labour administration. I say to problems confronting the Government will be resolved within a reasonable time. Obviously they cannot he resolved in a mere three or four months. The honourable meniber for 'Melbourne asked, "" What has t'he Government done about housing?"" It ill-becomes the honourable member to talk about housing. I remind him that, three years ago, the Premier of New South Wales said that within three years, 90,000 dwellingswould be erected by the Labour Government in that .State. We find to-day, however, that, even counting garages as houses, the total is no more than 40,000. There again a. Labour promise has not been fulfilled. The reason for the existence in this country of a state of full employment during Labour's term of office in the Commonwealth sphere was not that Labour had in operation a positive policy of full employment. In fact, Labour had no policy of full employment. It simply said that it had such a policy..",45,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

185,Mr Spender,"To o long-eigh tLt had no positive programme to maintain full employment. Full employment was maintained because the high prices that we were receiving for our exports stimulated our economy. In addition, of course, there was a vast backlog of unsatisfied demands for goods in this country. These factors combined to maintain full employment. This Government has a positive policy on this matter. The Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) has already indicated that the Government's rural development plans will contribute substantially to full employment which in future will not depend solely, if at all, on the maintenance of present high prices for Australian products in the world markets, but on expanding markets. We believe, too, as we have said many times, that full employment can be attained within the framework of liberty. It is quite simple to get full was Minister for External Affairs employment by enslaving people as Russia does. Full employment can easily be provided in vast slave camps; but we on this side of politics believe-and we have been elected to office because of this to present a common front, but we who belief-that by proper planning and administration, full employment can be achieved without sacrificing the liberty of man. In the short period that we have been a Government we have already indicated what we intend to clo in respect of housing and full employment. We have shown that we intend to carry out our promises. My fourth point relates to social serThey have always taken a view opposed vices. 1 could not understand what the to that of the right honourable member for honourable member for Melbourne was Barton.

It is quite true that wages have increased, but it is equally true, as the women of this country will testify, that tin; money value of wages has declined constantly. As the honourable member for Melbourne himself has said, it is well that we should remember that a democracy has a right to express itself. The honourable member received a rude shock at the last election, but his party's failure at the polls can be attributed largely to his own buffoonery, his insatiable greed for power, and his inhuman implementation of the immigration policy of his Government. Every one on this side of the chamber knows well that there has been great bitterness between the honourable member for Melbourne ancl the right honourable member for Barton, who in the Labour Government. They have been pursuing two quite different policies ancl I venture to say that great jealousy still exists between them. They pretend sat with them in the last Parliament know that they would cut each other's throats to-morrow if they thought they could get away with it.

186,Mr Roseveab,"If we allow it.have not a majority in the Senate, but I have yet to learn that a Labour opposition can have courage. Labour oppositions have never shown courage, and I ara confident they never will. Let me give some figures on the cost of living. During the four years 1946 to 1949, when Labour was in office, the actual increase of the cost of living was 23 per cent. In 1949, still under Labour's administration, the increase was 9 per cent, from the first quarter of the year to the last quarter. Now honourable members opposite claim a 10 per cent, increase in recent months. One has only to know the facts to realize that whatever increase has occurred in the short period during which we have been in office is directly attributable to the policy pursued by the last Government. We have a task before us and I believe the people will give us a chance to discharge that task. If they do, that task will be properly discharged.

I want to draw attention to some of the activities of the ex-Minister for Immigrachange of front that these people who tion ( Mr Calwell). He made some observations about foreign affairs and calling upon the Indonesians. There has been a cleavage of views on most things between him and the right honourable member for Barton. true. The honourable member for Melbourne spoke about New Guinea. At the right time a statement will be made, but I say now that this Government is determined to see that the strategic interests of this country are properly secured. I need not say any more at the moment because, at the right time, I shall make a statement upon foreign affairs. The arguments the ex-Minister for Immigration advanced were quite opposed io those of the right honourable member for Barton who, for a long time has said, "" Let all problems be solved by the TJnited Nations"". The ex-Minister for Immigration is a great fighter; he has been fighting with his mouth for years, but that is about all. When he has to go out and fight in any other way, he fights like the Duke of Plaza tor o-leadin g his forces from behind. fire of interjections coming from the front Opposition bench.

I draw attention to the fact that the creation and existence due to the policy pursued by the Minister for External Affairs in the previous Government. New Guinea was placed under trusteeship by that Government. Yet these are the people who point to danger in New Guinea in both the Australian areas and the Dutch and pretend they are the great defenders of Australia! It is not long since the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) said, "" If there is to be any fighting for New Guinea somebody else can do it "" . He would not fire a shot in its defence. It is a strange were prepared to throw New Guinea away now talk about the need to defend that area. The truth of the matter is that the foreign policy pursued by the previous Government has brought this country to a dangerous strategic condition.

The honourable gentleman has, by his inhuman acts and his stupid bungling, destroyed the goodwill in which this country has been held by the Asiatic peoples. He has driven some Asiatics with Australian wives and children forth from this country unnecessarily. All that I have to say is that if the administration of any law results in the law of God being destroyed, that is bad administration. If the administration of a law breaks up families, then such administrative acts cannot be supported. The White Australia policy was not originated by persons on the side of politics to which the honourable member for Melbourne belongs. It was established by our side of politics and has been to this debate, it has occurred to me that successfully administered by our side of politics for over 30 years. The honourable gentleman has, by his bungling, created hostility to Australia among the Asiatic peoples. has been caused not by any objections to the White Australia policy, the objects of which are clearly understood overseas, but by the inhuman and -brutal way in which it was administered by him. Since the present Minister for Immigration ( Mr Holt) has been in office, he has pursued a course of administrative action that has in no way affected the White Australia policy. In a humane way he has dealt with, specinc cases such as those of Mrs. O'Keefe, Mr Jang, and other persons. A simple, humane and common-sense administration of the White Australia policy has been pursued in place of an embittered and blundering administration, with the result that goodwill towards future well-being of this country.

Instances of inhumanity can be remedied by special acts of administration, and some instances of inhumanity were dealt with immediately this Government came into power.

T gathered a great deal of satisfaction from that reference to government factories, If we must indulge in <a policy of compulsory military training and preparations for war, let us set up a factfinding body now, with the object of establishing munitions factories so that Trom my own observations, I firmly and the Government should keep that fact in mind in dealing with Speech. Reference was made in the Speech to the increased cost of living. People may make excuses and blame whichever government they care to blame for the increased cost of living, but the facts are simple and plain to those of us who have led a bread and butter existence. The fundamental cause of the spiralling .cost of living was the defeat at a referendum of the proposal by which the Chifley Government sought to obtain power to control prices. The members of tbe present Government must accept responsibility for that defeat. The Governor General's Speech dealt also with taxation policy. I have no objection to the simplification of taxation forms and procedure, as suggested this afternoon by the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Casey). However, if the Government intends to reduce taxes without first doing something more tangible than was proposed in the Speech for the benefit of aged and invalid pensioners, its remissness will be a standing disgrace to it. The persons who should count most in this community to-day and who need succour most are those who won for us the right to our nationhood, our old citizens. They should be the first to receive help from any government of any political colour. I am reminded of the fact that the basic wage has been _ increased by 5s. a week in Victoria since this Government came into power. What effect will that increase have? Unless something is done by the Government to assist pensioners, their position will become virtually intolerable. I was astonished to hear in the Governor General's Speech the announcement that the Government proposed to reduce taxes without an accompanying declaration that the lot of our age and invalid pensioners would be made easier. The Speech contained the following reference to pensions:My Government realizes that the increase iu thc ""cost of living is accentuating the diffibeen in the privileged position of being culties with which age and widow pensioners in particular have to contend. My advisers realize, also, that the present system, under which the various benefits are paid subjectto a means test, gives rise to problems of whicli there is uo easy solution. I was particularly concerned by this passageMy Government, however, is closely investicountry had been responsible for the ingating the most pressing anomalies to see what can be done to remove them. It believes, moreover, that the application of its financial and economic policy will result in improvement in the purchasing power of the currency, so that pensioners, as well as other fixed income groups, will benefit. 1. do not know what is meant by ""other fixed income groups "". It might reasonably be said that the 123 members of this House belong to a fixed income group. That could truly be said of most honourable members on this side of the House, llr. E. James Harrison. althougli most honourable members on the Government side have lucrative sources ot income apart from their parliamentary allowances. Immediate positive action should bs taken to alleviate the distress of our pensioners, and it is completely wrong to bracket them in broad terms with "" other fixed income groups "". My mind is seriously agitated by the Government's attitude towards pensioners. It would be tragic to reduce taxes without first giving relief to those members of the community who most deserve sympathy and help. The Government has appointed a Cabinet sub-committee to deal with claims of ex-service men and women, and we can at least be grateful for that. Those men and women also deserve early consideration of their needs. I have noted with a great deal of interest that all members of the sub-committee are ex-servicemen. My experience during the past twelve months, when I was attempting to displace the former de facto leader of the Liberal party in this House, indicated that the general impression amongst ex-servicemen's organizations was that they were treated best by people who were not ex-servicemen. However, I hope that that impression will not be borne out unhappily by the decisions of the sub-committee. I shall deal next with the matter of communism. I listened with interest to the debate on this subject. I have not able to stand outside and talk about communism. For fourteen years I have been responsible for trades union leadership, and I can give a true anoVhonest answer to the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Casey), who asked to-day whether economic conditions in this creased Communist domination of the unions in the last four or five years. That question indicated the Minister's ignorance. In the last four or five years the grip of communism on the industrial movement in this country has relaxed. The growth of communism was given its greatest fillip when the Communist party was banned by the previous anti-Labour Government. The Sydney Trades and Labour Council became riddled with communism while the ban was in force. Members who were known Communists took control of that council while the party was banned, because those who were honest in the trades union movement could not pin them down as Communists. The position has been quite different during the last five years while the Communists have been out in the daylight. To-day we who are members of the Australian Labour party control the Sydney Trades and Labour Council by a majority of two to one. In my union not one Communist holds oflice on the State council because the party has been in the open. No Australian worthy of the name, whether Liberal or Labour, has ever been afraid to fight a common enemy in the open. sent underground, those who, like myself, have fought communism and know something about it are at a disadvantage because we cannot pin the Communist tag on them. I believe that the Communist party in this country will welcome the imposition of a ban upon it. In my electorate during the recent election I was opposed by a Communist candidate, by the de facto leader of the Liberal party, Mr J. T. Lang, and by a Liberal candidate. Honourable members of this House will remember that Mr Lang fought his campaign on a policy of banning Communists. The Liberal party has branded me a socialist, but there was very little difference between the attacks that were made on me as the Labour candidate in Blaxland by each of the three anti-Labour candidates. Despite the enormous personal following of Mr J. T. Lang in Blaxland, and the belief that he could not be beaten, the electors accepted the policy that it is wrong to send Communists underground. No Australian will run from a good fight, and we shall fight to keep the Com munists in the open so that the Australian people may deal with them in the same way as we have done while we have had them in the open. A similar situation arose in South Australia and in Tasmania. When a ban on communism is mentioned, I wonder whether some people who say that there is very little difference between the Communist party and the Liberal party are not right. I now turn to tbe intention of the Government as expressed in His Excellency's Speech, in respect of industrial arbitration. His Excellency saidMy Government is convinced that a rapid development of the Commonwealth depends largely on higher levels of production and, with tliem, higher standards of living, on freedom from industrial disturbances, and on the fullest co-operation of both sides of industry. 1 view that statement with some apprehension. Whatever section of the Government made that recommendation to His Excellency, does not fully appreciate what is implied by it. The next paragraph of the Speech deals with the intention of the Government to interfere with the machinery of conciliation and arbitration. If that be done the GovernBut' if these persons are ment apparently intends to bring about some arrangement whereby we shall get back to a system of barter. The control of industrial relations will be taken from the present machinery and will become subject to a system of barter between employer and employee. Tliat will be treading the path that Thornton and the Communist party want it to tread. That is the policy which Thornton brought from overseas and it is opposed by the Labour party with all the sincerity it possesses. That system exists in only two countries in the world. If the honourable member for Corio( Mr Opperman) made a study of international relations while he was overseas he would know that one country is America, where to-day there are between 5,500,000 and 6,000,000 unemployed, and the other is Russia, where, if the worker does not do the employer's bidding, he goes to the wall. I shall fight for as long as I live and with every ounce of my strength to retain in this country freedom of movement in the industrial field between worker and employer on a basis that must be prescribed by some form of conciliation and arbitration. The proposed system can be given any name that honourable members like to attach to it but in essence it is a bonus system. When piecs-work systems and incentive systems are spoken of, it may be pointed out that America has all of them and that they are merely other names for the bonus system. As Shakespeare saidWhat's in a name? That which we call a rose, By any other name would smell as sweet; All these systems become ultimately bonus systems and are of no advantage to tbe worker. In fact, I think that the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited had something to do with this part of the Government's policy because it is well known that large concerns are assisted by the introduction of bonus or incentive systems whereas small men are forced out of business. The Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Casey) referred to the Government's policy with relation to decentralization. To my mind, his implication of a course of action that will assist monopolies does not square with the contemplated action in connection with industrial control. I am convinced that very few honourable members opposite know much about the responsibilities and trials associated with trade union leadership. I sincerely hope that before the existing legislation relating to industrial arbitration is amended, great care will betaken to ensure that the conditions at present operating in favour of the workers of this country shall not be disturbed. I assure honourable members that the Communist party is anxiously awaiting interference with the existing arbitration machinery by the newly elected anti-Labour Government. The Communist party hopes that the present Government will revert to the system under which appeals were permitted against the decisions of conciliation commissioners, because the Communists would then be able to "" point the finger "" to the intolerable delay inevitably associated with industrial arbitration machinery of that type. Although it may be contended that some of the decisions that have been made by conciliation commissioners have not been so good as they could have been, broadly speaking they "" break even "". I point out chat it is of the utmost importance to the trade union movement in Australia that matters relating to industrial arbitration shall be resolved promptly, whether or not the decisions favour the trade unionists. In my opinion the .previous Government was a much better government than the Minister for External. Affairs( Mr Spender) is willing to concede. The industrial arbitration machinery that was initiated during the regime of the Chifley Government did more to advance indusMr E. James Harrison. trial stability and industrial peace generally in this country than any such legislation that was in existence when that Government took office. This passage also occurred in His Excellency's SpeechAn investigation is also being made of measures that might be taken to restore to union members the opportunity to express their views, by democratic methods, in relation to the election of officers and threatened or actual disputes. As the Government has not consulted the leaders of the trade union movement about this matter, it is difficult to understand what course is being pursued in connection with the investigation. I remind honourable members that it was my pleasure to be elected by the rank-and-file members of the Australian Federated TJnion of Locomotive Enginemen to the highest position in that organization. As that union has always adhered to the policy of rank-and-file control I find it difficult to understand what is meant by the statement that it is proposed, by democratic methods, to restore to union members the opportunity to express their views. I stress that any union that does not adhere to such a policy has before it a matter that can only be determined by the rank and file of that organization. Furthermore, if any government or other legislative authority were to interfere with the domestic affairs of trade unions in this country there would follow the greatest industrial unrest ever witnessed in Australia. I am not aware of who recommended to His Excellency that investigations should be made in connection with the proposal to conduct secret ballots in relation to actual or threatened disputes. I am quite sure, however, that His Excellency is fully aware that tbe introduction of secret ballots in connection with such matters would lead to the greatest chaos ever known, in the industrial field in Australia. It must be remembered that the only commodity that the workers of this country have to sell is their labour. TJnder the existing industrial arbitration machinery it is possible for disputes, actual or threatened, to be dealt with promptly on the spot by conciliation commissioners. As Australian workers have been accustomed to relative freedom in the industrial sphere, I am convinced that, iu many instances, they would walk off the job, if conciliation were removed from union control, and say, in effect, ""You can go hang"". Let us consider premeditated industrial action and the circumstances in which it is possible to take a ballot to decide an industrial issue. I have had actual and bitter experience of what happened during the Avar period, as well as in peace-time, when the executive of the union with which I was associated considered that ballots should be taken in relation to proposed industrial stoppages. Despite the fact that that union had not experienced a stoppage by its members for over 30 years, on both occasions on which ballots were taken the decisions were two to one in favour of a stoppage. Following those ballots it was only because of the vast strength of the leaderSelf-preservation is the first law of ship, and because of the type of industrial arbitration machinery that was provided hy the Labour Administration, that I was able to "" side-track"" the issue. It is nothing but hypocrisy for the Government, on the one hand, to suggest that it wants to ensure freedom from industrial disturbances, and on the other hand to contemplate destroying measures that were introduced by a Labour government to establish a semblance of industrial security in Australia.. The Minister also implied that the Australian Labour party was not prepared to fight for this cause. I remind honourable members that I have been associated with the industrial spheru in this country for fourteen years, and have engaged in all kinds of fights. During the war period I even had to fight the members of the union with which 1 was associated, and on more than one occasion I incurred the wrath of othei organizations because I refused to permit the members of my union to become involved in industrial disputes at such a time. I was able to adopt that attitude only because of the legislation that had been enacted by the LabouiGovernment. My views on this matter may be briefly summarized in this way: If the Governuiunt is sincere in its announced policy of maintaining peace in industry it should take steps immediately to reassure the workers of this country that they will be provided with full employment, a state of affairs that they enjoyed under the previous Government. I cannot stress* too strongly that the Government will not achieve peace in industry unless it guarantees to the workers of Australia continued full employment. In the second place, if the Government is really "" big "" enough to face up to the reality of the situation, it cannot introduce the system of compulsory ballots and at the same time maintain peace in industry, unless it is prepared to grant preference to unionists in every industry in Australia. I am conscious of the honour done me by the people of Leichhardt in making me their representative in this Parliament, and of the duty I owe them. I am proud to be a member of this Parliament, and to support the Government. nature, and it applies to the individual as well as to the nation. In his Speech, the Governor General stressed the need for defence. Australia has a near neighbour in the north and, as has been pointed out to-night, that neighbour has laid claim to territory belonging to one of our former allies. Indeed, if I am correctly informed, it has laid claim even to territory which Australia administers under mandate. It may be of interest to members of this House, and to the public generally, to know that the electorate I represent extends to within three miles of the Papuan coast. That brings the Indonesian question very close to our shores, and makes it a matter of immediate concern to this House. ""We must have adequate defence, and I am glad that the Government is aware of that fact. North Queensland has been neglected throughout the years. Shipping services to northern Queensland are far worse now than they were 30 years ago, and residents and farmers are subjected to greater inconveniences now than any they had to endure in the past I am glad that the Government proposes to treat coastal shipping as a matter of importance, and to give it high priority. The electorate which I represent is capable of producing vast quantities of goods which are needed by the people",50,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
202,Mr Gllmore (Leichhardt) [9.50].,"of Australia, and by tbose of other countries. A great deal of sugar is produced in the area. We produce also tobacco as good as that grown in any country in the world, and better than that grown in most countries. Australia needs dollars. Much has been said to-day on that subject. It was known to the last Government that the tobacco grown in northern Queensland was of the highest quality, yet nothing was done to encourage production. Indeed, everything was done to disGourage growers. The Government forced upon them a method of marketing that robbed them of Â£3,000,000. Can any one wonder that the production of tobacco has declined? No assurance of stability was given to those engaged in the industry. No encouragement was given to any one to invest money in it, whilst everything was done to force them to leave it. In nortliern Queensland there are vast forests capable of supplying the finest cabinet timbers, but it is impossible to get machinery and equipment to work them. Our roads are in a deplorable condition. In many instances they are no more than bush tracks. Our telephone service is bad. I cite one example. The only brickworks supplying Cairns district is situated 14 miles from the nearest telescheme can produce. We have no comphone. In wet weather there is no means of communication at all. During my election campaign, I was at the Walsh telegraph station when a truck arrived carrying a pastoralist, his wife and children, who lived on a property situated 80 miles from the nearest white people. Their mail was brought to them once a month by a black boy. The wife, who before her marriage had been employed in a. wool broker's office in Brisbane, had not capital and encouragement. seen or spoken to a white woman in six months. I was deeply touched when I saw the emotion with which she greeted the telegraph officer's wife. Such are the conditions that still exist in the pioneercement. The plans that are envisaged ing areas in northern Queensland. I should like to refer also to another family that went out to. Cape Tribulation, and carved a home for itself out of the virgin forests with the axe. In other countries, such a forest would be called a jungle. The only means of communication with the outside world is a weekly launch Mr Qilmore. service. There is no wharf or jetty, and goods have to be loaded and unloaded from a barge in the open sea. When the weather is bad it is sometimes impossible to work a cargo at all, and produce goes to waste. There is no telephone communication. Only a few months ago, a unall girl in this district had some of her fingers severed in a chaff-cutter. A journey in an open boat was undertaken to obtain medical assistance, but I regret to say that it arrived too late. The child died. The farmers in the area are producing rice, and within the last month they received their supply of fertilizeramounting to 7 tons, upon which they paid Â£42 in freight charges. Despite such difficulties, however, they still retain that pioneering spirit of which the people of northern Queensland, and the people of Australia generally, are so proud. I am very pleased that the Government proposes to establish a Department of Supply and Development. We in the north, in one section of the Leichhardt electorate, have possibly tbe most assured rainfall belt in Australia. Many rivers rise in these jungles, and falls of varying heights abound. There is sufficient water to produce power that would be, I daresay, equivalent to the power that the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric plaint about the progress that is being made in the advancement of the Snowy Mountains scheme. We seek only additional consideration. I hope that the Government will remember our claims for such consideration. Every known mineral that exists in the world is found in the rainfall belt to which I have referred. To obtain these minerals would certainly require But our people have drifted from there. In fact, the drift has almost become a rush. We have vast deposits of limestone, a material which is used in the manufacture of by the Government for the absorption of immigrants to build homes will call for a great quantity of cement. I turn now to irrigation projects. To-day, I heard .the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds) ask a question in this chamber about the money that has been made .available for the Burdekin Valley scheme. That scheme is excellent, but there is one which is more important still, and it should be hustled along. 1 refer to the Barron-Walsh scheme, which will be of such great assistance to our farmers, who are already preparing and cultivating their land, and producing tobacco, of which this country is so short that its importation constitutes one-third of our dollar expenditure. The Barron-Walsh scheme is not so big as the Burdekin Valley scheme, but it should be proceeded with simply because the farmers are already in the area, the land is already tilled, the buildings are prepared, and skilled workers are available. We require our roads' to be extended. Cooktown, with all its possibilities and vast resources, has no road communications with the rest of Australia, and I hope that a road from Cooktown will be kept in the mind of the Minister in connection with schemes that will open up that land and develop it.

203,Mr Jeff Bate (Macarthur) [10.6].,"you made your announcement everybody that I had met in the last few weeks oxpressed delight that you were to be the Speaker. They felt that your occupancy of the chair would mean a new era in parliamentary government and parliamentary procedure in this country. They believed that backed, fortified and strengthened by the magnificent policy enunciated by their leaders, they would be able to restore freedom to this land, and preserve the liberties of its subjects. They believed that you, sir, in presiding over this House, would give it the reputation and prestige that all Australians look for in their National Parliament. On your election to oifice, you referred to King CharlesI . If I might venture to do so, I should like to remind honourable members of the time when King CharlesI . went to the House of Commons with an armed force with the object of removing five members who had dared to try to uphold civil liberties. The King looked around the chamber, but he could not see the men concerned. He then asked rhe Speaker whether he could see them, ancl Mr Speaker Lenthall used these historic words, which were spoken for the last time to a sovereign in the HouseMay it please Your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see, nor tongue to speak in tliis place, I nit as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here, and I humbly beg your Majesty's pardon that I cannot give any other answer than this to what your Majesty is pleased to demand oi' me. ""Well"", replied the King, ""I see that all the birds are flown"". Mr Speaker Lenthall did a tremendous job in establishing a parliamentary tradition which yon, Mr Speaker, have intimated you hope to uphold. The tradition established by Mr Speaker Lenthall makes this chamber, the Lower House of the Parliament, absolutely sacrosanct. It establishes this House as a place in which men may act, and say what must be said, with complete freedom. We believe that you, sir, like Lenthall, will be the protector of the rights, privileges, and liberties of honourable members and because of that, the protector of the rights, liberties and freedom of the people. To-day, the people are asking for freedom. If the prestige of this House be not upheld-and I hope that I shall be pardoned for speaking in Jfr. Jeff Bate. this fashion in my maiden speech-w e shall deal a deadly blow at freedom.. Unless those who represent the common people in this Parliament are protected and parliamentary democracy and parliamentary practice are upheld, freedom will perish in this land. Your statement from the chair, sir, coupled with the speeches that have been made by the leaders of the Government parties, in which they have laid down the aims and objectives of the Government during the next three years, give me great cause forhope that there will be a return of the vigorous pioneering spirit. Unfortunately that spirit was lost during the war because of the mismanagement ancl controls that caused a loss of incentive and a general slowing down of progress in this country. We have high hopes that the pioneering spirit will return, but we realize that some time will elapse before it does so. I congratulate the Government on its magnificent decision to establish a Ministry of National Development. In all States, but in New South Wales in particular, governments have to face problems which, if they are not solved, may well be fatal to this country. Our railways are running down, our roads are in a serious condition of disrepair, and we suffer power and light shortages, and even blackouts. The housing situation isdesperate. Eamilies are separated, and ex-servicemen and young people generally are unable to secure homes. The rapid increases of tlie cost of living are seriously affecting pensioners and other people on fixed incomes. At the root of every one of our troubles lies the shortage of coal, notwithstanding the fact that in New South Wales alone, seam upon seam of rich coal representing billions of tons are undeveloped. In onesmall part of my electorate, with a spread of 30 miles and within a few miles of Sydney, 200,000,000 tons of magnificent steam coal remains untouched. Some Mr Speaker people blame the coal-miners for the present situation. I do not intend to do that.. The honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) has made a statement on this subject which must bepromptly answered. It is the leaders of the miners who have persuaded them that direct action is the only means by which results can be secured. Eecently, I was asked to speak at a strike meeting at Camden in my electorate. A rather naive request was made to me to bring with me a Labour speaker. I asked the Labour member for the district whether he would go with me. Like the honourable member for Blaxland, I believe that it is the duty of poli tical and industrial Communists and no member of the conleaders to endeavour to stem the onrush of communism: and to bring about industrial peace. The Labour member was too busy to accompany me, but I addressed the miners at Camden. For a whole hour I heard a Communist named Martin address the miners. Martin is still a member of the miners' central council. This story is very different from that which we have heard from the honourable member foiBlaxland. Martin told the miners, who were receptive to his sugmen. gestions, a story which was so plausible and so dangerous to the people of this country that it could make one's blood run cold. When I tried to tell the miners about the things that they had achieved and the improvements that were to come -tlie y already had bathrooms and water reticulationI was prevented from doing so. One of the miners' leaders then said, in effect, "" We got these things only through direct action. We had been promised water reticulation for years. One morning at 8 o'clock we held a. stopwork meeting, and. by 11 o'clock pipes, which were said to be unprocurable, appeared. The miners were inclined to cheer their arrival, but after all, you can get these things only by direct action"". He knew perfectly well that it would be impossible to obtain pipes and have them delivered to such a remote ancl inaccessible place in the Burragorang This is what happened: When some one got word through that the pipes were on their way a stop-work meeting was called simply in orcier to dupe the men and to pretend to them that the water reticulation had. been installed in the mine only as the result of holding the stop-work meeting. A few days ago, when T visited the coal-face at Berrima, a miner leaned on his pick and said, ""We want freedom to work when we want to work and freedom to earn money for our wives and children. We do not want to be forced into strikes when we do not want them "". That miner and many others like him are calling upon this Government to do the right thing. They are looking to this Goverament to have the courage to protect them against extremist leaders. The honourable member for Blaxland would have us believe that becanse be has fought the trolling council of his union is a Communist, the Communists have been cleared out of the controlling bodies of all the trade unions. Let us have a look at the position in the Australian Bailways TJnion, which, I believe, is the organization with whicli the honourable member for Blaxland is associated. Federated TJnion of Locomotive Enginethe honourable member has fought the communists within his organization, but be is a member of an organization of which Mr Ferguson is president.

However, I should like to make this Valley in three hours. point: Mr Ferguson is a member of the Australian Railways TJnion and he came to my electorate and said that that union would not strike during the big eoal strike recently because it might affect the liberties and earnings of other workers. When he was asked whether he was genuine in making that statement, he replied, ""Yes, we will not strike against tbe Labour Government and the workers"". I ask honourable members to recall what the honourable member for Blaxland bas just said. Mr Ferguson was then asked, "" Would your union strike if the Menzies Government were in power ?"", and he replied, "" That is a",57,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
