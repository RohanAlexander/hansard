Minister) [3.46] I move That this Bill be now read a second time. Honourable members will notice that in this B ill expression has been given to the policy of building up from existing things, and remodelling existing things, rather than of destroying and starting anew; and that, in order to endeavour to avoid any confusion that can possibly be avoided, we have made as few changes in the original Act as possible, consistent with administrative efficiency, electoral security, a free franchise, and a free press. I hope that honourable members will not be in any way discouraged by the number of clauses contained in the measure. A very considerable number of them are clauses of a purely consequential nature. Indeed, sir, this B ill in one respect is suggestive of those daringladies who are at present taxing the endurance of American magistrates by "" bumping up against "" the dress regulations of some of the States; because by means of these consequential amending clauses, the B ill , like the ladies to whom I have referred, has a pretty extensive* The covering of immaterial things. In order that honourable members may be able to separate, in their minds, the consequential clauses from the remainder It of the measure, I w ill give a bare recital of them. Clauses 3,4, 6, 9, 16, 21, 22, 23,. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 34 are either consequential in a verbal way or consequential upon some alterations effected by other portions of the measure under review. He has been frequently consulted as to The clauses which aim at administrafciye efficiency are as follow--numbers 5, 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 17. I may add that all these proposals would necessarily have been suggested by the Electoral Officewhatever Ministry had been in power. No. 5 deals with the appointment of electoral inspectors. I do not desire at this stage to emphasize the point-which I am sure needs very little emphasis amongst honourable members; but I may say that the Chief Electoral Officer hasreported strongly in regard to this matter. Consequently, I think it is rather a matter for supplying honourable members with information from his report if they desire to have it during the Committee stage. Clause 7, dealing with the appointment of emergency officers to the position of Returning Officer and assisting Returning Officer, is a proposal that has become necessary owingto a defect that has been found to exist in the original Act. Under the principal Act an appointmentcould be made only when a vacancy had occurred, 'and in cases where a Divisional Returning Officer or an Assistant Returning Officer had become suddenly ill it was not certain in law that a vacancy had occurred. The result was that the Electoral Office was placed in a very awkward position in the absence of the immediate opportunity of securing Executive action. The amendment proposed will obviate that-",19,Buildings Mr Parliamentary Library Purchase Of Books
118,Mr Kelly (Wentworth,"Honorarydifficulty. The next proposal of a machinery nature is that set out in clause 11. It aims afc preventing the glutting of the rolls immediately prior to a general election. The Chief Electoral Officer reports on this matter as follows: Unless the law is amended as proposed, it will always be impracticable, on the eve of an election, to make the necessary adjustments consequent upon duplications resulting from the errors of electors, and upon transfer and changes in the rolls to be used at the elections. the existing law, the Commonwealth Electoral Officers are unable, in the limited time at their disposal, to adjust a large number of these duplications (the result of errors by ' electors), which occur during the period immediately pieceding the issue of the writ for on election, and the Electoral Registrars are unable, in many cases, to remove the names of persons who have secured change or transfer of enrolment immediately prior to the issue of the writ. I may say that the statistical returns, when contrasted with the number of persons actually enrolled at the last general elections, show the pressing need for some such alteration in the machinery of the Act as is indicated in this B ill . If honourable members will bear with me for a moment, I would like to point out that whilst on the 31st May last there were no less than 2,885,000 names on our electoral rolls, only 2,710,000 persons of adult age, and eligible for enrolment, were estimated to be in the Commonwealth. So that there was the great surplusage of 175,000 persons to be accounted for, and it is to prevent any repetition of that sort of thing that the Electoral Office desires this provision to be included in the measure. of persons who are entitled to vote being placed on the roll, too. regard that interjection. We do not want persons to be enrolled who have no right to enrolment. We desire every person whose name ought to be on our electoral rolls to have every chance of recording an honest vote, but we do not wish our rolls to be inflated with the names of persons who do not exist in fact. do we desire our rolls to be swollen by voters' names being duplicated. . name should appear twice on the rolls than that he should be robbed of his vote. is that no man shall have two votes. I hope that the honourable member for East Sydney will not interrupt me, because I do not wish to be too painfully reminded of the courteous and distinguished gentlemen who used to represent that electorate. ought not to be insulting.

I wish to give them all the inforUnder mation that I can, but I do not desire to be interrupted by an honourable member who is not seeking information, but who is merely endeavouring to establish as a fact that which does not exist. The next amendment aiming at reforming electoral administration deals with the abolition of the 5s. deposit required in connection with objections to names which appear on the rolls. Other safeguards are proposed in its stead. The abolition of this deposit is intended to bring to the Electoral Department the assistance of every person in Australia in regard to these objections. It marks a very important step, but it does not wipe out a section of the Act which has been availed of to any appreciable extent. In deed, I am informed that the only case in which an elector has paid 5s. with the object of securing the removal of another person's name from the roll is that of a lady who felt it worth her while to prove that an elector whose name was given on the roll as Mrs. Jones was not, in fact, Mrs. Jones. Every other person has shirked the trouble of lodging a deposit of 5s. for the exercise of what, after all, It will prevent the names ought to be a civic duty framed on account of the experience of I think that I can disthat lady ? partment realizes the value of getting, and desires to get, the help of electors generally to insure the removal from the rolls of the names of persons whose names ought not to be there.

Honourable members will see that clause 68 is to be amended to provideThe objection may be in the prescribed form, and shall be(a) signed by an elector registered on the same subdivision roll in the presence of a returning officer, an electoral registrar, or a postmaster, and attested by such returning officer, elecdivisions, I might mention thafc Dampier toral registrar, or postmaster. In other words, before an elector can take the initial steps to get another elector's name removed from the roll he must see a highly responsible officer and make the necessary statement of fact, and any person who without reasonable cause signs such an objection will be liable to a penalty of £ 5 . The Department holds that this is sufficient to cover unreasonable and frivolous objections; but that it will not deter persons from coming bond fide to the assistance of the Department, with the object of assisting in the purification of the rolls. We have endeavoured to in troduce another reform in the B ill relating to objections to registration. As honourable members will perceive, enrolment and transfer are in the original Act placed upon a sub-divisional basis. In this measure we have followed the logical course by placing objections upon a similar basis. As a result, any person residing in a particular locality, and being aware that another elector has quitted that locality, w ill be able to assist the Department with his knowledge. I would remind honourable members that, in a country like Australia, some such provision is absolutely essential if we are to secure the assistance of the public in such matters. rary Minister mean by "" the public "" ? term is a very clear one, and is, I understand, one which is in common use. ral public have the time at their disposal to permit of their going round to look for objections ? ber does not want the Australian public to take any interest in the purity of our electoral rolls, by all means let him resist this proposition. He w ill then be in the position which he ought to occupy if he is honestly of that opinion. If , however, he does wish the public to take an intelligent interest in the purity of our electoral rolls, he ought to give them every possible facility to object to the names of persons improperly appearing there. If he does not wish to see double enrolments, if he desires an honest electoral system, of whicli the public may be proud, I take it that the only course that can be properly adopted, is that in which the Electoral Department now concurs. To draw attention to the size of some of our electoral embraces a larger area than the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Austria. Manifestly, it is impossible for an elector residing in that division to be certain that another elector who has l e f t his neighbourhood has gone out of the division. Under the Act, an elector lodging an objection must make sure that the person whose name is objected to has departed from the division, but under the amending provision the person objecting will be asked to make sure only of a matter that can reasonably be expected to be within his knowledge-that is, of departure from the subdivision-and the Department w ill, under such circumstances, welcome assistance.

141,Mr Kelly,"I ask the country to to have contradicted at the earliest possible moment. Electoral Officer has to say regarding Saturday pollingExperience ,has shown that Saturday is not a satisfactory clay for the purpose of polling, from an administrative point of view, inasmuch asi . A large number of ballot-papers have to be held over Sunday uncounted, and a considerable risk run of fire or other untoward accident, and difficulty is experienced in safeguarding the Custody of the ballot-boxes containing the ballot papers. That statement alone should be sufficient to make any decent patriot seek the earliest possible amendment of the Act . The Chief Electoral Officer continuesThe transport, telegraphic, and postal facilities are practically suspended on the following Sunday. Further he saysA very large number of persons are released from their avocations practically from midday, and other persons leave their homes for various reasons, with the result that the polling is very unevenly distributed, and congestion at certain hours is almost unavoidable. Those statements are worthy of the respect and consideration of honourable members, and I hope that what has been said in advance by honourable members opposite as to their determination to prevent this B ill passing will not be proved by our experience in Committee. briefly run through aim at better administrative efficiency, and would have been suggested by the Electoral Department, whatever Government chanced to be in power. main policy provisions of the measure, by which we destroy nothing, but create principles which are essential to any Liberal electoral measure. flower of Democratic initiative, the freedom of the press, is sought to be reinstated in this Federal measure; and the franchise is again to be extended to a large body of persons, from whom it ought never to have been taken away, persons who, lying on beds of sickness, or who, pioneering far from polling booths, are laying the milestones of our country's progress. There was never a more foolish nor more wanton thing done in this Parliament than the attempt of the last A d ministration to "" g a g "" the press. Honourable members opposite have often told w since the purpose for which it was done. But let us consult the pages oi This is what the Chief Hansard to see why it was sought to rob the press of its liberty. Let us take first the statement made at the time by the present Leader of the Opposition, who was then Prime Minister. He saidThe honourable member for Ballarat wonders why a proposal of this kind should be made at all, but I will give him the reason. The honourable member then proceeded to describe the rise of his party, and the increase of its numbers, and added that it was "" practically without a press to defend it . "" For no nobler purpose, then, than to h it at a press that was criticising his party, the honourable member for Wide Bay struck at that basis of free institutions, the freedom of the press. But what could he be thinking of when he said that the party had no press to defend it? D i d he forget that throughout Australia there are newspapers specially subsidized by Labour organizations which t u r n out, week by week, the most glaring betrayals of the truth that have ever been consistently published in any part of the world ? I do not wonder t h a t he sought to deny the Labour press; but it , nevertheless, exists, and is paid for by the same forces that return h i m and his followers to Parliament. It was because he wished to curb the criticism of the other unsubsidized newspapers in Australia, Liberal and Independent, that he supported the electoral "" gag."" What the honourable member put in a guarded way the honourable member for Gwydir expressed unguardedly. He adI come now to the two mitted that the Labour Administration was fearful of any criticism whatever regarding its methods. "" The press,"" he by which we hope to resaid, "" cannot injure a party that is fighting to win a position, but it can, by its That misrepresentation of words and actions, injure the reputation of a party in power."" I can only say in regard to that naive admission that the present Administration fears no criticism. Ministers regard a free press as the basis of free institutions, and we would rather lose our positions as the result of unjust criticism than deny the right of criticism to tbe press. Here is another statement by the honourable member for GwydirI f we were to say outside what the journalists write of us, we would be called to account by the Courts of the country, but those who control the newspapers are too wealthy, and can command too much legal talent for it to be possible for us to attack them with much chance ef success.",22,Elector Al Bill Second Reading

How long before an election can a person vote? able members opposite do not give us a chance of doing business, they will have an election very quickly, but I hope that we shall first have a chance of putting our electoral law in order. I have read to honourable members the list of authorized witnesses. choose these persons? Because, in connection with this vote, we place very material responsibilities on their shoulders. Take, for instance, the first duty of an authorized witness. Under the subject to a fine of £ 5 0 , or one month's imprisonment, he has placed upon him the responsibility of seeing that the postal voter makes proper application for his vote. He has to know personally the applicant, or satisfy himself as to his identity. He has to satisfy himself as to the facts set out in the application, and he must witness the proper signature of the applicant. The applicant, I may say, is equally liable to a fine of £ 5 0 , or one month's imprisonment, if he exceeds or evades any of the obligations under the B ill . orable members who have been saying of recent weeks that the electoral affairs of Australia are absolutely safe in the hands of the most honest public, I believe, that exists throughout the world, must surely be making a somersault with extraordinary celerity if they now say that specially authorized witnesses, subject to these fines, pains, and penalties, will deliberately do a dishonest thing to secure for some other person than themselves a benefit. Unless honourable gentlemen had their tongues in their cheeks during the last few weeks, they must recollect that it is nothing but hypocrisy and cant to suggest that these persons cannot be trusted in this regard. Let us see what next happens in regard to the postal vote. A f t e r having been specially witnessed by an authorized person, with all these safeguards, the application is sent to the Returning Officer, who, after he satisfies biniself that no previous application has been put in , whether for an absent voter's certificate or for a postal voter's certificate, can send to the applicant a postal voter's certificate and ballot-paper. When the ballot-paper reaches the applicant, he again has to call in an authorized witness, and to show the ballot-paper and the envelope to the witness. The witness is to see these things, but is I think that, if honorspecially instructed, under pains and penalties .amounting to a fine of £ 1 0 0 or three months' imprisonment, that on no account must he see or know how the voter votes j and-if it is a question of having to help an illiterate person-unde r the same pains and penalties he is bound Why do we specially down not to betray the information. ence before-in Queensland. has not had this measure in Queensland Bill, before, and he knows it . things which are most laughable in this connection. Honourable members opposite spent days and days in tirading against a Queensland Act when what they have to deal with is a Commonwealth Act, which, in the past, has been practically without abuse. A f t e r the placing of the ballot paper in the envelope and its despatch by the voter in the way set Now, honout, the vote is to go to the Returning Officer for the division, and his duty is to compare the signature on the application form with the signature on the outside of the envelope covering the ballot-paper, to see that the applicant is really the person who is voting. Right from beginning to end, therefore, the system is thoroughly safeguarded, and it is the safest method in electoral law of which I personally have ever seen or heard. But, in order that the last remaining shadow of doubt may be taken away in connection with the measure, we have introduced one reform in these proposals. Now, the voter himself may post his ballot-paper; he may make himself responsible for posting the document which he gets under the provision. post the ballot-paper? it to his father or his mother to be posted. In the old days, we were charged with being responsible for the Act under which a justice of the peacethe class that is held up to universal ridicule, contempt, and contumely-coul d",25,Elector Al Bill Second Reading

That is the only variation in tlie B ill so far as the postal voting clauses are concerned, except certain amendments consequential on the retention in part of the absent voting provisions, with a fresh penalty in order to still further tighten up the latter. Honourable members opposite declare that it is almost inhumane to ask persons who are sick to interfere in party politics; and we have heard the honourable member for Cook make use of that argument with great force. It might be a fair argument, and worthy, at any rate, of passing consideration, if it were not for the fact that we do not propose to force people to vote, but only to give them an opportunity to do so. Further, the argument comes with singularly bad taste from a party that, at every election for the last six years^ has consistently endeavoured to worm its way to place and pay by appealing to the fears of the aged poor. If honourable members opposite think that the aged and infirm ought to be left free from party conflict, why do they constantly endeavour to work on the fears of old-age pensioners? We do not propose in any way to invade the sick room, but we do propose to give those who wish to exercise the franchise the right of which they ought never to have been deprived-the right to take an interest in the affairs of the country, whicli means so much to all of us. We have heard a good deal about justices of the peace as being men who, according to lionorable members opposite, are a particularly dishonest class. require exact quotations I shall give them some. For instance, the honourable member for Bass saidWho are the people throughout Australia that can afford to pay broken-down justices of the peace to canvass electorates? . . . -think the police would lend themselves to anything wrong, and I do not think any State-school teacher, who is privileged to do that work, did anything wrong, but I do believe that justices of the peace have done that which was wrong with regard to the spirit of the Electoral Act. Do honourable members opposite endorse I s it not a weak spot when that statement ? Well, then, let us for a moment look at what has actually happened in the way of corruption T h a t is why the proin connection with the postal vote. I have given honourable members some indication of the enormous scope there is for corruption, and it was to be anticipated that there would be some few cases of malpractice. As a matter of fact, those cases are very few. From a return that I hold in my hand I find that the first charge made was against Henry Ellis, J.P., of Melbourne, but the case was dismissed. The first conviction, though the conviction was not ultimately upheld, was that of Stephen Barker, J.P., who is a member of the Senate, and a colleague of honourable members opposite. in that? where malpractice was charged. the case of the Jew"" b l o k e "" at Hamil ton.

We now see how evenly those positions are distributed over the Labour party, and yet how unevenly they are represented in the Federal Parliament. I do not say, because of the fact that so many of them will be exercising these privileges, that the electors of Australia are not able to look after themselves if they do occasionally meet a justice of the peace who is not honest. There is only one member of the House whom I have not mentioned as being a justice of the peace, and that is the honourable member for Bass, who, most appropriately, appears on the register as hailing from Beauty Point.

WhatI do say is that the Leader of the Opposition must indeed be a disingenuous person if he can ask the people of Australia to believe that there is no occasion to safeguard the rights of the honest many from the invasion of the dishonest few, with regard to a general voting system, when he says, practically, that no justice of the peace in Australia is fit to be trusted with postal votingwhen he says that the postal-voting system is an engine for enormous and tremendous corruption.

I therefore ask honourable members to join with the Government in endeavouring to amend the existing Act in this regard. I do not say that any f r a u d has been committed. I do not know. All that I do know is that there was no inducement for fraud in any sense or form at the last election. There was on that occasion no keen or intense bitterness of feeling. But I do say that in the future, judging from present indications, we are. likely to have a far more bitter and intense display of feeling than we have ever had in Australia before; and I therefore ask honourable members opposite to assist the Government in putting the law right by adopting the provisions which we have inserted in this B ill . Under the measure, when an elector comes into the polling booth to vote, he or she will simply have to sign his or her name on the butt of the ballot paper. He will make one signature for the ballot-paper for the Senate and the House of Representatives. paper will then be given to him, and, after he has voted, it w ill be deposited in the ballot-box. The purpose of the signature is to insure that we may have no double voting. We shall be able, on the order of the Court of Disputed Returns, to contrast the signature on the butt w i th the signature of the claimant for enrolment, which will be kept at the central Electoral Office. This is simply an extension of the card system. We have not turned down the system already in force. We have engrafted on to the existing card system a means of attaining electoral security.

In no other way can the votes in question be traced. But where double voting is suspected we shall the land, both political parties be able to check the signatures on the butts of the ballot-papers with the signatures on the application forms, and shall very easily be able to tell who was entitled to vote and who voted wrongfully. signature of the elector is to be on the butt of the ballot-paper ? butts will be kept by the presiding officer. We shall have a long ballot-paper. Theb u tt will be 6 or 8 inches long. The balance of the paper will be small. As soon as the elector has signed his name on the butt, the ballot-paper w ill be torn off, and taken to the ballot-box, and when the elector has voted he will fold it , and drop it in the ballot-box, with the same secrecy as prevails at the present time. The change which this system will make is that a comparison will be able to be made between the signature on the b u t t and the signature of the elector when he claimed to be enrolled. Furthermore, if an election is challenged before the Court of Disputed Returns, the The ballotCourt wil l have the right to examine the ballot-papers and to compare them.

In 1826 the island was again occupied, and maintained as a place of detention unti l 1844. Then, by Act 6 and 7 Victoria, it was placed under the control and administration of Van Diemen's Land, as Tasmania was then called. ThatA c t was described as "" An Act to amend so much of an Act of the last session, for the government of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, as relates to Norfolk Island,"" and under it the island was.severed from New South Wales and annexed to Tasmania. 1855, just before the penal settlement of Norfolk Island, the Australian Waste LandsA c t was passed. It contained a provision empowering the separation of Norfolk Island from Tasmania. Orderi n Council was issued in accordance with the Act of 1855, dated 24th June, 1856, which in effect declared that from Che date of the proclamation, which was subsequently issued on the 31st October, the said island, called Norfolk Island, should be separated from the said Colony of Van Diemen's Land, now called Tasmania, and made a distinct and separate settlement. The Orderi n Council goes on to state, "" the affairs of which should, until further Orderi n that behalf by Her Majesty, be administered by a Governor, to be for that purpose appointed by Her Majesty."" The Governori n New South Wales was appointed by the Order, as the Governor for the purpose. Speaking generally, from the date of that proclamation t ill 1897, the Orderi n Council rethe Governor of New South Wales to the mained unchanged. During that period Norfolk Island was under the administration of the Governor for the time being of New South Wales. In 1896 Sir George Reid, who was then Premier of New South Wales, agreed to pay the cost of government;-that is to say, in effect, any deficiency between the revenue and expenditure of the island. About this time, 1897, the Imperial Government contemplated a change, and some little trouble occurred in the island. did contemplated. Some thought that the titles of the lands vested in the original settlers were to be interfered with . In a few years, however, their anxiety, I think, was allayed by their actual experiences. a proclamation was issued, from which I of Norfolk Island desire to quote a few sentences. It On the statesAnd whereas by an Order in Council dated the fifteenth day of January, 1897, made in pursuance of the said last-mentioned Act, Her late Majesty, after reciting that it was expedient that other provision should be made for the government of Norfolk Island, and that, in prospect of the future annexation of Norfolk Island to the Colony of New South Wales or to any Federal body of which that Colony might thereafter form part, in the meantime the affairs of Norfolk Island should be administered by the Governor of New South Wales as therein provided, was pleased to revoke the said Order in Council of the twenty-fourth day of June, One thousand eight hundred and fifty-six, and to order that the affairs of Norfolk Island should In thenceforth, and until further Order should be made in that behalf by Her Majesty, be administered by the Governor and Commander-in-Chief for the time being of the Colony of New South Wales and its Dependencies. An That was modified by an Orderi n Council on the 18th October, 1900, which was published 011 the 1st January, 1901, and the effect of which was to change the word "" Colony"" into "" State,"" so as to bring it into line with the fact that Federation had been accomplished. That is about how the matter stands at present, so far as title is concerned. In 1897, the question was raised as to what should be clone with the island, and it was pointed out that there could be 110 annexation by New South Wales or the Commonwealth except by an Act of the Imperial Parliament. But, by an Orderi n Council, the island can be placed under the control of the Commonwealth. When that Orderi n Council is issued, the administration of Norfolk Island will be transferred from Commonwealth, and become a Territory which will be administered by the Commonwealth in accordance with section 121 of the Constitution.. In 1909, the second reading of the B ill for the transfer of Norfolk Island to the Commonwealth was merely moved. It did not reach another stage. Subsequently, some communications were exchanged in regard to it between the Governor of New South Wales and the then Minister of ExternalA f Its settlers fairs. The Imperial Government was also not know exactly what was communicated with by the Governor of New South Wales as to the establishment, on transfer to the Commonwealth, of freedom of trade between Norfolk Island and Australia. TheB ill , as it is now drafted, was finally submitted for the approval On the 15th January, 1897, of the Governor of New South Wales, and it has recently been revived. It contains a provision which satisfies the Imperial authorities that we desire to allow the produce of Norfolk Island coming direct to Australia to be admitted free in all cases in which there is not an Excise duty on similar commodities here. of the island 1 prises an area of 8,528 acres. It is of a fairl y mild and equable climate, the temperature ranging from 56 to 82 degrees, giving an average of 68 degrees. rainfall is 43 inches, the population 985, being composed of 568 males and 417 females, a disparity in the numerical proportions of the sexes that, according to thelaw of supply and demand, or to speak less profanely, of proposal aud acceptance, naturally gives the ladies, whenever the inevitable and fateful question is popped, a position of advantage. The island is compact, salubrious, and, I believe, in parts beautiful. It is no mereShadowy isle of bliss 'Mid-most the beating of the steely sea, but the home of a race of somewhat romantic traditions-sailors , expert whalers, men of the stamp of those whose seamanship, proverbial amongst nations, has extended the trade and the bounds of Empire.' I think honourable members are fairly familiar with the history of Pitcairn Island. Bounty, a sloop of about 250 tons, was commissioned by George III . , who desired to transplant some of the bread-fruit tree, of which a favorable account had been given by Captain Cook, who was in Tahiti in 1769, to the West Indies. On going Home, Captain Cook reported that in Tahiti he had found an amiable, peaceful population, a fertile soil, and a genial climate, and that there flourished there a f r u it which was exceedingly nutritious. Bligh was commissioned to transplant some of this f r u it to the West Indies. reached Tahiti, remained there about six months, and then started on his voyage. We all know that soon after a mutiny occurred on board his vessel. Some say that it was brought about by the stern and Draconian discipline of Bligh himself. Others say that it was due to different causes. A t any rate, Bligh and his companions were turned adrift, and eventually reached the Island of Timor, and Christian, a man of virile and attractive character, although chief of the mutineers, some of whom belonged to the best and most adventurous blood of Great Britain-as might be said of many of the officers associated with Bligh-wen t to Tahiti, and, after calling twice at Tauwith seven or eight companions, started on the ocean to seek some uninhabited No r f o l k Island comland-on e of thoseSummer Isles of Eden, lying In dark purple spheres of sea The there to spend, as Morrison's Journal said, the remainder of his days without seeing the face of any European except those who accompanied him. Honourable members may recollect that Byron's poem, The Island, was based on this episode of the mutineers of the Bounty. It is the poem which caused Ruskin to pay one of the greatest tributes ever paid to Byron. Ruskin extolled the poet's concision, directness, and sincerity, quoting in support of his opinion the passageA little stream came tumbling from the height And straggling to the ocean as it might. . . . While far below the vast and sullen swell Of ocean's alpine azure rose and f e l l . In 1856, Norfolk Island was vacated. Tb.3 Pitcairn islanders, finding that their island had become too small for them, petitioned for another home, and Norfolk Island was given to them. The island is about 480 About 1787, the miles from Auckland, 450 from New Caledonia, and 9""04 from Sydney, and is in latitude 29.3.4, longitude 167.58.6, the latitude being about that of Brisbane.

I hope that the interests of Australia in the Pacific will be more manifest in the future, and I say it with the greatest respect to other nations, whose ideas of government, if applied, may tend as much to the amelioration and advancement of the natives as our own. Placed as we are, the greater the control we have of islands like Norfolk Island, the better it may be for the people there and here. And we must look ahead.

The following is an extract from an interesting letter received by a colleague from a lady living on the island. The letter is dated 16th July last, and speaks of the principal cropsThey can grow anything in any quantityoranges, lemons, guavas, pineapples, yams, Kumeras, potatoes (three or four crops a year), strawberries, bananas, coffee, maize, wheatanything; but what's the use? case to send a case of oranges to Sydney, and 2s. a case duty. In 1903, Mr Oliver, appointed by, I think, SirH a r r y Rawson, visited the island, and, reporting on its production, saidHowever, maize, among grain crops, and oranges, lemons (Lisbon), bananas, guavas, passion-fruit, melons, and custard apples, among . fruits, are at present the staple products of the soil, and with encouragements such as might fairly be claimed by the farmers, could be grown over very much larger areas, and in much larger quantities, than now. couragement of any kind, and, indeed, with the certain prospect of producing what he cannot profitably sell at home or abroad, or find some profitable use for, it is hardly reasonable to ask these farmers to increase their output of any State-taxed commodity. lishment of the Australian Commonwealth, Norfolk Island exports have, as might be expected, shrunk in value in a very marked degree, and at present the excess in value of imports over exports is very nearly, if not quite, as 10 to 1. The island, therefore, is very far from being self-supporting, economically considered, and but for the Melanesian Mission and Cable Station, expenditure on local products would exhibit a most unsatisfactory balance-sheet from a business point of view. The island has a capital of £5,700, of which £4,800 is invested in the funded stock of New South Wales, and bears in terest at the rate of 3 or 3£ per cent, per I find from looking at the annum. The stock is redeemable only with the consent of the New South Wales Government, but possibly, as in taking over the island we shall relieve the I do not wish to State of an expenditure of more than £1,500 a year, its Government may consent to the redemption of the stock, in whicli case it should be possible to re-invest it on terms giving a return of I or 1 per cent. more.

The revenue of the island was made up in this way:-Interest on funded stock, deposits, and loans, £ 2 7 3 ; Customs duties, £ 4 6 0 ; postage stamps and postal notes, £ 1 9 7 ; land revenue, £ 1 0 8 ; timber royalties, fees of Court, and other revenue, £ 1 8 2 ; and an annual grant from New South Wales, £ 8 0 0 ; making the total £2,020. When the necessary deductions and additions are made, we get the total revenue for the financial year £2,520. New South Wales, besides making an annual grant of £800, pays the salary of It costs 4s. per the Chief Magistrate of the island, £ 4 5 0 ; that of the principal teacher, £ 2 5 0 ; and that of the teacher's wife, £ 3 0 ; so that the minimum outlay which we shall be called upon to meet if we take control of Norfolk Island, and of which we shall relieve the State of New South Wales, is £1,530. For the financial year ending 30th June, 1912, the imports from New South Wales were valued at £ 8 , 2 9 6 ; from New Zealand, £ 8 1 0 ; a total of £9,106 . The exports were, to New South Wales, £ 7 9 8 ; to the Without enSouth Sea Islands, £ 4 3 2 ; and to New Zealand, £ 1 3 5 ; a total of £ 1 , 4 1 5 .

There may not be the same necessity for lawyers there as here. The Ten Commandments were not created for that purpose-onl y on account of the prevalence of sin. As regards the lands, the leases are for twenty-eight years, subject to renewal under certain conditions. No one can hold more than 25 acres for cultivation and grazing unless the Governor, in special circumstances, permits that to be done. And there are provisions against aggregation beyond the declared area. There is a provisionI have not been able to find the Order in Council-that every person after a residence of six months must pay a tax of £ 3 to the Council or do fifteen days' work on the roads. As regards the liquor Ordinance, lionorable members may wish, perhaps, to take some guidance from it . Regulations were issued on the 21st September, 1904, as follow2. All beer, wines, and spirits landed on any part of Norfolk Island shall be consigned to, or to the care of, the Chief Magistrate, and will, on landing, be taken possession of by him, and will not be issued by him except in pursuance of a permit. 3. Permits will be granted either for the supply of liquor to be issued by the Chief Magistrate on demand by the holder of the permit, or for the periodical supply of liquor to be so issued in small quantities to such holder for a period not exceeding one month. 5. Permits to the Melanesian Mission and to the Cable Station will be granted only on the condition that liquor shall not be supplied to any person not being a member of the mission, or permanently employed in the mission or cable station. of the cable station respectively will be responsible for the observance of this regulation. 8. Permits to persons other than the Melanesian Mission or Cable Station will only be granted on and in accordance with a certificate signed by the Government Medical Officer in charge that the liquor is required for medical purposes only, in case of sickness, old age, or other debility. It practically means the existence of a teetotal island, so far as I can see. A good deal of development may have to take place. able harbour yet, is there 1 what has been done since the report of 1903, which laid stress on that matter. Two wharfs have been put up, but I do not think that the wharf and jetty contemplated then has been erected. There has been some, but there seems still to be a good deal of work to be done in the way of keeping down noxious weeds, and in general development, so as to encourage the slight use made of the soil; but the people have been hampered by the fact that they could not compete with Australia under the -duties that obtained, and I hope that by allowing the produce to come in free we shall remove the chief obstacle to commercial development. As regards the Bill, there is very little that I need tell honourable members. It provides for acceptance of Norfolk Island as a territory under the authority of the Commonwealth, as provided in clause 3. That will take place when the Order in Council has been issued by the Imperial Government and a proclamation accordingly made. The existing laws will continue until modified or repealed.

I would not ask my worse enemy to submit to a proceeding of that kind. much respect for the Treasurer, even though he is fathering a piece of legislation which I would not like to father, to ask him to withdraw it . He takes my remarks quite calmly. The country may go, the finances may go, and the Auditor General may take control of everything. Here is a Bill which hands over to that officer, not only the right to audit the public accounts, and give a true representation of the finances, but also the right to regulate the purchase of all supplies for the Commonwealth, and their distribution through ihe different Departments. Here is a man who, while on the one hand he is to be charged with the duty of directing the way in which' purchases shall be made, stores be issued and checked, has to audit that which he directs. What au anomalous position that is! The Treasurer is not acting fairly to the Auditor General. I have met that officer. He is only an Auditor-General; he knows nothing about anything else; he has devoted his whole life to the question of auditing. Wheni t is proposed to hand over to a specialist a foreign duty, of which he knows nothing, there is a danger to the community. Auditor-General to tell him that he is to be "" boss "" over the purchasing of stores, the distributing of them, the checking of the audit, and the analyzing of the provisions of this great measure. I ask the Treasurer, out of his humanitarian sympathy, to have a little thought for that officer. Has the Auditor-Generali n dorsed this B ill as the head of the Electoral Department has agreed with every provision in the Electoral B ill ?' Has this Bil l been drawn by the Auditor-General as the Electoral Bill has been drawn by the electoral officers, according to the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs? If the Auditor-General has told the Treasurer that this measure is necessary, he must have been not quite in his right mind, because he is taking upon himself a responsibility too great for any man, or dozen of men, to be charged with. over this matter. have appealed to him, and he has not only listened, but paid attention. been open to conviction at times. orable friend will not misunderstand me. The Treasurer has been open to conviction as a statesman, and now the idol I have too whom I had lifted on to the pedestal of statesmanship, and who I think ought to be the Leader of this Government, has crumbled into clay at my feet. Is the Prime Minister back; will he ever come back? has the Prime Minister gone to another meeting to proclaim the opposition of this party to non-contentious legislation ? Hasi t become a disease with the PrimeM i nister to ever go on prating about the action of the Opposition in that regard ? The Treasurer may well look at me. I know that he does not agree with the Prime Minister in leaving his seat in the chamber and shirking the responsibility which is his. I know that the right honourable member is quite prepared to carry the whole load on his broad shoulders; but I do not want him to bear a load which he is not entitled to carry. of the Ministry. rid of the Ministryi f he has to bear the It is not fair to the whole load. Through you, sir, may I make one final appeal to the Treasurer before he commits this act irrevocably? May I ask that he should retrace his steps, and that a B ill of this character should be put into the waste-paper basket at once, and another measure prepared more in accordance with the necessities of the times ? If he cannot for shame's sake consent to back down at this stage, will he consider the advisability of asking another place to cut out the objectionable clauses, to t r i m the measure in such a way that it will be acceptable to the people ? W ill he do credit to the Government, or will he allow the Government to go down to posterity denounced as one that had endorsed, when in Opposition, the principle of legislation by regulation? W it h all seriousness, I say that this is one of the most perplexing problems that have I want the Treasurer to think ever been offered for consideration by honI n days gone by, I orable members, and it behoves every honourable member on this side to do his duty.

We ought not to permit to be done by regulation what can be better done by Act of Parliament. sent out hundreds of regulations under the Defence Act. MrM c DONALD what has been done by others. Hundreds of regulations are issued every year, and I do not think they are read by a solitary member of Parliament, except by the Ministerial heads who are responsible for them. It is one of the faults of our parliamentary system that we allow so much to be done by regulation. I admit that there are some things which cannot be very well controlled by Parliament. The Government should have power to make regulations in such cases; but when we can give a clear idea of what we want, as in this case, it is not wise to provide for doing it by regulation. Under the circumstances, I enter my protest against the third reading of the B ill . surer) [9.18] -Al l the arguments that we have heard to-night, .with the exception of a few observations from the honourable member for Maribyrnong, have been stated before, and I do not propose to allude to them again. In regard to what the honourable member for Maribyrnong said, I quite recognise that our system is not perfect, and that the Estimates and the Appropriation Act are passed too late in the year. But we have not been able to overcome that difficulty up to the present; indeed, difficulties will arise whatever we do. If we followed the honourable member's advice, and terminated the financial year in March, we might have the Estimates brought before Parliament at the beginning of July. But, even then, Parliament would be no nearer to them than it is now. The financial year would be nearly half over before the Appropriation Act was passed. meet earlier. to bring the finances before Parliament as soon as possible, but whatever we do there is a difficulty in the way. When I first entered Parliament in Western Australia, the financial year ended on the 31st December. Parliament used to meet in the middle of the year. The Treasurer had [47]2 to estimate fhe revenue, not only for the remainder of the financial year in which the Budget was delivered, but for the whole of the coming financial year. That is to say, he had to estimate the revenue for nearly eighteen months. That waa very inconvenient. It is necessary thafi the Treasurer should know the total amount of revenue and expenditure for I cannot justify the past financial year when estimating for the next financial year. I admit that the Commonwealth system is inconvenient from the Treasury and departmental bookkeeping point of view, because the half year has gone before the final appropriation takes place. But I am not prepared at the present moment to say that the limits of the financial year should be altered. All the States are in the same position. Their financial year ends on the 30th June. It would be inconvenient if the Commonwealth's financial year ended on a different date from that of the States. I do not think that a Treasurer would deliberately hold back accounts from payment towards the end of the financial year for the purpose of making the finances look better. He could not hide what he was doing from the officers of the Department, and it would soon be apparent to any one examining the accounts, and especially to the Auditor-General. The public creditor would complain that he was doing it for political purposes. The law, as well as the usual custom, is that all accounts that are ready for payment on the 30th June shall be paid then. 1 do not recall any case in which that has not been done. If the revenue of the year is falling off, or is not coming in as anticipated, care is taken not to commence works as early as might otherwise be done, in order that the whole of the expenditure on those works might not fall due within the financial year. That might even be done when works had been authorized by Parliament. Indeed, it is quite right that a Treasurer should not embark on works, although he may have a vote of Parliament for them, unless he can see his way to pay for them. T have myself, as a State Treasurer, delayed works because the revenue was not coming in satisfactorily. A f t e r all, the management of the finances of a country is a business affair. A Treasurer should manage the finances as he would manage his own affairs. He should not spend money which he has noli",52,Interjector Yo U Mentioned Thousands

448,Mr Rodgers (Wannon) [9.32],"Iappreciation of the work which they have been able to perform with the limited funds at their disposal. I hope that there will be healthy co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth in this connection. I am certain that the Prime Minister was right when he said that the object of the Government was not to in vade the field which is at present being covered by the various State Agricultural Departments, but rather to widen the scope of the science of agriculture. The States, by reason of their financial position, are somewhat cramped in their efforts. The operation of each State is naturally circumscribed by financial considerations, so that, under their guidance, there can be neither the acquisition nor dissemination of knowledge that is possible under the Commonwealth. I take it that this B ill has two objects in view. In are affected with many diseases, notably the first place, it aims at increasing the production of Australia; and, secondly, at diseases which are common to plant and animal life here. Take the production of wheat, for example. The most common pests which affect wheat are red-rust, flag-smut, ball-smut, takeall, white-heads, and the wheat grub. I may tell honourable members that I have had a recent experience of the ravages of the wheat grub. It was my bad fortune, on returning home about a fortnight ago, to find that I had lost about 300 acres of self-sown wheat through the depredations of this grub. My experience is not a singular one. northern district this year the wheat crops have been very much affected by the grub, a specimen of which, by the way, I submitted to Mr French, the Entomologist, who describes it as the climbing cut worm. The ravages of this one pest alone may reduce the value of the production of Australia in one year by hundreds of thousands of pounds. I may be pardoned for mentioning, as an illustration of my good fortune, that, round a paddock of wheat adjacent to that to which I have referred, I seeded a chain of oats, which proved an effective barrier against the grub. with that object in view? prompted first by a desire to obtain clean seed oats, and secondly by the assurance of my neighbours that it formed an effective barrier to the grub. result of a practical effort. The fact that the grub did not thrive in the oat crop, when conveyed to the scientist, may lead to some valuable discoveries. I come now to f r u it cultivation. We all know that fruit-growers are subject to very many pests, and the last word in the methods to be adopted for their destruction has surely not been uttered. What the little lady-bird was able to do in Americai n connection with the scale there illustrates what may be accomplished if science has f u l l play in Australia. I come now to the natural enemy of lucerne. In our district, it is a new arrival, which is known as the lucerne flea. If this little flea gets its way amongst the lucerne of Australia, very serious results will follow. Let me touch now upon the veterinary side of the project. Sheep, for example, fluke, tick, maggot-fly, lung-worm, anthrax, and foot-rot; while cattle are dealing with the pests and attacked with pleuro, tick fever, contagious abortion, and tubercular trouble. anything in these matters ? ber wish to rob the States of their powers ? to increase the opportunities of the States to cope more effectively with these diseases. The point which impresses me most in regard to the establishment of a Commonwealth Bureau of Agriculture is that Australia is competing with many other In many parts of the nations for land users and agriculturists. How are we to attract them to our shores ? By being in a position to put the best proposition before them. There is no patriotism about the man who is looking for the best spot to land upon. If we can increase the production of Australia in any one of the lines to which I have referred, we shall render good service to every one engaged upon the land here. We shall also do good work for others outside, including the supporters of my honourable friends opposite, in increasing employment and cheapening food supplies. able member get his experts?

There should be proper co-operation between the State and Commonwealth authorities. The Prime Minister has wisely suggested that we should get the best experts in the world.

If the Commonwealth positions are sufficiently attractive, and they are suitable for the work, T hope that they will come to us. to get the land ? tralia are reserved to the States by the Constitution, and we must co-operate with them. My idea is that the Commonwealth Department should acquire all possible knowledge, and disseminate it , using State organizations to demonstrate its value. I have already spoken informally to State officials, who welcome attempts to throw more light on the science of agriculture. Victoria, for example, should not be confined in matters of research or of demonstration to her own territory, and it seems to me that the widest investigation can be made by a Commonwealth Bureau. great advantage it would Australia if the Bureau could provide our pastoralists with knowledge that would enable them to make two blades of grass grow where one grows now. It is not sufficient merely to kill the timber on a piece of land; much more can be done to improve its pastures. Cultivation and the use of manures may produce 2£ tons of fodder where the natural pasturage would not amount to more than 5 cwt. Surely honourable members see what a wide field there is for increasing our knowledge, and thus increasing our wealth in this and other directions.
