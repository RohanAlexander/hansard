25,Mr Batchelor,"I should likei n niy own way. A t the last Federal election the leader of the conservative party received 27,000 votes, and the leader of the labour party 24,000 votes. Therefore, there was a difference of only 3,000 votes for the whole of the State, whereas, in six out of the seven districts now proposed, the leader of the conservative party beat the leader of the labour party, even though the voting was in the proportion of four conservative to three labour votes.

He looked at the matter from an entirely non-party stand-point. Nevertheless this House has a right to consider the effect of any subdivision which he has recommended, and if the effect of that subdivision is to give an unfair indication of the opinions of the electors of South Australia, we ought to insist upon an alteration of the boundaries.

"" honourable member wants 1 want, but what I consider ought to be done in order to obtain a fair subdivision. Apart from the matters to which I have referred, I believe that generally speaking the Commissioner has very fairly divided the State into electorates. raised by the honourable member is a purely political one. no community of interest is obtained by attaching Glenelg to the Southern District which stretches away to Mount Gambier on is the honorthe Victorian border. Glenelg is really a seaside suburb of Adelaide. If community of, interest is to be considered, it should certainly be bracketed with other watering places adjoining it . It will be observed that while the Commissioner has, generally speaking, adhered very closely to. the quota in subdividing the State into electorates, the district of East Torrens comprises 26,727 electors, whilst the adjoining district of Barker comprises only 21,791 electorsa difference of some 5,000. That difference the honourable is material only from the point of view that East Torrens is growing more rapidly than is any other part of the State, and that in the course of some two years at the outside another' redistribution will be necessary in view of the fact that the number of the electors in the district is already very close to tlie prescribed limit. On the other the hand, Barker is not-making rapid headway, and there has been practically no change for a great many years in the number of I care not what is its electors. Its population is unlikely to overtake the quota for some time to come. Even at therisk of having to go back to the old state of things, and leaving it to the State Parliament to make the divisions, the proposed scheme of redistribution should be sent back, though I do not want honourable members to believe for a moment that I advocate this course for any personal or party interest other than I can absolutely justify anywhere..

The party in power to-day may three or four years hence be advocating the policy of the present Opposition, and it would be impossible to continually alter the boundaries of the divisions to meet the change in the views of political parties.

If we suggest an alteration of the names, I do not question the power of the Governor General to give effect to our wishes. propose. tliat way without any objection, but not otherwise. With regard to the proposed distribution of the electorates, I can speak with freedom from personal interest, because I have not the slightest intention to submit myself to either of the districts which are affected. MrV . L . SOLOMON -The right honourable gentleman has a much safer one. but I confess that I have been very fairly treated in connection with the polling throughout South Australia. I have great confidence in the judgment of the officer who was responsible for the subdivision. South Australia never had a better officer than the late Sheriff Boothby, and I venture to think that the benefits of the service which he has rendered in connection with electoral matters have been by no means confined to South Australia, but have been shared by all Australia. Whilst approving generally of the divisions which he has recommended, I cannot help thinking, after listening to the remarks of the honourable member for South Australia, Mr. Batchelor, that he has made a mistake with regard to the inclusion of Glenelg in the district of Barker, and the exclusion of the district of Goodwood from Barker, and its inclusion in the district of Port Adelaide. I think that can hardly be justified. The position is this :. Glenelg is a fashionable watering place, corresponding to a very great extent with similar watering-places to be found in the district of Port Adelaide, notably-the Semaphore, Henley Beach,-the Grange, and others, and it is much closer to them than is the district of Goodwood. The latter district may be described as the home chiefly of workers empioj'ed in the city, and is in no sense a fashionable neighbourhood. It was originally started by a building societj', and has been extended from time to time. Goodwood and Glenelg have for years past been included in the same district, and I should have been glad to see them so included now. What has been done 1 Glenelg, which is, as I say, a fashionable watering-place, adjoining other places which are included in Port Adelaide, is not selected for inclusion in that electorate,, but is joined to the district of which Mount Gambier is the chief polling place, and which includes the greater part of the south-eastern district peopled by producers I think it could be done in generally. Goodwood, on the other hand, which is farther away from Port Adelaide, has been included in that district. I cannot help thinking that a mistake has been made. Speaking about community of interestsI am not bothered particularly about the political views which are held by the residents of different localitiesa fashionable watering-place such as Glenelg should,",21,Electoral Divisions South Australia

Sir LANGD ON BONYTH ON (South Australia) Whilst sympathizing with much that has been said by the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, and the right honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, I feel that I must support the Government in approving of the electoral .divisions for that State. am quite sure that the people of South Australia generally approve of the way in which that State has been subdivided. Up to the present time there has been no question raised as to the boundaries not being acceptable, with the exception of the boundary between the districts of Barker and East Torrens. member any ground for making that statement? Sir LANGD ON BONYTHON -Some time ago I was approached by Mr Chinner, the Mayor of Unley, who forwarded me a resolution which was passed by a meeting held at Goodwood. That meeting expressed the opinion that the boundary between Torrens and Barker was not a satisfactory arrangement, but the meeting was held after the month had elapsed during which exception could be token to the electoral boundaries. I brought the matter before this House by means of a question, and ascertained that nothing could be done. In view of all the circumstances it seems to me that, as a representative of South Australia, I should not be justified in asking that these divisions should be rejected. l a m fairly acquainted with the State of South Australia, I feel justified in offering a few remarks upon this question. . In . the first place the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, objects to the inclusion of Goodwood, in the district of Port Adelaide, on the ground that there is no community of interests between the two places. I contend that there is a community of interests in the case of Goodwood with the district of Port Adelaide, and also with that of East Torrens. generally. is in its connection with the rest of the municipality of Unley. of Unley would exceed the quota. Goodwood is populated by working men, and by many old residents, who made it a suburban retreat in the early days. Then,, again, it is a centre in which a good many railway men reside. I think we may fairly assume that the community of interests is. as strongly pronounced in the case of Goodwood as it is in that of Hindmarsh and Port Adelaide. from Goodwood. rendered necessary by reason of .the quota. Regarding the question of gerrymandering,. I would point out that if we included Unley we should probably have to take in Parkside. Otherwise we should certainly giverise to a suspicion of gerrymandering. The honourable member for Bland, who has no knowledge of the district whatever, suggestshonorable that a little gerrymandering has taken place. But I would point out to him that a certain portion of this district has been included in the new Federal electorate from a point on the old Bay-road. The part in the angle, which is shown in the map, represents what is known as ""The Old Black Forest,"" and the population settled there is very sparse indeed. missioner in effecting this subdivision has crossed the Bay-road. the point I have indicated.

He has walked round the chamber with a map in his hand for the purpose of showing that gerrymandering has taken place. He wishes the new Federal electorate, to which reference has been made, to be a perfect oblong.

I have a strong notion, though I may be altogether wrong, that if both Houses of Parliament pass resolutions approving of any suggested which, undoubtedly, to my mind, includes the names as well as the boundaries contained in the Commissioner's report and the attached maps signed by may be done. But can it be said that both Houses have approved of a distribution if the House of Representatives' rejects some of the names of the divisions recommended by the Commissioner, and substitutes othernames t General) -There is no express authority for the alteration by this House of either names or boundaries; but whereas an If any honourable memalteration of the boundaries of the divisions would be an alteration of substance, the alteration of names is not. In my opinion, the Act is not so severely worded as to prevent us from making immaterial alterations, and no court would say that the alteration of names is material. Question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative. ResolvedThat this House approves of the proposed distribution of the State of South Australia into seven Divisions, named Adelaide, Hindmarsh, Angas, .Barker, Wakefield, Boothby, and Grey, and shown on the maps laid upon the table of It is open to any honourable the House of Representatives on the 7th July' last. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Min ister for Trade and Customs) I move That this House disapproves of the proposed distribution of the State of Victoria into 23 divisions, named Balaclava, Ballaarat, Bendigo, Bourke, Corangamite, Corinella; Coria, Flemington, Flinders, Gippsland, Grampians, Indi, Jika, Kooyong, Laanecoorie, Melbourne, Melbourne Ports, Mernda, Moira, Toorak, Wannon, Wimmera, Yarra, and shown on the maps laid upon, the table of the House of Representatives on the 21st July last. I have placed this motion second on the list because, as I have already explained, the proposed distribution of Victoria was the second to be reported upon by the Commissioner. I ask the House to disapprove (South Australia) -I of the distribution for several reasons. One reason, to which I shall make further reference presently, is the prevalence of a series of disastrously dry seasons, which has driven the population of Victoria and other States towards the coast. to be a very large allowance for couutry representation. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I do not think the distributionallowance is large. The population now residingon theeastern coast of Australia cannot be considered a normal population, and that fact will appear more clearly when I come him-something to deal with the proposed distribution of New South Wales. The Commissioner in reporting upon the written objections to hisdistribution whiuh have been received by him enumerated them in this wayThat the statistics as to the number of electors, residing in the country are unreliable. That owing to the drought numbers of electors, from countiy districts have moved, probably only temporarily, to the metropolitan centres.

The proposal in the Electoral Bill introduced by the Government was that the margin should be one-fourth, but in Committee that was altered to one-fifth. If the original margin had been kept, a great deal of difficulty would have been saved. accepted the amendment. Sir WILLIAM LYNE BecauseI could not get anything better. I have always been opposed to giving to the electors in large centres of population the same representation as to those in the sparsely-populated country districts. Under the old division, Balaclava stands with 3,180 electors above the maximum, Bourke with 2,746, Kooyong with 6,3S5, Melbourne Ports with 589, North Melbourne with I will presently 1,445, South Melbourne with 3,144, and Yarra with 4,832.

The Wimmera District includes the dry country to which I have just referred. Every week the people are leaving those districts, in which the numbers are at present above the maximum, ' to swell the population of those in which the numbers are at present below the maximum.

I desire to show the proportion of electors in city electorates as compared with country electorates under the State system in Victoria. The electorate of Windermere contains 1,74:3 electors, Clunes and Alhmdale 1,744, Creswick 1,812, Talbot and Avoca 1,831, Norman by 1,935, Maldon 2,004, Eiglehawk 2,01 S, Daylesford 2,035, Dunolly 2,041, Horsham 2,056, Portland 2,081, Port Fairy 2,081.

I have quoted these figures to show honourable members the principle that was followed in the distribution of electorates for State purposes. Mr F. E.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE orable member is quite mistaken. The great number of electors in each of the divicause of the trouble has been the transfer of sions under the distribution rcommended population from the country districts to the by the Commissioner, because honourable towns.

In many cases, two or three times as many electors are required in the centres of population as in the country. I once heard it said by the present Agent General of New South Wales, that the city of Sydney would be better represented than the country districts of New South Wales, even if had no members, because Parliament was meeting in the city. In Great Britain, country members are returned by 2,500, 2,600,2,700, 3,200 electors respectively, whereas in the centres of population 35,000,28,000, 24,000, 23,000, 22,000,' and 20,000 electors respectively are required to return one member.

176,Mr Sydney Smith,"The Minister didto have been a most extraordinary one if judged from the map. The representatives of Victoria are better acquainted than I am -with the effects of the division. I believe they will fully endorse everything I have said with regard to the exodus of people from one part of the State to another, and the necessity of giving the opportunity to people to return to thedrought afflicted districts before the boundaries of the districts are permanently altered.' I think that an alteration at the present time would prove very detrimental to the best interests of the State. If we adhere to the present proposed distribution, we may deprive the country districts of a member to which they would still have been entitled but for the drought, and give the city electorates an undue advantage. I remember that, on one occasion in"" New South Wales when we altered the electoral law, we reduced the number of members by sixteen, of whom fourteen were taken from the country electorates on account of the requirement that the representation of country and city electorates should be upon the same ""basis so far as' the number of electors was concerned. This alteration struck a most disastrous blow, under which New South Wales has been staggering ever since, and I hope that no such course will be adopted in the present instance. lution will not mean that the Government intend to refer the divisions back to the Commissioner ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE MrA . McLEAN-(Gippsland) I rise to support the motion, and I may say at once that, so far as I am personally concerned, the proposed divisions would suit me remarkably well. They would leave me all my present electors, and the territory which it is proposed to add to my electorate happens to include the district where I went to school, and where . 1 have a large number of friends. Therefore, from my own personal stand-point, I could not find any fault with the proposed distribution. But I think it is our duty to view this matter from a broader stand-point than that of our personal interest or convenience. I thoroughly agree with what the Minister for Trade and Customs has said in regard to the effect of the recent drought. When the question of the apportionment of electors, as between town and .country, was under consideration, I did all that I possibly could to secure a margin of one-fourth,either above or below. But, having been defeated upon that question, I do not desire to raise it again. We have a certain law upon the statute-book, and I have no wish to dis regard its provisions. A t the same time. I think all fair-minded persons will admit that we ought net to take advantage of a time when the country districts are partially denuded of population, as tlie result of-one of the most disastrous droughts ever experienced in Australia, to deprive those districts of their fair share of political representation. I am sure that our city friends would be the last to take advantage of any temporary displacement of population for that purpose. When the present division of electorates in this State was submitted to the Victorian Parliament by myself, the present Treasurer, .although he is a city member, moved that it be disagreed with upon the ground that it gave too much representation to the city. In common fairness, I had to admit that it did. The reason which he assigned for his objection was that a majority of the members composing the Government, of which I was the head, were country representatives, and were afraid of being accused of unduly favouring rural constituencies. A considerable majority of the Victorian Assembly supported the amendment to deprive the city of a member, and to add that measure of representation to the country. But ib was found that if that course were adopted, the balance of representation would be No . rather the other way. The House, therefore, accepted the subdivision as originally proposed, although a majority of honourable members considered that the city had been somewhat unduly favoured. We can well imagine -what would be the effect of depriving the country districts of still another representative, and of giving that measure of increased representation to the city. I have no desire to raise the question of town versus country. Their interests should be identical; but the knowledge and experience of their residents are not identical. The city man is conversant with city interests and the country resident with country interests. Let me refer to the proposed boundaries of the electoratewhich I represent, as they are shown upon themap.

If that power does not satisfy honourable members, we had better abolish altogether the principle of manhood and womanhood suffrage. Is it not remarkable that, judging by his speech, the Minister appears to be oblivious of .the fact that, since the last general elections, the women of Victoria have been granted the franchise? Judging by his speech he is oblivious of the fact that by one stroke of our legislation we have added to the electoral rolls of Victoria a larger number of persons-in shape of the women of the previously existed upon the roll of male electors. Is is not marvellous that in dealing with the position' created by what most of us consider to be a grand new departure, which has converted the number of electors of Victoria 600,000, the Minister has not made any reference whatever to that revolution of the political system of the State? I have before me the figures published 'in part of the Statistical Register of Victoria for 1901 showing the number of men and women over the age of 21 years then residing in this State. The return shows that whereas there were at that time 307,000 males above the age of 21 years in Victoria, there were 317,000 females above that age. Therefore, the electors of Victoria in point of voting is supposed to be equal, so far as individuals are concerned-have by one stroke of policy, from 300,000 to 600,000. But not one word has fallen from the Minister in regard to the way in which that change affects his scheme, or how it works out. TheMinister may have thought fit to refer very briefly to this matter, but we must very seriously consider it. honourable member for Gippsland, and tlje Minister for Trade and Customs do not wish to raise the question of town and country. They do not desire to do so, because they wish to submerge the towns. fracture the main principle of the Constitution in the interests, as it is thought, of certain persons in one part of the State^ and then to say, "" Oh, do not let us raise this question of town and 'country."" The question is raised by those who seek to depart from the general principle of the Constitution, by making a difference between the voter who lives in a town and the Mr Reid. voter who resides in a country district. They are the people who raise this question. The broad catholic basis of our suffrage does, not regard the status of men or women in the world. It pays HO regard to what theirwealth or their poverty may be, or to what may be the extent of their education. All these things have been brushed aside in order that every human being above, theageof 21 shall have the same right that the biggest and best man has, so far as the ballot-box is -concerned. That question has been settled long ago. If the Minister could have discovered any injustice, or any in the vasion of the principles of the Constitution State-than in this distribution, it would be a wholly different matter But what is the principle ? The Minister says that he hasalways held the opinion that the votingpower in the hands of the people"" in the country districts should be one fourth from 300,000 to greater than that of the city electors. In other words there is to be 25 per cent., more voting power in the country electorates, than there is in the city divisions. We arelegislating in a number of democratic directions which some people consider to be daring experiments, but I think that the mostaudacious experiment of all would be tosolemnly confer political rights upon individuals, and then by side methods to deprivethem of those rights. In such circumstances, what is the use of standing up and pointingto Australia, as our great men do, as the onepower-which place in the British Empire where theequality of the manhood and womanhood of been raised, the country has been fearlessly affirmed.. If that is the principle of our Constitution, there is a personal right, possessed by every man and woman in Australia. It is his right, and her right, under our Constitution. .We talk of establishing a High Court, and of appointing The a High Commissioner, but is it not of infinitely greater importance that we shall not deprive the people of their politicalrights ? Isi t not of supreme importancethat we should not revert under cover It is easy to of a wretched question of this kind to the old tory distinctions of bygone times?"" I wish to point out that in my judgment the Commissioner has already gonetoo far in discriminating between the voterin the country district and thevoterin the town. In support of that view, I shall read certain figures which areembodied in his report. What do they show ? They show that the Commissionerin planning out and distributing the voting act up to them on vital occasions.

194,Sir William Lyne,The next elections,34,Electoral Divisions Victoria
195,Mr Reid,"There is no provision fora larger representation, to the extent of 50,000 votes, than is given to the metropolitan electorates. Section 29 of the Constitution provides thatUntil the Parliament of the Commonwealth otherwise provides, the Parliament of any State m:iy make hiws for determining the divisions in each State for which members of the House of Representatives may be chosen, and the number to be chosen for each division.. It was necessary to pass that provision to make arrangements for the first election of members to serve in the Parliament of the Commonwealth. But now that we have passed an Electoral Act, and laid down a certain procedure defining the boundaries of divisions, the question arises whether the States Acts still hold good. The section continuesIu the absence of other provision, each State great deal more than we do about this shall be one electorate. It was clearly intended that, until other provision was made by the Parliament of the Commonwealth, the laws of the States Parliaments should remain in force, but, as we. have now passed an Electoral Act which provides that the boundaries of divisions shall be arrived at in a certain way, it is worthy of consideration whether the State Acts continued to be valid. That is a very serious matter, of course, but it seems to me that the main point is that the very principle upon which our Constitution is founded is intended to be attacked and negatived, because there is some objection to the proposed divisions. What is the only objection urged by the Minister against tlie report ? It is that he believes that the people in the country should have a greater voting strength than the people in the towns, man for man. learned member is deliberately misstating the case. busy taking up his new duties, that he will not allow me to finish. I was about to say that the honourable Minister also said that there had been a great rash of people from the country districts into the towns. If that is so, it is a wonder that we do not see them about. The streets of Melbourne would be all the better for a few thousand strangers will king about. I defy the oldest inhabitant of Melbourne to find many of these strangers here at the present time. You cannot have many people coming to Melbourne nowadays without some one noticing it. Where is the slightest trace of a single basis for the Minister's statement. We hear of people clearing out of Australia altogether. Somepeople may have gone to Ballarat and to other towns, but that kind of thing is happening at all times. If the new policy of the Government caused a great demand for artisans, that would, to some extent, cause the shifting of the population from the country to the towns, but if that took placewould it be proposed to disfranchise the men who went into the factories? That would be a new method of conducting the political affairs of the country. We know that the difference of 48,000, which the Commissioner makes in favour of the country electors, must cover any tendency of the kind mentioned. I admit that the representatives of Victoria must know a matter, but I think that it will be difficult toshow that the allowance made by the Commissioner of -almost 50,000 against the city in favour of the country would not cover any exodus of people to Melbourne, or to the country towns of Victoria. I should like some definite proof of this enormous transfer of population. In view of the objection raised, it becomes a very serious matter to notice that this distribution involves giving one seat more to the city electorates. I understand that there is a change to that extent. AVhereas formerly there were nine town and fifteen country electorates, tlie proportion would, under the new subdivision, be nine to fourteen. Surely, if the presence of human beings qualified to vote in a given area is proved, you cannot deprive them of their votes because they do not live in the country. The drought has been going on for a very long time, and if these people, who are supposed to have left the countiy, were living in the towns, they would have been placed upon the roll. The Act provides that a man can be transferred after living in any division for"" one month, so that these people would have been placed on some roll if they wereliving in Melbourne or Ballarat. Now, let us look at the effect of the introduction of the female franchise. The difference which I have mentioned of nearly 50,000 votes against thecity is on the basis of the female and malefranchise. I have a return here showing how the. women above the age of 21 arelocated, and there is such a marvellous difference between the number of women in certain parts of Victoria and those in other",34,Electoral Divisions Victoria

197,Mr Beid,"The Minister has been soparts that, since they have not been taken into account at all, there would be a wholesale disfranchisement of the females of Victoria. I have taken the five most populous -city electorates and the five least populous -electorates, in reference to women in the country. And here is the discrepancy : In the five city electorates there are 54,000 more women qualified to vote than in the five country electorates. be calculated in addition to the 50,000 -electors allowed by the Commissioner; -are these 54,000 women to be forgotten? 'The Commissioner has included women voters in his total, and upon his subdivision there is a difference of nearly 50,000 voters iu favour of the country and against the town. But if his proposals are disapproved the whole of, that will go by the board, and we shall have the original difference, which, -according to the figures for the last election, was again thousands and thousands in favour of the country. But, owing to the introduction of the female franchise, we have -a discrepancy like this aggregating the -original discrepancy : In the five most populous city electorates there were, according to the census of March, 1901, 101,000 women above the age of 21. ""We hope that the forthcoming election will take place at the end of this year, so that nearly two j'ears will have elapsed since the census, -during which the young women will have been growing up and becoming entitled to the vote. Girls of nineteen, when this return was made up, would be entitled to vote -at the next election. that men grew older and women did not. But the right honourable and learned gentleman is putting it the other way. the younger age imputed to them, but they do not care to be altogether ignored. A t any rate, we have imposed a duty upon them by our legislation, and it was intended when the vote was given that they should have an opportunity of exercising it . It would have been a mere mockery otherwise. A t the time the last census'was taken there were 101,000 women above the age of 21, and entitled to vote in the five most populous city districts, whereas in the five least populous country districts in respect to females the total number of women above the age of 21 and entitled to the vote, was 47,000. That is a difference of 54,000. Are these women also to be disfranchised in addition to the 40,000 or 50,000 men already given to the country; are these 54,000 women to be added to the discrepancy? I could understand it if we were going backuponall the planksof our platform. I should like to know what the labour party think of this. I understand that they have a plank which solemnly emphasizes the right of every man or woman to vote, Are these to whether he or she lives in Collins-street or. Gippsland. the plank. seems to think that the members of the labour party are asleep on this point. We shall see how far they can afford to sleep upon this issue-ho w far men who solemnly pledge themselves that all men and women shall have an equal share in the government of the country will be prepared to support a proposition that a woman living in the country shall have an opportunity of exercising a vote, whereas if she lives in the electorate represented by Mr Tudor she shall not have the privilege of voting for that honourable member. The principle I have referred to is not peculiar to the platform of the labour party, but it is embodied in the Statute law of the Commonwealth. We may strain at a gnat or two in order to prevent an extensive disturbance of the political situation, but there is always a point at which for some men the straining point becomes the breaking point. I am not oblivious of the fact that if I had not happened to be here I could not have wished for a better electioneering cry-if I were anxious for such a thingthan would be afforded if this proposal were carried. I could not have a more legitimateI do not mean a cry for party purposes-bu t a more legitimate ground of complaint against the majority of the members of this House and the Government than if they threw this principle to the winds. It is of no use to give the electors platitudes; they want to exercise their votes. It is of no use to say that the manhood and womanhood of Australia are enfranchised, if 40,000 electors in the city return one member, and 20,000 electors in the country also return one member.

It would appear that all the people who are not suffering from drought are not to have a vote, whereas all those who are suffering from drought are to have arrangements made so that they shall not only enjoy a vote, but shall have a larger voting power than those who are living in the city. That is a singular method of statemenship to adopt in settling the political rights of the people of Australia. the matter, except that I wish to be fair: honourable and learned member that we all want to be fair,, but that some of us have to regard the principles of the Constitution. The Commonwealth Constitution does not say that the honourable' member for Corio, or the honourable member for East Sydney, shall have the right to arrange things, so that they shall do what they think is fair. The Constitution does not talk in that way. It does not give us that power, but it gives the people the right tovote. It does not give us the old political power to so make our arrangements that thousands of electors shall not have the right to vote. right to do what is fair.. an equal share of political power ? platitudes upon the platform and the way iu which we talk in this House is truly astonishing. right honourable member. than I do. I have specially come to Melbourne on this occasion, because it is one which is altogether too important to warrant me in leaving Ministers in the dark as to my attitude, and afterwards criticising their actions. I wished to be here before thisproposal was carried, and, to avoid the possessionof the battle cry to which I have referred,. I am arguing now, not tliat I may have an opportunity of ventilating these ideas upon the hustings, but that there may be a settlement of this question which will prevent me from having that opportunity. I am prepared to take the f u l l responsibility of my action. There is. a difference here which invades the principle of equality. If we do not accept the subdivision which is recommended, with all its faults, we shall behumiliated by being forced to accept the electorates denned by the States Parliaments three years ago under a different franchise. Honourable members talk about, the fluctuation of population owing to thedrought, and yet they are willing to disregard the ordinary movements of population within the past three or four years.. When were these boundaries defined?. In 1900. This Commonwealth is now almost three years old. It includes hundreds of thousandsof personswhose names were never upon any electoral roll outside of South Australia. These marvellous changes have taken place. Yet they are not regarded. No ; but thepossibility that some unfortunate people in the drought-stricken areas have come to the city is the cry which is raised. Surely the fact that they have a city to which they can come ought not to deprive the residents of the metropolitan districts of their political rights ?

I have been pointing outi that there is a difference in the quota between town and country which represents 50,000 votes, and I submit that that is where we ought to make these' legitimate differences, and that they have already been made in the quota. The Electoral Commissioner, I assume, is a competent man, because he was appointed by the present Government. He had these matters before him, because, upon page 4, under the heading of "" Objections to distribution,"" he rjoints out the following objections,.which were received by him iu writing :Red notion of the number of country districts to fourteen, on the following grounds-(as ) That bhe statistics as to bhe number of elecbors residing in bhe counbry are unreliable. We should never arrive at finality in regard to the boundaries for the new electorates if we proceeded upon that basis. Another objection isThab, owing bo bhe drought, numbers of electors from country disbricbs have moved-pro bably only temporarily-to metropolitan centres. I hold that it is impossible to have an in1 cursion of 4,000 people into Melbourne without every person in the city being aware of it. Why, 4,000 new faces would create a sensation. Certainly we should hear something about the rents going up. my district. when that is so. I am satisfied that if a thousand electors moved into my honourable friend's constituency he would know all about them. No man representing an electorate could help becoming seized of a fact of that sort. There is absolutely no proof that there has been this remarkable exodus from the country districts to the metropolitan area. This generality, which satisfies the honourable member for Gippsland upon the present occasion, would not satisfy him when the fiscal question was being discussed. member himself spoke very differently upon the fodder duties. He spoke then of-the terrible distress of these people. He denies it now. was that these people were suffering-that they were out in the countiy fightingdreadf ul difficulties-no t that they had come into the sphere of theatres, trams, and public baths. MrA . McLEAN -The right honourable member does not admit that disaster will drive away population. population is driven away from one locality we are able to trace it . May I suggest to my honourable friend that a l l ' these statements about the removal of population will attend everyproposal fordividing the population for electoral purposes to the end of the world. When the cry of the drought is not raised something else will be. I have never yet seen a scheme of electoral boundaries which did not meet with disapproval. The question involved here is whether we shall practically take the political power out of our own hands and retur© it to the State 'Parliament of three years ago. Is the redistribution scheme which is recommended so bad that we must humiliate ourselves before the electors by admitting that we have not been able to carry out tbe provisions of our own Act, which gives us power to refer the scheme back to a non-political authority should it not meet with our approval 1 The Act saysIf either House of Parliament passes a resolution disapproving of any proposed distribution, or negatives a motion for bhe approval of any proposed distribution, the Minister may direct the Commissioner bo propose a fresh distribution of bhe Stabe into divisions, If the Ministeri n charge of this matter, being dissatisfied with the proposed bounI t is a good sign in a city daries, carried out the provisions of our own law and asked the House to send them' back to the Commissioner with an instruction to make a larger difference between people living in one part of Victoria and those resident in another, would they take the responsibility of a straight vote upon that question ?

226,Mr Reid,"I do, but I hold tliat whena distinction between the value of a country vote and that of a town vote,"" but do not let us make a farce of the most vital principle of the Constitution. Do not let us profess to give votes to every man and woman in Australia, whilst simultaneously we erect political fences so that the men and women in one part of the Commonwealth cannot have an equal chance with those of another part in returning a representative to this Parliament. This is a vital matter. The only way in which the voters can exercise a voice in the. government of the country is by the share which they have in the return of members to represent them. If equality is not to be found in this choice, it is to be found nowhere. If we are to have this inequality, why do we not provide that a man who is possessed of profound learning and who has a large stake in the country shall have another vote ? Why not elevate him a little above the man in his employment-hi s groom or his gardener ? Bat we have discarded an}' such principle. We have deliberately given the most ignorant man in the country the same political power as the most enlightened, and for very good reasons. The most ignorant man in the country, who is perhaps possessed of the fewest interests, is more likely to give a disinterested vote than is the individual who is interested in it up to his eyes. However, the day for arguing that question has passed. The matter which is now under consideration is"" W ill this House do something which will have the effect of taking away from the people of the Commonwealth a right which they at present enjoy."" We cannot divest ourselves of responsibility inthisinatter. The Minister for Trade and Customs makes no' secret about the matter. No honourable member can afterwards say"" I thought that if I disapproved of this scheme it would be referred back to a non-political source, and that a new scheme would be placed before us."" The Minister has been perfectly frank in his statements. He has declared that it is a choice between these recommendations and tlie State electoral boundaries with the number of voters within those boundaries. Surely, if we intend to revert to a State Act, and to the State-determined boundaries, we cannot help remembering that we are deliberately choosing under womanhood suffrage the same set of boundaries that obtained before the adoption of that suffrage. Is that the position which this Parliament desires to take up before one-half of the electors of Australia? In constitutional questions of governmentwhenever any serious disturbance is made in the franchise-the usual practice is to elect a Parliament upon the new basis. If ever there was an occasion when that principle should apply, it is when a larger number of ""electors have been added to the Victorian rolls than were there previously. Formerly there were 300,00o electors upon the Victorian roll, but under our Federal franchise there are 600,000, of whom 300,000 are women. Surely if ever Parliament should discharge what is its inherent duty, it should do so now. AVe say that we must have a High Court, an Auditor-General, and an Acts Interpretation A ct and yet we refuse to perform this great vital work of determining a new scheme of political distribution upon the basis of a new na-' ticnal franchise. That is a responsibility which honourable members may take; but I think that if they do they will find it a very serious one. I have spoken my mind with perfect frankness, and no one can say that I have not put the position of affairs to this House as fully as I can. If the Minister proposed to refer this distribution back, it . would be infinitely more reconcilable with our duty than is the proposal of disapproval coupled with a statement which means that if we carry the motion we shall leave the electors at the mercy of a set of boundaries established by a State authority before the creation of the Commonwealth and before women were admitted to the franchise of Australia. There is one other point to which I desire to refer. I doubt seriously whether, if this course were followed, a State like New South AVales or Victoria would allow such an injustice to be perpetrated. They have only to repeal the StateA c t and our basis has gone. The Minister for Trade and Customs may laugh. No doubt he is a great lawyer, But we know from his views on the franchise question that he is a bush one. Other honourable members, at all events, will not regard this point as a small one.. There is no provision that the laws of the States shall remain in force after we have legislated upon an electoral subject. Mr F. E. McLEAN It is also open to the States Parliaments to amend their electoral laws. <j»n deny the right of a State to amend its electoral laws. If we leave this matter to the Statesi t will be within the power of a State Parliament to repeal its local Act, and we shall then have no provision for delimiting the electoral boundaries. The words of the ConstitutionIn the absence of other provision each State .shall be one electorate9 means tliat in the absence of other provision in reference to the determination of the boundaries of electorates, each State shall be one electorate. If the States laws are repealed-and the States Parliaments have an absolute right to repeal them-ther e will be no provision existing in relation to the subject. Therefore, if we place ourselves in the humiliating position of leaving our electoral boundaries to a State law, and do the State electors an injustice, the State may retaliate by withdrawing its law. suffrage to which I have no objection. There being no other ' provision, the whole State would vote as one electorate. We cannot, however, go behind our plain duty because of possible contingencies of tliat sort. We owe a duty to the people of Australia to define in some method or other the electoral boundaries for the Federation. It is a duty more important to hundreds of thousands of the people of Australia than even the establishment of a High Court, that we should insure, that when the first opportunity of passing judgment upon the Federal Pauliament occurs, every voter shall have as fair a chance as possible of expressing his view. ' Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) The right honourable gentleman who has just resumed his seat has made a singularly earnest and impressive appeal to tlie House to reject the motion submitted by the Minister.

In appointing a State officer to prepare the outline of a scheme for the division of Victoria into Federal electorates, this House did not wholly abdicate its control over electoral matters. I contend that the House would I venture to assert be betraying its own best powers if it gave to any civii servant the uncontrolled right to delimit our electoral boundaries.

237,Sir John Quick,"He came over frommatter of convenience, this Parliament said that it would refer the question to a Commissioner, subject to the right of review, and surely we have a right to review the distribution. We have a right to review it according to the evidence to be taken into consideration, and that evidence is be found embodied in the Commissioner's report. The Commissioner states that he has received certain objections to the proposed distribution ! Provision is made in the Electoral Act for the reception of such objections, either from private individuals or public bodies, and it appears on the face of the report that objections have been lodged against this scheme under the provisions of the Act. What are those objections ? They go absolutely to the very root of this distribution. They are not merely directed to the exercise of the Commissioner's discretions ry power of allocating members according to population with an allowance above or below the quota. I , for one, should be prepared to admit that if the officer had exercised his discretion within his competency, aud there were no other fundamental objection lodged against the distribution, the case of those who objected to it would be much stronger than it actually is. But the objections are not based solely upon the exercise of the Commissioner's discretionary power. The preliminary objection, as set forth in the report, goes to the root of the data which was at the Commissioner's disppsal when making this distribution. The report sets forth thatThe following objects in writing were received by me, viz.:.1. Reduction of the number of country divisions to fourteen on the following grounds, viz.:(a) That the statistics as to the number of electors residing in the country-are unreliable . . . The officer does not in any way challenge the force or the ground-work of that objection. He merely says that he was bound to accept the data submitted to him. As a member of this House, I believe that the objection tliat the statistics as to the number of electors residing in the country submitted to the officer were absolutely unreliable is well founded. Evidence with regard to the point is embodied in the objections which have been submitted to the Commissioner ; and the House may, if it thinks fit, call upon him to produce the objections. As a member of this HouseI have received communications from electors and publicbodies throughout Victoria, stating that when the statistics were collected the population of the State was not in accordance with thenormal distribution. There had been an extraordinary disturbance and dislocation of the normal distribution of population. It is notorious that at the time of the collection of the statistics the drought-stricken districts of Victoria were almost depopulated, and that thousands of people who-, usually reside in country districts had been compelled temporarily to take refuge in Melbourne. That is the fundamental ob-. jection to this distribution. The electoral officer in charge o£ this matter does nob challenge the accuracy of that allegation. He merely says that he was bound absolutely to the figures submitted to him, and there can be no doubt that those figures did not fairly and properly .represent the normal distribution of the population of the State. That being so, I ask whether it would be fairto accept a distribution, based upon a return which did not show the usual distribution of population ? It would be absolutely unfair, and would amount to that very disfranchisement, so far as the people residing in country districts are concerned, which the leader of the Opposition said would occmin the city electorates. learned member any idea as to the number of people who left the country districts in consequence of the drought ? said to be very large, but there is no means. of ascertaining the actual figures unless a census be taken, or a re-collection of the names of the electors be made. mate ? Sir JOHNQUIC K Many of the countrj' districts of Victoria were absolutely depopulated, and cattle and sheep, which had not died in the drought-stricken centres, were driven to the western districts of the State. Therefore it would be most unfair to accept that as a fair time at which to divide the population for electoral purposes. The right honourable and learned member for East Sydney has pointed out that, upon the occasion of the Melbourne Cup meeting, there is an extraordinary influx of visitors to the metropolis from the country districts; but I ask would that be a fair time at which to divide the population? It is equally",40,Electoral Divisions Victoria

240,Mr Thomson,"Is there no rough estiunfair to make the division in a droughtstricken period such as has never beforeoccurred in the history of Victoria. It would be utterly useless to refer the proposed distribution to the Commissioner now, because, if we did so, he would have no new statistics to guide him in making any modification of his scheme. The distribution might effectively be referred to the Commissioner if arrangements were to be made for a new compilation of the electoral rolls; but is there time for that to be done before the end of the year, when, it is generally admitted, the elections for this House, as well as for the Senate, should take place? It is usespeeches such as we have had from the less to refer the scheme^to the Commissioner except subject to the conditiou that the population statistics shall be revised, and the lists of voters re-compiled. W it h regard to the constitutional position of our electoral law in the event of the motion being carried, tlie right honourable and learned -member for East S) dney has suggested that the laws of the States will either have no force, or may cease to have force. submit, however, that under section 108 of the Constitution the laws of the States will continue to have force until they are superseded by other provisions. Hitherto they have not been sosuperseded,and they will not be superseded until both Houses approve of new schemes of distribution. It has been suggested that the Parliaments of the States may repeal their laws. I do not think that there is much probability of that. I think the members of those Parliaments are quite satisfied to allow the present electoral divisions to remain. management of our affairs in their hands 1 discretion in disapproving of the Commissioner's scheme of distribution. be forced to approve of the Commissioner's distribution, and I hope that before we get rid of the existing electoral divisions we shall have an opportunity to deal; calmly and judicially, with a new scheme of distribution based on proper information. Mr E. E. McLEAN -Does the honourable and learned member say that section 108 of the Constitution prevents the Parliaments of the States from repealing or altering their laws 1 Sir JOHN QUICK the kind ; but if there is any doubt on the subject it will be easy for the Government to bring in a short Bill adopting the existing divisions. done. Sir JOHN QUICK I do not know that it is absolutely necessary to do that, but it would remove any doubt as to the constitutional position, and in the meantime a re-examination of the population statistics can be made, and a new distribution based upon them submitted for our approval. To my mind, the matter is one which can be dealt with without eloquent right honourable and learned member for East Sydney this afternoon, about the inviolability of adult suffrage. He has admitted that this is not a party question, and I submit that it is entirely within the discretion of the House to say whether the Commissioner's scheme shall or shall not be approved. I think that for the reasons contained in the objections which have I been received by the Commissioner, and altogether apart from the conflict of town and country interests, upon which I do not wish to dwell, we should pause before approving of the Commissioner's distribution. could quite understand the arguments of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, if this Parliament had not deliberately adopted a franchise which is entirely different from that upon which the electoral divisions framed by the States were based: Parliament has definitely decided, at the request of the Minister who has moved the motion now under the consideration of honourable members, that the franchise upon which the legislators of the Commonwealth are in future to be chosen shall be entirely different from that upon which they were chosen in the past. We, by our own Act, extended the franchise to almost as many more electors as there were previously on the rolls, and yet we are asked to allow a new Parliament, which may exist for a period of three years, to be elected on the old basis, which we have decided is an improper one. Surely no other Parliament was ever asked to place itself iu such a position. To do so means one of two things : Either that we do not now approve of the law which we have passed, and, instead of recognising that fact and repealing it , inI say nothing of tend to evade its provisions, or that we approve of it, but are incapable of carrying its",41,Electoral Divisions Victoria

I do not know upon whom the blame for that incapacity rests, butincapacity has been shown in thedawdling since the measure was passed before effective steps were taken to carry its provisions into operation; in the instructions that were given to the Governments of the States, allowing them to collect the list of voters, not on the Commonwealth franchise but on the State franchise, and in the discrepancies that occurred between the actual population as shown by the census and the number of the voters on the rolls. Now the Minister practically states that we have not time to carry the law into effect. Sir WILLIAM LYNE these schemes of distribution to the Commissioners ? The motion is a practical admission that we have not time to carry the law into effect. Sir There is plenty of time. take this position: that the Minister is deliberately departing from a law which Parliament has passed. He must accept one position or the other. I have given him credit for not wishing to deliberately evade the provisions of the Commonwealth Act, but if he accepts that position he must admit that there is not now. time, owing to the neglect and delay which has occurred, to provide for the holding of the next elections under that Act. If the Minister says that there is time, and that he has, for other reasons, taken the course which he asks us to approve, he is asking us to evade the provisions of a law which we have passed, and to submit ourselves for re-election upon a franchise which is entirely different from that which Parliament has sanctioned. The Minister himself introduced the Franchise B ill which provided for adult suffrage. He approved of the principle that women should -haye an equal voice with men in the election of members of the Commonwealth Parliament, and we agreed to it on his recommendation. Then he introduced an Electoral Bill which provided that there should be approximate]}' equal representation. He did not propose in that Bill to give a larger representation to country populations than was given to town populations. Sir WILLIAM LYNE No r do I propose to do so now. during the consideration of the Bill in Committee by the difference between one-fourth and one-fifth, and the .Minister accepted the amendment without division. But now, apparently because certain results are seen to follow from this provision which might have been anticipated at the time, the Minister desires to evade the Aot, his reason being that, owing to the drought, a great many of the country people of Victoria have been.driven to the coast, so that the number now residing in the country districts does not represent anything like their average 'population. That matter was brought before the Commissioner.

That is what they would be entitled to, but the Commissioner has actually given fourteen members to the country and nine to the city. He proceeds to sayAs, however, section 16 of the Act referred to grants a discretionary power to depart to tlie extent of one-fifth more or one-fifth less than the quota, and havingin view the recognised interests as between country and city, and tliat many electors in drought-stricken areas were temporarily, residing in the city, I deemed it prudent to exercise that power to a very large extent. There is a statement by the Commissioner that he has recognised the difference, and that he has allowed for it in the numbers which he has allotted to the city and country electorates. Apart from this, the facts show that he must have done so. The allowance makes a difference of about 48,000 votes to the city. The Commissioner was appointed by the Minister, and yet the Minister now seems to doubt his capacity. use of bringing the report before the House if we were compelled to abide by the Commissioner's recommendation 1 to do that.

I do not say for one moment that in that event they would not be more ably represented than they are at the present time, but tbere are certain considerations which warrant their action in opposing this proposal. The electorate of Echuca happens to comprise the irrigation districts of this State. It I was correct. was specially mapped out with a view to securing the proper representation of the irrigation interests of Victoria. The system is still practically in its infancy, and as it has to fight a very hard battle, my constituents naturally feel that with one representative, who is able to concentrate his attention on the work, thej' are in a much better position than they would. be if they were attached to different electorates, and had four or five members representing an area so large that their minds would be taken away from the subject of irrigation. This fact explains why the people of my electorate are so' strongly opposed to this proposal at the present time, while from other portions of Victoria there have come but very few complaints as to the readjustment of boundaries. My constituents feel that if the electorate is absorbed b j ' the surrounding divisions it will absolutelv lose its individuality, and that is another reason for their opposition to this proposal. I think that the change made by the Commissioner in regard to my electorate might have been avoided. I do not believe that when this House passed the Electoral Billi t contemplated anything further than the re-adjustment of boundaries. It certainly I have received numernever contemplated the making of ruthless changes in constituencies. I fail to see why we provided the margin of 20 per cent, if it was not intended to meet cases such as the one I am now putting before honourable members. That provision was either inserted in the Bill for a specific purpose or it was not. I understood that it was inserted in order that a margin might be allowed between the town and countrj' districts. before the House only as it presented itself to me at the time. in the clauses with that specific intention.

In the case of Victoria very special circumstances have arisen, and although the leader of the Opposition may scoff at the drought, and say that the changes which it caused in our population were, in reality, only normal changes, I venture to assert that he would not be prepared to go up to the northern districts of Victoria, which he recently visited, and repeat the speech that he delivered this evening. in New South Wales? the position, in Victoria. Doubtless at a later stage we shall have the experience of New South Wales put before the House. The drought which took place in Victoria was far too serious a matter to be ignored. I have travelled over miles and miles of country, and have found house after house empty. leaving their homes in the north in order to attend to their stock in Gippsland. I have found them also travelling their stock over all the roads in Victoria on which any grass was to be obtained. I have found whole families shifted, not only to Melbourne, as has been suggested this evening, but to various parts of the State, the women and children going wherever they could find friends to take them in. I have also found women, who in ordinary circumstances would have been on their farms, working as domestic servants and endeavouring to earn a few shillings to make some provision for their families. That has been the position of affairs in the north of Victoria, and now some honourable members would add to the hardships which the prolonged drought has entailed upon the men of the north political disabilities and injustice. impose political disabilities upon the women -we should be sure of our ground. My remarks not.deprive these people of their votes -in favour of country divisions. In New they would not be on the rolls for the district in which they lived. administering the Electoral Act ought to look to the last wish expressed by the No one House when dealing with the measure in order to ascertain the mature determination arrived at by us. The mature determination at which we arrived was that a margin of 20 per cent, should be allowed. The Comr missioner admits in his own report that in mapping out the electorates he allowed a margin because of the drought; but he could have avoided all this trouble by allowing a still larger margin. In doing so he would not have gone outside the four corners of the Act. The electoral census 0 was taken at a time when the drought was at its very worse stage. Most of the normal population of the north had left,, and helped to swell the returns for other districts. The names of many people residing in the north of Victoria now appear on the rolls for other divisions, and they will be deprived of their votes unless MrA . McLEAN -The names of those who were travelling on the roads will notappear on any roll. held all over the electorate of Echuca to protest against the change proposed to be I have found men and lads made, numbers of men have asserted that their names are on the rolls for other divir sions, and do not appear on the rolls for the district to which they have now returned. Honourable members are aware that the first inch or two of rain which fell after the prolonged drought made a great change in the northern districts of Victoria. It caused the farmers and others who had been forced to go elsewhere to return at once to their homes. But their voting power has been taken to swell electorates in other parts of the State. I was speaking recently to a man living near Boort, who, some two or three years ago, took the census for that district. He said that he had recently travelled over 30 or 40 miles of country, and had found that where-bu t a few years before-number s of people were living, scarcely a house was occupied. I take it that, before we make this great and fundamental change in our electoral system, apply specially to Victoria, where we have always been used to a margin being given",47,William Lyne No It Is Not Comprised In The Existing Country Divisions Would

304,Mr Mccoll,"No. A t many meetingsSouth Wales, on the contrary, no such principle has been recognised, and doubtless it is owing to that fact that honourable members from that State come to cross purposes -with us. Before we introduce so fundamental a change as this in our electoral system we should make sure that we are adopting an accurate basis. If we do not work on an accurate basis, -we shall simply give rise to even greater anomalies than existed under the old law. Many men who clamoured for equal representation would find when the new rolls were prepared under this scheme that they exhibited greater anomalies than were to be found in the old ones. We must remember that once we accept a change of this kind we shall not readily be able to detained the following reply :part from it. Once an electorate has lost its individuality it may never regain separate representation. Is the adjustment ofboundaries to be always at the whim of an official ? It seems to me somewhat extraordinary that some honourable members should be so ready and eager to place this House absolutely under the heel of one of it's own officials. If we intended to be guided simply by the"" Commissioner, why did we insert a provision in the Electoral Bil l that the distribution made by him should be submitted to us? Wasi t not intended that the House should be the final arbiter? Is the House to be ruled by one of its own servants? Isi t not to do what it believes to be right, independently of what any official may conceive to be his duty? The Commissioner looks, at the Act and says"" I cannot take the drought into consideration; I must be guided simply by the law."" And, having made his distribution, he hands over his scheme to the House so that we may do what we think fit with it. We should assert and maintain our supremacy as against any mere official. I wish to deal briefly with the mode in which the electoral census was collected. It was taken under a system entirely new to Victoria. In New South Walesi t has been the custom for many years to allow the police to collect the electoral census, and the men are, therefore, familiar with the work. When they were called upon to perform this service for the Commonwealth, they recognised that it was part of their duty, and they accepted it as such. Buti n Victoria the work was entirely new to the police, and they scarcely knew how to proceed with it. I know, froin 8K2 my own personal experience and from conversations which I had with the police, that they hardly knew how to go about the work. In a great many cases, no doubt, it was a distasteful duty, and the police were not very particular in their performance of it . Doubtless many of them carried out the work perfunctorily, and one cannot express much surprise, for it seems to be the fashion nowadays to hand over every new governmental duty to the police. I will give honourable members an instance A complaint was sent to me from the eastern portion of my district, where the drought was not so bad, that several names had been omitted from the rolls. I sent it on to the Electoral Department, and obWith reference to Mr H. Russell's communication to you of the 8th June, endorsed by you, in which that gentleman states that no one had called round the district to collect the names of females, I have to inform 3'ou that MountedConstable S. H. Marshall, who was intrusted with the duty, called at the house of Mr Russell, but, not finding any one at home, he received Mr Russell's name from a neighbour, and was advised that a number of females had objected to their names or information being afforded to the police for the purpose of enrolment. I sent that letter to the person who had made the complaint, and he wrote this letter30th July, 1903. In answer to letter received from you on 27th inst., I have been making inquiries, and find that there are nine families representing sixteen females over 2.1 years of age in this immediate neighbourhood where Constable S. H. Marshall did not call. He is altogether wrong in saying that he called here and found no one at home. 1 beg to say that there is always some of the family at home. I know that that statement is correct, because the man keeps a post-office at which considerable business is done, and his postal duties compel him to have some one always in the house to attend to persons who may have business to transact. The letters show how perfunctorily the rolls have been compiled. What is the result ? We find that in Victoria alone 40,000 names are unaccounted for. Is that to be wondered at when there are so many people driving their stock on the roads, and when the work of compilation has been done so perfunctorily ? Electoral-office been doing ? first attempt the Electoral-office has not done its work badly.",48,William Lyne No It Is Not Comprised In The Existing Country Divisions Would
305,Mr Joseph Cook,But what has the,49,William Lyne No It Is Not Comprised In The Existing Country Divisions Would
306,Mr Mccoll,"I consider that for aing 1,000 names lost sight of altogether ? that the statistics collected by the police afford a fair and accurate basis upon which to distribute the electoral divisions? I think that a close investigation would discover that most of the 40,000 names which are missing are the names of persons rer siding in the country districts, because it is so much more difficult to accurately determine the population of the country'than to accurately determine the population of the towns. Who will be hurt if the next elections are conducted on the present divisions ? It is all nonsense to. say that we are putting ourselves in the power of the States authorities. Honourable members opposite say that this is not aparty question, but their speeches have been party speeches, and no doubt, if a vote is taken, it will be a party vote. honourable members on the Ministerial side have arranged for a party yote. tions are over we shall be asking of the Opposition, with Hans Breitmann, "" Where is dot barty now ?"" Mv. SPEAKER member for Eden-Monaro not to interject. been said in any party spirit, nor to secure party interests ; but I hope that, for the .securing of the proper representation of the country, the distribution of the electoral division of Victoria will be left over until the seasons again become normal, and we can proceed upon an accurate basis. very fair way in which the honourable member for Gippsland opened the case for the representatives of the country districts of Victoria, it is a pity that the issue has been clouded by the introduction of irrelevant matter. The leader of the Opposition would, have given us an excellent speech if he had been merely advocating a .system of equal electorates; but his remarks contained a covert threat to those who might not fall in with his views. The question, with which he dealt was thoroughly thrashed out when the Electoral B ill was before us. One of the conditions which was introduced into that' measure by the honourable and learned member for Corinella was that existing -boundaries of divisions should be taken into consideration by the Commissioners in the demarcation of new divisions. But can that direction of Parliament be considered to have been carried out in the case of Victoria, in view of the fact that one of the existingdivisionsisomitted from theproposed distribution ? Considerable objection has been taken to the proposed distribution, on the ground that the recent drought considerably affected the location of population, but I think that even more objection is to be taken to it because of the way in which the electoral rolls have been compiled by the police. I , like other honourable members, know how greatly the drought has affected the population of the' country districts of Victoria, and especially of the districts in the northern part of the State; but I also know that the work of collecting the rolls was most inefficiently performed. I do not blame the police, because they had an almost impossible task. Besides, any one who knows what it is to ride long distances in the country, perhaps on a tired horse, seeking the names of persons living in one little settlement and another here elecand there, know how apt a policeman would be to shirk the duty, and to take other methods of arriving at the names of those residing in the district. I believe that I ask the honourable many names were obtained by the police by attending sales and small race meetings. I know that my own name was not collected, nor were those of some of the members of my family. Altogether, the system adopted has been a bad one, and I think that the Minister would have done better to take the census returns, making a fair estimate of the arrivals and departures', and divide the State accordingly. The leader of the Opposition spoke about the difference between the town and country electorates. According to tlie .police returns, the average difference is 4,441; but if the census returns had been adopted it would have been only 2,717. I do not think, however, that 4,441 is a very large difference, if-the conditions of the country districts are taken into consideration. Moreover, if the census returns had been taken, the additional number of country electors would have been 25,860, which would have been enough to make up another division. In my opinion, had the census returns been taken, the present arrangement of divisions would not have been much altered. The right honourable member also made a strong point of the difference caused by the introduction of",49,William Lyne No It Is Not Comprised In The Existing Country Divisions Would

312,Mr Ske Ne (Grampians),"Afte r thethe adult franchise, and he quoted figures to show the number of women enfranchised in certain town and countiy electorates. It is, of course, impossible to arrive at accurate figures in connection with any of these matters, and I do not think there has been much accuracy in the statements which have been made during the discussion; but, assuming that there has not been much alteration in the character of the population, whereas in my electorate there were formerly 10,200 electors, there will now be 21,441 electors, showing that 11,241 women have been added. I have, on more than one occasion in this chamber, pressed upon the Minister the desirability of collecting the names of the electors who are missing. ' I believe that most of them are in the countiy districts, and have been overlooked by the police. But if the rolls are to be compiled again, the work will take a long time to do thoroughly, and it would be impossible to get it done before the end of the year. I wish now to make one or two remarks in regard to the existing boundaries of the divisions. Like the honourable member for Gippsland, I have no reason to complain of the alterations which have been made. He says that the place where he went to school has been included in his electorate, and the place where I was born has been included in mine. Buti t appears to me that the Commissioner has not grasped the position so far as the boundaries of the divisions in the western district are concerned. The Grampian mountains have hitherto divided the electorate of the Wannon from the electorate of the Grampians, though they do not really count for much as a division. What really separates one place from another is want Of means of communication. Under the proposed distribution, however, the divisionof theGrampians has been run right up to the neighbourhood of Ararat, while the boundary of Wannon commences between Ararat and Dunkeld. If , instead of taking the Grampians as the line of boundary, some of the parish boundaries to the east of the railway line were adopted, the representative of the Wannon -electorate would be able to travel through his own electorate on his way west. If , however, this portion of the Grampians electorate were included in Corangamite, a round-about railway journey would be necessitated to reach it. Isee there are three parishes, Cooramook, Framlingham West, and Purnim, which j u t right into the Wannon electorate, and that seems to me to be a mistake. If the means of communication, and the facilities offered to members for travelling through their districts had been considered, the boundaries would have been very differently arranged. Originally Talbot, and a portion of the country around, was included in the Grampians electorate. A petition was sent in to the Commissioner in favour of having'that portion excised from the Grampians electorate and included in Laanecoorie, but a meeting held at Bupanyup iisked that it should still be retained in the Grampians electorate. That portion of my electorate has, however, also been included in the Wannon electorate. The result of the subdivision is to give the honourable member for Wannon 3,000 more votes than I have, whilst the number of electors in the Laanecoorie electorate has been increased to 25,000. Originally there were 24,000 electors in theGrampians electorate, and 23,000 in Laanecoorie. Now the number, of electors in the Grampians division has been reduced to 21,000, whilst those in the Wannon district have been increased to 24,000. I am making no complaint, and the objections which I have mentioned would not be regarded by me as obstacles in the way of the adoption of tlie Commissioner's recommendation; but, in view of action that may be taken in the future, I think it well to make known the information which I have submitted to the House. I believe that, in order to do justice to Victoria, either the distribution of the electorates should be left over t ill some future time, when we have returned to normal conditions, or some effort should be made to subdivide the State upon a fairer basis as regards population. I understand that there are 32,000 country electors and 5,000 town electors whose names have been missed.. If these had been placed upon the roll, the additional electors which would have been given to the country districts would have increased the net difference between the number of electors in the towns and those in the country by 26,000. I shall support the proposal of the Government. this question, I think it ought to be clearly understood that if. the House reject the distribution proposals, it will cast no reflection .whatever upon the Commissioner, or upon the officials who have assisted him in collecting information. No doubt the Commissioner and the various officers engaged",50,William Lyne No It Is Not Comprised In The Existing Country Divisions Would

He points out that he has had various objections sent to him in relation to the reduction of the It country divisions to fourteen. The first three of these objections are stated as follows :(a) Thatthe statistics as to the number of electors residing in the country are unreliable. (1>) That, owing to the drought, numbers of Exclusive electors from country districts have moved-probabl y only temporarily-to the metropolitan centres. elec(c) That a very large proportion of persons entitled who have been accidentally omitted from tlie returns are country residents, and that the number so omitted is almost great enough to form a quota for a division. What is his answer? I am not dealing with the other objections to which he furnishes a clear and satisfactory answer, but, with regard to these which go to the very root of the matter, this is-his answerThatI must be guided by, aud can aot only on, the official number of electors furnished by the Department of Home Affairs. In other words, he inferentially saysHowever convinced I may be that the objections are well founded ; however satisWe considered that the disfied I may be from my own knowledge of the States into electoral gathered'as a citizen of this country, and from the evidence brought before me by those who are directing my attention to these objections, I am utterly unable as a But it was thought better to Commissioner to take any notice of that information.

Are we to start a -new census all through the countiy? That would be a very risky proceeding in view -of the approaching elections. We might have to hurry the matter, and we might not -obtain any more reliable information than we have now, and the House would then have to hurriedly decide what should be -done. I consider that the Government have taken the right course. They have told us in effect that there are only three courses which can be adopted. The first is to approve of a proposal which is obviously -unjust, and which although attributable to no one as a fault, ought not to be imposed -upon the State of Victoria for a period of -three years. The next course is to remit the report back to the Commissioner, and I -agree with those who believe that it would -he idle to remit the matter back for reconpopulation has recently taken place that sideration upon the same unreliable materials we urge that the distribution scheme re--as those available in the first instance. The third course to adopt, is to decide that -for the next three years we shall retain the same electoral divisions as we have had for the past three years. I wish to say one word with regard to some observations which fell from the leader of the Opposition, and which formed, I think, practically the key-note of his speech. He eaid that we had enfranchised the women -of Australia, and ought not to deny -them the grant that we had accorded them. I agree thoroughly with him, but I think that when he proceeds to -apply that proposition he made a great -mistake. He said in one breath that we had placed women upon the same platform -us men, and then he went out'of his way to ask how the women were represented under the present electoral divisions, not as electhe Commissioner. Whilst they all agree tors, but as women. I take it that that was a wrong basis to adopt. We are no -longer to consider how men are represented -proportionately with men, or women proportionately with women, but how the men and women are represented proportionately and indiscriminately as electors. They are no longer men and women for electoral pur-poses, but citizens. Each one is an electoral unit-se x has nothing to do with it. ,It is entirely beside the question,.now that women are placed on the rolls, to consider how the women of the town are represented as compared with the women of the. country, or how the men of the town are represented as compared with the men in the country. Any argument based upon any such considerations is a fallacy. Weeannot do what we should like. We cannot mete out exact justice. But we are not departing one iota from the principles of the Bill, or from the rule laid down in it . We are doing no more than is contemplated by another section of the . Acb, namely, section 23, which provides that the divisions in the States may be re-arranged from time to time as occasion may require. Let us suppose that we adopted these divisions, and that within two years, owing to the discovery of a gold-field or to any other natural cause, the population shifted from one part of the State to another. What would the Government do? Un doubtedly they would bring down a proposal for a re-arrangement of the divisions. It is because such an abnormal change of commended by the Commissioner, to the best of his ability, is not a just one. learned member think it would be wise to alter the boundaries within two years if such a change took place ? upon circumstances. It would depend upon whether the arrangement of the population required it . The course proposed by the Government is, in my judgment, the nearest approach to what is best for Victoria and Australia at the present, moment. presentative of Victoria who has addressed the House upon this subject has favoured the proposal of the Government to disapprove of the boundaries recommended by that Mr Morrison is a very capable officer, and whilst they attach no blame to those who were charged with the duty of collecting tlie electoral returns, there is a unanimity amongst them in rejecting the scheme submitted. I venture to say, however, that the Commissioner has done good work, aud that no scheme produced would suit some of the honourable members of this House. Some honourable members have contended that, under the scheme submitted by him, the country districts have been unfairly treated; and have read the first three replies given by the Comhjissioner to",52,William Lyne No It Is Not Comprised In The Existing Country Divisions Would

319,Mr Tud Ob (Yarra),"-S o far every rethe objections sent to him, but none of them have proceeded to the fourth reply, where the Commissioner himself declaresI ha\'e taken advantage largely of the margin of 39,315 persons at the collection of the: allowance, and that if the margin of allowance had been departed from to the full extent of one-fifth less than the quota for the country divisions, the number of electors remaining in the city would have been such that with eight divisions only in the city, the one-fifth margin of allowance above the quota would have been exceeded. .Had the Commissioner kept to the margin of allowance to the ful l extent allowed, I venture to say that the electoral boundaries suggested would have required rearrangement within a period of three years. I might instance the electorate of Jika in this connection. Settlement in that district is increasing very rapidly, chiefly owing to the construction of a new railway, and I am positive that before another election could take place the residents there would exceed the quota, and another redistribution would have to take place. Mr Morrison addsThere are 253,709 electors in the city ""area as out that there was no need to adopt fresh proposed ; and if eight divisions were provided, the average number of electors in each would be 31,713, or an average of 1,133 above the maximum margin of allowance under the law. figures are accurate. urged no objection to this scheme, save that owing to the drought there has been an exodus of people from the country districts to the metropolitan area. The honourable member for Gippsland has declared that as the result of the drought in the north of Victoriai t is not necessary to niter the electoral boundaries of Gippsland, which is in the south. But I would point out that there are at least five or six electorates which have not been affected by drought. These include the electorates of Flinders, Gippsland, Corangamite, Mernda, and Wannon. Their boundaries, it is urged, should not be altered simply because the population within the metropolitan district has increased and because it previously possessed sufficient representation. I do not think the metropolitan area has ever had fair representation. Further, I would point out that, according to the, census which was taken two days after our election to this House, there are 70,705 persons in my electorate, and only 44,000 in Gippslanda difference of 26,000. The honourable member for Echuca declared that, in the Wimmera district, the police who were charged with the collection of the censusfound that a great number of the housesthere were empty. It contained only census. If we adopt the scheme which has been recommended by Mr Morrison, it isurged that we shall not do justice to th<* people of Victoria. I maintain that thatscheme will give greater satisfaction to thegeneral public than will the old electorates. Flat. in Colling wood Flat are just as much entitled to representation as are the 30,000 residents in the irrigation district, who do not pay their debts, and who had to get them wiped off by the State Parliament. The Minister for Trade and Customs hasdeclared that if we reject the proposed boundaries they will not be returned to theCommissioner for revision. The honorable and learned member for In di also pointed electoral boundaries for three years. If we listen to arguments of that description we shall have a repetition of the existing state of affairs for an indefinite period, because the evil day will be postponed as long as possible. I am in favour of the schemerecommended by the Commissioner, notwithstanding that my electorate has been reduced by about one-fourth, and that I havemany friends living in the portion that has been cut off. However, it is palpable that there is no chance of the proposed boundaries being adopted. I shall, however,, insist upon a division being taken, even if I have to submit an amendment. Somehonorable members contend that the country should have a larger measure of representation than the city. But I would point out that the honourable member for Kooyong and myself represent 72,.364 electors as against72,271 electors in the districts of Wimmera,. Indi, Echuca, and Gippsland. Is that just? Can any honourable member say that the country is entitled to such a proportion as that ? Reference has been made to the fact that the police in collecting the rolls overlooked some 40,000 voters, and that the majority of these were country electors.

In view of what is offered in its stead, I do not think we should reject it . Various contentions have been put before the House. We have had what I might describe as the drought argument, the gum-tree argument, and the want of capacity argument urged against the adoption of this scheme. We were told by the honourable member for Gippsland that the drought in Victoria was a most disastrous one, and that the House should extend its sympathies to all who had suffered by it . Some eight months ago certain honourable members sought to relieve the droughtstricken settlers and graziers of New South Wales by obtaining a remission of the fodder duties. But the honourable member for Gippsland declined then to recognise that they were entitled to our sympathy. MrA . McLEAN them. is not relevant to the question before the Chair. simply with a view of showing the weakness of the drought argument. The honourable member for Gippsland said that the country was entitled to greater representation than was the town, and the Minister for Trade and Customs has told us that he has always held the opinion that the country should have greater representation than the city electorates. able member said that one elector living in the country should be equal to two-residing in the city. should not exaggerate the statement that was made. ber should put it fairly and straight. straight as the honourable member has everput any question.

I should like to draw tlie attention of honourable members to the powers which are conferred upon the Parliament by the Constitution.' They show no distinction between town and country. Our power to impose taxation bears equally upon individuals resident in town and country.. I am very glad that the honourable member for Yarra, as a representative of labour, has taken up a stand in favour of the schemeSpeaking on behalf offchepeople of Richmond and Collingwood, he inquired whethertheir desires and aspirations were not entitled to as much representation in this. House as were those of the people of Corangamite? Much has been said of personal friendships, but . in the Federal, arena we have no room for the consideration of such matters. The Federal Parliament will always be noted for the fact that it pays no regard to purely personal considerations. I have no personal interestI sympathized with in the adjustment of the Victorian electorates, and I could well understand a proposal to return the distribution to the Commissioner if honourable members who represent Victoria were dissatisfied -with it . TheI am referring to it Minister, however, will not allow the distribution to be sent back to the Commissioner. He declares that we must revertto the old system, and he is prepared to bringin a Bill to give effect to that proposal. When the Electoral Bill was before us it was urged that the many anomalies associated with the Victorian electorates warranted the passing of a Federal measure. We passed that Bill, and a Commissionerwas appointed to arrange the distribution In other words, the honorof this State. He has done the work, and has presented us with his report. I do not say that we are bound to accept his distribution, but I contend that if we are dissatisfied with it we should send it back to him for reconsideration. We certainly should not revert to the old system, about which somany complaints were made when theElectoral Bill was before us.

We gave him power to include in a city division 10,000 electors in excess of the number in a country electorate, and I consider that that margin is a reasonable one.

The Minister is responsible for the acts of his officials, and if he failed to impress upon them the importance of expediting this work the fault rests not with the House,-but with the honourable gentleman. So far as the New South Wales distribution is concerned, I have sent in no objection to the Commissioner. The old divisions would have suited me much better than do the new ones, but I intend to support the scheme, unless good reason can be shown for its rejection.

I realize the difficulties which have confronted the Minister, and am prepared to recognise the disabilities under which the Commissioner has had to work. I would like to point out, however, that the Victorian Electoral law has hitherto recognised that countrydistricts are entitled to more representation on a numerical basis than are the metropolitan districts. Constitution has abolished that distinction. not be forgotten that we are dealing now with people who have been living under a law which made that distinction."" I recognise that, so far as the Commonwealth elections are concerned, the position is now different. The matter, however, was brought under the consideration of honourable members M'hen the Electoral B ill was before us. ""While the Minister, in introducing that Bill, stated clearly and distinctly, in reply to the honourable member for Gippsland, that he intended to make the electorates equal, the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella in regard to the margin which was to be allowed, showed that honourable members are of opinion that special consideration should be given to the rural districts. been given to them is so, and it was the intention of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, and of those who supported him, that that should be done.

I do not find sufficientcause for quarrelling with the recommendation of the Commissioner on that ground,, however.

Eailing the -possibilitj* of referring the distribution to theCommissioner, I shall vote for the disapproval of it . In the division of the Stateelectorates of Victoria, a 'source of discontent has always existed in the fact that for a distance of 45 miles the north-eastern railway line has been used as a boundary between two electorates. It is the only casein which a railway line is so used in Victoria. Now, it is laid down in the Commonwealth Electoral Act that community and diversity of interest, means of comI recognise that that munication, and physical features shall betaken into consideration by the Commissioners. I am not quite clear what view the Victorian Commissioner took of the meaning of "" community of interests,"" but, notwithstanding a vigorous protest from theelectors in the district to which I refer, hehas accentuated the trouble by using theline as a boundary for a distance of 90 miles, so that the sixteen railway townships between Avenel and Yarrawonga areeach of them severed, and belong partly to one electorate and partly to another.

As all these townships are in what is practically a farming district, they have, of course, community of interests, and I would have no fault to find with the .scheme on that ground. , But the complete severance of centres of population whose -commercial trainingand political interests re-quire that they should not be severed is such a serious thing that, on that ground alone, I think that the scheme of distribution .should be referred to the Commissioner for further consideration. boundaries of the new division of Kooyong take away a large number of electors whom, if I were to study my personal interests, I should be very sorry to lose. In the new division there will be 15,599 male -electors and 21,388 female electors, or 5,789 more female electors than male -electors. Inasmuch as prior to the conferring of the franchise upon women, and -since that time, I have expressed the belief that thej' would be better off without having the responsibility of voting cast upon them, it will be seen that my position is a peculiar one. I do not think that the Minister has satisfactorily explained to the House why there has been so much delay in putting the report of the Commissioner before us. In my opinion his Department -deserves condemnation. I think that the proper step to take -with regard to the -Commissioner's proposed distribution is to refer it to him for revision. If we were to refer the report back to the Commissioner, it would be impossible for him at the last moment to give proper consideration to the re-adjustment of the boundaries. I say in all frankness that I do not attach the same importance as do some other honourable members to the effects of the -drought in depleting the country districts of population. But at the same time. I should . be very sorry to see the slightest injustice -done to those who are engaged in the great producing industries of' the country. It would be a great calamity if the interests of the country residents were ^sufficiently represented in this House. That is my sole reason for supporting the Government on this -occasion. I thought that the Commissioner was instructed to take into consideration the means of communication between different parts of the country, because these have an important bearing upon the number of votes recorded. I find, on reference to tlie Statistical Register, that some very interesting figures are given with regard to the percentage of votes recorded in various metropolitan and country electorates. In Yarra, which has a. total population of 70,6S0, and I5,S59 electors on the roll, 61 per cent, of the electors recorded their votes at the last election. The figures for the other electorates were as follow :-Wimmera, 48 per cent.; Wannon, 60 per cent. ; Southern Melbourne, 60 per cent.; Northern Melbourne, 54 per cent.; Moira, 50 per cent. ; Mernda, 50 per cent. ; Melbourne, 60 per cent. ; Laanecoorie, 57 per cent. ; Kooyong, 63 per cent.; Indi, 58 per cent.; Grampians, 49 per cent. ; Gippsland, 46 per cent. ; Flinders, 58 per cent. ; Echuca, 54 percent.; Corio, 54 percent.; Corinella, 56percent.; Corangamite, 48 percent.; Bourke, 64 per cent, and Ballarat, 46 per cent. The percentages for Port Melbourne and Bendigo are not given. It will, therefore, be seen that on the average 55 per cent, of votes were recorded, and that, contrary to expectation, those recorded in the country approach very closely to the percentage of votes recorded in the city electorates. I regret that the Commissioner did not see his way to include Oakleigh in the Kooyong electorate. The town of Oakleigh is essentially a suburb of the city, and it can have no community of interest with the other portions of the division with which it has been associated, and which extends right away to the Murray. I am sure that the Commissioner had a most difficult task to perform, and that he endeavoured to adjust the boundaries in a just and equitable manner. Therefore, although I take exception to his action in regard to Oakleigh, I do not wish it to be understood that I am in any way reflecting upon the ability or the care which he bestowed upon his .work. Apart altogether from the technical questions raised by the leader of the Opposition and.others, I am supporting the Government in the belief that it is desirable that the producing interests of the country should be fully represented in this House. Mr F. E. M c LEAN (Lang) -The House is engaged in discussing one of the most important subjects that could engage the attention of Parliament.

370,Mr Knox (Kooyong),"The proposedof the Electoral Act. The Minister appears before us in a very extraordinary character. He was the author of the Electoral Act, which imposes a solemn responsibility upon the Electoral Commissioner. The Minister appointed the Commissioner to undertake these .responsibilities, and now calmly asks us to set aside .the work that has been done upon his statement, unsupported by any evidence, that there has been a great movement of population from the country to the metropolis. Sir WILLIAM LYNE strongly supported by figures. Mr E.. E. McLEAN -The honourable member did not quote anyfigureswhatever to show that there had been any great transfer of population from the country to the city. Mr P. E. McLEAN -The honourable gentleman gave us particulars as to the number of voters, but he did not give us any figures whatever to support the statement that there had been an exodus of population from the country, districts, and that the metropolis had been to a large extent benefited by that movement. The Minister must have known perfectly well when he introduced the Franchise Bil l extending the franchise to women that it would lead to a very large increase of voting power, so far as the metropolis is concerned, and honourable members must have been rather surprised to find that the work of redistribution made the difference of only one electorate in favour of the city as against the country. We were inclined to suppose that the overwhelming proportion of female voters in the city would have made very much more difference. Although only one electorate had been added to the metropolitan constituencies the Minister asks us to repudiate our own work. He asks us to perpetuate the present conditions knowing that there are disparities of population, and that the present boundaries are not suited to the circumstances of. the Commonwealth under the altered franchise. The Minister gained a great deal of political renown as the author of the Franchise Act, which conferred on women the right to vote. If I recollect aright, the ladies of Sydney presented him with a beautiful snuff box, or some other ' handsome testimonial, as a recognition of his splendid services in endowing them with the right to vote. The Minister did not, however, tell the women of the Commonwealth on that occasion that he intended to put the women of the country in a much better position than those of the town; that he proposed to ignore the principle of one vote one value, which is embodied in the Constitution. The honourable member is the author of all the Acts which establish that principle, and now he has the hardihood to tell us that he never believed in the electors of the city having the same voting power as the elector of the country. ««. My statement was Sir WILLIAM LYNE I did not say anything of the kind, but I quoted figures to show what was done in other parts of the world. Mr F. E. McLEAN -The Minister may not have said so in so many words, but hemade a strong appeal in favour of greaterproportional representation for country electors. If 10,000 voters in the country can return one member, whilst it requires15,000 or 20,000 voters to elect one member in the metropolis, is that not equivalent togiving greater voting power to the countryelectors ? Sir WILLIAM . LYNE I said that it was. the practice in other parts of the world to give greater voting power to country electors than to city electors, but I do not think I mentioned that as my opinion. Mr F. E. McLEAN -The Minister said that he had always been of that opinion, and his history shows that what he stated was true. His present attitude is quite consistent with that which he adopted when the Elec? toral Act of New South Wales was passed.. The honourable gentleman stated clearly and emphatically that he had always been in favour of giving the country elector greater voting power than the city elector. If he did not say that, I must be dazed. Hequoted other countries where the sameprinciple had been adopted. Sir WILLIAM LYNE It seems of no usefor me to deny the statement, but it is not correct. man made the statement when he introduced the Electoral Act. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I know I did, but not to-night.

372,Mr Thomson,"The honourable gentleof the country electors. It was never intended for any such purpose. MrA . McLEAN -Does the. honourable member recollect the amendment which was moved by the honourable and learned member for Corinella for that purpose ? Mr F. E. McLEAN --There was a contention that we should recognise the principle that had been followed in the State of Victoria, that there should be one quota for the city electorates and a different quota for tlie country electorates. But there was no understanding that the country electors were to have a 20 per cent, advantage in the arrangement of the areas. MrA . McLEAN -That was the object of the amendment. Mr F. E. McLEAN -Not at all. We laid down the principle that community of interest should be taken into consideration in the distribution of electorates, and knowing that it is not always possible to keep these interests in view and at the same time to divide the country into areas equal in population, the Commissioner had to be allowed to exercise some discretionary power. The Electoral Commissioner himself, in his report, states that this discretionary power has been exercised in the interests of the country electors. On the first page of his report he saysIn view of the fact that the quota of electors is to be the basis of distribution, the area comprised in the existing country divisions would be entitled, strictly speaking, to about 12J members, aud,the city to aboutjlOi members. As, however, section lb' of the Act referred to grants a discretionary power to depart to the extent of one-fifth more or one-fifth less than the quota, and having in view the recognised interests as between country and city, and that many electors in drought-stricken areas were temporarily residing in the city, I deemed it prudent to exercise that power to a very large extent. The Electoral Commissioner himself says that he has given every consideration to the loss of population by the country districts, owing to the drought, and has availed himself of the discretionary power allowed to him. But what is the demand that has been set up by honourable members who wish to give a greater voting power to country electors ? It is that there have been thousands and tens of thousandsI should not have been surprised if it had been said hundreds of thousands-of electors who have left the drought-stricken areas and congregated in the cities. Does any honourable member seriously believe that there are tens of thousands who had left the country and were residing in Melbourne and suburbs at the time the Commissioner was doing his work ? MrA . McLEAN A great number were travelling with stock in the southern dis-r tricts. Mr F. E. M c LEAN A considerable number of people are always travelling in the country, whether in times of drought or in times of plenty. The provision of which the Commissioner says he has availed himself liberally, covers all the requirements that have been insisted upon during the course of the debate. Yet we are asked solemnly to set aside all the work that the Commissioner has done, andto perpetuate the anomalies that exist under the present scheme of distribution. power to' Parliament to ratify the distribution, put in the Act if it is useless ? Mr F. E. M c LEAN It was wise and proper to provide that the final power shouldrest with Parliament. argument means that the power should not be there. Mr F. E. McLEAN -The honourable member has not grasped what I intended toconvey. I contend that as a matter of policy the Government, unless they can show that the work of the Commissioner has been badly done, and that he has not performed his work faithfully and well, arehonorably bound to stand by his work. not give them "" a show "" to do that. Mr F. E. McLEAN -They do not want "" a show "" to do it . They want "" a show ' r to depart from the work of the Commissioner. I fully recognise tliat the final power must rest with Parliament of rejecting or adopting the scheme. I do not find fault with the Government for bringing it before Parliament. WhatI object to is the attitude of the Government in repudiating the work of their own hand. The Government cannot escape from their responsibility for what the Commissioner has done. If the House likes to reject the work, it is open to them to do so, after f u l l consideration, and on the ground of public policy. But the Government are bound to stand by the work of their Commissioner.

McLEAN -The Government -do not think the work is bad, and they cannot think so, unless they wish to cast a stigma on their officer, AVe are told that the statistics and information furnished to the officer were all wrong; but if that -be so, the responsibility rests with the Department for Home Affairs, from which the information was supplied. Any re, flection on the Commissioner must only ""come home"" to the Government themiselves, because they are responsible for -the data on which he framed his report. I have never before known a Ministry come -down with a motion to set aside the work of their own hands. The whole of the provisions under which that work was done are contained in an Act introduced by the -Government themselves, and surely they ought to see that those provisions are carried -out. The only good reason they Can give for not approving of the suggested distribution is that they wish the next election to take place under the old arrangements, with no -alteration of existing boundaries. I can quite understand that most of us would be a great deal better pleased to let the electorates, remain as they are. Honourable members, having won their seats on the present electoral distribution, have no anxiety to disturb the conditions; and it would be the easiest thing in the world to let the proposed distribution fall through, and have the next elections under the old arrangement. Is that the way in which the Commonwealth Parliament are.to be asked by the guardians of the Constitution to do its work 1 The most remarkable thing in the discussion is that it is the guardian angels of the Constitution-honorabl e members who have always posed as high constitutional authorities and exponents of federalism-wh o ask us to put on one side our own electoral arrangements, and fall back on the mere makeshift that was supplied by the States Parliaments, in order to carry out the first Federal elections. One of the first duties of the Federal Parliament, in its legislative capacity, was to provide machinery for carrying out the next elections. AVe knew perfectly well that the arrangements made by the States were only tempprary-that they were only a makeshift at the very best-and yet it ' is proposed . to perpetuate those arrangements with all the incidental anomalies. If there had been no female franchise introduced, there were such anomalies in the various electorates tliat a redistribution was imperative; but, by reason of the enormous increase of voting power in some of the States, by reason of the extension of the franchise to women, a redistribution has become doubly imperative. Now we are met by a request from the first Federal Government in Australia, who should have been most loyal to the Constitution, and the first to carry out their own Acts, to repudiate our own work and fall back on temporary and unsatisfactory arrangements with all their anomalies and inequalities. The whole position is degrading to Parliament;' and it is not to be wondered at thatthepeopleof the Commonwealth are gradually losing faith in parliamentary institutions. Such an attitude on the part of the people is not to be wondered at when they see the way in which great principles are trifled with, and the way in which laws made by this Parliament itself are ruthlessly set aside and trampled on by the Government of the day. AVe passed an electoral law, and provided for the distribution",61,William Lyne H E Said Nothing Our Electoral Laws Are Improperly Adminis
376,Mr Austin Chapman,"Even if it wereof the various States into electoral areas. Under the authority of that law we commissioned certain officers to map out those areas ; and yet the Government of the day, who are responsible for the legislation, and are responsible for'the work of the Commissioner, now seek to set it aside. What sort of responsible government is it when we have Ministers repudiating the work of their own high officers who have only literally carried out the mandate of an Act of Parliament ? Is that not trifling with the legislation we have passed ? It is most unfortunate that the affairs of this Commonwealth should be in. the hands of a Government who have so little regard for the principles of the Constitution and of the Acts they have themselves induced Parliament to pass. There will be an election probably within very few weeks or months, and, after an existence of two years and a half, we have to confess that we are not in a position to go to the country under our own Electoral Act, and with electoral boundaries established by ourselves. As the Minister admitted this afternoon he will have to come to Parliament in order to have the electoral boundaries fixed by the States Governments made legal, while time which might have been profitabty occupied in dividing the States has been wasted. I . trust the House will reject the motion submitted by the Government. I do not know whether the honourable member for Yarra was speaking with authority when he said he thought the motion was certain to be carried, and that it was almost useless to speak in opposition to it . I hope that honourable members who assisted to pass the Electoral Act will regard it as their duty to see that its provisions are carried out, and that the work of the Commissioner is not set on one side. I know that it is quite open to Parliament in its judgment to reject the scheme, but it is unfortunate and humiliating that we should be asked to do so by the Government at whose instance we passed the Electoral Act and appointed the Commissioner whose work they now seek to destroy. will come as a great surprise to the admirers of the Minister for Trade and Customs to find that he is not going to stand by his officers. If there is one thing for which the Minister is given credit more than another, it is standing by his officers who carry out instructions. 8L introduced a Bill which was passed, and in which certain instructions were given to a Commissioner appointed by himself. When the result of the Commissioner's work is laid before Parliament, although the Minister has the opportunity of returning the report with further definite instructions from this Parliament, he takes the opposite course of asking us to reject the scheme of this capable officer. The arguments which have been brought forward repeatedly in favour of the rejection of the proposed distribution are quite consistent with the arguments used when the Electoral B ill was before the House some time ago. The honourable member for Gippsland is quite consistent. Upon that occasion he made a vigorous and telling speech from his point of view in favour of giving greater representation to the country than to the metropolitan districts. To-day he has practically repeated his arguments. The honourable and learned member for Indi, in reply to a question as to whether he thought it would be wise to make a redistribution of the electoral boundaries within a period of two years should some migratory change occur in the population, declared that it would depend entirely upon circumstances. The Minister for Trade arid Customs says that, owing to the prevalence of drought conditions, population has drifted from the country into the large centres. But I have before me a list of districts in Victoria which were not affected by drought. They include the electorates of Corangamite, Corio, Elinders, and AVannon. Some of the largest districts in this State were not affected by the recent drought. . We are told that population has drifted to the city. That, to some extent, however, is no new thing. Months ago, before the drought was so acute in Victoria as it subsequently became, Senator Pulsford adduced figures to show that in the cities of this State there would be a larger aggregation of women than there would be in the country. If one travels through the rural districts, he will find that the domestic servants employed in' the city are to a large extent recruited from those districts. Therefore, it is only natural that in tlie large centres the women will predominate. As we believe in the principle of equal representation, I hold that under this redistribution scheme one vote should represent one value. Those who profess to The honourable gentleman be strong democrats, and who to-day pose as",62,William Lyne H E Said Nothing Our Electoral Laws Are Improperly Adminis

I am glad to say that in common with him I enjoy the confidence of that association, and am the accredited representative of that body, a fact Which goes to prove that it is not a protectionist organization. If the Minister wishes to do justice to those women, he should refer this scheme back to the Commissioner with instructions to revise it , and return it to Parliament at the earliest posson has done his work extremely well. The electorates, as shown on the map, are most compact. Since he has discharged his duty so faithfully, it would be wrong to reject his scheme.' I regret that an impression is entertained by some honourable members that the work of this Parliament relating to the distribution of seats should be done by the States Legislatures. To my mind, it is our duty to see that the scheme of redistribution is effected according to Federal ideas. A little members will look at the map of either time ago some representatives of Victoria laid special emphasis upon the fact that Federal officers had not been employed to do certain work for the Commonwealth. I agreed with those honourable members, and now hold that our own officers should be intrusted with this work. I appeal to honourable members not to lightly reject the work of our own officials, and adopt that of the States Parliaments, which is admittedly imperfect, and is not in accordance with the provisions of the A ct that we have passed. MrM c C AY (Corinella) I desire to point out to the honourable member who has just resumed his seat that he has fallen into the same error as the leader of the Opposition, in assuming either that in the existing electorates in Victoria and New South Wales, or in the proposed subdivision, an attempt has been made to differentiate between male and female electors. I find it difficult to follow the reasons which have been advanced for the purpose of showing that the existing electorates or the proposed districts in either Victoria or new South Wales will be affected by the sex of the voters in those constituencies. I desire to say a word or two in reference to some statements which were made by the honourable member for Lang at the time the Electoral Bill was under consideration. The honourable member seems to have Of late years'the Minister for Trade altered his view about the intention of the Act, because when these clauses were under consideration in their amended form, and the honourable member for Parramatta moved to omit as one of the considerations to guide the Commissioner "" the existing boundaries of divisions,"" the honourable member for Lang saidI hope the amendment will not be pressed. It appears to me that the quota and the margin are ample safeguards against any great inequalities of misrepresentation. Later on the honourable' member saidWe are laying down a safe principle-that as far as possible existing electorates shall not be disturbed unless to comply with the conditions of the low. That is what I understood was one of the objects Parliament had in passing the Bill in the form in which it actually became law. member said that? for Lang, Mr F. E. McLean. If honourable Victoria or New South Wales they will find an immense number of alterations of existing electorates, which are by no means necessary if we desire only to so alter them as to comply with the conditions of the law. Consequently, so far as that is concerned, the honourable member for Lang appears to have taken up a new attitude now, as compared with the attitude which he took up last session. thanks which the honourable and learned member gives the honourable member for Lang for helping him at that time. for Lang is not helping me now. I have also looked at the discussion which took place on the Bill as introduced and as amended to its present form. I find that the honourable member for Gippsland moved to omit the words which declared that the quota should be adhered to as nearly as practicable. Those words were ultimately omitted, and the honourable member then pointed out that one vote one value did not mean one vote one equal fractional value of an electorate. I believe in one vote one value, but it is just because I know that one",63,William Lyne H E Said Nothing Our Electoral Laws Are Improperly Adminis

382,Mr Mccay,"The honourable membervote one value is not attained by absolutely equal electorates in city and country, utterly regardless of physical conditions, means of communication and scattered population, that I do not believe in an absolute equality of electors in city and country electorates. In speaking upon this matter, I saidI think the Bill might be unproved by combining clauses 17 and IS. Clauses 17 and 18 were combined, and are now to be found in section 16 of the Act. I explained that the result would be that it would be possible to give effect then to the principle that had obtained in Victoria of making, a difference between city and country electorates, grounded on tlie fact that they are city and country electorates. I saidThe Bill should show clearly that owing to the disadvantages under which country electors labour, it is intended that there should be a distics, either of State or of Commonwealth, tinction between country and city electorates within the prescribed limits. As the clause stands, the Commissioners in each State might take a different view and split up the States on entirely different bases. This and thenext clause should be combined. The words proposed to be omitted should be struck out, and clause 18 should be amended so as to indicate that the proportion of population to the area should be taken the founders of the Constitution. The into consideration by the Commissioner. There were no actual words introduced, specifically pointing that Out, but the combination of the clauses which I suggested, and which was carried into effect, indicates very clearly what was intended. It is because, in my humble judgment, the true number of country electors in Victoria, and probably in' New South Wales also, has not been really ascertained with the same degree of accuracy as has the number of city electors, that I think it would be. very unwise for us to adopt a division founded upon wrong dataat all events upon data which the Commissioner himself admits may be wrong data,when, by adopting that division, we may settle, for a number of years to come, a distribution of the States into electorates which would not be fair come? minute. We should be adopting a distribution which would be the result of figures which have not always been ascertained with great accuracy under the special, exceptional, and abnormal circumstances of their collection. As the leader of the Opposition has suggested, if the electoral census were taken during Melbourne Cup week 8 L2 it could not be regarded as a correct census any more than could the census taken recently in connection with this division. I quite agree with the right honourable gentleman that if the census were taken in Melbourne Cup week an unfair division would probably result, and we might even find that Victoria should be given a member at the expense of New South Wales. What could be more unfair than that 1 That would be an outrage upon natural justice, which would probably cause tlie roof of the Victorian Farliament House to fall in upon the iniquitous evil-doers who had a hand in bringing such a result about. I will tell the honourable member for Parramatta why I think this distribution is a distribution for some considerable period. I , for one, do not think that the founders of the Constitution ever intended that the so-called statiswhich are made up for the most part of estimates of emigration and immigration, making allowances for this and for that, should be the basis upon which a redistribution should take place for every Parliament. That could never have been the intention of American practice is the proper one, and there a redistribution takes place after every census, if the census discloses a necessity for it . The census really will supply the only proper data upon which to found a redistribution. The circumstances of the birth of the Commonwealth are such that we cannot do that on the present occasion ; and I say that the distribution now decided upon should stand until the next census is taken. It will consequently be a distribution extending over a number of years. It would be a bad thing for the Commonwealth and for this Parliament if we were to lay down a rule that there must be a redistribution of seats every time that the statisticians' estimates suggest that an alteration might be made. solution some honourable members might desire a change to be made. MrM c CAY I suppose that if there were a penal dissolution at the end of twelve months, and it was discovered that there were two men more in Victoria or two men less in New South Wales, and that that would change something under half a quota to something over half a quota, it might be suggested that the whole system should be reviewed, and the existing electorates revised",64,William Lyne H E Said Nothing Our Electoral Laws Are Improperly Adminis

To return to the matter more immediately before us, in supporting the Government in disapproving of the adoption of this particular scheme, I am joining in the exercise of a right that this Parliament especially reserved to itself, because it knew that it could not possibly leave to any outside body the final approval or disapproval pf any distribution proposed. distribution ourselves. the honourable member says we must accept a distribution the approval or disapproval of which we have expressly reserved to ourselves. learned member desires to force the Commissioner into doing it our way.

That would vitiate the value of his redistribution, and leave us in the position that we now occupy. that the Minister-and , through him, the Government as a whole-hav e behaved very badly in submitting this motion at the present time.

The Minister has succeeded in getting the House to approve of the Commissioner's distribution of South Australia, though that State, like Tasmania, formerly voted as one constituency. He asks the House, however, to disapprove of the proposed distributions of the Commissioners of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, and that action must give rise to the suspicion, inasmuch as the largest number of members come from those States, that pressure has been put upon the Government to retain the original boundaries because of the better chance of re-election which it will give to the sitting members. not let out the truth like that. the truth, more especially as I have no interest in the matter.

419,Mr Sydney Smith,"No, None of.movements of the population of ""Victoria, but I find, on referring to the report, tliat the Commissioner paid special attention to .that matter. Moreover, as the honourable member for Robertson has pointed out, four of the largest of the country districts of Victoria did not suffer from the drought, so that whatever number of persons may have been compelled to leave them from other causes, those districts could not have lost population because of the drought. If we were acting in our own interests as a party we should allow the proposals of the Government to be adhered to, because they would probably prove to our advantage. We are not, however, swayed by any such considerations. We are acting in what we conceive to be. the public interest. I do not think that honourable members can argue for one moment that there was any drought in Victoriain 1901. Therefore, the census taken in that year should furnish us with some valuable information bearing upon the proportion of electors in the city and country constituencies. I find that in the eight -city constituencies there were 271,000 male and female adults, exclusive of foreigners, lunatics, prisoners, and aboriginals. In the -fifteen country constituencies there were .353,000 adults.' If we divide the num-ber of adults in the city constituencies by eight, that being the number of electorates, we find that the average number of electors for each city constituency would amount to 33,875. Applying the same process to the -country constituencies, the average works out .at 23,533 electors for each division. That represents a difference of about 10,000 per -electorate between the city and country divisions. If the figures given in the census of 1901 are applied to the electoral divisions recommended by the Commissioner, and the divisors of nine and fourteen are adopted for the city and country electors respectively, the averages will work out at 30,100 'electors per division in the city, and 25,200 -electors per division in the country. Therefore, there would still be an advantage of about against the attitude adopted by the Govern-5,000 electors per constituency in favour of the country electorates. I think that shows -clearly that there is no justification whatever for the statement put forward by the Government. Ministers are now breaking the promises which they made when the Electoral Bill was introduced. It has been suggested that, unless a redistribution of .the electorates were made by this Blouse, it would be within the power of the Victorian Parliament to pass a measure for the division of the State into electorates for the purposes of the Federal election. If such action were taken a great reflection would be cast upon this House. I feel strongly upon this matter, and I had intended to deal more fully with it ; but, perhaps, it would be better to reserve any remarks I may have to make upon tlie important principle involved in the Government proposals when the distribution of electorates in New South Wales is under discussion. I believe that a great mistake is being made, and that the Government are rendering themselves liable to the suspicion that thoy are endeavouring to manipulate the electorates in order to suit their own party purposes. MrL . E. GROOM -No one has mode such a charge. that they arc exposing themselves to such an accusation, but I do not wish to deal with the matter from that stand-point. The Government are attempting to perpetrate a great wrong upon the electors of the Commonwealth, and ore altogether ignoring the interests of the female voters for whom they have previously expressed so much concern. I feel sure that the female voters will not view the matter in the same light as the Minister. They will see that he only professed, and recognising that there was a danger Sir WILLIAM LYNE L e t the honourable member say all the nasty things he can when, the motion relating to New South Wales is before the House. honourable friend just now that I did not rise for the purpose of prolonging the debateand he knows that I am not often at a loss for words to express my views--bu t for the purpose .of entering my strong protest ment with regard to the redistribution of the electorates. The position has been so well put by the leader of the Opposition that I feel sure that, when the people of the It seems to me that Commonwealth realize that the Parliament is interfering with their right to vote under the Electoral Act, they will say that it does not reflect any credit on the Government. I am very sorry that they are seeking to prevent a large number of electors from recording their votes.",68,William Lyne H E Said Nothing Our Electoral Laws Are Improperly Adminis
