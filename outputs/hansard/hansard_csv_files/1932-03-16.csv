I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Industry whether the Government' will arrange to secure full information regarding [he proposed changes of the New Zealand law with a view to detcrmiuiug whether they are suitable for adoption iu Australia? Minister for Health whether the Government has yet come to a decision regarding the continuance of Commonwealth assistance in the combating of the cattle tick menace? Health) [11.o] -by leave-The Government is gravely concerned at the reports which have been received from its officers to the eifect that cattle tick has been spreading southward and westward from the north coast districts of New South Wales. This has happened in spite of ihe expenditure during the present year by the Tick Commission of £142,000, of which £44,000 has been provided by the Commonwealth Government, and in spite pf the employment of more than 300 men in the work of tick control and eradication. This new danger from this pest has led the Government to reconsider the conditions of the contribution it proposed to make during the coming twelve months. I u more normal circumstances it might reasonably have expected that the reduced cost level and lower awards in Australia would have enabled the work of tick control and eradication to be continued with equal efficiency, but witb lower expenditure by the governments. This would have enabled some economy to have been effected during the coming twelve months to the relief of Commonwealth and State exchequers. The Commonwealth Government, however, views the renewed menace from the spread of tick so seriotisly that Cabinet has decided that a grant equal to that made during next year. This grant will be conditional upon a sumcient proportion of these funds being used-to erect enough new dips",10,Setup

In the past the Tick Commission has sometimes failed to receive that willing co-operation which might have been expected from the cattleowners in the infected districts. It is hoped that, both in the construction of the new dips and in observation with the object, of discovering tick, cattleowners will give the commission the fullest assistance, so that the limited funds available may produce results equal to, if not better than, those obtained in previous years. The commission, which consists of representatives of the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales and Queensland, will meet next week to consider this matter, and I hope to be able to make a further statement on the matter subsequently. what action, if any, is being taken to to take any action possible under the existprevent the spread of the tick pest ing law, and if the necessity arises to ask throughout an area of approximately Parliament to increase the Government's 700,000 square miles of clean country in powers by an amendment of the law; the Northern Territory? receiving the attention of the Tick Comin possession of proveable information remission, which comprises representatives garding Communist activities to supply of the Commonwealth Government and it to him, on the assurance that imthe Governments of New South Wales mediate action would follow. and Queensland, Its jurisdiction does not extend to the Northern Territory,, but I shall bring the matter under the notice of the Minister for Home Affairs, and also the Cabinet, with a view to determining what action should be taken a letter from an Adelaide business man in that portion of the Commonwealth. ance to the farmers who are about to commence sowing operations, can the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs announce that there will be no increase of the duty on crude oil: alternatively, if the Government intends to await the report of the Tariff Board, will it ask the board to expedite its inquiry? the matters now being investigated by the Tariff Board, whose report will be dealt with by the Government as soon as it is received. election campaign members of the presentMinistry said that if they were elected to office they would take action against the Communists. More recently both the Attorney-General and the Assistant Attorney-General have said that action would have to be taken by private individuals.

His determination this morning to proceed in the manner that he has indicated is in keeping with the tactics that all along he has attempted to employ to carry out this proposal. The intention of this Government was to endeavour to seize the revenues of the State, held by the private banks and thus to prevent the payment of public service salaries prior to the Easter holidays, but it was frustrated in that move. Honourable members opposite may laugh. If is obvious that, in the battle of tactics up to-date, this Government has been the loser, and that it wishes to hide its discomthe likelihood of our friends opposite havfiture by attempting to laugh the matter off. I assure the House that the longer laugh will be with the Government of New South Wales. Having been defeated in the direction already referred to the Government is now making this move to achieve its object. The information contained in the document that has been placed before us this morning could quite easily have been made available to us yesterday. As a matter of fact, I know that it was prepared yesterday in the office of the Prime Minister, and was ready for presentation to Parliament; but it was not to be made public, the object of the Government being to swoop down on the State of New South Wales just prior to the holidays and procure certain of its revenues. ber is now discussing the resolution. pointing out that the object of the Government in proposing to suspend the Standing Orders is to enable it to swoop down at a given moment upon certain of the revenues of the State of New South Wales. Had the ordinary procedure of the House been followed an opportunity would have been afforded to those concerned to prepare their case. I remind the. honourable member that when the resolution is debated it is possible that its terms may be altered. Therefore, he is not justified in assuming that certain things will happen. fact. But at the moment all that we have before us is the document that has been distributed. I am not competent to forecast what changes may be made; consequently I cannot express any opinion in that direction. It seems clear that it is the desire of the Government this morning to suspend the Standing Orders so that it may obtain a tactical advantage over those who are affected adversely by the terms of the resolution. I followed closely the remarks of the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) when he questioned ing read this document or of knowing exactly what it contains. I remind the House that a statement by the Prime Minister, which was published in the press this morning, set out that the amount to be obtained from New South Wales was, in round figures, in the vicinity of £S00,000. As a matter of fact the statement prepared in his department yesterday was for that amount. Since then, however, a change has been made, and the amount has been altered to £924,082 3s. 4d. The statement of the amount involved, which was published in the Canberra Times this morning, apparently was sent also to the different States. Yet honourable members who sit behind the Government claim to have a complete knowledge of the subject! Although the Prime Minister himself apparently has not, they are prepared to follow him blindly. The only course open to the Government of New South Wales is to play this Government at its own game; and I am satisfied that it is quite capable of doing so. The resolution may be bludgeoned through this Parliament, and the Government may ""go its hardest"" to enforce it ; but in due season the State Government will give effect to its policy, and I am satisfied that it will obtain the results it desires. I have no hesitation in supporting the motion moved by the Prime Minister; because, if ever there was a time when",18,Ministerial Members Al L Of Us

Within the last three weeks we have discussed the measures that were regarded as necessary to enable this resolution to be put into operation. debates consideration was given to the methods that might be used. Eor weeks everybody has been considering what was the wisest course to pursue. It is the first Standing Orders, has been thrown duty of this Parliament to act swiftly and certainly, and in such a way that a similar thing will never occur again. Honourable members have a just grievance against the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) for treating them with the scant courtesy that he has exhibited this morning. Surely he could have given notice last night of his intention to move this motion! It is understood that a certain measure,, which he gave us to understand would be first on the notice-paper tb-day, is not to be proceeded with. honourable gentleman continues to act in this fashion, he will meet with a good deal of obstruction.

He has not us "" in the bag,"" nor has he "" in the bag"" such extremely able men in the United Australia party and the Country party as Senators Colebatch and E. B.

The Government, in moving it without having given previous notice, is endeavouring to ride rough-shod over all the precedents and customs of this House.

No one has had an opportunity to consider these proposals, and to ascertain what revenues the Commonwealth proposes to seize from New South Wales. I doubt whether the proposed action will be taken, because, if it is taken, it will obligations. The State of New South undoubtedly lead to the imprisonment of certain Commonwealth officials in the gaols of New South Wales. The Government is attempting to hold up the festivities that are to take place in New South Wales at the opening of the Sydney Harbour bridge, and no doubt its action is in accordance with the promise of some of its supporters on the hustings that, if the United Australia party were returned to power, the Lang Government would be put out of oflice within three weeks.

I assure honourable members that it was impossible for me to give notice of this motion yesterday, because the information on which it is based was not then all available. In any case, the Parliament having so recently passed the Financial Agreements Enforcement Act, was aware that the subject with which it dealt would require urgent attention. In view of the continued default by the New South Wales Government, the Commonwealth Government feels compelled to intervene at this stage, aud to begin the course of action necessary to enable it to recover from the New South Wales Government the amounts which have been paid on behalf of that State. It was necessary that the debate on the motion for the susa continuance of the failure on the part pension of the Standing Orders should be concluded before 1 o'clock, otherwise the orders of the day would have beeu called on, and our whole procedure dislocated. As honourable members know, the Financial Agreements Enforcement Act, which was passed last week, was assented to on Saturday. On Monday last, as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, I made a request to the Auditor-General for a certificate setting out the amount then due aud payable and unpaid by New South Wales, under or by virtue of the Financial Agreements. That request was made in accordance with the provisions of section 5, sub-section 1, of the act. the Auditor-General furnished a certificate that an amount of £924,0S2 3s. 4d. is due and payable and unpaid by the State of New South Wales under or by virtue of the Financial Agreements. In accordance with the requirements of sub-section 2 of section 5 of the act, a copy of that certificate was published in the Gazette yesterday. The Government is now taking the next step provided for under the act, and is asking both House3 of the Parliament to pass a resolution approving and adopting the certificate of the Auditor-General, and providing that, by reason of urgency, tlie provisions of sections 7 to 13 inclusive of the act, shall every other State. All the States as well apply immediately in relation to New South Wales, aud shall have effect with respect to the particular classes of revenue set out in the motion. The motion has been moved in pursuance of section 6 of the act, which sets out the procedure in a case of urgency. There can be no doubt that a position of urgency has already arisen, in view of the fact that the default of New South Wales is now practically £1,000,000. On Monday last I forwarded a copy of the act to the Premier of New South Wales, and invited his attention to its provisions. Saturday. that it has been attended to. 1 informed the Premier of the amount due and payable and unpaid by New South Wales, and requested payment of it. I also informed him that in the event of of New South Wales to meet its financial obligations, it was proposed to invoke the provisions of the act. New South Waies not having since met those obligations, the Commonwealth Government is forced to proceed under the act. The Premier of New South Wales has informed me that he is advised that the act is ultra vires of the Commonwealth Constitution , and has asked for an un1 dertaking not to put it into operation pending the hearing of the actiou which the State proposes to bring to test its validity. The Commonwealth Government is prepared to assist in every way to secure an early decision as to the Yesterday validity of the act, and the New South Wales Government will find that no obstacles will be placed in its way by the Commonwealth Government, but rather that every assistance will be forthcoming to facilitate the action which it proposes to take. But the amount already in default and the amounts becoming due by New South Wales for overseas interest are so large that delay in putting the measure into operation may seriously affect the finances, not only of the Commonwealth Government, but also of the other States. as the Commonwealth must be seriously",25,Commonwealth Ov Australia

The amount for which the New South Wales Government is now in default exceeds £900,000. It is, of course, impossible to say what further defaults will be made by the Government of New South Wales. To date there have been several overseas and two defaults in respect of interest due in Australia to the Commonwealth Bank, but the interest due in Australia to private bondholders has been paid by the State to date. If we assume that the State Government will maintain the same attitude in the future, the amount in default will increase month by month, and will, after allowing credit for amounts withheld by the Commonwealth, amount to £4,500,000 by the 30th June; and if the State does not pay the Australian interest, the amount in default may reach nearly £6,000,000 by the 30th June. "" ifs "" about this statement; why not get down to facts? assume that the New South^ Wales Government will continue to do in the future what it has done in the past. The can deal only with the position as it now exists. poses to take such action as is necessary to recover the amount now due by the State. At the same time, it cannot neglect consideration of the possibilities of the future, and must safeguard itself against further default by the State Government. Honourable members will recollect that the act provides that both Houses of the Parliament may resolve that particular classes of revenue of a State may, subject to certain procedure, be made payable to the Commonwealth, but it also provides that it is not obligatory that all the classes of revenue specified in the resolution of the Parliament shall be included in one proclamation. ,, Different classes of revenue may be included in different proclamations. classes of revenue that might be attached are included in the resolution; but not necessarily all, or even more than one class, will be included in the proclamation. The different classes may be included in different proclamations. This elasticity is necessary to enable the Commonwealth to recover amounts in default with the least disturbance of existing arrangements. The need for such a provision will be seen on an examination of the position. defaults of interest due The amount of the present default is £924,082. The estimated yield of income taxes in New South Wales, apart from unen^Joyment taxes, during the next eight weeks, would be sufficient to provide that amount; so that, if no further default took place, it would be necessary only to proclaim that income taxes due to the State of New South Wales would be payable to the Commonwealth for a period of about two months. cover future default? revenue that would be attached if future default occurred; but fhe Government does not at present intend to deal with revenues other than those that are sufficient to meet the present default. It is necessary that this resolution shall make provision for covering any default that may take place between now and the next meeting of the Parliament, because a Commonwealth Government further resolution can be obtained only from the Parliament, of the Auditor-General be required in regard to any future default? provides for that. But the present resolution covers various classes of revenue that will be sufficient to effect recovery in the event of a further certificate being given, by the Auditor-General relating to further default. It must be recognized, however, that if the default increases, the income tax receipts may not suffice to meet the default. I have already stated that there are possibilities of the default increasing to £4,500,000, or, perhaps, £6,000,000, by the 30th June. To protect the interests of the Commonwealth and the other States, t,he Commonwealth Government must, All the various therefore, ask Parliament to give it power to require payment from time to time to",27,Commonwealth Ov Australia

151,Mr Lyons,"Undoubtedly ; the actthe Federal Treasurer of such revenues as may be necessary to meet the amounts in default. It is for this reason that the motion now before the House covers several classes of revenue. The yields of these revenues, up to the SOth June, according to the information available to the Commonwealth, may be estimated as follow:£ Butting and racing taxes State lotteries "" .. .. 100,000 Entertainments tax . . Income tax unemployment relief tax) Motor taxation 550,000 Unemployment relief tax 5,914,000 These classes of taxation, which are those covered by the motion would suffice to meet the interest payments of the State for the balance of the year, even if the overseas defaults were continued, and the default were extended by the State Government to interest payments due to Australian bondholders. The Government considers it desiiable to ask Parliament to give such authority now as will enable the Commonwealth to deal with the position as it develops. If the default does not increase, the Government's course will be clear. It will proclaim only such revenues as are necessary to meet the amount of the present default. The revenue from income tax, excluding the unemployment relief tax, for the next eight weeks would be sufficient to cover the existing default, and there would be no necessity to proclaim any class of revenue beyond that of ordinary income tax. Buti f the default increases, the Government must have power to recover larger sums. Before recommending Parliament to resolve that the several classes of revenue specified in the act may, in certain circumstances, be made payable to the Commonwealth, the Government carefully considered all the sources of revenue of the State. certain classes of revenue can be made payable to the Commonwealth more readily than others. For instance, some revenues could be attached in the hands of State officers only, and such a procedure might entail difficulties. Other revenues could be intercepted before they reached the State. Then there are certain revenues on the payment of which action by the State is necessary; for instance, probate duties. These facts have been borne in mind in the drafting of the motion now before the House. revenues to be attached bear to the total revenue of the State for the period from now to the end of the financial year? 20,000 not furnish that precise information. We (exclusive of are dealing now only with the amount 2,280,000 of revenue obtainable from ordinary .. 2,764,000 income tax, for a period of eight weeks, which will cover the present default. The desire of the Government is that the more practicable course; shall be adopted, and that the revenues which can be intercepted shall, in the first instance, be drawn upon. So that there may be no misconception of the position by taxpayers, I desire to make quite clear the position which will arise on the adoption of this resolution. The resolution sets out what classes of revenue of the State of New South Wales may be made payable to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. The obligation of the taxpayer to pay to the Federal Treasurer any particular tax or class of revenue named in the resolution does not, however, arise until a proclamation has been issued by the Commonwealth in-relation to that particular tax or class of revenue. The mere carrying of this resolution does not make the tax due to the State payable to the Commonwealth; it is only when a proclamation is issued specifying a particular tax or class of revenue that that applies. It is not intended at the present stage to issue a proclamation covering all the taxes or classes of revenue named in the resolution. One or two of those taxes or classes of revenue will, however, be proclaimed as soon as possible. When that is done, wide publicity will be given to the matter, so that all persons concerned may clearly understand This consideration shows that what obligations are imposed on them under the Financial Agreements Enforcement Act. They will then know that the obligation is to pay to the Commonwealth and not to the State. The mere fact that all these classes of revenue and taxation are included in this resolution does nothing at the present stage to make them",28,Commonwealth Ov Australia

Would the Commonwealth then demand payment of the tax a second time? urgent need for the action which the. Commonwealth Government proposes to take was fully explained during the debates on the Financial Agreements Enforcement Bill. The position is that one State in the Commonwealth has deliberately refused to meet its contractual obligations for interest, and is seekvernment has evinced no desire to honour ing to place the burden of those obligations on the Commonwealth, and, through the Commonwealth, on the other States. Such a proceeding cannot be tolerated by the Commonwealth or by the other States. The action being taken to-day, and recent federal legislation with respect to this matter, have for their object the promotion of the interests of the Commonwealth and the whole of the States. This is not a matter of party politics; the Government is endeavouring to save the financial reputation of Australia, and of the individual States. It is suggested that the Government has some ridiculous motive affecting the festivities in connection with the opening of the Sydney Harbour bridge on Saturday; but our sole object is to compel the Government of New South Wales to meet its obligations. people of that State. The Commonwealth Government is merely taking action to recover from New South Wales moneys that we have already paid on its behalf. If this default were allowed to continue, and the Commonwealth Government, accepting as it does, liability for payments due by a defaulting State Government, were asked to meet default upon default, to find million upon million in order to meet the obligations of the State, the finances of not only New South Wales and the Commonwealth, but also of every State in the Commonwealth, would be wrecked, and that at an early stage. Gothe moral code, and must meet the financial obligations into which they have entered with due deliberation. That is all that we are asking of the State Government of New South Wales. Every effort has been made to induce the Premier of that State to meet his commitments Even after the Einancial Agreements Enforcement Act was passed, and before any attempt was made to put it into operation, tbe Premier of New South Wales was again reminded of the position, and asked to reimburse the Commonwealth the amounts that it had paid on behalf of the State. However, the Lang Goits obligations, and it is only just to the other States, and to the citizens of New South Wales, who, as a body, would repudiate the action that has been taken by the Lang Government, that the Commonwealth Government should endeavour by legitimate means to recover the amount that it has paid on behalf of the Government of New South Wales. The reason why various classes of revenue are included in this motion which, in the aggregate, are greater than the amount that is due to the Commonwealth is that this Government must be able to recover all that is due to it in the event of the New South Wales Government again defaulting. If that precaution were not taken, and Mr Lang again defaulted, Parliament would have to be called together specially to pass a further resolution. Under the terms of this motion, it is only necessary for the Auditor General to issue a further certificate as to the amount due. out a further vote of Parliament being taken ? mitted by those who are seriously concerned about the necessity to maintain the financial position and the honour of the Commonwealth that the -power sought is entirely reasonable.

160,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [3.35],"In his( Mr Lyons) referred to the protest that was made hy myself and the members of my party against the attempt of the Government to rush this motion through without giving the House an opportunity to examine it properly. The honourable gentleman declared that we knew that the motion was coming before Parliament. That cannot be denied;, but we did not know what it would contain, and our protest was a legitimate one. We made no endeavour to stonewall. Had the Prime Minister agreed to adjourn the debate until 3 o'clock this afternoon, as he eventually did, our objections would have ceased, and Parliament could have proceeded with other business during the morning. Out protest has been effective, and the honourable gentleman has learned that rush tactics are not always the most expeditious. It was suggested that members of the Opposition were obstructing the work of Parliament. The insinuation is both disorderly and untrue. Had we desired to obstruct the business of the House, we should have spoken at greater length, a procedure which would have brought the guillotine into operation in clue course. Members of the official Opposition merely voiced a genuine protest against the attempt of the Government to rush through a motion the contents of which were not familiar to them. We desired an opportunity to examine it, and compare its phraseology with sections of the Financial Agreements Enforcement Act. The action of the Prime Minister in getting the sitting suspended until of money is due and payable by the 3 p.m. has given us an opportunity to peruse the motion, and we can now discuss it more intelligently. In my opinion, there are two broad aspects of this motion, the general method that is employed for the recovery of money due to the Commonwealth, and the specifying of certain classes of revenue as liable to be attached. We have already discussed fully the principles that are contained in this class of legisladented situation. I certainly hope that tion, and I do not propose to repeat at length what I have previously said on the subject. I agree entirely with the general views that have been expressed by the Prime Minister as to the obligation of a' State to meet its commitments. I do not find fault with the statement that the honour of Australia requires that every government shall meet its obligations and eschew repudiation. I say to those who, by these proceedings, would make a martyr of the Premier of New South Wales-and that is one of the things that I fear this legislation is doing-that if that gentleman had shown a genuine desire to meet his obligations and demonstrated his incapacity to do so, the people and the Government of Australia would have been prepared to meet him as far as was possible. There is a vast difference between the declarations, "" I cannot pay "" aud "" I will not pay "". My Government believed last year that there was a genuine desire on the part of the Lang Government to meet the situation, and even at this stage I have no reason to believe that that desire did not then exist, for I am not one to impute base motives to men with whose policy I entirely disagree. I resent strongly the insinuation tliat I and my party are apologists for a person who has repudiated. We have suffered more thau any other body associated with the political life of this country because of the stand that we took against repudiation by the Lang Administration. At the same time, I cannot change my opinion that the method which is being employed by the Commonwealth Government to deal with the Lang Government is a wrong one. This Parliament is asked to carry a resolution declaring that a certain sum Government of New South Wales. The resolution does even more than that; it is a garnishee order upon certain revenues of that State. I do uot claim to know all that has been done by Parliaments and courts; but for years I have studied constitutional and political history, and I know of no precedent to warrant action of this kind being taken by Parliament against another Government. I may be told that we are facing an unpreceit will never recur in tbe history of this country. At the same time, we must be careful not to create a bad precedent, in striving to deal, with what is regarded as a bad situation. This motion declares that money ia due and payable by the Government of New Soutli Wales, and a proclamation may be issued to attach certain specified revenues. before the courts a little sooner than The resolution will be carried by the claimant government, through the Parliament that supports it. Where, in the history of litigation, can we find a parallel case, where the right is given to the claimant to declare what the defendant owes. Where does there exist the right of the claimant to say, "" I shall a heavy and unpleasant fall. I do not issue an order attaching certain of your -revenues, and garnishee them""? Other party enters a defence. defence will be entered, disputing the amount. I am not going to say that there are strong grounds for that defence, but thousands of defendants advance a case which is no stronger than that of the Lang Government. It matters not how strong may be the opinion of a claimant that money is due to him, he cannot attach it without first applying to the proper tribunal. No one knows that better than the honourable member for Eawkner( Mr Maxwell), who has had such a distinguished career in the law courts of this country. In this case the High Court, the tribunal which interprets our Constitution and decides these problems, is deliberately brushed aside. It. is true that a State may make application to the High Court; but that provision was inserted only as a result of criticism that was levelled at the original bill. Originally it was provided that unless the federal Attorney-General made application to the court, the State could not apply to that tribunal for a declaration. This motion proposes that the Commonwealth Government shall seize the revenues of a State without the consent or the declaration of the court. That is a principle to which I will not subscribe, no matter how provocative the circumstances may be. Some may say, "" But the State may apply immediately to the Court"". seize the money without an order of the court. A State may apply for an interim injunction. Surely that would prevent the Commonwealth from, obtaining the money pending further action, and delay matters just the same as if action were originally instituted through the ordinary judicial channels. The method proposed may bring the case otherwise would be possible; but, in order to save a few weeks or a few months, is it wise to precipitate what may be one of the greatest crises known in the history of Australia? Hasty methods are often dangerous methods. One may run so rapidly as to trip, and thus sustain want that to happen in this instance. In the clash that may occur between the Commonwealth and State, I want to see the Commonwealth always on the right side, always paramount in what it does. I do not want to see any action taken by the Commonwealth proved wrong. That would cause unnecessary provocation, and possibly give rise to the suspicion that it has behind it political motives, so diverting sympathy to a government that espouses a policy of repudiation. Why has the Government chosen to start in the wrong way? This matter must eventually go to the court; so why not go to the court first, and l if t this issueone of the biggest in the parliamentary history of our country-ou t of the political atmosphere into tbe calm, judicial, aud non-political atmosphere of the court? The fact, that the Government is taking action without any preliminary judicial procedure, is in itself a warrant ancl e::cuse for counter action that may be direct and illegal. Even the very course that the Commonwealth Government is proposing may be declared to be illegal. The Premier of New South Wales declares that he has been advised that this legislation is invalid. That advice may be good or bad, but the High Court has before now declared unconstitutional certain legislation of this Parliament. The very fact that the Government of New South Wales starts with the assumption that the Commonwealth is doing something illegal will give it an excuse to counter this legislation with illegality. And what will be the outcome But this motion proposes to of this conflict between two sovereign parliaments, each' controlling means of supporting its will by force? The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) said that the hurried action now being taken is justified, because on Saturday morning the Government of New South Wales drew over £1,000,000 in cash",30,Commonwealth Ov Australia

162,Mr Scullin,"In this instance afrom the banks, carried it off in suitcases, and deposited it in the treasury vaults. That any government should adopt such a method to dodge the bailiff is pitiable, but it is regarded in many quarters as a smart move to frustrate a political opponent. What happened on Saturday, and the public attitude to it, illustrate the danger of dealing with default in an atmosphere of party politics. Had the withdrawal of cash from the banks followed a judgment of the High Court, a cry of indignation would have been raised throughout the country. But because of the political feeling which has been aroused, this extraordinary action on the part of the Government of New South Wales is regarded by a large section of its people as merely another political move in the game of chess being played by the Prime Minister and the Premier of New South Wales. What a regrettable position Australian governments are getting into when the public display that attitude towards so serious a matter! Had Mr Lang acted in defiance of an order of the court the opinion of the public would have been vastly different. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Porde) referred to the opinion expressed by Senator Colebatch, admittedly one of the ablest men in the Nationalist party, whom not even the honourable member for Bartor( Mr Lane) would accuse of being a partisan of Mr Lang. Senator Colebatch said in effect, "" I have been in Sydney, and have heard sympathy expressed with Mr Lang in quarters which would surprise most people "". And he and others are opposed to this legislation, not because they sympathize with Mr Lang, but because they cannot agree to the method which the Government is adopting. My attitude is similar. I do not attempt to endorse repudiation, but I strongly condemn the procedure which the Commonwealth Government is adopting to recover the money owing to it by New South Wales! Less judicial minds, resenting the methods employed, become sympathetic with the person against whom these proceedings are directed, and there is danger of that sympathy extending to the policy which Mr Lang has adopted. This Parliament is treating the High Court with contempt. If the Commonwealth went to the High Court and obtained judgment, ancl the defendant did not obey it, he would be treating the court with, contempt. This Government is reversing; the process. This resolution gives to the Government power to attach eight different classes of revenue, totalling approximately £6,000,000. Income tax alone represents £5,000,000, or, deducting that raised specially for the relief of unemployment, approximately £2,500,000. The Prime Minister stated that in eight weeks sufficient money would be obtained from income tax to meet the present claim of the Commonwealth, but the resolution is covering a larger amount because of the possibility of further default. The proclamation of attachment need apply only to that amount which is immediately required, and thus, I admit, unnecessary hardship and trouble to the people of New South Wales will be avoided. The issue of proclamations from time to time attaching such sums as are required, will be infinitely better than issuing a proclamation attaching the whole of the £6,000,000, and creating chaos and uncertainty throughout the State. Nevertheless this resolution will create a Certain amount of uncertainty and difficulty, and for the life of me I cannot see why the Government is attaching the income tax raised specially for unemployment. Tactical considerations alone should have restrained the Government from adopting a course that will provoke sympathy for default which otherwise would be abhorrent to the majority of people. orable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) and the Premier of New South Wales( Mr Lang) are glad that the Government is proposing to lay hands upon the unemployment relief funds.

As one who at least has had responsibilities, who has occupied the position now held by the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Lyons), and who regards Australia with pride, and desires to see its governments working harmoniously along constitutional lines, I warn the Government of the danger of adopting a procedure which is political rather than judicial. At the very outset it will stir up political partisanship on both sides, and the merits of the case will be lost sight of. It will provoke resentment and resistance, and therein will lie the danger. monwealth Government is now pursuing I hope that the course proposed by the Government will be supported by the whole Parliament, and that this will not be regarded as a party issue, because the real struggle is between the honest Government of the Commonwealth and the dishonest Government of a State. I cannot understand the objection of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) to the course now proposed, because it seems to me that it is in accordance with the spirit of section 51, paragraph i i , of the £8,000,000 will have to be provided by the Constitution, whicli forbids discrimination between States or parts of States in the imposition of taxation. annual interest obligation of approximately £13,000,000, and if it refuses to pay any of that amount, obviously the other States, which are taxed to make good the default, will be discriminated against. Unquestionably if the Constitution did not contain provision against such discrimination the normal course would be for the Commonwealth Parliament to impose special taxation on the people of the defaulting State in order that their burden might not be loaded on to their fellow citizens in the other States; and that would be done without reference to any court of law. The electors and taxpayers of New South Wales must accept responsibility for having placed in power a government which has deliberately adoptea a policy of default. Honourable members have not forgotten that when Mr Lang went beforethe electors eighteen months ago he candidly enunciated a policy for smashing the Loan Council. He stated that he had no intention of keeping within the council, and that New South Wales would, be better outside it. Yet, in 1928, the people of Australia, including a 3$ to 1 majority of the electors in New South Wales, approved of the Loan Council becoming part and parcel of our constitutional machinery. majority in 1929 ? majority not by his opposition to the Loan Council, but because of his promise of employment and social benefits, and because of his undertaking to make the wilderness blossom as the rose. The Oomthe right course to bring the recalcitrant State to book. Unless the Commonwealth takes firm and immediate action, the taxpayers of States other than New South Wales will be mulct in an additional annual £8,000,000 erf taxation. If New South Walesdeifaiults in respect of the whole liability of £13,000,000 per annum, Commonwealth taxation will recover approximately two-fifths of that amount from the people of that State, and the other taxpayers of other States. The interest which Mr Lang refuses to pay relates to a debt incurred for public works which New South Wales has an were described in the loan prospectuses as reproductive assets which would return interest and sinking fund on the capital invested in them. In fact, many of them are earning more than working expenses. That is true of the railways of New South Wales, which provide between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000 towards the interest bill on the money expended in building them. Yet this amount is being diverted to other purposes in complete defiance of the canons of honesty and decency. There is every reason why the Government should take the swiftest and surest action to secure possession of revenues which can be used to satisfy the payments which are due.

I have no hesitation in supporting this motion. As I said during the discussion of the legislation upon which this motion is based, I should have preferred that railway revenue be attached rather than the proceeds of direct taxation. ever, it is necessary to attach the revenues derived from direct taxation, it must be evident that we should attach practically the whole of such revenue if occasion demanded it. If an exception were made, as suggested by the Leader of the Opposition, in favour of revenue raised for the relief of unemployment, the Government of New South Wales would, no doubt, cease to enforce the provisions of the ordinary income tax law, aud raise practically the whole of its revenue by means of unemployment taxation, so that the Commonwealth Government could not collect. I do not propose to allow any minor difference of opinion as to what class of revenue we should attach to influence my course of action. The Government is responsible for what it does. It is the Executive, and if it is prepared to go ahead and deal with this matter in the firm and courageous manner which the situation demands, the Country party is prepared to support it to the utmost. The Government should, however, be ready to meet all emergencies. In particular, it should make provision for relieving the unemployed and other indigent persons, if by any chance, the Government of New South Wales, for political or tactical reasons, should try to make a pawn of them. If it is necessary, in order to strengthen the hands of the Government, that Parliament should remain in constant session, I am prepared to remain here day ancl night for that purpose. -Before dealing with the motion itself, I should like to reply to some of the remarks made by previous speakers, and particularly by the speaker who has just resumed his seat. In the course of his remarks the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) mentioned the last New South Wales election, when the present Premier( Mr Lang), who was then the Leader of the Opposition, placed his policy before the people. I remind the right honourable member that Mr Lang at that time told the electors that the Loan Council should not be allowed to interfere with the proper development of his State. He stated that if the Government of New SouthI f , howWales wished to enter upon a scheme of development, and if it had the necessary assets to provide backing for a loan, it should be within its power to determine its own course of action. But while New South Wales is under the Loan Council, the State of Tasmania, the extent of whose financial operations is not even so great as those of the municipality of Sydney, has the right to veto the application of the Government of New South Wales for a loan. New South Wales is thus not permitted to use its own resources as a means of providing employment for its people. That position was put before the people of that State at the last election, and the people then returned Mr Lang and his colleagues by the largest majority ever recorded in the history of New South Wales. On the subject of election promises generally, I remind honourable members that those who live in glass houses should not throw stones. This Commonwealth Government has still to honour its own election promises. Honourable members representing Queensland constituencies, may recall that, during the last election campaign in that State, Mr Moore, two days before the election, promised that he would, if returned to power, provide £2,000,000 for the relief of unemployment. I shall leave this matter to be further elaborated by honourable members on this side who come from. Queensland. At the present time New South Wales, in common with many other countries, is passing through a period of great stress. Indeed, the situation which confronts that State, confronts also, in varying degree not only countries, but individuals as well. If we were honest with",34,Commonwealth Ov Australia

174,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [4.4].,"ourselves, we should have to admit that at the present time it is humanly impossible for many governments and for very many individuals to meet their obligations in full. The Government of New South Wales has, by means of moratorium provisions, &c., granted concessions to the extent of over £2,000,000 to various sections of the community, particularly to those living in the country. I agree with what it has done, and I believe that all governments should do whatever they can to tide their people over these difficult times. The commercial interests have also received considerable relief, and many in New South Wales, who disagree with me politically, are grateful to the Government of that State for the help it has given to them.. They have expressed their gratitude without any hesitation, and it is evident that there is much sympathy with the Government of New South Wales to-day in perhaps unexpected quarters. It is all very well to speak of honouring obligations, and to say that governments should subscribe to the same code of honourable conduct as individuals lay down for themselves. The great "" Cromwell"" Hardy was one of the loudest in advocating such a policy. honoured his own contractual obligations ? No. He is a bankrupt who has paid about 4s. in the £1. That is the man who talks of the duty of governments to honour their obligations. Where does the Treasurer of the Queensland Government this matter of honouring his obligations? from Broadway, in Brisbane, and has paid only 2s. or 3s. in the £1. These are the men who hold up their hands in holy horror at the suggestion that a State might not honour its obligations, but they themselves were quick to seek the protection of State laws when they found themselves unable to pay fheir debts. The honourable member for Martin( Mr ment' of New South Wales did the right Holman) was in the bankruptcy court the other day back-stopping for Hugh D. Mcintosh, who could not meet his obligations, either.

Its political opponents, no doubt, believe that if they created such chaos they would derive some benefit therefrom. All along, the object of this Government has been to seize revenues of the State Government of New South Wales to hinder it in the performance of its duties. Members of the Ministry have already expressed, outside of the Parliament, the opinion that there is a doubt as to the constitutionality of the action now contemplated by this Government, but they are not much concerned about that. They are rushing this resolution through so that they may take immediate action in the hope that before legal redress can be obtained the Government of New South Wales will be forced out of office. In other words, they hope to have some excuse whereby a demand could be made on the King's Representative to dissolve Parliament. should be forced out of office. that interjection, because it emphatically endorses the statement of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) when he likened the situation to a game of political chess in which the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) makes one move and the Premier of New South Wales another. When the test is applied, the people who need relief will declare their allegiance to the State Government, and will stand behind it in its efforts to meet the every-day obligations of New South Wales. This Government, under recent legislation, is setting up machinery to enable it to take an unconstitutional action without any reference to the High Court. If it' is right for the Commonwealth to exercise such a power, it is equally right for the State of New South Wales to combat the action of this Government by every means at its disposal, whether by way of executive act or legislation. Time will tell whether the people of New South Wales are standing behind our efforts to defend the interest of the State. I have listened carefully to the references to the various revenues to be collected by the end of June. Throughout the remarks of the Prime Minister the indication is that there is plenty of money to be collected from various sources of taxation, and he referred particularly to income taxation. One would think that the State of New South Wales had no obligations whatever, that because £5,000,000 was due by the end of June in income taxation, it could be seized by the Commonwealth Government without placing any serious disability upon the general organization of that State. There are every-day services to maintain in New South Wales; services which, to some extent, are enjoyed by honourable members, and which are for their own personal welfare. The maintenance of the general health of the community is a charge upon the State, just as is the eradication of the cattle tick pest to which frequent reference has been made' in this House. If the State revenues were seized, the State Government would be unable to carry out its obligations in that respect -Any attempt on the part of this Government to seize State revenues is likely to disorganize and dislocate the essential activities of that State. This Government is out to upset the existing social order in New South Wales at a time when it is faced with a financial crisis. Men and women do not think normally when living from day to day under a sy3tem of food relief, not knowing at what moment they may have no roof over their heads. These people are straining every nerve to keep body and soul together. The Government of New South Wales has allocated £7,000,000 for food relief purposes in an effort to keep intact the social system of that State. The object of the Government in making tins proposed inroad into State revenues is ostensibly to meet our commitments overseas; but, in any case, those commitments are not just. For instance, according to the certificate issued by the Auditor-General, £292,000 of the amount owing by New South Wales is for exchange purposes. It is therefore only natural that the unemployed who are in receipt of food relief, business men whose businesses are declining, and farmers who are finding it difficult to make a living, will use every means at their disposal to defend the State Government against this imposition. It is useless for this Government, situated as it is, in snug quarters",36,Commonwealth Ov Australia
184,Mr Lane,The Lang Government,37,Commonwealth Ov Australia
185,Mr Beasley,"I am pleased to hearin this Parliament, to think that the mere fact' of passing this resolution will bring about the object that it has in view. One would infer from the statement of the Prime Minister that in New South Wales there are enormous revenues which can be seized by the Commonwealth without causing that State any inconvenience. Reference has been made to revenues derived from betting and amusement taxation. But, after all, those sources of revenue are taxed by the State Government to enable it to carry on the ordinary every day services of the State. The revenue from lotteries may be seized. Is it because of spite on account of the New South Wales lottery having had a serious effect upon Queensland and Tasmania, States which also derive revenue from lotteries, that that source of revenue is to be used for the purpose of paying overseas bondholders \ Let me remind honourable members that the purpose of that lottery is to assist the sick in the community. It is to assist the public hospitals which, in many cases, are being maintained by voluntary subscriptions, and by persons who have devoted their lives to those institutions in attending to ment were permitted to accept the advice the sick and infirm. This Government, which made so many promises on the hustings and said that it would provide employment for the people-whic h it has failed to do-is now proposing to penalize the sick ancl the infirm in the State of New South Wales. The Government can pursue that course to the bitter end, but I promise it that the people of New South Wales will stand behind the Lang Government; they will be prepared to .fight for their rights, allow New South Wales to obtain that and I challenge the Prime Minister to test this issue. The resolution provides that the revenue collected under the unemployment relief tax shall be exempt. unemployment relief is included in paragraph viii. paragraph v., and, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, is included in paragraph viii. New South Wales has, from time to time, endeavoured to provide some form of relief work. The revenue collected from the unemployed relief tax has not only been used for the provision of foad relief. reveuue a certain amount of relief work is given in order that clothing and other things may be obtained by those who need them. Under the coupon system only food is supplied, hence the necessity for some other means to provide clothing, &c. This Government proposes to further earmark that revenue for confiscation, so as to embarrass the State Government and the people it is now assisting. Although the resolution names the revenues which may be seized by the Commonwealth Government, the general public may refuse to pay any clas3 of State taxation. This Government is alive to that possibility, and' hopes that it may bring further embarrassment to the State Government. This is a political move, despite the statement of the Prime Minister to the contrary. Ever since this Government has been in office its utterances have been directed towards removing the Lang Government from office. We shall fight this Government, and use every means at our disposal to defeat the object of the resolution. The action of this Government is unjust and unwise. If the Lang Governalready received from the Agent-General for New South Wales in London, it could at once obtain relief from the Bondholders Association. I am informed that if the State Government were permitted to enter into negotiations that association would be prepared to assist it through this difficult period. Unfortunately, the position is that if the efforts of the Ageut-General were successful, the Loan Council would refuse to relief. This legislation is, as has been said by the Attorney-General, a step in the direction of forcing New South Wales to meet its alleged obligations. The next step is to come, and the step after that will be determined by the people of New South Wales. I hope that they will be successful in their efforts to defeat the action of this Government. sonal explanation.

Every honourable member who knows anything about the bankruptcy laws knows that any person who has had transactions with a bankrupt may be called as a witness. I was called on subpoena. I had had nothing whatever to do with the bankrupt for very many years, and was in no way concerned with his affairs. I should have been quite willing to give what information I could in private to the official receiver, but was subjected to what, in these circumstances, becomes the indignity of a public examination, during which things occur which are capable of misconstruction, and which were misconstrued by the honourable member for West Sydney. I seek the protection of the Chair from this kind of thing. The honourable member who made these statements knows that there was no justification for them, and he has not the courage to make them outside. Treasurer) [4.32] -The subjects brought . under review by this motion were exhaustively discussed during the debate on the Financial Agreements Enforcement Bill, and I do not intend to deal with them again at any length. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) in his speech has briefly summarized the objections which he took to the Financial Agreements Enforcement Bill. I point out to the right honourable gentleman that I there is now embodied in our Constitution a provision empowering this Parliament to force a defaulting State to honour its obligations under the Financial Agreement. This motion is in exercise ousting the judicial power by adopting this procedure, because the final determination of the amount due and payable will be made by the High Court. Certain information I also remind the right honourable gentleman that it is not by any means an unheard of thing for a government to make a demand for the payment of money due to it even before the amount of indid nothing of the debtedness has been definitely determined by judicial action. We are facing circumstances which require swift and immediate action to prevent the possibility of chaos in respect of both ComLeader of the Opposition has suggested that we should proceed to recover the amount due by New South Wales by ordinary action in the High Court. The right honourable gentleman has evidently overlooked that we are doing that very thing. But such an action must necessarily be protracted. There would be very little prospect of obtaining a decision in less than eighteen months or two years. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has pointed out that if the New South Wales Government pursues its present course it will be £4,500,000 in default by the 30th June, and if it also refuses to meet its obligations to Australian bondholders it will be £6,000,000 in default by the end of the financial year. If the recovery of these amounts must be deferred for eighteen months or two years pending a judgment of the High Court, many more millions of pounds will then be due to the Commonwealth. It is almost impossible to conceive what (Flinders-Assistant may happen to the finances of the Commonwealth and the Statesi f that degree of default were permitted.

The contention that we arc ignoring the judiciary and infringing the Constitution is without foundation.

Would the gentleman who is pleading that the default of his Government is due to its desire to help starving men, women, and children allow a judgment of the High Court to stop him from doing what he is doing? Nothing would stop him. The present New South Wales Government would just as readily defy a judgment of the High Court as it is defying this Parliament. advice of the Leader of the Opposition, we should in eighteen months or two years have to face the very problems which are now confronting us, and we should almost certainly have to do something like what we are now doing. We should have to attach certain revenues of the State in order to strengthen the arm of between New South Wales and a bankthe judiciary, and to ensure that a judgment of the High Court would be observed. Moreover, if we postponed this action for eighteen months or two years, the problems facing us would be intensified a hundredfold. There would be continued default in the interim, and we should still have to do the very thing which the Leader of the Opposition now wrongly describes as ousting the judiciary. then would have to be much more drastic. amount we should be compelled to recover would not be nearly £1,000,000, as it now is, but many millions of pounds. Probably all the revenues of the State for a year would not be sufficient to meet the payments due to the Commonwealth. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) has argued his case from a different angle. He has said quite frankly that the Premier of New South Wales is out to smash the Loan Council, apparently because, in his enthusiasm, he thinks that he could then obtain all the financial accommodation Wale3, and would thus be able to put public works in hand, and provide employment for the people. We have had our credulity stretched frequently by statements made by the honourable member and Can any honourable his followers, but I do not think that any honourable member of the House can for a moment imagine that the New South Wales Government would be able, without the backing of the Loan Council, and of Australia generally, to borrow anything from any one. That argument is absurd on the face of it. New South Wales is extremely fortunate in having the strength of the Loan Council behind it. It is only this fact which has enabled it to go as far as it has gone. If New South Wales had not been able to If we accepted the throw its responsibilities on to the Loan Council, it would have been in a desperate plight. We are for ever being told that a State should be expected to pay its way only if it is able to do so. Rather unfortunately, a comparison has been made rupt. Apparently honourable gentlemen who make this comparison forget that au unfortunate bankrupt who goes through the court is stripped of everything he possesses. The whole of hi3 assets are used for the purpose of paying his creditors. I cannot, therefore, really imagine that any one desires New South Wales to be reduced to a position comparable with that of a bankrupt. If that time came, a receiver would be put into the State Treasury, and all the assets of the State, as well as its revenues, would immediately become available for the purpose of meeting its obligations. Should such a time arrive, the people of New South Wales will experience very great suffering. Fortunately, the position is not anything like so serious as that. If New South Wales would only show a spirit of reasonableness and sanity, and abandon the attitude which it has adopted, it would be",39,Commonwealth Ov Australia

193,Mr Bruce,"That is so, for thegiven the help that it needs. Al l that is asked of the State Government is that it shall act in good faith, make every effort to pay its way, and deal honourably with its creditors. the other States of the Commonwealth are doing. Unfortunately, New South Wales has not shown the slightest disposition to do anything of the kind. If it did so, the Loan Council would not refuse its request for assistance. All that has been asked of the defaulting State is that it shall pursue an honest and upright course. ""Instead of doing so it has said in effect, "" We will not honour our obligations. It is true that a few months ago we gave an undertaking to the Loan Council to do certain things. We solemnly undertook to live as nearly as possible within our means, and to bring our deficit down to a fixed limit."" On that undertaking the Loan Council, acting for the Commonwealth and the remaining States, came to the help of New South Wales and continued to assist it for six months. Then the Government of New South Wales repudiated its undertaking, and its obligations under the Financial Agreement. Nobody would suggest that a State which has done that is deserving of consideration. New South Wales, because of the largeness of its population and the extent of its resources, has probably greater advantages than any other State for getting out of its financial trouble, if it would only show a determination to honour its obligations; but it would be absurd that that State should receive further help from the rest of Australia or from its creditors, while it .adopts its present attitude. would be hope of help from the Commonwealth, from the other States, and from its creditors, if the Government of New South Wales would but show itself prepared honorably to observe its obligations. But we recall the dishonourable character of the action of the Government of New South Wales. References have been made by certain honourable members to the overseas bondholders of New South Wales as bloodsucking Shylocks, and it has been said by them that it is the desire of this Commonwealth Government that these bondholders should be paid the interest due to them in order to prevent the unemployed of New South Wales from receiving sustenance and preventing the hospitals of New South Wales from continuing their beneficent work. That is That is what an absurd statement of the position. The money which was borrowed overseas on behalf of New South Wales was spent to create for that State the great assets that it possesses to-day; the assets which are now assisting it to tide over its present troubles. The great assets which have assisted the development of that State were created with the money that is now owing to its bondholders. Yet the present Government of New South Wales says that it will not honour its obligations to them. Such conduct must inevitably lead to almost irretrievable disaster. The people of the State are now faced with the fact that every industry within its borders is going down, and opportunity is being taken to transfer industries from that State to some other part of Australia. Where that is physically impossible, the State industries have become unable to compete with similar industries in other States. So far from helping the unemployed, or doing anything at all for the relief of the poor and suffering in New South Wales, everything that the present State Government is doing will cause further injury to the unfortunate people who are to-day at its mercy. The people of that State must recognize these facts if there is to be any salvation for them. Certain honourable gentlemen have said that the action now proposed to be taken is a political measure, designed by the Commonwealth Government because of its venomous spite for Mr Lang, the Premier. There of New South Wales, and the other members of his Government. Actually, Mr Lang and his colleagues, in themselves, do not count at all; it is the incalculable harm that they are doing to New South Wales and Australia that counts. If that Government had not power to do the things it has done, nobody would have been interested in it. It is the incalculable power for evil which that Government possesses and is exercising that gives us concern. It cannot be fairly said that the Commonwealth Government, which, is conscientiously, trying to prevent the ruin of the people of New South Wales and the bringing of disaster upon Australia generally, is prompted in its present action by political spite. It is fighting for a principle in which it believes. The action that is proposed is intended solely to prevent Australia from being faced with the consequences of continued default by New South Wales. The charge that the action of this Government is prompted by political motives does not assist the financial rehabilitation of New South Wales, and I deny that we are actuated by such motives. The statement of the case made by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr its obligations is benefiting the workers of Beasley) was calculated to cause the very damage that he accuses the Commonwealth Government of wishing to do. This Government merely says to the New South Wales Government, ""You must honour the word you have solemnly given to the Commonwealth."" The honourable member and his friends declare that the Commonwealth Government is trying to starve the people of New South Wales, to deprive the unemployed of sustenance, and to prevent the giving of medical assistance to tlie poor. It is such inflammatory speeches, and not the action taken by the Commonwealth Government, that endanger the interests of this country, and I trust that the people of Australia will realize this. Although the highest basic wage in Australia is paid in New South Wales, the real wages of the people there, as determined by the purchasing power of the money they receive, bear an extremely unfavorable comparison with those of workers in other parts of Australia. The following figures were prepared by the Comrnouwealth Statistician, and were quoted at the Premiers Conference that was held recently in Melbourne, and have not been challenged. They show the percentage change from June, 1929, to June, 1931, in real wages for full employment and after allowing for unemployment:Percentage Decline in Bise in Beal Heal Wages Wages for Full Allowing for lent propaganda. Employment. UnemployPer cent. New South Wales Victoria+ 6.44 13.63 Queensland South Australia . . Western Australia Tasmania Australia Mr Bruce. The full significance of the facts will be realized by a study of both columns of that table. Surely the people must be beginning to realize what is happening. Put shortly, the position is this: Although the wage paid in New South Wales is higher than that paid in the other States, the workers in New South Wales are infinitely worse off than those in any other State. I shall, therefore, dismiss the suggestion that the conduct of the New South Wales Government in refusing to honour that State. On the contrary, its refusal to pay its debts is gradually, and continuously, making their position worse than that of the workers throughout the rest of the Commonwealth. On the subject of the attachment of particular revenues of New South Wales, I need only say that the amount now owing by the State to the Commonwealth is, because of the State's failure to meet its obligations to its bondholders, something less than £1,000.000. When this resolution has been passed by both Houses of the Parliament the Commonwealth Government will proclaim only some of the revenues mentioned in it. If the New South Wales Government was prepared to meet its obligations, the amount due to the Commonwealth could be recovered from the income tax within a period of from eight to ten weeks,_ and it would be unnecessary to attach any other revenue. There need l:>e 110 dislocation of the affairs of New South AYales as the result of the action of the Commonwealth Government. If any further action has to be taken, it will be on account of something done deliberately by the Premier of New South Wales.

Against that may be set off certain moneys that are due to the State of New South Wales by the Commonwealth Government uncier the terms of the Einancial Agreement, amounting to roughly £243,000 a month. If that total is deducted from the amount that will be due by the Lang administration if it continues to default in its overseas commitments, the sum owing to the Commonwealth Government at the end of the financial year will be £4,577,000. If that of the Lang Administration. Government also defaults in its internal interest obligations, a further sum of £1,4'00,000 will be involved, making the total of £5,97S,000 to which I have referred, which is a little more than the sum that can be attached. This resolution would give the Commonwealth Government power to attach not only the sum of £924,000 that is now due, but any additional sum of moneys that the Commonwealth may have to pay to the bondholders of the State because of the default delay of eighteen months or two years if of the Government of New South Wales. It will merely be necessary for the Attorney-General to issue further certificates showing the amounts due and owing, and this Government can then issue a proclamation attaching other revenues specified in the resolution. Obviously the Commonwealth Government must safeguard itself by including in this motion revenues estimated to be equal to the amount of the possible future defaults of the Government of New South Wales. It is sincerely to be hoped that that Government will yet see the error of its ways, and avoid bringing further disaster and dishonour upon the State of New South Wales. I sincerely trust that there will be no necessity for the Auditor General to issue any further certificates, and that this will be the end of the whole sorry story. Apparently the Government, suffering from the pangs of remorse for having allowed Australia to default, is now rushing from blunder to blunder in an endeavour to rehabilitate itself in the estimation of investors overseas. It would have been most interesting to listen to the debate that took part in the Nationalist party room after the Government declared its intention to follow the policy of Mr Lang and default. Senator Colebatch, one of the ablest men in the ranks of the Nationalist party, and an ex-Premier of Western Australia, declared that the Federal Government had "" offended and wrecked the confidence of the public investor"". It is fast losing whatever principles it possessed, and listening to the dictates of the outside political machine it is adopting what will prove to be unconstitutional methods in an endeavour to bring about the downfall When the Financial Agreements Enforcement Bill was introduced, we were told that it had been very carefully considered, but before we saw the last of it it was necessary for the Government to frame a sheaf of amendments, to which we were asked to agree at a moment's notice. The Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) made himself perfectly ludicrous by saying that it would probably involve a the Government waited to obtain a judgment from the High Court. That is merely a wildly extravagant assertion by -the who is unable to advance a logical argument to support his case. The right honourable gentleman asked: "" How are we going to enforce the act?""

It is difficult to reconcile that statement with the action of the Government, which, as plaintiff, is declaring that certain moneys are due and owing without first obtaining the decision of the High Court, which is being brushed aside.

There are others who are prepared to sacrifice principle for expediency, in an endeavour to honour their election promises, and bring about the downfall of the Lang Administration. We, as a party, do not"" stand for the repudiation that has been practised by the New South Wales Government. It does not follow, because we take a stand on a matter of principle, that we support any acts of repudiation that have been perpetrated by the Premier of New South Wales, and to declare that Agreements Enforcement we are apologists for Mr Lang is a reflection on prominent members of the the action of the ComGovernment.

But would the honourable member take the law into his own hands, as the Oommonwealth Government is doing, if one of his debtors defaulted? This Government has no mandate from the people to take this extraordinary action. Our quarrel with the Government is over the unconstitutional method that it is adopting to compel the Government of New South Wales to pay its just debts. The Government, has made a tactical blunder of the first magnitude in proposing to seize the income tax imposed specially for the relief of unemployment. Thiscourse must at once rally to the supof the amount due will merely add to the port of the Govei'njne.tit of New South Wales a large body of public opinion which is quite opposed to Mr Lang's policy of repudiation. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) complained in one breath that the default of the New South Wales Government would inflict injustice on the other States, and in the next breath declared that if the seizure by the Commonwealth of unemployment relief fluids inflicted hardship on the unemployed of New South Wales, the duty of the other States would be to come to their assistance. -Clearly the right honourable gentleman is prepared to resort to any argument to justify his support of the Government's attempt to bring about the downfall of the Lang Government. The Commonwealth Government is committing a breach of the Constitution. The framers of the Constitution and the State Premiers who subscribed to the Financial Agreement never intended that the Commouwealth should have power to seize the revenues of a State without first obtaining a judgment of the High Court. Because the Opposition believes that the methods now being adopted are wrong, and because it stands for principles and not for party political expediency, it joins with two of the ablest men in the non-Labour ranks, Senator Colebatch and Senator Johnston, in opposing the extreme action which the Government is taking. cordially endorse the action which the Government is proposing. When the Scullin Government proposed to prosecute the State of New South Wales for default, the Opposition of the day gave to it unvernment was taking the proper constitutional course. understand what is prompting the members of the present Opposition. Not only has Mr Lang defaulted a second time, but it is evident that by the time a judgment has been obtained from the High Court, the liability of New South Wales to the Commonwealth will be greatly increased. Thus any delay in taking action for recovery difficulties of the people of that State. No honourable member of the Oppositiou has denied the possibility of Mr Lang continuing to default, and adding still further to the burden he has already placed upon the Commonwealth. We are told that the Government should not ignore the High Court. Section 6, subsection 3, of the Financial Agreements Enforcement Act providesAs soon as practicable after sucb a resolution has been passed by both Houses o£ the Parliament, and in any event within two months thereafter, tlie Attorney-General shall apply to the High Court for a declaration that the amount stated in the resolution, or any part thereof, is due and payable and unpaid by the State to the Couiinoiiweiilth. It is clear, therefore, that the Commonwealth's claim will in due course be referred to the High Court for decision. It is unfortunate that after the Scullin Government's experience of Mr Lang, honourable members of the Opposition will not support the present Government in taking action to bring the defaulting State to book.

Although they may be so thin skinned as to object to a charge of insincerity and hypocrisy, their actions speak for themselves.

I do not know whether I would be allowed to term that misrepresentation a wilful perversion of the truth, but the honou the Government for allegedly defaultorable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr ing in regard to payments due by New Makin) can place upon it his own construction, according to his particular conception of ethics. Mr Lang gave the Commonwealth Government only 24 hours notice of his intention to default, aud the Commonwealth had not time to make arrangements to avoid that default; yet the Deputy Leader of the Opposition bus said that we who are supporting the Government are suffering pangs of remorse for having sinned in the same way as Mr Lang. I do not know whether I would be in order iu describing that remark as insincere, but the fact is clear that the Commonwealth Government was forced into a distasteful position by an unscrupulous State Government. ber for Barton is not in order in discussing the merits of the Opposition or any other party. I ask him to confine his remarks to the motion before the House. persuade members of the Opposition to recognize the inconsistency of their attiture. [Quorum formed.] The arguments advanced by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Eorde) were not characterized by common sense or sincerity. His references to the alleged default of the Commonwealth Government were an attempt to link up this Government with the Lang Government of New South Wales. He and the other members of his party have been giving tacit support to the Government of New South Wales in its refusal to meet the just claims of the Commonwealth. The statement of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), and, after him, of the Deputy Leader( Mr Forde), cannot be interpreted as meaning anything else than that they stand behind the New South Wales Government in the dispute with the Oommonwealth Government. Whatever the merit of the technicalities which have been raised, I am surprised that honourable members opposite should support the action of the Lang Government. I have no doubt that the Premier of New South Wales, in defending his policy, will make full use of the fact that these proposals have been consistently opposed by the Federal Labour party. Members of the Opposition tried first of all to cast obloquy South Wales, and it is now opposing the attempts of the Commonwealth Government to recover the money due to it. Contrast the attitude of the Opposition \vith that of the party now supporting the Government, when that party was in opposition.

I believe that clauses 5 and S of the motion, taken together, make it clear that there is no intention on the part of the Commonwealth Government to interfere with such revenue. Clause5 gives power to attach the revenue derived from income taxation, but clause S clearly indicates that the Government has no intention to attach income taxation revenue, which has been specially set apart for the purpose of relieving unemployment. Sufficient revenue will be obtained by the Government of New Soutli Wales from ordinary income tax sources between now and the end of June to meet the debt due to the Commonwealth. The last two montlis of the financial year always yield more revenue from direct taxation than any corresponding period throughout the year. Therefore, it will not be necessary, in order to satisfy this debt, to levy on revenues raised for the relief of unemployment.

Government, in seizing the revenues of that State, desires to bring about chaos for the purpose of forcing an election. This resolution has been introduced in a venomous political spirit. New South Wales is being carpeted by other States which have from time to time been nursed by that State. Many thousands of pounds have been made available by New South Wales for the assistance of Tasmania. I ask him to ignore interjecWestern Australia and South Australia, and inreturn those States are biting the hand that fed them. New South Wales contributes to the CommonwealthTreasury 14s. 4d. more per head of population than it receives from it. The business of Tasmania is about equal to that transacted by the Coal Miners Federation, to which I belong. The business dealings of that State are no bigger than those of the Sydney City Council. Yet Tasmania is a party to this attempt to smash New South Wales, a State which has two-fifths of the total population of Australia, and provides two-fifths of its total revenues. The action that this Government is taking is not likely to strengthen the ties of federation. Honourable members generally do not seem to realize that the operation of this legislation may bring about bloodshed in the community. Quite a number of honourable members believe that Mr Lang is a monster, and beyond the pale of decent society, but in New South Wales there are many thousands of people who respect the name of Mr Lang. He has shown more sympathy for the people than have the Premiers of the other States. The legislation sponsored by him has been designed to assist the poorer section of the community. At one time a woman, when her husband died and left her with no means of support, had to work at the wash-tub or as an office cleaner, but under State legislation a widow is now entitled to a pension.

The Lang Government has also provided child endowment and workers' compensation, and these have been of great benefit to the people generally. Buti f the Commonwealth Government put the bailiffs into New South Wales those privileges will be lost to the mothers and the workers. The Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) referred to Mr Lang's act of repudiation, but I contend that the Premier of New South Wales has not repudiated. Mr Lang himself has, by means of the State Moratorium Act, given thousands of the people who are represented by the Country party in this House, time to meet their obligations, thus preventing them from being ejected from their holdings. They now owe £3,00*0,000 to the Government of New South Wales. All Mr Lang is asking for is time to meet his obligations, and an adjustment of interest rates in accordance with the recent fall in values. The Government itself, and even the Opposition when it was in power, adopted the policy of repudiation. During the Great War men who enlisted were promised that they would be provided for when they returned, or, if they did not return, that other countries of the world in which their dependants would be provided for. That promise, which was made on every recruiting platform, was honoured by various governments until last year, when the Pinancial Agreement began to operate. The Scullin Government, with the assistance of members sitting behind the present Government, by reducing the pensions of the dependants of fallen soldiers, committed an act of repudiation. When the big loan conversion took place many bondholders refused to convert their holdings, and although the rate of interest applying to their bonds was 6 per cent., legislation was introduced compelling them to convert their holdings at an interest rate of 4 per cent. this repudiation of a written contract? When honourable members talk about Mr Lang's alleged repudiation, they should remember that this Parliament has repudiated some of its undertakings, particularly in respect of returned soldiers and the dependants of deceased soldiers. At present, many of our pensioners are being obliged to live on a mere pittance. The sum of 30s. a week is supposed to be enough for a man and his wife. If a married pensioner earns anything up to 30s. a week, he only receives in pension the difference between his earnings and the 30s. This is repudiation of the worse description. The Assistant Treasurer complained that the basic wage in New South Wales was higher than in any other State. To me that is a subject not for complaint, but for pleasure. I am glad that the standards of the working people of New South Wales are higher than those of the working people of the other States. The right honourable gentleman also referred to the percentage of unemployment in New South Wale3, but he did not say that there are to-day 8,000,000 unemployed in the United States of America; 6,000,000 unemployed in Germany; and 2,400,000 unemployed in England. Is Mr Lang or the high standard of working conditions in the State of New South Wales responsible for this? No; these countries have a standard of living far lower than ours, yet, on a per capita basis, they have more unemployed. It is sometimes said that the cause of the unemployment in Australia, is high wages and short hours, but lower wages are paid and longer hours worked, have a greater percentage of unemployment than Australia. We shall never solve our unemployment problem by reducing wages and lengthening hours. We know very well, that the mechanization of industry, which has resulted in the displacement of human power by machine power, has had a great deal to do with the extension of unemployment throughout the world. I know that Australia, with her unique opportunities-for land settlement, is in a better position than some countries to meet an abnormal situation such as is now facing her; but we shall never solve our unemployment problem until we abandon the Is not obsolete monetary system which is in vogue in this and other countries. If the proposal to seize State revenues were not so tragic it would be Gilbertian. Have honourable members opposite asked themselves what is likley to happen when federal officers attempt to enter State departments for the purpose of receiving State revenue? structions have been issued in New South Wales that no stranger is to be permitted to cross the threshold of any departmental office? What is likely to happen when Commonwealth police officers attempt to take charge of the State lottery office, or of our railway and tramway systems? serious trouble. State officers will naturally obey the instructions that have been given to them by their departmental heads, who in turn, have received their instructions from the Government. When resistance is offered to the entry of federal officers into State establishments, does the Government propose to train the guns of HMAS. Canberra on Sydney? Honourable members opposite must realize that there will be serious trouble when the first attempt is made to enforce the provisions of this act in New South Wales. As a representative of New South Wales, I shall do my very utmost to resist this action of the Commonwealth Government, and I shall fight to the last ditch for the protection of the State Government. ber will be thrown into the ditch. attitude that I am adopting in connection with this motion, and the honourable member for Denison need not joke about ditches. The situation is serious. Surely the Government cannot calmly contemplate development of the situation which unfortunately may lead to bloodshed in this wonderful tralia, of which we are so proud! Surely the people of other States cannot lightly contemplate the possibility of fighting against their brothers in New South Wales! Yet if an attempt is made to enforce this legislation in New South Wales that may happen. The people of the mother State are just as determined to oppose, as this Government seems determined to insist, upon the enforcement of this rotten law, which may lead to a bloody revolution which no sane person desires -. able member must withdraw the word than enough State revenue to meet the "" rotten.""

The Einancial Agreements Enforcement Act may be likened to a wedge driven into the Australian federation"". It will probably result in the splitting of it asunder. This will mean that instead of this great nation becoming united in sentiment the feeling of nationhood will 'be killed in its infancy. One of the troubles about this legislation is that it has been conceived by persons without Australian sentiment or outlook, who have spent more time abroad than here. This Parliament is now being asked to act in the interests of the overseas bondholders and .not in the interest of the people of Australia. Our own people are to be deprived of the necessaries of life in order that overseas bondam sincere in theholders, who are not in need, may receive their interest payments. Surely the bondholders can wait a little while. Even when Mr Lang entered upon negotiations with the overseas bondholders through the Agent-General for New South Wales( Mr Willis) Aushis efforts were adversely criticized by his enemies in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition in New Soutli Wales declared that even if Mr Lang were successful in getting the overseas bondholders to agree to a reduction of interest rates, his action would be ineffective without the approval of the Loan Council. Is the Loan Council ever likely to do anything that may even remotely benefit the Lang Government?

How often have we heard for the interests of the whole of the it3 members eulogizing Mr Lang for people.

What a policy for a continent occupied solely by white tion would not be acceptable even on a second-class race-course. Consider the disclosures that have been made, to the discredit of the Lang administration, regarding "" tin-hare "" racing. On reading the debates that have taken place in the New South Wales Parliament, and on hearing the allegations of honourable members of the Opposition in that State, one realizes that the whole career of the Lang Government reeks with corruption.

240,Mr White,"I am not castigatingme that the time of the House is wasted -An honourable member may not reflect on the proceedings of the House by saying that its time has been wasted. this chamber have shown members generally, and the audiences which crowd the galleries, what can happen in this Parliament, I am sure that their time has not been wasted. Nobody believes that a State Premier who behaves like a fraudulent insolvent is doing the right thing. It must be obvious to honourable members opposite that New South Wales, having defaulted, and forced the Commonwealth to go to its rescue, has done incalculable harm, to the Commonwealth and every other State. The other States have as much right as New South Wales to default, but they are inspired by higher motives than those now in evidence in New South Wales. I believe, however, that the days of Mr Lang and his Government are numbered. Mr Ward interjecting, asked the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) to cease his continual interjections. I now warn him for the last time that he must be silent. default with regard to their interest payments, it would be impossible for the Commonwealth to save them from financial disaster. The result would be chaos, and Australia would sink to a level below that of a third-rate South American republic. Yet the Leader of the Lang party recently had the audacity to say that the New South Wales Premier took his place among the immortals, among the great patriots of Australia, among the national figures! I have seen figures in waxworks with which it might be possible more appropriately to associate Mr the ministerial benches; that members Lang. I was surprised to hear the right honhonesty, and have no regard for public orable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), the Leader of the official Opposition, proof conduct is observed in public life. We test against the action of the present Goshould at least be generous enough to vernment in taking steps to bring to a speedy conclusion its dispute with the defaulting State of New South Wales. The right honourable gentleman is an adept at splitting straws. In his eloquent set by the Leader of the Opposition this style, he told us that he stood for the honour of Australia, and had opposed Mr Lang and his policy, but that because he believed that the Commonwealth Government was adopting a wrong procedure he intended to oppose it at every stage in the action it was now taking. It follows, therefore, that if the Leader of the Opposition were in a majority in this chamber, Mr Lang would still be permitted to carry out his discreditable financial policy, subject only to any belated action by the High Court. I am disappointed to find that the Leader of the Opposition, who was Prime Minister for two years, was not 'big enough to support the high principles for which the present Government is fighting. He should at least range himself behind this Government on the principal issue in order that effect may speedily be given to the Financial Agreements Enforcement Act, so that the people of New South Wales may receive the relief that they need. When this debate began this morning I moved the application of the closure; but at the request of the Prime MinisterI withdrew the motion. My object was to limit the debate, for the sooner the act was put into operation, the shorter would be the time before happiness and prosperity would be restored in Australia. If the Labour party stood for the interests of the whole of the people, irrespective of class, party, or creed, they would realize that it is necessary in the interests of New South Wales, and of Australia generally, that the reign of the present Premier of New South Wales should promptly be brought to a close. After listening to honourable gentlemen opposite, one might imagine that all the virtues are to be found in occupants of who differ from them are devoid of ethics. It is regrettable that such a code concede to others the right to follow the dictates of their conscience.

245,Mr Makin (Hindmarsh) [8.13],"afternoon. I wonder whether they realize the profoundly serious nature of the resolution under discussion. I have reason to question seriously honourable members who comprise the Beasley group. ber means the Labour party. right of that faction to such a title. There recoil on the heads of those whom we is one thing that I shall never depart from, and that is the observance of the principle of honest dealing. The party with which I am associated endeavour to set a standard of conduct in public affairs that is beyond criticism. the Beasley group are under no obligation to me, and I am certainly under no -.obligation to them. I regard as reprehensible the financial policy of the individual whom they set up as their high priest. I approach this matter entirely free from the sectional jealousies which members on the ministerial benches would like to attribute to me. No one has received less generous treatment, or has been subjected to more open hostility, from that group than I , and I repel emphatically any insinuation that I hold a brief for members of the Beasley section, or for the person that they represent in this chamber. I contend that the Government is not justified in taking an action which cuts right across the fundamental principle of British justice that the accuser shall not constitute himself his own court. The Government should have adopted the constitutional way of dealing with this problem, one that is free of any taint of malice. member for Barton( Mr Lane) endeavoured to create the impression that honourable members of the official Oppositiou were guilty of gross inconsistency in this matter. He stated that when the Scullin Government was in power members of the present Administration, who were then in opposition, gave it their undivided supthis, the people of Australia, including port when it approached the High Court to launch an action against the defaulting State of New South Wales. He claimed that in return it was incumbent upon the present official Opposition to stand behind him afterwards. this Government in whatever course of action it deemed wise to pursue , to deal with the present situation. If the action of the Government were similar to that of the Scullin Government, there would be no doubt as to our attitude, but we refuse to endorse the unconstitutional methods that are now being followed. We may be convinced that the claim of the Commonwealth Government against the Government of New South Wales is sound, but we believe that the procedure I distinctly deny the that is being adopted is unwise, and will seek to safeguard. There is a proper course for a government to pursue in such circumstances. Members of vernment is following may prove to be much longer than that taken by the Scullin Government, I warn honourable members opposite of the serious consequences that may follow the action of this Government when it sets aside the High Court and trespasses upon the sovereign rights of the government of a State. There is uo question, that the Premier of New South Wales will challenge the validity of the action of this Government, which will delay matters longer than if the Commonwealth Government had followed the orthodox procedure of first approaching the High Court. Nothing is more likely to arouse the antipathies of the States against federation than legislation such as this. Australia has Suffered much because of interstate jealousy, and the suspicions that have poisoned the minds of the citizens of one State against those who live in an adjoining State have done much to retard the progress of federation. The Commonwealth Government proposes to fan This afternoon the honourable the flame of ill feeling, and will make more difficult the task of welding our people into a composite nation. Australia can ill afford to be divided against itself. I am confident that if the Government had followed the prescribed procedure instead of sponsoring an act of coercion such as the inhabitants of New South Wales, would have stood behind it. a thief.

251,"Mr Makin,","The hypothesis of thewho owed hirn money defaulted he would have to comply with the legal formalities, and prove his claim before he could recover the debt. As with an individual, so with a nation. Unfortunately, there is a tendency on the part of governments to make one law for the people and another for themselves. It is remarkable how governments seek to give to themselves immunity from even their own legislation. Governments and Parliaments should set an example of observing the law, and not seek, by the exercise of their legislative powers, to set themselves above the law, and ride roughshod over constitutional procedure for the establishment of claims. Thei l l confess to the people that they are readvised action which Parliament is now taking will create a state of uncertainty which will be harmful to peace, order aud good government in New South Wales. No one who has read the newspapers in recent weeks can fail to entertain grave fears of the possible outcome of this procedure. right. for Barton may treat the matter flippantly, but a crisis is being precipitated which may cost the lives of honest and worthy citizens of the Gommonwealth. Eveni f only one life be risked, we should fully count the cost before we provoke a struggle between two sovereign powers. No man would more strongly uphold and enforce the law than I , but I will not support action which is being taken M'ithout fully counting the cost and reckoning the consequences. I ask honourable members to recognize the wisdom of first proving the Commonwealth's claim in the High Court ancl trusting to the court to enforce its decision. If that procedure be adopted, any action against New South Wales that subsequently becomes necessary will have legal authority which no law-abiding citizen would dare to dispute. But this attempt to ignore the judiciary, to make the Commonwealth both claimant and judge, and to enforce by duress a claim that it is not prepared to prove in the court, is not in accordance with what I believe to be the correct procedure applicable to the claims of governments as well as of individuals. The members of the New South Wales Lang group sowed the wind and are reaping the whirlwind. For this legislation they must accept some of the responsibility that they seek to fasten on to others. But for their action in the last Parliament, the present Government would not be in office to bring forward this enforcement legislation. These honourable members pose in the House and on the platform as the champions of liberty and freedom, as the special friends of the downtrodden, and as the only men in this Parliament who have real sympathy with the unemployed, but are they prepared to go into the constituencies and sponsible for having defeated a Labour government which would have dealt with Mr Lang by those constitutional means which they to-night have advocated. I am confident that they will not be able to satisfy those who admire consistency, and expect public men to live and act according to their professions. I have a vivid recollection of the proceedings in this House six months ago, which brought about the defeat of the Labour Ministry, and subsequently the decimation of the Labour party. The honourable member for West Sydney and his colleagues are now reaping the first fruits of their betrayal of the Scullin Government. I hope that the workers will realize that these honourable gentlemen, who are professing their anxiety to preserve the living standards of the people, and who are defending the Government of New South Wales against the action proposed by the Commonwealth Government, must answer for their direct action in this House, and in the constituencies last year. In my own electorate, I had to fight, not only my lifelong political opponents, but also the Lang group. These honourable gentlemen cannot escape their responsibility for the legislation that is now being directed against the State Government which they claim to represent. They declaim about the starving people in their State; I know from my own observation that there is much serious impoverishment there, but if any person is starving, it is no credit to the Premier of the State.

Let us take no precipitate action that w ill cause more hardship and unhappiness to the people in New South ""Wales and in the other States in Australia. I admit that New South Wales has indirectly made generous contributions to relieve the disabilities of South Australia, but by the repeated default of the Lang Government, the relief of unemployment in Soutli Australia and every other State is possibly beiug made more difficultI am only saying what is true. If the Commonwealth has to find moneys which should be paid by a State, it is only natural that, the other States will be deprived of some of the funds which would otherwise be available to relieve distress among their people. I heard the Premier of New South Wales say on one occasion that the working people of that State were already taxed to their f u l l capacity. Australia. we might reasonably expect something better from this prophet of the working class movement. Mr Lang said that it was impossible for the workers of New South Wales to contribute another penny by way of taxation. "" If money for the bondholders was to be found,, it could come only from one section of the community, namely, the commercial classes and mortgagee interests. If those sections said that the money should be paid, he was quite prr-pared to provide the machinery by which they could pay it .

Downs) [8.48] -We have now arrived at this stage in connection with these proceedings: Parliament has approved aud enacted as law the Financial Agreements Enforcement B ill , and now Parliament is called upon to operate that legislation. [41] Under the act, the Executive is empowered to obtain a certificate from the Auditor-General stating that certain sums are due to the Commonwealth by a State and then to invite Parliament to pass resolutions for the recovery of whatever debt is shown to be due and unpaid under the certificate. Upon the passage of the resolutions, certain revenues of the State are specified, and certain legal action taken to enforce payment. Parliament has been asked to act upon the urgency provision of the act contained in section 6. When the bill was before the House originally, a good deal of criticism was directed against clause 6, and some of the criticism advanced by -honourable members at the present stage would have been more properly directed to the original bill before it was amended. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) said that Parliament or tbe Government was proceeding to constitute itself judge and advocate in its own cause, and was, in effect, usurping the judicial functions of the court, as well as thbse of prosecutor. Mr 'MAKIN -Hear, hear! studies the act he w ill see that his criticism is not justified. The act is very clear, and embodies a proper principle. When a debt is certified to exist and to be unpaid it is a reasonable aud proper thing' to empower the Executive, not to give judgment, but to prevent the assets that might ultimately be used to satisfy a legal judgment being dissipated, and to If the Premier is so preserve them until a judgment has been given. That is the effect of this provision, and that is all it seeks to do. If the resolution is passed a proclamation w ill be issued, and on the issue of that proclamation certain debts which are owing to the State Government by virtue of statutes will be made available in accordance with section 9 for the payment of debts due to the Commonwealth by the State. That, however, is only a step in the proceedings. The next step is provided for in sub-section 3 of section 6, which is as follows:As soon as practicable after such a resolution has been passed by both Houses of the Parliament, and in any event within two months thereafter, the Attorney-General shall apply to the High Court for a declaration tha*",54,Commonwealth Ov Australia

Sir LITTLETON"" GEOOM I cannot agree with that, beeause, under either metjhod, the case must ultimately rest on the judgment of the court. Both pai-ties admit that already there has been a breach of an agreement by the State of New for action by the Commonwealth. Both are agreed regarding the moral aspect of that, and of the necessity of enforcing agreements and undertakings. The Executive has asked Parliament to participate in the enforcing of the judgment by passing a resolution putting section '6 of the act into operation, and specifying the subjects which should be the subject of seizure under the act. That places a responsibility on members of this Parliament. The question has been asked whether the judgment sliould be .enforced if, by so doing, there would bo a possibility of destroying a State. If there were any such possibility, the judgment, of course, should not ibe enforced. It mrust be enf-onced in sucb a way as to .do as little injury as possible, but ultimately it has to -be .done, especially if tike State .concerned has >the means, and is in a position to pay. That is the position in which we ar.e placed. We have to decide what are the proper .rewsenues for seizure wader the act. 'The resolution specifies tihe different classes of State taxation which may be seized, and the object of seizing those particular irevenues as obviously to prevent the very conflicts that have been suggested by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) and other speakers. The object is to have a method of recovery by which we shall bring the two governments and their officers as little as possible into conflict. The subjects named in the resolution seem to be suitable for the application of the act. The resolution, following the words of the act, indicates that the action is to protect the Commonwealth The only difference of interests until the question of liability of the State is determined. The subjects are: revenue from taxation in relation to betting; revenue from taxation upon payments for admission to race-courses; revenue from taxation in relation to totalisators; revenue from taxation in relation Opposition to admission to entertainments; revenue from taxation upon incomes; revenue from taxation in relation to motor vehicles; revenue from any State lottery.; and revenue from taxation imposed upon incomes for the relief of unemployment. Those are the different revenues which it is suggested should be seized, and no one can. argue that on the South Wales and justification whole they are not fit and proper revenues for seizure. Honourable members opposite have said that the seizing of one or two classes of revenue wiJl prevent the State Government from assisting public hospitals and from paying certain sums fpr relief.

267,Sir Littleton Groomi,"to assist the Executive in deciding what are the proper revenues to be seized. Honourable members opposite have given no good reason why the State of New South Wales should not honour its obligations. The Financial Agreement was made in the interests of the Oommonwealth and the States, and it is valid and binding by virtue of the Constitution. The Commonwealth made big concessions of revenue under the agreement, which benefited the States to the extent of over £7,500,000 annually during the period of the agreement. In respect of borrowings the Commonwealth has undertaken to bear a proportion of the sinking fund payments for the redemption of State debts. The Commonwealth and the States entered into that solemn obligation. What justification is there for one of the States ments under the Financial Agreement, at this stage to refuse to be bound by that agreement? Certain honourable members opposite have stated that New South Wales is entitled to carry out any policy which it decides upon, regardless of whether the operation of that policy will prevent the State Government from meeting its obligations under the agreement. Such a contention is destructive of the whole agreement. members opposite have put up a plea on behalf of the widows and orphans. Naturally every member has sympathy for them, but if the other States can meet their obligations and still provide for the widows and orphans, New South Wales, which is the strongest member in the union, should be able to do the same thing. It should not be necessary for it to refuse to honour its obligations under the Financial Agreement and there is no reason why that State should be placed in a privileged position. This Parliament has no right to interfere with the policy of any State which is within the ambit of its powers; but there is a limitation on the policy of all the States to act so as to enable them to fulfil their obligations. Before the Financial Agreement was entered into the States were limited by their sense of honour. gone. "" exists, but a State cannot claim benefits under the Financial Agreement, and, at the same time, repudiate its obligations under it. The representatives of New South Wales in this House have to look at this issue from the point of view of the other States as well as from their own point of view. Beasley group are not the only representatives of New South Wales in this House. honourable member expresses the voice of his constituency; but we are entitled to heed, not only that voice, but the voice of all the constituencies. Above all, we have our obligations as members of the National Parliament. If New South Wales refuses to make payand the Commonwealth, as a result, has to raise money by taxation or other means to make up the deficiency, the burden must fall upon the federal taxpayers generally, including those in New South Wales. If that be done the State taxpayers of New South Wales will not bear their just burden, and it will fall unfairly on the other five States. HonorCertain honourable able members should not suggest that conflict may arise between governments as a result of this legislation. We have to appeal to the honour of the nation and the honour of the States. This federation was formed with high aspirations. We have built up a great Australian nation. During the last 30 years we have made marvellous progress in the development and peopling of this country. We have developed rural and secondary industries, and Australia has its place in the counsels of the nations of the world. Our representatives at world 'conferences have been able to uphold the honour of Australia and the Empire. Surely we can appeal to the sense of honour and patriotism of the States and of their representatives in this House to fulfil their obligations and so bring peace, prosperity and happiness to the people of Australia.

Evidently thosefooDiorablemembers think that Mr ceived £3,935,905 from the CommonLang should have waited until after the burglars had come and gone before he attempted to get the money. I think that he is to be commended for his foresight in protecting money which is needed to provide the necessaries of life for the --eople of New South Wales. Honourable members opposite, who are favorable to the attachment of State revenues by this Government in order to ensure the payment of the interest obligations of that State, seem to think that no hardship will be inflicted on the people if £1,000,000 is extension of our railway and tramway applied for this purpose. One would imagine from the remarks of these honourable gentlemen, that the State Premier wants the State revenues for his own purposes. Why are they not honest and straightforward, admitting that it is honest for a government to honour its obligations to the people who returned it to oflice? No one can point to a single dishonest action of the Premier of New South Wales. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Stewart) may laugh, but I have a clear recollection that a member of the party to which he belongs, who had made certain charges against Mr Lang, was so humiliated that he had, within a few days, to make his apologies to the Premier on the floor of the State Parliament. The leader of the Country party. (Dr. Earle Page) says that there should be no discrimination in taxation between the various States. I agree with the right honourable gentleman in that regard; but has there not been discrimination in taxation ever since the consummation of federation? Is it not a fact that on the average the people of New South Wales pay 14s. 4d. per head more into the Commonwealth Treasury than the State receives from the Commonwealth? Is it not also a fact that the people of some of the other States pay less to the Commonwealth per head than they receive from it, and that thus their States are made able to meet their obligations ? Who provides the moneys to enable these States to meet their obligations? Is it not the taxpayers of New South 'Wales? We know that many special grants have been made to several States in recent years. Mr Ward. Western Australia, for instance, has rewealth; Tasmania has received £-2,465,656, and since 1925 South Australia has received £1,530,000/ The money to provide those special grants has come out of the pockets of the taxpayers of New South Wales. It has been said that the money on which interest is now being paid by the New South Wales Government was borrowed for public works, such as our harbour bridge and water schemes, and the systems. That is true. It has also been said that New South Wales is not carrying any war debt. It cannot be said that that statement is actually true, for wcknow very well that during the war years large sums were paid out of State revenue for the provision of war services. It is now said that the people who provided the money for the construction of the works to whicli I have referred should be paid their interest. But although the investor had everything to gain by the protection of the undertakings in which his money was put, was it suggested during the war years that the revenue from those undertakings should be applied for war purposes? Of course not! That would have been counted dishonest. But is it not extraordinary that the people who had to go to the war and fight for the protection of those public works, should now be asked to sacrifice themselves again to provide the money to pay for them ? This is surely an astounding proposition! Do honourable members opposite who believed that the last war was a war to end war realize that the war cost Australia approximately £744,000,000, or more per head of the population than was paid by the people of any other country in the world? Will these same gentlemen tell us whether Canada assisted Great Britain during the war to the same extent as Australia? Were the Canadian people so foolish as to sacrifice the interests of posterity, in order that the war might be prosecuted with vigour? We know very well that they were more far-sighted than to adopt such a policy. In Australia our leaders had not sufficient vision to realize that the war was being fought, not to. end war, but to secure control of world markets, and that it was a losing proposition for the workers of every country, irrespective of -which group of nations might win the victory. Was it not said that German reparation payments would recoup us for what we paid for war purposes? order. I submit that the honourable member's observations have nothing whatever to do with the motion before the Chair. ing the speech of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) very closely, and his observations are relevant to the subject of interest payments. is hurting some honourable members, but they will have their opportunity of placing their views on the subject before the House, The right honourable member for Elinders( Mr Bruce), who in the delivery of his speeches in this chamber always preserves an attitude of contempt for honourable members, and whose bearing suggests that he is bored, by having to speak at all, had something to say about the relative position of a private bankrupt, and a State bankrupt. He said that a private bankrupt is stripped of all his possessions. No doubt the right honourable gentleman would like to strip'New South Wales of every penny of its wealth, in order to meet the demands of overseas bondholders. He indicated that he would even be prepared to seize the State railway and tramway services, and hand them over to private enterprise, so that the State might, as he said, preserve its honour. He also observed that a continuance of the present policy of the State ment could not provide for the unGovernment would undoubtedly bring disaster to New South Wales. The fact is that if the Lang Government had been able to carry out its policy, and had no< been hampered by the Legislative Council, and by the supporters of the party to which the honourable member foT Hindmarsh belongs, the condition of the people of New South Wales would be very much better than it is to-day. The State Government has not bean able to do all that it would like to have done, but its policy is far preferable to that enunciated by the right honourable member for Flinders, who has suggested that we must starve ourselves before we can again walk along the road to prosperity, and enter upon the new era for -which we are all looking. I do not describe the present circumstances of Australia or of other countries as depression; it is due to the decline of a social order, which has outlived its usefulness and cannot now provide for the needs of the people. Those who are attempting to maintain this order are like the boy who tried to stop the leak in the dyke. The present social order has served its purpose and must go. It has been said that the people of New South Wales are suffering the pangs of starvation, but even if that is true to some extent the State Premier is not responsible for it. I ask the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb), and the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Stewart) whether they would care to live on the rations provided for the unemployed in New South Wales or iu any other State. I speak as one who knows what unemployment is, and who has_ suffered hunger. Although my position has been improved by the votes of many thousands of people in East Sydney, I am not unmindful of their needs, and I hope that I shall not forget that while I am in this Parliament it is my duty to do everything I can to relieve their unfortunate condition. I trust that if ever the time comes when my position here is taken by some one else, I shall at least be able to face the people who sent me here with the knowledge that I did my best to improve their conditions.

They are represented in this chamber by members of the Labour party who do not make mock attacks on the Government, and then fail to carry out their undertakings. The honourable son), when travelling in the train between Sydney and Canberra, asked the members of the Lang group to support the Country party against the Government in regard to the tobacco duties. My party agreed to do so; yet, when the vote on the matter took place, that honourable member repudiated his undertaking and crossed over to the Government side. I view the proposed action of the Gosection in the House. vernment with alarm, because it will have far-reaching consequences. I see no necesthat is frequently made by memsity for the hasty steps contemplated. As a matter of fact, last month Mr Lang paid the interest due by the New South Wales Government, because he was able to do so. Why does not the party opposite tell us what it means when it talks about "" living honestly "" ? Does it want the basic wage in New South 'Wales brought down to the South Australian level? Does it desire the widows' pensions to be taken away? Is it suggested that workmen's compensation, and food relief for the unemployed should cease? Members opposite should not hide their true opinions by using vague expressions such as ""protecting the honour of the Australian people."" Actions are of more value than words. I have heard some honourable members opposite speak of the need for a restoration of confidence, and others have said, "" Get down to world conditions."" It should be realized that every country has its unemployment problem. machinery, the human element is being largely displaced in industry, and wealth is now being produced like water. What the world needs now is markets. In the United States of America, there is no shortage of finance, but that country has enormous numbers of unemployed.

Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [9.45] I do not desire to touch upon the legal technicalities of the Einancial Agreements Enforcement Act at this juncture; they have been discussed time and time again.

The Transport Act threw 4,000 persons out of employment, and that is not taking into consideration the harm that was done to trades that are associated with the transport industry. The means of transport conveying people who live in their jobs was wiped out, and during the winter workers will be subjected to misery and hardship because of this action of the Lang Government. That Administration introduced an arbitration bill that was designed to control industry and place it under the control of union secretaries and organizers. As a result it is likely that the commercial interests of New South ""Wales will be so seriously handicapped that they will be compelled to invest their money elsewhere: The Lang Government also sponsored an insurance bill which would cause bonds to the value of £3,000,000 to be placed on the wealth who live in New South Wales, and market to find cash for the making of compulsory deposits demanded by that Government, so' further lowering our stocks in the eyes of the world. It appointed a milk board, and the people had then to pay more for milk than was previously the case. The Lang Government introduced a transport co-ordination scheme and appointed numerous supporters to control it at salaries ranging from £750 to £1,500. introduced by it has been designed to cripple the industries of the State and to inflict hardships on the people that it professes to represent. has only to mention the appointment of dole inspectors, the Shadier bread contract, and tin hares to remind honourable members that the whole history of Lang administration is unsavoury, and directly opposed to the interests of the people of New South Wales. The honourable member for Hindmarsh stated that Mr Lang had declared that *he people of his State were taxed to the limit, and that the only sections that had not been taxed to capacity were the commercial and mortgagee sections. Lang owns about £13,000 in debentures in the Labour Daily so he may be included b in the mortgagee class. That is possibly why he has not pursued that section with greater vendictivcness. Mr Lang proilr. E. ./. Harrison. posed to increase the unemployment tax from Is. to 5s. in the £1, and thus to inflict further burdens on the workers of New South Wales. The people that I represent are New South Welshmen, who love their State, but who first of all are Australians, and have a sense of national honour. They believe that outlying suburban districts to the Financial Agreements Enforcement Act is a national measure, designed to preserve the honour and integrity of Australia. Some honourable members have questioned the need for hurry in this inatter. When the body politic is suffering from a cancerous growth it is necessary to apply with all speed the keenest lancet of political endeavour that is available to remove that growth so that the tissues may heal, and the Mother State of the Commonwealth regain a healthy body. That is why there is need for haste. It is necessary for the protection of the two-fifths of the people of the Commonfor the protection of our national honour. The talk of honourable members in the corner about starving women and children is so much political clap-trap, designed only to appeal to the people in the constituencies that they represent. One of the most noticeable features of the speeches that have been made by honEvery measure orable members opposite during this debate has been the endeavour on the part of both leaders and rank and file to convince the. House that this motion is not One a political move. When honourable members remember how frequently that protest has been reiterated they will regard the utterances of honourable members opposite as suspect. We know that this is a move to complete by legislation the action begun by the leaders of the National party at the meetings of tbe Premiers Conference and Loan Council. There assembled at tliose conferences representatives of the Governments of Australia, each viewing these matters from a different angle. The representatives of the States which had endeavoured Mr to carry out the Premiers plan in its entirety, by imposing upon their people tremendous burdens, had to admit that the sacrifices made by their people were in vain; that they could not balance their budgets. The Premier of New South",63,Commonwealth Ov Australia
294,Mr Rosevear (Dalley) [9.52],"Wales did not adhere to the terms of the Premiers agreement, but the position of New South Wales was no worse than that of other States which had endeavoured to do so. The Premier of South Australia declared that ""budgets must be balanced, even if the people of my State have to make further sacrifices "", while the Leader of the Government of Victoria said, "" The workers of Australia will have to take their belts in a few more notches"", and the Premier of Queensland, whose State was in an infinitely worse position than New South Wales, as he himself admitted Commonwealth Assistant Treasurer ( Mr than the action this Government is taking Bruce) told that gentleman that the position of Queensland was hopeless, and worse than that of the other States. In some respects the position of New South Wales is the same as that of the rest of the States; in others it is not. Borrowing by that State, the richest in the Commonwealth, has been prevented because of the determinations of the Loan Council, which is comprised of representatives of States many of which have been for some time in a state of bankruptcy, and dependent upon the charity of the Commonwealth. In addition, moneys due to New South Wales from federal sources have been confiscated hy the Commonwealth Government, with the result that the Lang Government has been entirely dependent upon ""its own taxation resources to carry on its social services. The Commonwealth Government now proposes to attach even those revenues. It knows that by doing so it will embarrass the Lang Administration in carrying out the ordinary functions of government. That, of course, is just what this Government desires. Like all previous Tory administrations it acts first and argues about the legality of the matter afterwards. acted on behalf of its people with the same vigour and the same disregard for legal formalities which characterize the actions of this Government in the interests of its supporters, in all probability it would be in -office to-day. The honourable member for Darling Downs( Sir Littleton Groom) tried to Government of the revenues of New South Wales. He said that it did not matter if the ordinary legal process was not complied with in this instance, as the departure from orthodox action was justified by expediency. The seizure of the revenues of New South Wales is claimed to be justified whether the High Court declares that action to be legal or otherwise. In the meantime what is to happen in New South Wales? It is claimed that the lack of confidence that is allegedly felt in the Government of New South Wales is reflected throughout Australia. Nothing is more calculated to destroy the confidence of investors in Australian securities in regard to New South Wales. The Prime Minister has paraded his allegedly fair treatment of that State. To-day he stated that he went so far as to make a final appeal to the Lang Government during the week-end to do the right thing as he saw it. Let me examine the wonderful opportunity that was afforded to the Premier of New South Wales to make a deathbed repentance. On Friday, the Enforcement Bill was passed, and on Saturday it received the assent of the Governor General. Apparently there wa3 little doing on Sunday, but on Monday the Government set the law in motion. On Tuesday, it secured a certificate from the Auditor-General, and to-day it submits this resolution for putting the bailiff into the Treasury of New South Wales. Yet the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) parades as a virtue the last effort of the Commonwealth Government to awaken the State Government to a sense of its responsibility to the bondholders. We are told that this measure is urgent, and that New South Wales has defaulted to the extent of £924,000. The Prime Minister did not disclose, nor will the Had the Scullin Government Nationalist press do so, that £242,000 of that amount is due to the adverse exchange rate, which is manipulated by the .financial interests supporting the Commonwealth Government. The resolution proposes the seizure of several specified forms of revenue, and to justify the extent of the raid, the Assistant Treasurer built up a supposititious case justify the seizure by this which depends wholly on the word "" if",64,Commonwealth Ov Australia
295,Mr Bernard Corser,That is not so.,65,Commonwealth Ov Australia
296,Mr Eoseyear,"In any case theHe said that if New South Wales should continue to repudiate its overseas liabilities, if in future it repudiates tlie interest owing to the Australian bondholders, and if such repudiation continues for a further six months, a stated amount will be owing. man admitted immediately afterwards that the amount at present due by the State to the Commonwealth could be recovered by attaching the income tax revenue for the next eight weeks. But by specifying revenues totalling much more than the present 'liability of the State, Cabinet will have power to issue, while Parliament journed, a proclamation which can be manipulated as the Government thinks fit to embarrass the Government of New South Wales. this proposal have alleged that New South Wales is creating a new standard of political morality by failing to meet its commitments. Stale would be in a better position than, any other to discharge its liabilities if its Government were prepared to accept the policy dictated by the Commonwealth Government. Lang is not prepared to do that. His Government could, for instance, save a considerable amount of money by closing non-paying railways. Would the Gountry party approve of that? If overseas commitments are to be met regardless of tbe sacrifice entailed on the people of New South Wales, the Government would possibly be justified in conserving the finances of the State by discontinuing railway services which are a burden on the Treasury. Another £2,000,000 could be saved if the State Government were to enforce the payment of the amounts due to it during the last twelve months by the farmers-debts which the Lang Government has waived in order that these primary producers may be relieved of a portion of their burden. Would Ibe Country party approve of that? Again, if the Commonwealth Government were to expend in New Soutli Wales the revenue it collects there, the State Government would be in a better position to meet its commitments. ing to Commonwealth Treasury returns, the federal revenue received New Mr Rosevear. £25,147,000, and Commonwealth expenditure in that State £23,372,000. New South Wales, during the twelve months, paid into the Eederal Treasury £1,750,000 more than was returned to it. In other words, 14s. per head of the taxation raised The riglit honourable gentlein New South Wales, and 103. per head of that raised in Victoria, was spent in other States. On the other hand, the Commonwealth expended in other States the following amounts per capita more than it collected in those States:-Queensland , 9s.; South Australia, los. 9d.; Western Australia, -ios. 4d.; and Tasmania, 76s. 3d. is adYet the representatives of these States have the effrontery to charge New South Wales with having refused to ""meet its commitments. But for the Supporters of federal revenues collected in New South Wales and Victoria being expended in other parts of the Commonwealth, the finances of the other States would be in an Possibly that infinitely worse position than they are to-day. The Prime Minister, the AssistantTreasurer, and the Leader of the Country party are most solicitous for the welfare Mr of the oversea bondholders who, we are assured, are not Shylocks. Indeed, the Assistant Treasurer declared that the foreign lender has been a benefactor to New South Wales, inasmuch as the great public works of that State are assets which were created by loan expenditure. The right honourable gentleman neglected to mention that the bondholders have been repaid over and over again, in interest, the money they lent. Whilst the Commonwealth Government is so concerned about compelling New South Wales to pay its debts to the bondholders, Ministers have not shown similar enthusiasm in attempting to recover from the Kylsant Shipping Company the money contracted to be paid for the purchase of the Commonwealth Shipping 'Line. If the Government is justified in putting the bailiff into the New South Wales Treasury to recover £900,000, it should adopt the same procedure to recover moneys amounting to £1,320,000 in respect of which default has been committed by Lord Kylsant, to Accordwhom the Bruce-Page Government sold the Commonwealth Line of steamers at a from sacrifice. The money with which those South Wales last year was steamers were purchased by the Commonwealth was borrowed, and surely the purchaser of those ships from the Commonwealth will not force the lenders to forgo their money. If the Commonwealth Government will collect in behalf of the people the money owing for the ships, it will at least give some evidence that it is sincere and consistent in insisting that obligations should tax does uot .nearly cover the paybe honoured. The Assistant Treasurer told the House that the credit of New South Wales has disappeared. That is a remarkable statement, having regard to the fact that private capitalists were prepared to finance the building of the eastern suburbs railway at a cost of £8,000,000, and to accept New South Wales Government bonds in payment. If the Loan Council and the Premiers Conference had been sincerely desirous of relieving unemployment, they would not have refused to co-operate with the Government of New South Wales in arranging to finance that project. The expenditure of £8,000,000 in New South Wales would have provided work for many hundreds of the unemployed. reasonably large? pared with the expenditure on other public works. mere pre-election bluff. negotiations had proceeded so far that the Government was able to name the contractors, who in turn publicly stated that they would find the £8,000,000 required and accept New South Wales Government bonds. bonds endorsed by the Commonwealth. were prepared to accept New South Wales bonds without any guarantee by the Commonwealth, but the Loan Council would not allow the State Government to accept the offer. have paid interest on it? member might put that question to Mr ing world prices for primary products, Lang. One remarkable feature of this resolution is the misleading wording of item v.: "" revenue from taxation upon incomes, but not including revenue from taxation imposed by the Unemployment Relief Tax Act 1931"". The Assistant Treasurer stated that because of the specific exclusion of the proceeds of that act, the money raised for unemployment relief will not be claimed by the Commonwealth. The right honourable gentleman knows as well as I know that the special unemployment relief ments made by the 'State Government for the relief of the unemployed. Moreover, all classes of revenue are paid into a common fund, and it is impossible to discriminate between one kind of income tax and another. The talk of separating one form of revenue froni other forms is sheer hypocrisy, and the endeavour to make the people believe that the workless are sustained only by the revenue from the unemployment relief tax is a mere subterfuge. Every source of revenue is being tapped to provide work and sustenance for the unemployed; therefore this House may as well delete the qualifying words in item v. and frankly tell the people what the Government is really doing. The Assistant Treasurer stated that the high basic wage in New South Wales is responsible for the distressful conditions in that State. If bigh wages are responsible for conditions in New South Wales, what is responsible for unemployment in South Australia? If low wages are the solution of the unemployment problem, let us got down to the coolie standard at once. Perhaps the right honourable member would be satisfied then. If this argument is sound, the coolie standard is the only remedy for unemployment. According to him, the lower wage3 are, the better it is for the country. Therefore, India, China, Japan, and other eastern countries, where the people work as long as the sun shines, for the lowest possible wages, should be the working' man's paradise, but even those countries have their unemployment problem. The fact is that the reduction * of wages will not solve the unemployment problem, and members of the Country party should be the last persons to advocate wage reduction. Owing to fallmany farmers are suffering hardship today. The only hope for them is to develop a strong, local market, and that cannot be done by reducing wages.",65,Commonwealth Ov Australia

The Eederal Government availed itself of the relief afforded by the Hoover moratorium, and the same sort of treatment should he accorded the Government of New -South Wales. That Government is nof defaulting because it wishes to do so. The alternative before the Government of New South Wales is to meet its obligations to the overseas bondholders, or to do its duty by the people it represents. It is one of the proudest claims of our party that the Government of New South Wales had no hesitation in saying that the people of Australia should come first. The honourable member for Hindmarsh blamed us for the position he is in to-day; but the honourable member cannot honestly blame any one but himself. If he were in his proper place, he would be among the Government supporters. doned any Labour principles he ever had when he supported legislation which attacked the wage standard of the workers, and the pensions of those who were least able to help themselves. voted against the economy plam of the Labour paftyj although they voted * against the Scullin economy measures, first took good care to see that those measures would be passed. The honourable ""member for Cook( Mr Riley) was one of those. He whipped up his own party to vote for the measure, but "" squibbed "" the issue himself, and voted against it. It is certain that if the Labour stitutional or not. We realize that if we party could not solve the unemployment problem, the reactionary Nationalist for -.p-s will not be able to do so. We are noff offering, any apologies' for our attitude'in regard to these proposals. The fact that our group is in this Parliament to-day, even though we are small in numbers, shows that the people we represent support the action of the Government ef New South Wales, and we represent some of the biggest industrial districts , in which the blows of the Scullin1 economy measures were felt the hardest. The Unemployment problem was really responsible for the downfall of the Scullin Government, and it will bring about the downfall of this Government also. Those who organized the campaign of the party now in oflice were keen psychologists'; they recognized that the unemployed were becoming depressed, and were ready to turn to any party which would promise them relief. Numerous promises were made to the unemployedpromises which there was never any hope or intention of carrying out. Perhaps the Government thinks it is doing something clever in attempting to embarrass the Government of New South Wales by means of the debt enforcement legislation. No doubt, it is a shrewd political move, but it will inflict great hardship on the workers of New South Wales, and they are not likely to forget it. Honourable members who represent New South Wales constituencies will be held responsible for their support of the action that is being taken to-night. He abanSouth Wales would not accept my challenge to resign, and contest his seat against me. lenges are freely issued during election time. Donations are promised to hospitals, but the hospitals never receive them. Challenges to political contest are flung out but never eventuate. If the Premier of New South Wales were to bother his head about all the challenges issued to him by political cranks who want to contest his seat against him, his whole time would be given up to fighting elections. As I said before, the Government is notconcerned whether this legislation is conhad the wisdom of Solomon and the eloquence of Demosthenes we could not deflect the Government from its purpose.",67,Commonwealth Ov Australia

309,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [10.26]. When,"huge exchange"". Following the advice of Napoleon, I have delved into history, but I can find nothing, not even iiv the United States of America, to compare with this Government's contemplated action of putting bailiffs into a sovereign State. I know that the young men of New South Wales will oppose that action strenuously, and if blood is shed, which God forbid, because all the money in the world is not worth the loss of one human life, then honourable members who support this resolution will regret their vote. Queensland, although, the basic wage has I that, would destroy unemployment, v\ Iiicli is the greatest curse of humanity. It is said that an Englishman fears poverty more than the thought of hell. That is a splendid fear, and should stimulate the British race to wipe out unemployment altogether. If the Great War had continued for some years money would have been found to finance it. There is more misery in Australia to-day than there was during the years of that awful war. We are gifted with intelligence, and fashioned, we are told, in the likeness of God. Why cannot we, the highest type of life, remove this great curse of poverty which is the cause of unemployment? My conscience tells me that members of the Beasley group are right in putting the interests of tho3e in want before the interests of bondholders overseas, and so long as I am a member of this HouseI shall vote to assist the unemployed. The legislation recently passed by this Parliament, and the resolution now before the Houso, are likely to cause a great deal of trouble, not only in New South Wales, but in the other States. It is .the turn of New South Wales to-day, but it may be the turn of some other State to-morrow. The Loan Council has assisted several States. When the Labour party was in power it provided £1,000,000 for the relief of unemployment, but the State's agreed in conference to pay the whole of that amount to South Australia to relieve the suffering and distress there. That State received assistance from the Loan Council because it was prepared to lower the standard of living. Yet it is doubtful whether the position of South Australia is any better than that of New South Wales. There is just as much poverty in South Australia, although the living conditions of the people have beeu reduced practically to a minimum. In Queensland men are working two days a week for a wage of £1. When I was in North Queensland, a man who was being given two days' relief work a week, told me that he had a wife and two children. As they were in bad health, he asked me to buy some milk and biscuits for them. That is the position prevailing in would gladly give my life if been reduced to £3 5s. The people are prepared to work, but not under slave conditions merely to increase the profits of the capitalists. During the last twenty years we have increased the production of this country enormously; yet 30 per cent, of our people are to-day on the unemployment market. On the hustings many promises were made by the Govermnent, but what has it done to carry them into effect? It has introduced no legislation which has been of benefit to the nation. Yesterday we had a discussion on the Broadcasting Bill. measures before us, but the only bills passed have been directed at the Government of New South Wales. That class of legislation is not likely to create confidence. The members of the Government remind me of rushing cattle, almost panic stricken, milling and locking their horns together, but getting nowhere. The members of the Government have been doing that since the 19th December. What has the Ministry done to restore confidence in this country? This legislation may restore confidence among a certain section of the community in New South Wales, but what confidence can it restore among those people who are today on the dole in that State? I invite honourable members to try to live on the dole of 5s. a week which is paid to a single man, or to keep a wife aud eight children on £1 a week. The people have a right to live, and it is the responsibility of the Government to enable them to live. No honourable member would claim that a dole of from os. to £1 a week is a living wage. The Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) to-day stated that the trouble in New South Wales has arisen as a result",69,Commonwealth Ov Australia

311,"Mr Speaker,",Order!,70,Commonwealth Ov Australia
312,Mr Riordan,"We have had severalof rhe high basic wage operating there. The right honourable gentleman also said that if the basic wage of New South Wales were reduced, that State would be able to overcome its difficulties. But how is it that there are unemployment difficulties in other countries where wages are much lower than in New South Wales? A few years ago, we were carrying out an extensive immigration policy in this country, and we declared that we had large areas of land available for settlement. The trouble we are suffering from is not due to the action of the New South Wales Government, and the action which this Government is proposing to take against that State will not correct the situation. Very serious results mustfollow the application of this policy. If a New South Wales taxpayer pays his tax to the federal authority, he will doubtless be prosecuted by the State authority, and if he pays it to the State authority, he will just as surely be prose-, cuted by the federal authority. How is this legislation to be enforced against bookmakers who are required to lodge deposits in respect of the amounts collected by them? How can the entertainment tax be collected from picture show proprietors and the like? If a man's State income tax assessment is unsatisfactory he must pay his tax before he can appeal. If he pays his tax to the federal authority, can it be expected that the State authority will listen to his appeal? The carrying of this motion must result in chaos in New South Wales, and cannot do anything to restore confidence either in that State or in the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Government should test the validity of the Financial Agreements Enforcement Act in the High Court. The Premier of New South Wales has declared that he will defy the Federal Government to collect State taxation, and the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has said that he intends to do,so. Will Lyons or Lang eat the leek? The Premier of New South Wales has issued instructions to the State police which will doubtless 'be obeyed. In that circumstance, it seems to me that the passing of this motion will be futile. If I am any judge of tbe Premier of New South Wales, he is not the man to let the Commonwealth Government get its fingers on any of his money. He showed that by going to' the banks at 11.55 a.m. on Saturday, and withdrawing State deposits from them. I was in the Sydney Domain on Sunday, and listened to the speeches made there. It seemed to me that a good deal of sympathy was shown to the Premier of New South Wales. What will happen if there is default by the State for the remainder of this financial year, and the Commonwealth Government steps in and collects State revenue to meet it? Inevitably, many people in New South Wales will starve, for there will be no money to pay them the dole. I am sure that if the Prime Minister saw his wife and children starving, he would not hesitate to take bread from the shops to feed them. That will be the position of many people in New South Wales. If the Government is successful in attaching State revenues, will it use the money it obtains to relieve the unemployed in that State, and to provide sustenance for them? We know very well that various governments have made promises to the people at different times; but the electors are becoming thoroughly dissatisfied with political promises. They want action. Mr Moore, who is now Premier of Queensland, made certain promises to the Queensland people in May, 1929. ber must connect his remarks with the motion. The Queensland people at that time believed that the promises made to them would be fulfilled. In an election placard issued prior to the last State election, over Mr Moore's signature, the following statements were made:IT CAN BE DONE-I T WILL BE DONE. If my party is successful at tbe polls we pledge ourselves to arrange for tlie expenditure of £2,000,000 to find early employment for 10,000 workers. the honourable member to connect his remarks with the motion. way: Mr Moore failed to fulfil his promises, even though £5,000,000, provided for the previous Government, was made available to him by the Loan Council.

If that is so, the Commonwealth Government would act wisely if it took a referendum of the people on the question of the abolition of State Parliaments. and Treasurer) [10.55] -Very little criticism, apart from that expressed during the debate on the Einancial Agreements Enforcement Bill, has been offered to the Government policy during the discussion of this motion. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr .Riordan) and some other honourable members have said that dreadful things will happen in New South Walesi f the Government puts info effect the policy which it has outlined, but I assure those honourable members that the retribution which will follow continued default and repudiation by the New South Wales Government will be far worse than anything that can follow the attempts that this Government may make to attach State revenues for the purpose of meeting State liabilities. The complete failure of the New South Wales Government to carry out the undertakings which it solemnly gave to the Commonwealth and State Governments at the conference which agreed to the Premiers plan is the original reason for the adoption of the policy which this Government is now pursuing. Nothing that honourable members of the group which supports the Lang Government in this House have said, or ean say, can explain away Mr already pointed out that the amount now Lang's failure to reduce the expenditure of his Government in accordance with the Premiers plan. Anything that may happen in New South Wales in the. near future in consequence of the failure of the"" Lang Government to honour its pledges in that respect will be the responsibility of that Government. The Commonwealth is merely taking steps to ""recover moneys paid by it on behalf of New South Wales. Those moneys have been spent on developmental works in New .South Wales. Honourable members of ithe ILang group In this chamber care nothing about undertakings of tbe character to which I hay.e referred, and they are at least consistent in the course which they are following; Ibut the honourable member for Kennedy was one of the great majority of honourable members of this Parliament who, by his vote, declared that the Commonwealth Government should accept liability for any payments due by a State under the Financial Agreement and not paid. Those honourable members who deliberately did that the other day now protest against the action taken by this Government to secure reimbursement of the amounts already paid by the Commonwealth on behalf of New South Wales. that the Government is adopting an illegal course. under measures that have beeu approved by both Houses of the Parliament. The question of the validity of our action will soon be determined if the New .South Wales Premier is prepared to assist in obtaining an early decision by the High Court. All the dreadful things that it is 'hinted will result from the action of the Goverjiment take us back to the failure of the New South Wales Government, in the first place, to honour its obligations to bondholders, and to carry out tlie solemn undertaking given by it to tbe other State Governments and to the Commonwealth Government. There has been an attempt ro make political capital of .the fact that the unemployment relief tax ih included among the various classes of revenue mentioned in the resolution; but I have owing by New South Wales can be recovered from ordinary income tas. If the Government of New South Wales is prepared to meet its obligations in future, the £924,000 now required can thus be obtained in a couple of months, and no other class of revenue need be attached. If it should become necessary to attach any other class of r-evenue, the -responsibility for that will rest on the shoulders of the New South ^Sales Government. That Government, if it chooses, can start out to-morrow to meet its obligations honestly. New South Wales is the wealthiest State in Australia, and if it meets its commitments as they fall .due, it will be unnecessary for the Oommonwealth Government to issue a further proclamation with respect to this inatter.

After Ward) he should have said so immediately it was made. desire ro correct the statement of the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) that I told the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) that I was going to the Maitland show on the occasion referred to. Actually, the Maitland show occurred a week before that date. WhatI told the honourable member for West Sydney was that I was about to attend a sitting of the Tariff Board that was taking place at Newcastle to deal with the matter of bunker coal. I desire to bring the following newspaper extract uncier the notice of the Postmaster-General( Mr Fenton) :. By a. special amendment of the regulations, the Bruce-Lyons Government has abolished the basic wage for a large number of Commonwealth public servants as from to-day. Under the regulations governing the employment of ordinary messengers, telephonists, and launch boys in the Customs Department, it was provided that the adult mini mum wage in the Commonwealth service would be paid on the employee reaching adult age. This regulation has been abolished, and tlie employees in question have been notified that from to-day they w i ll receive a junior's wage only. Previously these employees who had reached 21 years automatically received the basic wage of £182 a year. They will now be reduced to the earnings of youths of 20 years, whioh incurs a drop of £39. That this is a direct blow at the principle of the basic wage is illustrated by the fact that in the telegraph branch, of SO junior assistants, 20 are 21 years of age and over. It is pointed out that it is no fault of the majority of the employees that they are still designated juniors. Most of them have qualified themselves for promotion, but no vacancies have been created to which they could be appointed as adult workers. The only way in which these "" j u n i o r s "" who have reached 21 years can now receive the minimum base rate is by getting married. This is provided for by award. Salaries Reductions Act was introduced, these employees received £232 per annum. When that measure came into operation, they were reduced to £182; now they have suffered a further reduction, which makes their income only £143 per annum. Perhaps the Postmaster-General is not aware that that drastic alteration has been made. It' strikes a vital blow all, it is not. the fault of these employees that they happened to be employed upon",74,Speaker Hon. G H Maokay The First Business To Morrow Will Be The

They have qualified for promotion, but the department has not seen fit to transfer them to other grades. wise have lost their positions? that is so. Surely the Government does not seek, by this process, to introduce a means to defeat the determinations of wage-fixing tribunals? I am aware that the Postmaster-General may not be able to give me an answer immediately, but as I may not have had an opportunity to ventilate the matter to-morrow, I bring it forward now in the hope that the honourable gentleman w ill give the matter liis personal consideration, and that lie w ill not permit any officer of his department to penalize these employees. I desire to ask the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) whether, consequent upon certain legislation that has been passed by both Houses of Parliament, and requires further executive action by the Government in tlie for m of a .proclamation, he w ill expedite the issuing of that proclamation, in order to reassure the people of New South Wales, livin g in that portion of the State which I represent, and also to prevent them from paying to the despicable Government of New South Wales taxation due to the Commonwealth Government? I direct the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Gullett) to the disabilities experienced by settlers in Western Australia who are compelled to pay primage duty on wire netting and calcium cyanide used to prevent the spread or cause the destruction of rabbits. This pest is causing considerable damage in the agricultural districts, and naturally the settlers are anxious to obtain supplies of these commodities at the lowest possible cost. I have brought this matter under the notice of the customs authorities, and it would appear that on one phase of the subject. I have been misinformed by those who brought the matter under my notice. I have received a communication from the Greenongh Road Board, a portion of which readsIn view of the alarming increase of rabbits cheaply as possible. As wire netting and all through the agricultural districts of Western Australia, every road board in the State is being circularized with an urgent request to pass resolutions asking the Federal Government to take off the duty from English-made double-dipped rabbit netting wire. Netting now costs £45 per mile, the best British can be purchased, duty free, from 40 to 45 per cent, cheaper. The damage caused through I am not aware that the pest is enormous, not only to crops, but graziers find their holdings are reduced in feeding value by 50 per cent. That statement is not altogether accurate as I shall show later. In a communication from the Moora Road Board, referring to a resolution passed at a road board meeting, it is stated thatThe particular motion for your consideration is the one . . . with regard to a reduction of duties on rabbit netting and calcium cyanide. An earlier motion, as you will sen, asks for netting at world's parity. World's parity is now about £7 to £9 per mile. I have made inquiries into this matter, and the Minister was good enough to supply me with certain information. I am advised that instead of there being a duty on all wire netting, as stated in certain circulars I have received, this commodity is admitted under the British preferential tariff free of duty, while the general tariff is 200s. per ton. Calcium cyanide is also admitted under the British and general tariffs free of duty. B r it i sh wire netting is not, a3 indicated in the circular, sold at £45, but at £24 4s. per ton f.o.b., as against foreign wire netting at £28 l is . which is £4 7s. cheaper. On the 2nd MarchI asked the Minister the following questions:1. What is the amount of primage duty received from(a) wire netting, and (6) calcium cyanide from the date of imposition of tlie duty to the present date? 2. What was the date from whicli the primage duty was instituted in each case? The answer I received was as follows:1. The amounts of primage duty received from individual items are not recorded separately in the statistics. It is estimated however, that the amounts of primage duty received during the period, 10th July, 1930 to the 31st January, 1932, on the goods mentioned were(a) wire netting £466. (A) calcium cyanide £460. 2. 10th of July, 1930. As the primage duty collected on these two commodities represents such a small sum, the interests of the farmers could best be served by removing the primage duty, thus making them available a3 calcium cyanide are used extensively for",75,Speaker Hon.
