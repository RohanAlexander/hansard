2,Mr Fowler Asked The Minister F O R,,14,Fifthvictorian Contingent
3,Sir John Forrest,"In reply to theminute to the Prime Minister, asking him to move His Excellency the Governor General to obtain from the Imperial authorities full information on the whole matter. When that information is received, should any steps be found necessary, further action will be taken. Debate resumed (from 1st October, vide page 5405), on motion by Sir WILLIAM LYNEThat this Bill be now read a second time. thought last night that this was too important a Bill for one to speak upon from first impressions, and I therefore asked for an adjournment of the debate, so that I might look into it more carefully. It seems to deal -with two classes of property-wit h property hereafter to be acquired and with property passing under the Constitution. As regards property hereafter to be acquired, the power to acquire seems to be given under subsection (31) of section 51 of the Constitution Act, which saysThe acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws. The only condition imposed by that subsection is that the terms of acquisition must be just, and, in my opinion, the provisions of the Bill are not altogether within the powers conferred by it . Take for instance, clause 10, which makes provision for the purchasing of land for underground works, and states that unless the surface be injured by the construction of those works, no compensation shall be paid to the State or persons from whom the land is acquired. I question if that clause could stand the test of an action in a court of justice. The provision, of course, is one which could have been passed by a Parliament such as the Parliaments of the various States before Federation; but our powers on the subject are limited by the sub-section to which I have just drawn attention, which requires that the aquisition must be upon just terms. I put it to the House that to acquire a portion of a man's land, although we do not take the surface, without paying him compensation for it, is not just. In some cases, at all events, the privilege taken must have a value. That being so, there is no doubt that clause 10 is ultra vires. I can scarcely see the object of putting the clause into the Bill. taken for the purpose of carrying on underground works in connection with the telegraphic and telephonic services of the Commonwealth. moment that the carrying on of those services has been vested in the Commonwealth. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Are not all the necessary powers provided for in the Post and Telegraph Rill? may be necessary, for which, I presume, the provisions of the clause would be required. A man is, however, entitled to receive compensation for any portion of his land that is . acquired, whether the surface be taken or not, the principle being that a man's proprietary rights in land extend to the utmost depths. I put it to the Minister, therefore, that there is more than a doubt whether the clause would stand tlie test of an action in a court of justice if it were challenged by any person in respect to whose property it was proposed to exercise this power. Two modes of acquisition are provided for in the Bill-the voluntary and the compulsory mode. It seems to me that Division1 of Part 2, which provides for voluntary acquisition, is somewhat cumbersome, is not required, and therefore might be struck out. Division2 of Part2 provides a pretty quick-mode of compulsory acquisition, which may take place without consulting the owner, or even giving him notice, the Commonwealtli acquiring the fee-simple of land by the mere publication of a notice in the Government Gazette of its intention to resume. If it is not a condition precedent to compulsory acquisition that the Commonwealth must try to enter into an agreement with the owner-and the Bill does not make it so-it seems to me that the more facile method of acquisition provided in Division2 is the only one which should be retained. One reason that makes me suggest the desirability of striking out Division1 is that its provisions are somewhat technical, and might lead to litigation. Division2 brings about the complete extinction of all proprietary rights in, and of all charges upon, property by a. mere notification in the Government Gazette. I think that that is a good method to adopt. It gets rid of all questions of title, and as. to who should",14,Fifthvictorian Contingent

7,Mr Glynn,"Yes; but extensionsconvey, and it throws the responsibility on the court of apportioning the purchase money amongst the persons interested, either in possession or in remainder. The provisions of Division 1, however,""would enable a person who had the slightest interest in a property to barter away the interests of all others in it by a mere agreement with the Government. For instance, a tenant for life aged 78 could, under clause 4, enter into a contract with the Government to sell, not only his own life interest, which would, of course, be of exceedingly small value, but all interests in remainderi n fact, the fee-simple. Unless under the compulsion of sheer necessity, I do not think we should retain provisions which would allow of such a contingency as that occurring. Such provisions are not necessary, because, under the compulsory provisions of Division 2, the notification in the Government Gazette is to operate as a conveyance of the land, and the adjustment of rights between the various parties having estates in possession or in remainder, or otherwise interested in it, can be equitably made by agreement with the court under subsequent provisions. In clause 8, power is taken to compulsorily acquire land > which has been dedicated under a State Act to some public purpose; but 1 fail to see why such power should be taken. Why should the interests of the Commonwealth be paramount to the interest of the public of a State in a matter of that sort ? Under that clause, the Commonwealth could acquire a pleasure ground or park land dedicated to the public under a State Act. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Surely the Bil l does not go so far as that. lands which surround Adelaide have been dedicated under a State Act, but this clause gives power to the Commonwealth to acquire them, notwithstanding such dedication. much consideration, and the proposal should not receive acquiescence until a little more justification is shown for it . required for defence purposes, for instance. poses for which it might be desirable to take even park lands. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Would educational grants come under the clause ? saysAny dedication or reservation of the land made under the authority of any State Act. As regards the method of ascertaining the value of land compulsorily acquired, I submit-of course, subject to correction -that the method proposed is a wrong one. The provisions of the Bil l are somewhat intricate, so that they are a bit confusing, even upon a second perusal, but the method proposed seems to be this : Each person owning an interest is entitled to separate consideration in the matter of compensation. Instead of valuing the land as they generally do in the States, and afterwards getting a Judge-in default of an agreement-to apportion the purchase money amongst the various owners' interests, what is done here is to provide that each owner shall be dealt with separately as to the value of his interest, and by summing up the whole of these separate interests the total value to be paid is arrived at. In default of an agreement with tlie Minister, an estimate is made of the value of each life interest and of each interest in remainder, and from the total of these interests tlie Judge has to determine the price to be paid. That is not a correct method of dealing with the property to be acquired, but the proper way is to value the land, and leave it open if there is no agreement-for the State court or for the High Court to adjust or divide the price of the land equitably amongst the persons interested prior to purchase. An Honorable MEMBER -O r by arbitration. settled by arbitration, but I am dealing with the relative values of the interests of the persons having had estates in the property, and I say that the persons interested should get the value of their respective interests out of The matter is one which requires the total money paid for the property, and not according to the principle of the Bill, whichseems to be toestimate the value of each interest, and by adding these up to ascertain the price to be paid. That is not the usual method, nor do I see on what ground of expediency the Minister can insist upon it .

I do not know really .whether this is a case of the draftsman slipping into loose verbiage, or whether the provision has been made in accordance with the policy of the Ministry. very least, reprehensible that tlie Bill should have been framed in its present form. Now, the most important provisions of this Bill are contained in clauses 44 and 45, and I should like to say a few words regarding them, although the Prime Minister has declared that these clauses will not be finally settled until the conference of the Premier's of the various States and the Prime Minister, or whatever Federal Minister represents the Commonwealth, has taken place. There is, no doubt, a great deal of misapprehension as to the effect of these clauses, and a great deal of interest is being taken in the various States in rinding out what will be their probable operation. As regards both clauses 44 and 45, I might say that the Constitution requires that before this Bill was introducedI will put it almost as strongly as that-the Government should have endeavoured to come to an agreement with the various States as to values. Sir WILLIAM LYNE B ill was introduced ? late before we have done that, and it seems to me that the Prime Minister called the Premiers of the different States together, not as an act of grace, but as a matter of necessity. whatever. Section 85 of the Constitution provides, under sub-section (1), for the taking over of property used exclusively in connection with the department, and this property is of two 16 F classes-namely , property used exclusively and permanently by the Commonwealth, and property used exclusively and temporarily. I do not know how the MinistryY e s ; recourse ought to provides for estimating the value of property used temporarily by the Commonwealth. Tlie class of property that is referred to is, I suppose, border Custom-houses that will be no longer'used after Inter-State free-trade is established-to the best of my recollection that was the reason why the provision was inserted in the Constitution. There is no means of estimating the value of these properties at present, but there is a clause in the Bill which provides that the State interested in such property shall take the steps necessary to claim compensation within 90 days after the acquisition by the Commonwealth on the passing of the In either case it is, at the Act. Under these circumstances it will not be possible to wait until the introduction of free-trade before a valuation is placed upon the property. the period. necessity ought to be provided for explicitly in the Bill. The permission given ^to the High Court to extend the time is intended to cover unforeseen contingencies, but when we can foresee what is likely to happen, we ought to provide for such cases in the Bill -otherwisee it is a case of bad draftsmanship. The Bill does not contain any provision as to how the value of properties not permanently required is to be assessed. The other class of property that passes under the Constitution, or that may be''acquired under the Constitution-is any property of the States used, but not exclusively used, in connection with a department; and it is provided in section 85, sub-section (2), of the Constitution that the value thereof W h y before the' shall, if no agreement can be made, be ascertained in as nearly as may be the manner in which the value of land or of an interest in land taken by the State for public purposes is ascertained under the law of the Statei n force at the establishment of tlie Commonwealth. The Bill does not comply with tlie conditions of that subsection (2). That sub-section seems to clearly require that before we can resort to the State method of ascertaining the value of the land-the Bill does not provide for, but rather abolishes, the State method, which is the only method the Constitution gives us-w e must t r y to enter into an",16,Property For Public Purposes Acquisition Bill Second Beading

That is a condition precedent to legislation, and our power is contingent upon it . Under sub-section (3) of section 85 of the Constitution, it is providedThe Commonwealth shall compensate the State for the value of any property passing to the Commonwealth under this section ; if no agreement can be made as to the mode of compensation, it shall be determined under laws to be made by the Parliament. first part of the Bill to which the honourable and learned member has objected contemplate arrangements being made without going to the court. The provisions in the first portion of the Bill are not applicable to property passed or acquired under section 85 of the Constitution. Property so passing or acquired under the Constitution cannot be the subject of voluntary acquisition or bargaining between the parties under the first division of Part2 of the Bill. In regard to property that is passed under tlie Constitution, 'for which sub-sections (1) and (3) of section 88 provide, all that is to be done is to estimate the value and the mode of compensation. The Constitution clearly lays down in sub-section (2) of section 85 that the Commonwealth may acquire any property of the State of any kind, used, bub not exclusively used, in connection with a department; but a condition precedent to legislation as to tlie mode of compensation, or the method of ascertaining the value, is that an effort shall be made to come to an agreement with the States. member means that recourse shall be had to the method provided for in tlie section, after an attempt to come to an agreement has failed. sub-section, and my opinion is that the Ministry have been driven into this conference with the Premiers as a matter of constitutional necessity. learned member is quite wrong. but the matter struck me in that way last night when the Minister was speaking, and I think I am right. learned member's colleague, MrY . L . Solomon, objects to tlie conference. by that honourable member was that an effort to enter into an agreement as to the method of valuation ought to have been made before this provision was put in the B ill ; and I think that is a very wholesome suggestion. Some of these provisions might not have been necessary if some mode of valuation and compensation had been agreed upon between the Commonwealth and tlie State Governments. Clauseas regards land acquired under the Bill are, generally speaking, to apply to land which is passed under or has been acquired under section 85 of the Constitution. That is the effect of the two sub-clauses of clause 47. Sub-clause (2) providesWhere any property of a State, of any kind, used but not exclusively used in connection with any department of the State transferred to the Commonwealth, has, either before or after the commencement of this Act, been acquired by the Commonwealth under sub-section (2) of section 85 of the Constitution, the provisions of this Act relating to claims for compensation, the payment of compensation, and the mode of such payment, should, subject to the Constitution, be deemed to extend and shall be applied as nearly as may be to such property. I think that provision is ultra vires. The mode provided by the Constitution under section 85, sub-clause (2), for ascertaining the value is "" as nearly as may be"" the method adopted in the States. able and learned member agrees with me, as his concurrence removes any doubt I might have had. The method prescribed there is to allow the State law to operate as to> the determination of the value. That method varies. In some States arbitration is provided for, whilst in others recourse is at once had to the court. In this B ill provision is made not for the method mentioned in the Constitution, and the words in the Bill, clause 47, sub-clause (2), providing that the value shall be ascertained in as nearly as may be the method of the Bill, have no validity. The effect of this is to entirely upset the Constitution. gathered from the provisions in the Bill and the intentions of the Ministry as therein",17,Property For Public Purposes Acquisition Bill Second Beading

31,Mr Glynn,"The effect can only beapparent. I say that the principle of subclause (2.) of clause 47 of the B i ll is the op^posite of the principle of sub-section (2) of section 85 of the Constitution, and I think that tlie honourable and learned, member for Northern Melbourne, if he looks into the matter, as he seems to have done fairly closely, will agree with, me on that point. Clauses 44 and. 45 are those upon which the greatest degree of public anxiety exists. I am. very glad the Ministry have adopted the suggestion which I made under almost hopeless eircumstances in the Convention. I remember tablinga motion at the Melbourne session almost in the terms o£ this subclause. The present Prime Minister agreed with me, or at least said that it was a subject worthy of consideration, and called upon the Treasurers of the various States to express tlieir opinions. The two State Treasurers who spoke-on e of whom was the present Federal Treasurer-gav e their opinions against the motion. The suggestion which I made to take over an equivalent in debt to the value of the properties transferred was negatived in the Convention without division. I am glad that, on the principle that time gives wisdom even to Ministers, they have adopted the suggestion which met with so little acceptance from the Treasurers in that Convention. Hie method which I suggested could have been accomplished then, but I doubt whether we can constitutionally pass clause 44 now. I will quote from what I said in the ConventionThe suggestion I nuike, therefore, is that we to differ from them; sliould amalgamate the purchase moneys up to the lowest amount, which is that of Tasmania, and pay the balance of the valuation money either in cash or by taking over a proportionate set-off? amount of the State debts. That suggestion amounted to this: that we could, owing to the States their assets, have pooled an amount up on the grounds, not only that it is unto the lowest valuation-which Tasmania-and total of something like 4>1,500;000, and the balance could have been dealt with by taking over an equivalent of the public debts of the States. The first suggestion, as to the striking off of an amount equal to the lowest valuation-namely, -cannot be carried out now. I question whether we can. even take over the debts, however politic it maybe to.do so, as. against the liabilities of the States. Section 105 of 16 P i : Pm-poses Acquisition B ill . 5463 the Constitution evidently does not help us. That section provides for the Federal Parliament taking over the debts either, altogether or per head of the population. The principle of this Bill is not to take over the debts per head of the population. But there is no other power-in the Constitution to take over the debts, nor is there without the consent of the States any provision that entitles this Parliament to Now, with regard, to clause 44, declare that the acceptance of a State liability is to be equivalent to payment. That is a matter of agreement with the States* but we are putting it into this Bill as if we had the absolute power to put it there. Theright of compelling the States to transfer a portion of their liability in lieu, of the price does not exist. We have the power onlytotake over without State consent the debts altogether on to take them over per head' of the population. However, the method pror posed undoubtedly isa good one, and probably may be the solution h it upon by an agreement with the Premiers of the various States. Notwithstanding the opinions which have been expressed against clause 45, on the ground thab it is unconstitutional, I say with a certain amount of deferencebecause much abler men than myself Have taken an opposite view of the matter-that that clause, so far at all' events as tlie grounds of objections hitherto urged against it are concerned, is constitutional. There is one flaw in it not hitherto mentioned which I will point out, and which I think can be overcome only by consent of the States. So far as the main objections which have been urged against it are concerned, I shall have we do it ? "" This is challengedby the' amalgamating press and the representatives of some States, was that of constitutional, but that it is a bad method thus have wiped out a of doing it . I do not agree with that argument. I rather support the Ministry.

We have to deal now with the provisions of the Constitution as they are. distinction there between capital outlay and outlay that is merely annual. There is no distinction made between outlay for public works and outlay for the current services of -tlie Government. In England both classes -of expenditure are put in the annual budget. Honourable members will have noticed that this year the annual expendi-ture approximated £200,000,000, a con-. siderable proportion of which was made up of the accidental expenditure and paid out r of revenue of the year.

Under sub-section (2) of section 93 of the Constitution it is declared thatSubject to the last sub-section, the Commonsvealth shall credit revenue, debit expenditure, .and pay balances to the several States, as pre-scribed for the period preceding the imposition of uniform duties of customs. But that is "" until Parliament otherwise provides,"" which may be ten years hence. it may be for ever."" or it may never be done, but Parliament can, ten or fifteen years hence, if it wishes, adopt another than a per capita method of apportioning expenditure. Then we shall have reached that degree of unification resting upon which so many have landed themselves in a wrong position. They imagine that we There is no have reached that position now, but we have not. A t the present time the method of apportioning "" other expenditure "" is absolutely prescribed by the Constitution for five years after uniform duties have been imposed, and afterwards unless we see fit to alter it . I therefore think that it is constitutional to do what the Ministry are doing so far as capital outlay is concerned. But there is one matter that weakens my first opinion that the clause was in all respects constitutional. That is power of apportioning all capital expenditure per head. MrV . L .

How can we call purchase money due in respect. of properties revenue? venue. by or collected in a State. We receive revenue from the States, and after taking off certain debits, we pay back the balance to the States. What we are doing in the Bill is to declare that the credits due to the States are held by the Federation as if they were revenue raised in the States; and, therefore, the surplus over what is required under sub-sections(2)and(3) has to be paid back to the various States. We cannot treat this as revenue, because it is not revenue ; and if that be so, we cannot put it as a set off in any way under the Bill.

69,Mr Glynn,"I am merely pointinghas been objected to as bad. I think it is as policy a very good solution of the difficulty. It is a mistaken policy, for instance, to borrow money to pay the States. I am pointing out what I consider difficulties in applying the clauses. I prefer what is, perhaps, the best method-that is taking over the equivalent of the States debts. There are constitutional difficulties, but if it can be done, I am bound to support that course, having seen no reason to change my opinion as expressed in the Convention. The other is a good method also, because we might at once, with the exceptional means at our disposal, discharge an obligation which otherwise we should have to shift on to those -who come after us. Under clause 93, unless another method of meeting the expenditure than a per capita distribution can be found, those States who now refuse to pay will ultimately have to pay on the very same principle. Whether that will be on better or worse terms depends on the fluctuations of population. These are considerations which have struck me on a second perusal of the Bill since yesterday, and which certainly justify me in giving the methods, suggested by clauses 44 and 45, at least favourable consideration. no doubt that the interest in this measure will ultimately centre upon clauses 44 and 45. I understand that the Minister has consented to allow those two clauses to go over for the present. 45. Mr. BRUCE SMITH -Whethe r the Minister has so consented or uot, I do not think that any honourable member who wishes to deal comprehensively with this measure can fail, or should fail, to deal primarily with that aspect of the Bill. Looking at the Bill as a whole, with a considerable practical knowledge of 'the Acts in existence in the mother State in regard to the acquisition of propertyI refer to the Public Works Act, and the Land for Public Purposes Acquisition Act I can see clearly that this measure runs very much on the lines of those measures. I am bound to say that experience in the mother State has shown that the general principle on which those Acts have been based is a very good one. The principle effects a very good result with regard to the owners of land, and, on the whole, has worked well. But there are some points in this Billi n regard to which experience has produced a great deal of difference of opinion; and I should like, before dealing with clauses 44 and 45, to draw the attention of tlie Minister in charge of the Bill to certain of those points. I should like first to direct his attention to the question of costs. That is generally the last question considered in proceedings of any .kind, but it conies first in order of my notes taken according to the rotation of the clauses. I do not mention New South Wales merely because I wish to refer to the law as it obtains in that State as final and conclusive, but because I wish to point out that, with regard to costs, there have been there two methods of dealing with them. According to clause 16, if a claimant recovers from tlie State an amount equal to or greater than that which he claimed, he is entitled to costs against the Crown. But, on the other hand, if he obtains a less amount than he claims, the Crown has a right to costs against him. That principle was observed in one of the New South Wales Acts for some years, but in the later A ct an alteration has been made. It was foun*d that so long as a claimant was guaranteed that he would be awarded costs against the Crown, if he only recovered as much as or more than he had claimed, there was a direct incentive to go to law instead of arriving at some friendly understanding with the Government. The provision as to costs was afterwards altered, so that when a claimant makes an exorbitant claim against tlie Government, he is dealt with very much as a person is dealt with in respect of legal costs. If he does not recover within a certain proportion of what he claims, he is mulcted in costs by tlie Crown; and that is a very fair provision. If a man has a claim against the Government for property which is really worth, say, £1,000, it may be to his interest, under this Bill, to make a claim for £3,000. All he has to consider is whether, when he ultimately goes before a jury or arbitrators, he can recover £1,000. The later Act of New South Wales provides that if a man claims £3,000, and he does not recover within one-sixth or five-sixths-or at any rate a certain proportion of that amount-h e is mulcted in costs by the Crown. That is, as I have said, a very fair provision, because it deters claimants from making exorbitant demands. Where a property",22,Property For Public Purposes Acquisition Bill Second Beading

I suggest to the Minister that he should consider the propriety of applying that principle here. It will be a check upon exorbitant claims, and will not affect the probability of justice being done between the parties. Sir WILLIAM LYNE the proportion in New South Wales is as large as five-sixths. sixth applies where a client taxes his solicitor's bill. that proportion running in my mind. All legal members know that, with regard to the taxing of costs, if a deduction of more than one-sixth is made from the original bill, the attorney whose bill it is must pay the cost of taxation, whereas, if he recovers more than five-sixths of the amount claimed, he obtains costs from the other side. There is another aspect of this question, upon which, I think, the experience of New South Wales is valuable. Clauses 13 and 14 set out the principle upon which valuations shall be made. not laid down in the first Property Acquisition South Wales, but experience showed that very often, where pavt of a property was taken, the public work for which it was resumed increased the value of the remaining land by, in some cases, a greater amount than the value of the resumed area. For instance, if a man owned 10 acres of land, and 1 acre was acquired for the purposes of railway construction, it was often found that the value of the remaining 9 acres was increased by the construction of the railway to an amount larger than the value of the acre that was taken from him. Under the old state of the upon "" mean t law, however, he was allowed to retain the added value of the 9 acres, and at the some interpretations, it would mean "" imsame time to obtain compensation for the mediately,"" and according to others, "" as 1 acre of which he had been dispossessed. The later Act provided that when tbe valuation of the land taken over was being made, the arbitrators or tlie jury because in some cases the question went before arbitrators first, and if either party was dissatisfied by their award, then before a jury-shoul d have the right, where the added value of the land which was left was as great as, or greater than, the value of the land taken, to deduct the added value from the compensation which was due though not so as to make the claimant a debtor. the betterment principle. is provided for in clause 17 of the Bill. that provision. I should now like to direct I do not think that the attention of the Minister to clauses 13 and 14, which provide the periods within which the different stages of a claim shall onebe made. Clause 13 says thatWithin 00 days after the receipt of every such notice of claim by the Attorney-General he shall forward the same, together with his report thereon, to the Minister, who shall thereupon""Thereupon"" is a very vague wordif no prima, facie case for compensation has been disclosed, cause a valuation of the land. Although the claimant is under an obligation to put in his claim within 60 days after the receipt of the notice from the Crown, and, under clause 14, must, after the Minister has notified him that his claim is disputed, do something else within 90 days, the provision regarding the action of the Minister is left vague. The clause says That principle was he shall "" thereupon."" I have known cases in New South Wales where, the time within Act passed in New which the Minister shall perform his part of the transaction not being defined, tbe claimant has had to apply to a Judge of the Supreme Court for a mandamus to compel the Minister to act. That is not desirable. The New South Wales Act, too, contains the provision that after the 90 days, or after the 60 days have expired, either party, may obtain an extension of time by permission of a Judge of the Supreme Court. That is a very desirable provision. tained in the Bill.",23,Property For Public Purposes Acquisition Bill Second Beading

I come now to clauses 44 and 45, which constitute the crux of the Bill, and in regard to which, if passed, there is likely to be a great deal of discussion if not of litigation between the States and the Commonwealth. Every business man must be struck with the fact that if this Bill is going to do what is generally supposed-to allow the Commonwealth first of all to acquire the property of the States, and then, if no value can be agreed upon, to make some sort of settlement in which it calls upon the States to contribute towards the purchase-it will give rise to a great deal of unpleasantness between the States and the Commonwealth. is claimed by the Ministry-and I believe that the claim was put forward in the Senate rather forcibly by the Minister in charge of Government business there -that under the Constitution the Commonwealth has power to call upon the States to contribute in some way or other towards the capital purchase monej' of whatever properties are taken over. Whether the Commonwealth has or has not that power is a question which, unless the States, through their various Parliaments, agree to forego their rights, will ultimately come before the High Court. I did not hear the Minister who is in charge of the BUI address the House upon this question. I have read the report of his speech which has appeared in the press, but such reports are necessarily so condensed that it is impossible to ascertain exactly the views of the Minister on the finer points at issue. I understand, however, that it was contended that, under section 89 of the Constitution, the Commonwealth is empowered to call upon the States to contribute per capita in some way or other towards the purchase of properties taken over by the Commonwealth. That opens up a very large question. The first thought it suggested to my mind was thisthat if the Commonwealth wus invested under the Constitution with the power of taking State property, and instead of paying outright for it, either by cash or by federal When stock, or by taking over part of the State debts, was allowed to call upon the States to contribute towards the fiur-chase of their own property, great difficulties will arise. The logical outcome of such a construction would be that it would be possible for tlie Commonwealth to take without compensation a veiy large amount of property from the States which has been purchased with money borrowed by the States, and by the borrowing of which their national debts bad been proportionately increased, without compensating them. The States would have to continue to bear the burden of the debts they have incurred in respect to that property : and the Commonwealth would have complete control over it . Meanwhile the bond-holders would have to see the States denuded of the security upon which they had relied in advancing their money, without the responsibility for those debts being taken over by the Commonwealth. I am aware that it holders be just as secure if the Commonwealth guarantees the debts of the States% we are now considering the first of a series of transactions in which the Commonwealth and the States will be involved, and which may to some extent be regarded as a precedent by which the Commonwealth forces the States to contribute to the purchase of their own property. Of course, a precedent in fact does not make a precedent in law; and, although it might be passed over on one occasion by the States, and no action taken in the High Court, the legal right would be preserved in the States to question it at any future time. It is important to look veiy closely into these transactions at this stage, and to do it without party feeling or unnecessary warmth. I take it that, unless the Federal Government wish to come into possession, by some circuitous method, of a larger proportion of the revenue than they would be entitled to in the ordinary way-and I do not for a moment think they do-the y must be as anxious to have these matters settled amicably between the States and the Commonwealth as any private member can be. Without coming immediately to close quarters with the legal aspect of the question, it appears to me at the veiy first glance that if the Commonwealth can take property",24,Property For Public Purposes Acquisition Bill Second Beading
81,Sir William Lyne,Will not the bond,25,Property For Public Purposes Acquisition Bill Second Beading
82,Mr Bruc E Smith,"No doubt; butfrom bhe States, and, under this 45th clause, tell the States that although they are thus taking it from them, and although they acknowledge their obligation to pay for it, they are going to compel the States to contribute towards the capital sum out of which they make 'their payment, it will amount to nothing more nor less than the appropriation of State property by the Commonwealth. If the Commonwealth pays for the property, but at the same time requires the States to contribute per capita towards that payment, there is only one logical conclusion to be drawn from the transaction, and that is that the Commonwealth acquires the property without talcing upon itself the debt attaching to it . The effect of this will be that the public of Great Britain from whom I suppose we have derived most of our loan money-wh o have advanced money upon State debentures, under the supposition that tlie State would continue to hold their railways and public buildings, and wharfs, and other real property as security for the debt, will see-to the extent of the property takenthe assets upon which they relied gradually passing away from the States to the Commonwealth ; and as the Commonwealtli will not take over part of the obligations commensurate with these assets, the national debts of the States will remain in the same position as before. The most business-like suggestion that occurs to my mind is this : that if the Commonwealth is going to acquire these properties the Commonwealth should pay for them-no t pay for them in name merely, but pay for them in fact, so that the States can to that extent reduce their national debts. If a State like New South Wales has a debt of £60,000,000 or £70,000,000 and property of a like value, and the Commonwealth £5,000,000, it is a perfectly business-like expectation that £5,000,000 should be handed over to the State to enable it to proportionately reduce its debt. the interest? the interest, I am prepared to show that it stands on a different footing altogether, and that if the States are going to receive, from year to year, the net proceeds of these transferred departments, the charge for interest on the capital outlay is a very legitimate debit against them as long as the bookkeeping system exists. As long as the Braddon clauses exist, or what is known as the bookkeeping system is in operation, that will be perfectly fair ; but by-and-by, when the Commonwealth takes this revenue for itself, and the obligation to hand back three-quarters of the revenue under the present system of bookkeeping is at an end, the Commonwealth should pay the interest on the public buildings, which form the corpus out of which it makes its revenue. as to the balances between the States. difference. I want to make it quite clear, that so far as my mind is concerned, I draw a veiy keen distinction between tlie capital and the revenue involved in these transferred departments ; and, further, I am impressed very muchI suppose as a lawyer-wit h the necessity for recognising that the Commonwealth and the States are what we call distinct legal entities, just as much as are two different companies, though they may consist of exactly the same shareholders and have exactly the same directors. Supposing there are two companies, A and B. The courts know nothing about the personnel of these companies, or of their shareholders, but lay it down that in doing business with one another or with third parties, they must be treated as separate individuals with separate rights and obligations-as , in fact, distinct legal entities. That seems to me, from my conversation with members of both Housesi n this matter, to be the cardinal misconception at the bottom of their minds-the y do not recognise that tlie Commonwealth and the States are separate and distinct entities. They must be looked at just as if they were two separate and distinct companies, although composed of the same shareholders. takes over property worth I would remind the Minister of a case in New South Wales, where a very large land company was very desirous of embarking upon a big hotel venture.

The Supreme Court held that -although the two companies consisted of practically the same individuals they were -separate legal entities and must be looked -upon as such, quite apart from the individuals wlio constituted them. and learned member advocate that tbe Commonwealtli should go into the money market and borrow £10,000,000 and then hand it over to the States? should, rather than that they should not pay for what they take. I think thab the -Commonwealth will ultimately have to borrow money, and it is immaterial what the amount may be if it receives value for the money. How does the Minister expect the Commonwealth to take over the railways of all the States, at a valuation of probably £100,000,000, without paying money over to the States to enable them to reduce their debbs? for the assets which are taken over they will be placed ab a great disadvantage, because they will have debts in excess of their real liability. the honourable member endorses the view I take. If , by-and-by, under this Constitution, the Commonwealth and the States agree upon a transaction as to the State railways, it must be at once seen that bhe Commonwealth will have to raise a very larjje sum of money something like £100,000,000-in order bo pay the Sbates for the assets which they bake over. W'e all know that without the railway assets the debt of New South Wales, for instance, which I understand has reached tlie veiy respectable figure of £70,000,000, would be a most formidable incubus for that State, because its railways, which now give a return of 3 per cent, and upwards upon a total outlay of about £40,000,000, supply a very large portion of the interest the State has to pay the -English debenture holders. I take it that the only business-like way of dealing with a matter of thab sort will be to issue Commonwealth debentures, and, instead of taking them to the London market and disposing of bliem for cash, hand bhera over bo the States to an extent commensurate with the value of the assets transferred. Each State will then have so much Commonwealth stockbearing interest until such time as the debenbures have bo be realized in order to enable them to reduce their national debts to an amount corresponding with the amount to which their assets have been disposed of. be making an arrangement between bhe Commonwealtli and the Sbates-bha b would nob mean going bo bhe English money market to lioat a loan. I certainly no real difference as far as that is concerned, because a debenture is really only an I.O.U . When a State borrows a million of money in the London market it merely gives pieces of paper undertaking to pay back bhe money in 20 or 30 years, as the case may be, and to pay interest at a certain rate during the currency of the loan. It does not matter whether these I.O.U's. are given to the public for cash, or whether they are given, like bank notes, to the State to compensabe it If bhe States are not paid for whatever assets the Commonwealth has taken over.

The question is, has the perty acquired to be ascertained by a State law and the mode of compensation to be determined by the Commonwealth law ? point with which I am dealing, though I agree that that is so.

96,Mr Bruce Smith,"That is not thebefore the House the thoughts which occur to me in regard to this particular provision, which seems to me to clearly travel beyond the powers conferred by the Constitution. Legislate as we like, we shall not be able to lessen the powers of the States or increase those of the Commonwealth under the Constitution. Although Ministers representing the various States may decide upon a certain course; if the States agree to do something contrary to and beyond the Constitution, it will still be within the right of any citizen of a State to bring the Commonwealth legislation before the Federal Court, and to ask the Court to determine whether such legislation is or is not ultra vires. I do not consider that any Minister for a State could .agree to putting the transaction between the States and the Commonwealth in any other form than that provided for by the Constitution. What is the puipose of this clause for determining the valuation of property if the Commonwealth has power to levy upon the different States a per capita contribution of that identical capital cost ? It would not matter whether the amount involved in the purchase money were £10,000 or £10,000,000. It is just like playing cards with counters, and giving the counters a £ 1 0 value instead of a £ 1 value. It would not matter whether the assets of the States are valued at £1,000,000 or £1,000 if we compel all the States to contribute, per capita, towards the cost of their acquisition. Unless we suppose that this clause, therefore, has been inserted for no purpose whatever,' the House cannot come to the conclusion that the Commonwealth has power to do what is herein provided. Section 89 of the Constitution brings us to closer quarters with this matter. orable and learned member reconcile subsection 85 provides thatsections (2) and (3) of section 85 1 of section So statesThe Commonwealth may acquire any property ment can be made as to the mode of compensaof the State of any kiud used, but not exclusively tion, used, in connection with the department.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE description, because there are certain Glynn, when he said that it is a condition properties which are not exclusively used in precedent of any Commonwealth law proconnexion with a department. applies only to those properties which would between the State and the Commonwealth. come under the definition which it contains. The Commonwealth cannot legislate without Sub-section (1) deals with property which is exclusively used. Sub-section (2) refers to property which is used, but not exclusively used, in connection with a department. It goes on to provide how, if no agreement can be made, the properties shall be valued. But we have the distinct and positive provision in the Constitution that the Commonwealth ""shall compensate the States for the value of any property passing to the Commonwealth "" under this section. To require the money to be repaid by the States would not be compensation for but appropriation of their property. Mr T. E. GROOM -I s that an agreement between the State Parliament and the Parliament of the Commonwealth ? tion is that the State would have to act through its Parliament and not through a Minister. Otherwise it would be possible to -have a Minister of the Crown in one of the States consenting to an arrangement which was ultra vires of the Constitution. We know very well that every citizen of the Commonwealth can demand his rights under the Constitution, just as recently in America we saw that Congress passed an Income Tax Bill in such a form that a single citizen took the matter into the Supreme Court, with the result that the provisions of that Bill were held to be ulbra vires, and therefore mere waste paper. Tn the same way, I take it, that where the Constitution provides that a certain arrangement must be made between a State and the Commonwealth, it would have to be made by the State qua State, and not by any individual Minister. Obviously it was never intended that a Minister of the Crown of any particular State should be able to bind all its citizens to an agreement which was ultra vires of does the honthe Constitution itself.

They say to the States"" We owe you a certain sum of money, namely, your three-fourths of Customs revenue. You now owe us your contribution per capita towards the capital purchase money of certain property. Therefore, we are not going to hand over to you the whole of tlie revenue to which you sure entitled.""

Apart from the legal aspect of the question, the arrangement proposed would have this startling effectthat the Commonwealth takes from the States assets upon which their debentureholders relied in advancing them money. I know ; but on People outside the Commonwealth do not know that the Commonwealth has not also the power, without arrangement with the States, to take over the railways; and if they suppose that there is an arbitrary power in the Commonwealth to take over all State assets, as it proposes to take over these, they might very well become seriously alarmed at the prospect of the States being left with all their obligations, but with no assets to represent them. This is undoubtedlya tedious question, but it is one which every member of the House, if he does his duty, must investigate. I think that we should exercise very great care before we pass I take the whole a measure of this kind, which, we may depend upon it, will only drag the States and the Commonwealth into the federal courts to determine how far the course that has been proposed is justified by the provisions of the Constitution. For my own part, after having given the matter very careful consideration, and with all respect for the opinions of the Attorney-General and the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, I think theframer of the Bill has wholly misconceived the powers conferred by the Constitution, and that, so far as it provides thab the Commonwealbh",32,Property For Public Purposes Acquisition Bill Second Beading

Quite apart from the legal aspect of the rights and obligations which may exist under the Constitution, there is an ordinary business view of the matter which one may be permitted to take. I hold the opinion that the High Court must have a case stated to it of this dispute. sense view to which I wish to refer is this : It has been stated by the honourable and learned member for Parkes that tbe Commonwealth and the States must be regarded in their negotiations and their payments as distinctly separate bodies, and, therefore, as has been pointed out, if the Comwords of the last speaker voice my opinion. I monwealth becomes possessed of the securities of the States, and does not recoup them, their enormous indebtedness will cease to be represented by their assets. In my opinion, the question must resolve itself into one of compromise, and the proper step has been taken in arranging for a conference. In the main, I take the view which has been stated by the honourable and learned member for Parkes. But, while we are arguing so much as to what are the rights of the States, I would point out that the Bill comes to us from a body created for the protection of State interests. The Senate debated it very fully, and agreed to send it on to this House, which is more concerned with the rights of the Commonwealth and the interests of individual citizens than with the rights of tlie States. Mr V. the Senate are not absolutely infallible. ally created for the protection of State rights, and they have sent tlie Bill to us with tlieir approval. That is one of tlie reasons which induced me to give my support to the measure, believing as I do that in committee some amendments will be moved which will commend themselves to the Attorney-General, and will bring its provisions more into accordance with the desires of all parties. members fought very hard for the recommittal of the main provisions of the Bill. the properties which have been taken over by the Commonwealth-differentiatin g the properties of each State-migh t very well have been placed before the House. We have at present no official information on this subject, and such information would be very serviceable to us in ascertaining the distinction between the State contributions as a State and its contributions per head of population. If the omission can be in any way repaired, I am sure honourable members will consider it an advantage to have the information. I look to the conference which for the determination is contemplated as likely to provide The initial commona solution of what is at the present time a rather troublesome matter. If I were a member of another place, I should certainly consider that under the provisions of the Bil l the States would be placed at great disadvantage. am afraid that under the B ill the States will be placed at a disadvantage. The Commonwealth Ministry have seen that we have a most difficult problem before us, and to allay any suspicion or doubt in the minds of the citizens of the States they have provided for a conference between the State Premiers and the Commonwealth Premier for the purpose of obtaining a harmonious agreement. I think, however, that it would have been wiser to delay the introduction of this measure into this Chamber until that conference had taken place, so that tlie House could deal immediately with whatever agreement was arrived at. As the Constitution provides in most unmistakable terms that compensation must be paid, I think that it would be wiser to clear up accounts by paying directly for L .

But I ask the Government to take a common every-day view of the position.

But they are 'told that, not only will that property be acquired by the Commonwealth without compensation, but that, in addition, the State must pay the Commonwealth £588,000. It seems to me that an easier way out of the difficulty would be for the Commonwealth Ministry to say"" We will compensate you to the amount decided upon by arbitration as the value of the property transferred, and take into account any set-off later on."" The honourable and learned member for Parkes, who has occupied in New South Wales a high position in regard to matters of public finance and commercial enterprise, and possesses great legal experience, says that there is danger of a disagreement between the States and the Commonwealth which will result in appeals to the High Court. I do not think any member of this Houseeven the members of the Ministry-ar e desirous that the Commonwealth and the States should wrangle before the Federal Court. public mind is a good deal exercised is the statement made by the Prime Minister that the Commonwealth can sue but cannot be sued, and these two matters taken together have given rise to a feeling of grave unrest, not only in New South Wales, but in all the States. I do not say that the Commonwealth should borrow ten millions of money and pay it over to the States, but an arrangement might which federal bonds would be accepted in payment of the federal liability. feel sure that tbe Ministers themselves are not clear as to the position of affairs, because if they were they would make a definite announcement upon the subject, and would not have invited the Premiers of the States to consult with them in the way they have done. We should not be called upon to consider this Bill at this stage, in view of the consultation that is about to take place between the State Premiers and the Federal Prime Minister, and in view of disagreements which may result.. The interpretations placed upon the provisions of the Bill by the Senate are not of a very definite character, and before we consider the important matters it deals with it would be well for us to await the result of the consultation to which I have referred. 16 (i 2 that there is no intention to proceed with clauses 44 and 45 until after the conference. not going to deal with the vital clauses of this Bill, but the public do not understand the position, and they are afraid that we may commit ourselves to some particular course of action which may not be in accord with the views expressed by the Premiers. We are placed in a very peculiar position, and I do not know what we are to think of a Ministry which sets such small value upon its own opinions, that it has felt constrained to ask the State Premiers to consult with it . In view of the uncertainty which exists in regard to this measure, not in political circles only, bub also among commercial men, in New Soutii Wales and the other States, I think it would be in the best interests not only of this House, but of the public, that we should allow this matber bo sband over.

146,Mr Piesse (Tasmania),"I am notshall endeavour to follow the very admirable course adopted by the honourable and learned member for Parkes, in discussing the very intricate matters that arise under this measure. It would appear that the Constitution has hardly provided for all the exigencies of the cases that are likely to arise. Apparently there are three methods contemplated under the Constitution in which property may be acquired. The properties which are essential to the working of the transferred departments are divided into two classes; that is, properties used exclusively in connection with the departments, and properties used but not exclusively. Then again, under section 51, sub-section (31), of the Constitution, power is given to acquire properties for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws. I have not noticed that that power has been dealt with in the speeches which have been made, because honourable members principally to the construction of section S5, dealing with properties in connection wholly or in part with the transferred departments. When we come to consider the methods of"" acquiring property, we find that section 85, sub-section (1), deals with property used exclusively in connection with the department, and that sub-section (3) also deals with such property, but only to the extent of saying that the mode of compensation shall be determined under laws made by the Parliament, if no agreement has been made between the States and the Commonwealth. But as to the property used exclusively in connection with a department, I have not been able to find out that there is any means of valuing it, or any direction as to how that property-which , of course, at present includes the largest proportion of what we are thinking of, namely, custom-houses and post-offices-is to be valued. MrV . L . SOLOMON -I s not that a matter to be determined by laws to be made by Parliament? jection to dealing with that in this Bill. would draw attention to the distinction made by the Constitution between property transferred and used exclusively by the Commonwealth, and property, under subsection (2), which is used, but not exclusively used, by the Commonwealth. accidental omission. regard to a portion of the properties there is a direction as to the way in which the values are to be ascertained, whilst as to the major part of the property, that exclusively used by the Commonwealth, section 85 does not refer to the method of valuation to be adopted. This raises a very great difficulty in the consideration of this measure, for, if there is no principle laid down in the Constitution with regard to these properties, it may become a question as to whether we are entitled, as only one of the parties concerned, without the consent of the other party, to lay down the principle on which the value of these properties shall be ascertained. We are thinking aloud, to some extent, in discussing this matter, but I would press that point upon the attenaddressed themselves tion of the Government, and ask them to give the committee the benefit of their opinions before the discussion closes. It may be necessary to consult the States as to the way in which these values shall be ascertained. only of the more important propertiesthose used exclusively in connection with the departments. It may be necessary in regard to these to obtain the consent of the States, perhaps by legislation, to the method to be adopted to ascertain the values of these properties. Of course, if we can come to an agreement there will be no difficulty. ThisB i ll only provides for alternatives if the parties fail to come to an agreement, but we are face to face with tlie problem as to how we are going to deal with the whole matter. Under sub-section (31) of section 51 of the Constitution, a very wide power is given for the acquisition of property, and it may have to be used in connection with the acquirementof the land for the Federal Capital site. The sub-section to which I refer gives power to acquire property on just terms from any State or pei-son for any purpose in respect to which the Parliament has power to make laws. That gives the widest possible power to acquire any property so long as it is done on just terms. Therefore it seems that we shall have a freer hand in dealing with the large class of property which may be acquired for any purpose, for which the Commonwealth has",35,Property For Public Purposes Acquisition Bill Second Beading

152,Mr Piesse,"No; I am speaking nowpower to make laws-a with regard to the departmental properties. I do not know that we can discuss the question of values here, but it is necessary to lay down Some principle on which these properties shall be valued. We are entering upon considerations which attach to tlie principles partners bring into a partnership of equal value, there need not be any question as to the interest When capital is put into a partnership, it is usually provided that the partners shall receive interest on the capital sums contributed, and profit upon certain terms laid down after the interest has been allotted. The partner who brings in the larger share of capital, naturally receives the larger proportion of interest. 45, it seems to me that it makes no real difference to the partners whether they receive interest on the whole sum which each partner brings in, or whether each receives only upon so much of his contribution as exceeds the lowest sum contributed by any partner. the same. But when it comes to the question of valuing there is a very great difficulty. Let us take, for example, a town which contains a very ornamental and expensive post-office. Another town, with an equal population, and deserving of the same postal conveniences, is probably possessed of only an ordinary, useful and well constructed building. treat this matter from a Commonwealth stand-point, we ought to lay down the principle that these buildings shall be valued solely from a utilitarian We are all interested in giving those postal facilities which a certain number of people may reasonably expect. But, if in one town a marble post-office has been erected, whilst in an adjacent town an ordinary brick building suffices for all requirements, why should the Commonwealth be asked to pay the excess price which the marble building represents 1 Tasmania. or fall by this principle, which is a perfectly fair one I do not see why we should be called upon to pay for ornamentation which has not been undertaken for Commonwealth purposes, but merely to add to the attractions of a particular locality. On the other hand I can see that it might be quite proper freer hand than for one State to pay something more than its contribution in the way of kind. South Australia, for example, has constructed an overland telegraph line. I suppose that the outlay upon that line, together with other sums expended upon postal facilities, will represent a larger contribution per capita of partnership. If all the than the contributions of the other States. property MrV . L . SOLOMON -The South Australian post and telegraphs pay better than to be paid. do those of any other State. point in favour of the honourable member's own State. The cost of the buildings and conveniences transferred by South Australia to the Commonwealth may have been swelled by a large expenditure upon the overland telegraph line. It will be perfectly Dealing with clause fair, when that becomes the property of the Commonwealth, that all the other States should contribute to the extra per capita cost of tbe Postal department of that State. and take"" will have to enter into the Tbe ultimate result is precisely arrangement. the objection, which I understood was being urged in some quarters, that it was not to be expected that any State should contribute more than its share of what has been already expended. Buti t may be that in very fairness some of the States will have to do so. Some of the States, by reason of If we are going to their large area, have had to expend larger sums than others in providing postal facilities, and those facilities have been of benefit to the rest of Australia.

But although honourable members of this House represent the States in another capacity, it does not follow that we should take advantage of any slip that has occurred in the other Chamber. I know that some honourable senators complained bitterly that they were unable to secure a recommittal of the Bill. In such circumstances, I ask-"" Is it worthwhile proceeding with this discussion ?"" The laymen of the House recognise that justice must be done to all the States. I am not concerned as to whether the Mr Poynton. payment for properties acquired by the Commonwealth is made in one particular way or I take it that what we . another, but I do think that in the interests of the States, if we take over a certain portion of their property we ought also to take over an equivalent proportion of their we are adopting a debts. The effect of the clause which has provoked so much discussion in connection Seeing that the two with this Bill, will be most detrimental to the States when they come to borrow as States, because by one act we are taking away a certain amount of their assets in connection with which they have borrowed money and which is represented in their national debt. Thus we are actually reducing their assests, and are then proposIf the ing upon a per capita basis to wipe out the debt. So far as the States are concerned the debt will remain just as it was before, and it will be very difficult indeed to explain to the community at large in the States that they have been paid an equivalent for the property which the Commonwealth has acquired. I recognise that if we borrow money the States have to pay the interest upon it . But the difficulty points will be smoothed away. seems to be that the States will be left saddled with the original debt, and will experience some difficulty in making it clear to the people that they have received a quid I pro quo for handing over the transferred services. is not altered. senators.

But with regard to other properties not exclusively in the possession of the transferred departments, or any subsequent properties which the Commonwealth may desire to acquire from the States under section 51 of the Constitution with those other proper-ties. Mr G. B. EDWABDS -But I say that in reference to section 51 we want to make in this Bill some provision for arriving at the value of further properties. In regard to transferred properties there is no difficulty whatever. No compensation is needed, and there is no necessity to trouble ourselves about the matter at all. those honourable members who think that this discussion is, to a very large extent, unnecessary, in view of the position taken up by the Government in reference to the clauses we are principally concerned with. I would not have risen but for the interjection made a little while ago by the Minister in charge of the Bill, with reference to the share which Western Australia may possibly take in the forthcoming conference. should be quite prepared to admit, if the Govcrnmenfhad had such a proposal before the country for some time as that at present entertained, that there would be some reason for the attitude adopted by the Minister for Home Affairs; but, in view of the fact that the position which they now take up has practically been sprung upon the country at very short notice, I think it would be a mistake if the State of Western Australia were left out of tlie conference. I understood the Minister to say, however, that, if the Premier of Western Australia could not find it convenient to attend, the conference would have to go on without him. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I did not say anything of the kind. say that he could not wait for ever ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I said that wecould not wait for ever. Premier of Western Australia would make such a request to the Commonwealtli Government. WhatI was going to suggest is that, if the conference is held, and the Premier of Western Australia is unable to attend, a report of the proceedings shall be submitted to him, and that he may have an opportunity of acquainting the conference with his views before a final decision is arrived at. stated somewhere that if he could not come himself, one of his colleagues might come. opportunity is given to the State of Western Australia to take a share in this important matter, I do not care what method is adopted, but I trust that due consideration will be given to that State, as well as to the other States. am one of those who think that tlie Commonwealth has taken a rather high-handed action in regard to this matter.

Those will have to be provided for separately. so in the Bill? MK DEAKIN -Section 125 of the Constitution relating to the capital is, in a sense, complete in itself. It relates to one special area to be acquired in one special way from one special State. look at clause 43 of the Bill, he will find that it is provided that, where any Crown land of a State is acquired under this Act, the State shall, subject to the Constitution, be entitled to compensation for the value thereof. I apprehend that tbe words "" subject to the Constitution"" mean that the State is to be recompensed for any Crown lands that may be taken from it , unless the Constitution provides to the contrary, as it does provide in connection with the lands to be taken for the Federal Capital site. clear and remove all difficulties somewhere We shall not strike in the Bill. I wish I could impress made it clear in clause 43, but not in clause 6. I understood that the State was not to receive any compensation for State lands taken for the purposes of the Federal Capital site; but clause 6 is worded in the widest general terms, and provides that the Governor General may direct that any land required for any public purpose may be acquired from any State or person, and the words "" subject to the Constitution "" should be inserted there as well as in clause 43. Of course the Attorney General will say that all Acts are subject to the Constitution, but if we are going to have the words "" subject to the Constitution "" in one clause, we should have them in the other also. If it is not intended that clause 6 shall relate to the Federal Capital site, the clause should have that stated on the face of it . with the honourable and learned member with regard to the last point he has mentioned. I will consider it , and at a later stage propose some form of words that will make it clear that this Bill is not to be considered as dealing with the Federal Capital site. That is dealt with in a separate section of the Constitution, and will have to be specially legislated for. I do not think it is well that our discussion on this measure should be cumbered by questions arising at every turn as to whether the provisions will affect the federal capital site. under this clause, land may be acquired without any notice being given to the owner, and I scarcely think that would be fair.

Mr GL YNN As a matter of practice I suppose it will not be necessary, but under this clause land can be acquired without making any attempt to enter into an agreement. Under sub-clause (3), unless some limit is placed upon the appropriation, any amount of land could be bought by the Executive-the Executive could bind the Federation to purchase £1,000,000 worth of property without consulting Parliament. strongly endorse the views expressed by the honourable member for Soutii Australia. The matter is not one to be settled just now, but I would strongly urge the Minister to put in some provision which would limit the operation of this sub-clause in some such way as to follow the lines of some parliamentary appropriation. Sir taken from the New South Wales Act. Minister will find that in the New South WalesA c t there are words which limit the power of the Government. The Minister will recollect that there were words in the Act which some of us thought hampered the Governor in Council when he resumed the land at Darling Harbor. We thought it was necessary that there should be an appropriation, b u t l t h in k the Ministry held that be put upon the power of the Government. an appropriation made some years previously was sufficient to meet the case. So far as my recollection serves me, the words in the New South Wales Act empower the Government to acquire land for any purposes for which Parliament has provided the funds. That gives Parliament the initiative, and the Governor in Council must act subject to the parliamentary grant. Opposition has to some extent anticipated what I was going to sa)'. We are commencing our Commonwealth career, and we are not i u the position of a State that is already supplied with landed property and buildings. We are practically setting up a new house, and really these provisions appeal to me to give enormous powers to the-. 1 Administration, which cannot be checked a t all by Parliament. It is provided that the mere notification in the Government GazetteB u t it should be provided that the Governor-Generali n Councilwhich is the Ministry-ha s decided to acquire property, acts as a-statutory conveyance, and it commits the country at once to pay for the property, and I. think that it necessary 1 action ought to be made provisional or tentative. The power given is a very large one, and we do not know what we might commit ourselves to. Parliament should be allowed to exercise its proper functions in matters of this sort. This power does not relate to small matters merely, such as sites for post-olfices and so on, but many matters of enormous importance might be dealt with by the Government, acting with the very best intention, so as to commit the country to a large expenditure, which might, after discussion, be disapproved of. I do not quite see the use of puttingin sub-clause (3), providing for acopy of the notification being laid before Parliament, because there will be no means of reversing the action of the Government, and tlie whole thing will have been made public long before. I suggest that some transaction shall not be considered absolutely concluded until Parliament has had an opportunity of discussing the matter. and learned member w ould not apply T that to all small matters 1 Minister means by ""small matters."" But, at all events, some limit ought to I think it would be wise to afford the House some opportunity of considering the wisdom of any compulsory purchase of property. I believe that the Government must have full power to take any property that they require for public purposes. I am not approaching the question from that stand-point at all. I merely desire to see that the country is not, from want of consideration or possibly from a miscalculation,, committed to something which it would repent of. Buti f this notification is once inserted in the Gazette under the terms of the present clause it constitutes a purchase, and then it only becomes a question of how much we have to pay for the property acquired.",43,Property For Public Purposes Acquisition Bill Second Beading

203,Mr Isaacs,"I do not know what thenot see anything very drastic to object to in this clause. The safeguards all come -afterwards. This provision follows very much upon tbe lines of the Acts which -exist in the mother State for the same purpose. There is no limit upon the power of the State to take whatever property it .requires for some declared public purpose. Honourable members will notice that in any notification in the Gazette, the purpose for which the property is acquired has to be -expressed. 'Commonwealth will never voluntarily take up land, unless it requires it for some public purpose, and unless it has in its mind with some degree of definiteness what that purpose is. Unless that power is one -of a very summary character, there is Always a danger that prior to the moment at which the change of ownership takes place, the parties interested will indulge in -a variety of negotiations. I have seen it -done repeatedly in connection with arbitration cases. I have been connected with a number of arbitration cases in New South Wales, where land has been resumed by the Government, and I have found that there is -a singular tendency to effect sales of certain property in anticipation of the resumption by the State. -am saying. it is very necessary to invest the Commonwealth with powers of a summary character, -enabling it, without any intimation of its intentions, to suddenly resume land. Such a power will check fictitious sales which maybe made in order that the sale prices may be -subsequently brought in as the actual value -of the land. If the Commonwealth has power to summarily take land for public purposes, and such purposes are immediately --declared in a Gazette notice, and if all provision is made for insuring that the owner receives reasonable compensation, I cannot -see that any objection can be taken to the -clause. Experience teaches me that it is very necessary that the power should be of .a summary character. -that. I think the honourable and learned member for In d i has done well to call attention to this matter. A t the same time, there is the other aspect of the question to which notice has been directed by the honourable and learned member for Parkes. On the one hand, we are giving a tremendous power to the GovernorGenerali n Council. It is a power which is unlimited as regards amount, and, of course, no Parliament can refuse an appropriation of money to carry out a contract which comes within the powers conferred by Parliament. The Governor General, therefore, can commit the Commonwealth to an immense expenditure without any warning. That is a power which has to be looked at very closely. On the other hand, the honourable and learned member for Parkes has very properly pointed out that if the Government have to give warning of their intention to resume land, all sorts of devices will be used for the purpose of inflating the price. A t the time Haussmann was rebuilding Paris he adopted the practice of suddenly giving notice that he required a certain street. The idea was that he would come down without any warning upon a certain locality of closelybuilt houses, and say"" I want that particular piece of land."" By this means he thought he would be able to prevent devices of the character referred to by the honourable and learned member for Parkes. But he found that with all his care he was unable to keep his scheme secret. The very highest courtiers used to get hold of his . plans beforehand. They used to acquire the localities in which he intended to work or else they would sell the information. Then people would suddenly take up long leases of localities, and secure, as compensation for resumption, very large sums of money. New South Wales. not many tricks which they need to be taught in New South Wales. I think that the honourable and learned member for Parkes is right when he says that we must give the Governor General in Council great power so that he may come down without warning and say, "" I want this particular piece of land."" 1 understand that the idea of the honourable and learned member for In di is that we ought to allow the Governor General in Council a power to appropriate the land provisionally, and if the Attorney General will insert in this clause the word",44,William Lyne Thi S Provision Is Provision Should Be Inserted By Which The

212,Mr Higgins,"I am afraid there are""provisionally"" before the word ""direct,"" the Governor-Generali n Council, if he finds that Parliament is not going to approve of what he hasdirected, willbeable to withdraw. It would be at his option then, and I think that the object of tbe honourable and learned member would be achieved. In Victoria we have an A ct for acquiring lands for closer settlement. lution of Parliament is necessary before the Governor in Council is authorized to conclude any contract. He makes a provisional contract, which is subject to the approval of Parliament. That is one way of doing it. I think that machinery enabling the Governor in Council to put his claw upon any particular land and to have the option, if Parliament does not approve of it, of receding from the contract would be tbe correct course to adopt. I admit that it needs machinery, but I am quite sure that the Ministry will be able to devise the necessary machinery for the purpose. If that suggestion is adopted, on the one hand we shall have the ultimate control, which Parliament ought to have, over the funds of the people, and, on the other, we shall avoid that sort of trickery which is continually used where notice has to be given before a contract can be made. that the Bill, as drafted, sufficiently meets the case, because, though it is necessary, as stated by the honorable and learned member for Parkes, that the public purpose for which any particular land is acquired shall be specified, it is easy enough to evolve pensating for temporary occupation. If fantastic public purposes, if Ministers desired to take that course. The clause, therefore, offers very little guarantee against jobbery. On the other hand, there is the unwisdom of hampering large public departments in respect of the acquisition of pieces of land of a small value. While the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne would be appropriate enough as relating to land in regard to which large values were involved, it would not be wise to make it apply to other transactions. omitted in this way. There might be a general vote on the Estimates for post-office or school sites. They would cover approximately any number of school sites. a proviso that, where lands involve an expenditure above a certain amount, tlie is required that the Minister can arrange, whole matter should be subject to the ratification of Parliament. Ido not wish to see thePostmaster-General hampered in regard tomaking proper provision for postal facilities to small townships in the back-blocks; but, on the other hand, we wish to prevent anything in the shape of jobbery or any possibility even of a miscalculation. agree with what has been said by the lasttwo speakers. I have known of cases in Western Australia in which the Government have been involved in a loss of.' thousands of pounds because they were unable to lay their hands at once upon property for railway purposes. In course of time, no doubt, the State railways will be handed over to the control of the Commonwealth, and it will be necessary then to secure lands for the purposes of railway construction. I think, therefore, that the-Government should have the power of summary resumption of lands for publicpurposes. mind of the committee aright, the criticism of the honourable and learned member for In di will be met by a proposal, such as is contained in a number of our Acts, that all transactions involving an expenditure of over £1,000 shall be scheduled and laid before Parliament for 30 days in order to give honourable members an opportunity of challenging them. Until the termination of that period, the purchase is regarded as provisional, but provision is made for comthe clause does not cover that, it will be enlarged to do so. That will cover what tbe honourable and learned member desires, and give honourable members all tlie freedom which is found to be necessary. you need not disturb the owner in any way. The transaction will date from the time of the first notification, but you will not interfere with him during that period. learned member will agree with the Government that there should be no doubt as to the exact moment the property will vest; it must vest absolutely and at once, i u the Crown. vests as freehold the moment the notificaI think we might insert tion appears in the Gazette.",45,William Lyne Thi S Provision Is Provision Should Be Inserted By Which The

221,Mr Deakin,"An additional provisionand though the property has passed, occupancy may continue under certain conditions. pressed by the Attorney-General seem to meet the case very fairly if they are carried out in the clause. I observe that the New South Wales Act is very much more guarded in its terms. It presupposes, I think, in every case, that the matter has been considered by Parliament. authorized. in connection with which the land is taken has been authorized-that there has been an appropriation, or that the Governor in Council has sanctioned the carrying out of the particular undertaking, and that the lands have been authorized to be acquired for school sites for example. In all cases, it seems to me, that the New South Wales Legislature very carefully, so to speak, considers beforehand the work in connection with which the acquisition of land is to take place. the honourable and learned member for Parkes when he says that when we take land, we must take it, so to speak, without warning. But that is perfectly consistent with the view I urge. We must give notice -without any previous intimation, and we must provide that the value of the land when taken, if taken, should be the value at the moment of giving notice. All subsequent consideration is not to give a loophole for or afford an opportunity of affecting the value of the land, but is merely to enable Parliament to decide whether we shall take the land at the value determined at the moment of giving notice. That is all consistent with what I have said. We have carried out the principle in regard to many 'Victorian works. The Attorney-General knows that in the ""Victorian Railways Authorization Actsi t is provided that when land is taken, the value shall be determined as at the beginning of the session or when the Bill is brought in. January. fix the date we give no opportunity for those little schemes for enhancing the apparent value of the land. The country is thus protected, and I think the method suggested by the Attorney-General will fairly meet the situation. to very strongly impress on the Government, in the interests of whatever Government we may have in the future, that they should if possible be covered by parliamentary authority in some way, and the land resumed under circumstances which will give them an opportunity of considering the matter with the assistance of Parliament. We know that when a Government, perhaps in the public interests, acts without authority, they expose themselves to a great deal of unpleasantness. Above all, there is the great principle which we cannot too strongly employ in our laws in connection with the Commonwealth, namely, that no public expenditure or liability leading to public expenditure, shall be at tlie arbitrary discretion of the Ministry. What is the essence of all government ? It is that all expenditure shall be watched as closely as possible, and have parliamentary sanction before it is incurred. That is one of the main principles of government, and a very wise I thoroughly agree with and salutary principle it is ; and if we are to observe it in reference to very small matters on the Estimates, surely we ought to observe it in large undertakings involving enormous amounts of public money. I am quite agreeable to any course which the Ministry may suggest which will give them power of prompt action, but which, at the same time, will not give any Government the arbitrary power of spending money without some sort of parliamentary acquiescence. I doubt whether the Attorney-General is going on exactly the lines which the committee seem to approve. As I understand, the object of most members of tlie committee is that the direction shall be an appropriation of land, if the Parliament afterwards approve, and it is to be an appropriation as from the time of the direction being given by the Minister. The appropriation is to relate back,, as soon as Parliament approves, to themoment the Minister says "" I want that land."" Most of the committee are anxious,. I think, that there shall be, as it were, a, provisional direction. The next point is. that it is proposed to have this provisional direction applied only to cases involving over £1,000, or some other figure. I do not believe in an arbitrary line of figures, because such rigid distinctions are oftentimes.",46,William Lyne Thi S Provision Is Provision Should Be Inserted By Which The

I can well understand that where a very small sum is involved, the Minister will take certain risks; but all of us know there may be jobs in constituencies when even under £ 1 0 0 is involved. Members of Parliament are often faced with the argument that although certain expenditure is wrong it has already been incurred, and that it is of no use discussing the matter; and I think there would be no hurt done if the provisional arrangement were applied to every transaction. In most cases there would be a contract made, and, assuming that to be the case, no hardship would be involved by my suggestion, because there would be an arrangement by which a person, who might be entitled"" to a small sum, would get interest in the meantime. postoffiee might be retarded for nine or twelve months, waiting the sanction of Parliament. in cases involving a small sum of £ 2 5 , about which there would be no doubt as to the sanction of Parliament. -"" spec."" -the safeguard. be a limit at all, it should not be beyond .£100. The provisional rule ought to be .applied to every case; and I have no doubt that when it is only a small piece of land, it would be a matter of agreement, in which there will be an arrangement made for the person who is to be deprived of the land, to get interest in the meantime. I would suggest, therefore, that when we come to -clause 7, the words "" if Parliament approve,"" be inserted. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume) It -seems to me, after what the honourable .and learned member for Northern Mel. bourne has said, that there cannot be much harm in carrying out the suggestion made by the Attorney-General. The limit may be made less than £1,000, but that is not a large amount to trust the Ministry with. We can insert in the clause that any expenditure above £1,000 shall hang in abeyance until Parliament has an opportunity of dealing with the matter. But I presume that what will be done in the Commonwealth in regard to Estimates will be what is done in the States, and that a sum of money will be placed on the Estimates to deal with matters of this kind. I suppose that a provision will be inserted similar to that in the New South Wales Act, where the word "" authorized "" or some similar word is used in regard to the money so voted. There was a large resumption of wharfage areas recently in Sydney, and the Government could not have carried out that resumption had there not been a vote passed years before, a balance of which remained unexpended, and which, technically, could be applied to this purpose. If there is a sum of money voted each year, there should be a provision put in one of the clauses, that the Government can exercise their power under that vote. In case there is no vote, an amount up to £ 1 000 or £ 5 0 0 could be dealt with, and afterwards approved. Any amount beyond that would require the sanction of Parliament. If that be done, there seems to be no difficulty; and I will get the Attorney-General to prepare an amendment in that direction, which can be dealt with on a recommittal. propose an amendment 1 Clause agreed to.

238,Mr Barton (Hunter,"Minister forIsland labour and the question of its employment have agitated, not merely Queensland, but the whole of Australia, and that agitation has been emphasized the achievement of federation. It is to be looked at by federated Australia-no t as a question affecting only one State, but as a question which belongs to the Federation which we have succeeded in establishing, and one which cannot with justice to the continent be relegated wholly to a State. I shall have a good deal of ground to traverse in speaking on this motion, because ""tlie question, if not the Bill, has a history. Much of that history I shall leave out. I shall make no recrudescence of the worse part of old memories. From the time of the passing of the first ImperialA ct dealing with this subject-whic h explained its subject in its short title, "" The Kidnapping Act,"" and which was preceded by a Queensland Act-for all will remember the Act of 1868-thi s traffic has been condemned, not only by the rest of Australia, but by the continued policy and the repeated utterances of the statesmen of Queensland. Although the first legislative provision on this subject was made in 1868, there is reason to believe that the traffic had been instituted fourteen or fifteen years earlier, so that from the time of its beginning to the present day more nearly 50 than 40 years have elapsed. Asking honourable members to bear these things in mind, and not unduly charging their memories until I shall have come to specific facts and instances, I shall deal with this question under several heads, with a view to making it as easily intelligible as possible. I shall deal first with tbe importance of the industry to Queensland, a fact which I shall not fail to recognise. I shall then show that, in introducing the Bill, the Commonwealth Government is carrying out only what has been the declared policy of Queensland for the last 20 years at least. In the third place, I shall show that this, being the declared policy of that State, the question for us to consider is whether the time has come for putting it into effect, and for bringing to an end by just means what has always been admitted to be but a temporary expedient. I shall show, in the fourth place, that tlie putting of an end to this temporary expedient does not mean the putting of an end to the sugar industry, and I. hope, too, to be able to show that, putting aside all other questions 16 n but the great question of right and wrong, the Government is supported by facts and by the whole situation in its opinion that since the traffic is bad and must be ended, though justly ended. In dealing with the question, and before I give a synopsis of the Bill, which being so short has, I take it, been read by every honourable member who hears me, I shall speak of the importance of the sugar industry to Queensland. I shall be forgiven by honourable members, if in matters so much involving questions of memory 1 refer to notes without which my statement could not be made. I wish to insist upon the importance of this industry, not only to Queensland, but to the whole continent. The industry, whether white or black labour enters into it, is in its results and its possibilities important to Australia, not only as every great industry is as a national possession of the continent, but also from the fact that it is carried on not only in Queensland, but in New South Wales as well, and possibilities exist of its being carried on in other States, too. BecauseI believe we shall see the day when sugar will be raised not only in the tropical, but in the temperate latitudes of the continent, though, of course, not sugar extracted from cane. The importance of the sugar industry to Queensland is shown by statistics. In 1900 the whole area under cultivation in Queenland was 457,400 acres, of which 108,500 acres were under sugar cane. Up to that time the area under sugar cane in Queensland had been larger than that devoted to any other kind of agricultural production ; but in that year the area under maize exceeded that under sugar cane by nearly 20,000 acres. The area of land producing cane actually crushed during the year was 72,650 acres, and the weight of cane obtained from that area 848,300 tons, an average yield of 11*68 tons to the acre. From that weight of cane, 92,500 tons of sugar were obtained, an average of a little over 1*28 tons of sugar to the acre. The value of that sugar at the estimated rate of £ 9 19s. 9^d. a ton-whic h was the price paid by the refiners to the manufacturers-was £924,380. The value of the sugar exported was £ 6 6 9 , 3 9 0; but I should explain that the term "" exported "" will not upon the institution of Inter-State free-trade strictly apply, because a large proportion of the sugar is sent to the other States of the Union. The value of the sugar produced in Queensland during the last eight years amounts to over£9,000,000; which £2,000,000 worth was retained for home consumption, and £7,000,000 salt to New South Wales, Victoria, the other Australian States, and to foreign parts. The value of the machinery and plant used in the crushing mills and refineries is £2,355,000, premises .£460,000, £3,000.000. implements, used in connection with the growing of cane, is roughly estimated at about £3,000,000 ; so that in all about £6,000,000 is invested in the industry in Queensland. people say that the amount invested is about £7,000,000, but even when we put it at £6,000,000, the great importance of the industry to that State, to which we all wish well, is immensely figures.

I am endeavouring to give the House a fair idea of the dimensions of the industry. The number of Kanakas engaged in the industry, according to the latest is 8,710. will see that there are directly employed over 5,700 whites, and of male Kanakas alone, 8,600: but there may have to be deductions made from that number on account of those holding exemption and working as members of the crews of vessels, or in other employments. figures are supposed to represent the numbers in Queensland at the present time, as they are the latest returns existing in that State. with these statistics to show that we must not trifle with this industry, and having reached this point, I shall have to recall the attention of honourable members to the fact that, when I was asked a question some time ago as to the date when this Bill would be dealt with, I told honourable members that it would be introduced-that Mr Bwrtmi. second reading would be moved, because of that is what we generally look upon as the introduction of a Bill apart from technicaliworth ties-befor e the Tariff was laid upon the table. I also intimated that the question of the treatment of the sugar industiy was so closely interwoven with the fiscal question that I could not ask honourable memand of the land and bers to go on to debate a Bill which dealt, upon which it is erected however comprehensively, with only one making a total of nearly part of the question, and that I must ask The value of the land, stock, them to suspend their judgment until they buildings, and other things knew what the Tariff provisions were, as well as the proposals with regard to the employment of Kanakas. That, of course, is reasonableenoughwhenoneconsidersthatthis Some industry has from its inception been supported by import duties, and will, I think, for some time to come, require to be supported by similar duties, in connection w it h ' the scheme which the Government will lay emphasized by the before the House on Tuesday. We can no The number of farmers-as Mr more divorce the question of the maintenance of an industry, which is largely dependent upon black labour, from the question 2,610, and the average of its future under the Federal Tariff than the Shylock was able to divorce the pound of flesh from the blood which accompanied it The number of men employed in -the one thing must go with the other. Therefore, I ask honourable members to form so that, their own judgment upon what I shall lay there before them, and to form their own judgment upon this Bill with only one reservation-namely , that the Bill stands not alone, but the Bill and the support to the industry which must inevitably be given by the Tariff must be taken and must be read information, together. That is why I eaid all along that So that honourable members. I did not ask any honourable member of this House to address himself to this Bill until he had seen what the Treasurer will lay upon the table as applicable to the fiscal conditions of Australia. Now, I will protickets, ceed to the next point, always saying this : that I admit to the full the argument of These any one who says that this industry must not be lightly dealt with, that it must be treated in all reason, and I apply to that my own frequent declarations that it will I have said enough in connection be the policy of this Government to avoid the destruction of industries, and to regard existing substantial industries as the possessions of this nation. NowI pass to the second question, which is my contention that, in introducing this Bill, the Federal Government is only carrying out the declared policy of is to say, its Queensland for the last twenty years. I propose to give a sketch of the legislative history of Queensland on that point, and I hope I shall showI am confident I shall show-as the result of that consideration that this traffic has been regarded, at any rate for the last twenty years, as a mere temporary expedient. shown 1 First of all, on the threshold of this part of my address, I wish to point out that, in giving the names of those who have made significant declarations with regard to this policy, I am endeavouring to avoid any implication of them in the current politics of the day, because many of them have passed out of politics. A t the same time. I shall try to show that the policies and the utterances of these men were part of the policy of the State which has so large a share in the. question we are now dealing with. name the holder of which has passed away, or some other name the holder of which is now in a high position, I do not wish to bring him into contemporary politics, but simply to quote his words and utterances as indicating the opinions of the large majority of the people whom, at the time, he seemed to represent. Now, the first Act regulating the Kanaka labour was passed in 1868, and by Queensland, although Kanakas had been employed in that State for at least ten or fifteen years previously to that, if Mr Archer, who made that declaration during the debate on the Bill, is to be taken as an authority. long; 1863, I think, was the date of the first importation. the statements that were made during the debates on the Bill, but I may as well declare that I am not binding myself to any particular time. If we date the Kanaka traffic from 1868, we have 33 years, and if we take it as having been in existence for five years prior to that, we have something like 40 years. In the debate on this Billi t was pointed out-and it is a curious fact -that the traffic had assumed some dimensions, because, however much influence and support any of us give to the London Missionary Societ)-, it was then beginning to attack the traffic. The Act regulated the mode qi introduction and the treatment of the Kanakas, the mode of introduction being under licence, as every one knows, and the treatment being designed to prevent 16 n 2 unnecessary hardship to those who were introduced. In 1877 a measure was brought in by the Hon. John Douglas, then Premier of Queensland-and as one is accused of knowing nothing about the history of this movement perhaps it is as well that I should be Now, how is that precise in referring to these matters-the Bill being devised to restrict the introduction of Kanakas, and to limit their employment to the coast districts. Sir Samuel Griffith was a member of that Ministry, and in the debates on this Bill the abolition of the traffic was very strongly urged. The Premier, Sir John Douglas, who is now A d ministrator of Thursday Island, denounced the traffic-and 1 can give the page references for these passages in Ransairdas ""bad, wrong, and utterly rotten,"" and hoped that the measure, if passed, would Where, therefore, I mention any ultimately put an end to the labour altogether. That is 24 years ago, and the House, at page 68 of the same volume of Haiisarrd, was described by one of the speakers as being almost unanimous in its objection to black labour. I need no riarticular authority for the statement that the House had an objection to black labour, for those who have in many instances asked Queensland to wait a little longer have, nevertheless, joined in the denunciation of the traffic. This Bill failed to pass, and the Bill of 1880 that is now on the statute book of Queensland was introduced by Sir Thomas Mcllwraith . The Bill became law under the name of the Pacific Islanders Labour Act ; it is really the principal principal ActI shall mean this one. Now, this Act repeals the Act of 1S68. It applied only to labourers, tlie stipulated time for whose return had not arrived. That is to say, it didnot affect any South Sea Island labourer who, having completed his agreement, was still in Queensland, but not under any control by way of agreement. That is a point to which I shall call attention in asking honourable members to note all the variations from the policy in the Bill we are bringing forward. The Act limited the employment of "" islanders "" to tropical agriculture, which is defined in one of the sections of the Act. In the course of the debate Mr Rutledge, now a member of the Queensland Ministry, announced himself as an uncompromising opponent, on principle, of black labour. I do not want to pass any judgment on any one in this matter, but to trace the legislative",48,Second Reading

240,Mr Barton,"I have as my authorityhistory of this movement, and. the way in which it was regarded by those who spoke with an authoritative voice in this matter. However, it wusfound afterwardsthis I deduce from the speech of Sir Samuel Griffith, reported in vol. 41 of Queensland Hansard-that Polynesians were employed I ask attention to that statementin sill branches of industry. I am not relying on my own judgment for this statement, but I am taking the voice of a leader of tbe people. The definition of tropical or sub-tropical agriculture in the principal Act was not strict enough, and as no provision was made in the principal Act for time-expired Islanders, these were employed in many ways in which it was never intended they should be, anda Bill was therefore introduced by the same distinguished gentleman in 1884 to amend the A ct of 1S80. Its chief provisions were the stricter definition of tropical and semi-tropical agriculture, the extension of tlie provisions of the principal Act to time-expired Islandersa step eminently in the right direction-and the formulation of stricter rules with regard to recruiting in consequence of abuses which were becoming known. The chief object of the A ct seems to have been the regulation oftime-expired Islanders, and let it be recollected by those who have in their minds the memory of those abuses in connection with the traffic which sent a thrill of horror from one end to the other of Australia, that the Government of Queensland made the strongest efforts to do whatever legislation, regulation, and inspection could . do to minimize the necessary evils attendant upon such a traffic. I shall express presently my own opinion on any such traffic, no matter under what regulation. But we cannot withhold from Queensland a recognition of her constant endeavour to deprive it of all those elements of evil, except such as are inseparable from such a traffic. In introducing that Bill Sir Samuel Griffith saidTo tolerate the introduction of these Kanakas of black labour, the Government would take the is only a temporary measure. was that? wish to quote a great deal from what stateshistory of this movement throughout the men in Queensland have said in the meanlegislation of Queensland has been that the time. Sir Samuel Griffith continuedI do not think that it will be ultimately found impossible to get white men to do regarded not merely as a question of time, field work. experience in the north. I wish the honourable member for Mackay could get some of the timber getters and miners in the north who are exposed to hardships infinitely greater than can exist in the cane fields, and ask them if they think it is impossible for white men to do the work on the plantations. 1 have never met one who has not scouted the idea unless he has gone into some commercial speculation the profits of which depend on the introduction of black labour. 1 do not believe that in Queensland it will ultimately be found necessary that iu order to carry on field work we should introduce black labour. It was further stated in the debate upon tlie same B i ll that, in spite of the provisions of the principal Act, out of 12,000 Kanakas in the colony, not one-half were engaged in field labour. Honourable members will be familiar with the name of Mr Morehcad, who was long a prominent figure in Queensland politics. In this debate he called the traffic what I venture to think it is, in its inherent conditions, and not because of any fault of the Government or of the Parliament of Queensland-"" a system of limited slavery."" Mr Macrossan's is another honoured name. Honourable members will remember him as one of the wisest and ablest members of the Federal Convention of 1891, and also as having been present at the Melbourne conference in 1890. Unfortunately for Australia, he died during the sittings of the Sydney convention. Mr Macrossan saidThere were no doubt scandals in connection with the trade, and there always would be. I venture to agree with that statement. It was said by Mr Brookes, another member of the Queensland Parliament, thatThey all knew what the Kanaka trade was that it was a scandal from beginning to end, without a redeeming feature. Mr Macfarlane, another honourable member, saidThey wanted to get rid of black labour as soon as possible. Sir Samuel Griffith saidWhen the time had arrived for the prohibition responsibility for doing ib. since elapsed, and it goes to .illustrate It was in 1884. I the position which I take up that the evils of the traffic have been generally admitted, and that its abolition has been I believe that from my but as a question of limited time.

242,Mr Barton,"view is emphasized by what I am about to mention. I come now to the following year, 1885. The Premier of Queensland at that time introduced and carried a B ill to further amend the Act of 1880, and to put a limit to its operation. The earlier sections of the Act deal largely with the cost of administration, and with amendments in respect to to. it . The most important object of the Act was secured by section 11, which provided that after December 31, 1890-no t 1906 no licence to introduce Pacific Islanders should be granted. The Premier in introducing it saidThe majority of the people of the countryand I take leave to say that this is the opinion of a majority of the people of the State of Queensland as well as elsewhere-hav e come to the conclusion that the time is approaching when we can no longer depend on the introduction of this kind of labour for agricultural work. Beforefiveyears are over, other arrangements of a more satisfactory kind will be made. We shall see some other system of agriculture substituted. Agriculture will be conducted by farmers working for themselves rather than by men working in large numbers for absentee employers. Sir Thomas Mcllwraith said during the same debateHe supported the clause, not because he believed the sugar industry could be carried on in North Queensland without black labour, but because the colony could not go on creditably before the world and continue the South Sea traffic. In the same year the Government of which Sir Samuel Griffith was the head placed upon the Estimates a sum of £50,000 for the purpose of erecting central mills with the object of encouraging small settlers and planters who would grow cane without black labour. There was a debate upon this, in the course of which Mr Hume Black, a strong supporter of coloured labour, quoted, though, no doubt, witb disapproval, from a petition from his constituents at Mackay, as follows :Farmers can grow and cultivate at a profit small areas of cane without coloured labour of any kind. The principal Act was again amended in 1886 by a short Act which amended tbe definition of "" islander,"" and cast certain charges on the employers, such as medical attendance and the cost of burials. I am only led to mention this lest it should be said that I have omitted any Act which is a link in the chain. In 1889 a certain Royal commission reported. 1 mention their report, not for the purpose of making copious extracts from it, but because I wish to deal with a motion which was brought forward by a member of that commission in the Queensland Parliament, and opposed by another gentleman who has lately been taken away from us. In the report of that commission, two of the three members, Messrs. Cowley and King, stated that there would be extinction of the industry if the licences were withdrawn, it being then the law that the licences were to cease at the end of 1S90. They said that the extinction of the industry would speedily follow, and therefore recommended the continued issue of licences for some years. But even they did not think that there should be an indefinite continuance. The late Mr W. H . Groom differed from them, and supported the termination of the licences in-1890. I mention this to point the attention of honourable members to what follows. In the same year Mr Cowley, after the presentation of the report of the commission, moved that the State should adopt some means for encouraging the sugar industry. He made the suggestion that Kanaka labour should be allowed for a further period of five years, and stated that such an extension would answer all present requirements. Mr Cowley is still a member of the Queensland Parliament. The then Premier, Mr Morehead, announced that the Government were fully determined not to allow the re-introduction of coloured labour after 1890. He gave as his reason the fact that, if they did not allow the Kanaka industry to drop after five years, they might be asked at the expiration of that time for a further extension of five years, and so on. That is precisely what has occurred. Sir Samuel Griffith in that debate expressed pleasure at Mr Morehead's declaration, and his hope that the question was permanently settled. He addedI t is idle to say that the cause of depression is the want of Polynesian labour. The causes are the same as have been in operation in every part of the world. He then stated many of the fundamental objections to black labour, and moved an amendment on Mr Cowley's motion so as to insure that any assistance given by the State should not involve a re-opening of the coloured labour question. I ask honourable members to mark what followed. Afteri t had been stated by another honourable member thatWith the exception of districts more immediately dependent on sugar, there is no pint of the colony returning a member to this House in favour of a continuance of black labourwhich is the position in Queensland to-day, and which is almost the position that obtains in this Federal Parliament. Mr Groom went on to justify his own report. If I may be excused for quoting him-and I think there is no honourable member who has occupied a seat in this House whom I am more justified in quotingI would point out that he saidIf the question is to be discussed on strong party lines, and with strong party feeling, and the result is to be, as the honourable member for Burrum has predicted, an appeal to the country, the planters will, in my opinion, get the worse of coalition Government, but I should like to the contest. That was the late Mr Groom's opinion at that time. I quote it , not in any sense as a threat or warning, but for the purpose of pointing out to honourable members that the state of public opinion in Queensland to-day justifies Mr Groom's prediction of that time. Mr Paul moved to add to Sir Samuel Griffith's amendment the words "" otherwise than by an extension of the coloured labour traffic for five years."" That meant that the Kanaka question was not to be re-opened except by an extension for five years. The amendment was put and negatived without a division. Sir Samuel Griffith's amendment was negatived by 31 to 25, and Mr Cowley's motion in favour of giving some support to the industry was negatived by 21 to 5. was that? next phase of the legislative history was in 1892. that the Act of 1885 professed to put an end to the traffic at the end of 1900. That Act was not altered or repealed, and so far as legislation can take effectI am not now speaking of administration-it took its effect at the end of 1890 by the prohibition of any further licences. Whether there were any further licences or not will be a fact in the memory of all honourable members who come from Queensland. matters went on until 1892. I think it my duty to give this history, which, although it may not be very lively in its details, ought to be on record in the debates of this House. Samuel Griffith introduced the Extension Bill, and the question was also discussed on the Address in Reply of that session, before the B ill was brought in. In that volume of the Queensland Hansard, a manifesto previously issued by Sir Samuel Griffith appeared. W it h regard to this Extension Bill, I would like to say, that it is clear from the manifesto and the debate that the measure was never intended to operate in any other way than as a temporary measure. We shall see what the manifesto was, and it will go a long way to support the conclusion arrived .it, because it was. a manifesto of the leader of the Government who introduced the Bill. coalition Government. point out that an admission of the temporary nature of the traffic from a coalition Government was a strong admission. In his manifesto Sir Samuel Griffith saidI can see no alternative but to permit, for a time at any rate, the resumption of Polynesian immigration. A t that time certain financial troubles had occurred in Queensland, and other financial troubles were impending. The manifesto continuedI t should be provided that the immigration shall continue (unless, of course, otherwise ordered by the Legislature) for a definite but limited period of say ten years. That was in 1892, and we are not three months from the end of the period in 1902. In introducing the' Extension Bil l which came afterwards, Sir Samuel Griffith saidWhat is proposed is that the restriction which Honourable members will recollect at present exists on the importation of Pacific Islanders shall be removed. It will be open to any future Parliament to renew that restriction. And therefore it was certainly open to bhat Parliament. But in the meantime persons engaged in the sugar industry will have the opportunity of knowing before the coming planting season that they will be able to carry on their industry without ruinous loss. Thus That"" passage shows to a certain degree I think, if not conclusively, that tbe idea was to give some security for the immediate season and for only a few seasons afterwards. Now, I come to the utterances of the honorI n 1892 Sir able gentleman who is now Premier of Queensland. He saidI do not regard this as a permanent solution of the difficulty, because in ten years there is not the slightest doubt the population of the islands will be so reduced that the supply will have ceased.",52,Pateeson Not So Act Of The Series And I F I Speak Of The

The In the same production of sugar at these respective periods is producing agencies, in these locations where the or conditions of nature, such us climate, do I have continued and increasing results, providing it is not checked through any device by which it may whether be sought to hasten the rate of movement of expedient natural law. sugar-growing, I do not know, but I prefer to believe that the statesmen of Queensland have been sincere in this matter. A t page 20 of the same report I find a further passage which I desire to quote. Dr. Maxwell writesIt is indicated bhat invention may be expected to provide mechanical devices for bhe harvesting of the cane crop, and for other work ; and these will further strengthen the ciirr.ent tendency to Substitute lower by higher forms of labour where the conditions of nature permit. There is, therefore, reason for us to place some relianceupontheprogress of invention, which, when forms of labour such as these have had to be dispensed with, can perhaps be relied upon to find some substitute. This tendencycontinues Dr. Maxwellalready very marked, will be accelerated by the settlement of a greater number of white families upon the grain-growing areas, resulting also in a more intense and productive cultivation of the partially exhausted soils. The increment of white settlers upon the sugar-growing lands during the past decade, and bhe concurrent increase in the volume of sugar produced, wibh the reduction in bhe number of islanders employed, demonsbrate the present tendency, and indicate that, under the current operation of given natural laws, and particularly in certain latitudes, bhe Pacific Islander is a relatively declining factor in sugar production in Australia. Let us take this into consideration in connection with the question we have asked whether we are ruining the industry by putting an end to this employment and this traffic. If it is true that-the cane-fields are increasingly able to do with a smaller amount relatively of black labour, if it is true that the extension of smaller areas under the operation of the sugar mills is leading to a greater production on the part of white families and to a further dispensation with black labour in that direction, it does not help the question to call this a natural tendency. The question for us is whether if there is this natural tendency we should leave it to the slow evolution of ages, or assist it in the same way that wo assist other good things-helpin g so long as we do not also destroy that which is good. I think we can do it . I think we shall be able to do it under this Bill. Afte r all, tlie Kanaka is only one factor in the cost of production: If black labour is abolished, and one factor, the cost of labour, is thereby increased in price, the question arises, ""Cannot other factors in tlie production be cheapened?"" I think they can. There is a-general consensus of opinion, which is shared by Dr. Maxwell-and I leave it to others to read his reports; I shall not quote them for this purpose-that tbe methods of agriculture in regard to cane-growing are in many cases crude, and that many steps could be taken by growers, or by the State itself, which would go far to counterbalance the increase in cost of production which is involved in substituting white labour for black. I am sure that is only a reasonable proposition, and I shall not labour it further by quoting froni these reports. Those who turn to Dr. Maxwell's reports, both that which he gave to the Queensland Government, and that which he has so honestly rendered to me, will come to the conclusion that he describes a state of crudity in method ; a progressive deterioration Of the soil due to the failure to replace in it those elements which the sugar cane takes out of it ; and a neglect of all those methods of cultivation which, when applied elsewhere, have been highly beneficial to the industry. He shows these things in so vivid a form in his report that this question is atonce present to the mind of any one who gives his attention to the subject: Is the cry that you must indefinitely have black labour the result of a normal condition of affairs, or does it spring from that failure of production which inevitably results from unscientific or careless methods ? There is abundant evidence of that state of things. Do not let me be understood for a moment as making any attempt to depreciate the position of or to speak offensively of the planter in Queensland. I am endeavouring to give f u l l consideration to his case, but I must be permitted to say, at any rate, that while we allow a cheap means of evading better methods of agriculture to go on, we are decreasing the likelihood of any substitute being obtained for these bad methods. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The history of the world shows us that. world teaches, or at any rate ought to, teach us that. I venture to say that although many planters are striving to improve their methods, it will not be until a certain limit is placed upon this employment and this traffic that the full attention which is necessary to tlie scientific methods of cultivation, and to the application of science by way of machinery in sugar cultivation, will take place. Until then they will not be developed. Dr. Maxwell's reports show over and over again the immense",55,Pateeson Not So Act Of The Series And I F I Speak Of The
249,Mr Barton,"The history of thenatural fertility of the soils of Queensland for cane-growing, and the very great suitability of bhe climate to that industry. One would think that with conditions in the .shape of soil and climate which are pointed out by Dr. Maxwell to be superior almost to any which exist elsewhere in the world, .a traffic and an employment which other places have been able bo do without could be done away with in respect to this industry in Queensland. I bake ib that they can be. The industry only needs the spur which will be afforded by the operation of tbe measures that we propose, in order to lead it to adopt better cultivation methods, and to attempt also to solve the question of machinery. Mr G. .B. EDWARDS -Manure, mechanism, and a market are wanted. off is taking place in the yields per acre. This is shown over and over again by Dr. Maxwell. If honourable members will look a t the tables he has collected, they will see -that in some of the richest districts there has been a falling-off year after year. This falling-off is not because the soils are not equally f it with those of other parts but because elsewhere certain constituents which are withdrawn from the soil by the cane are given back. are not, but they will have to be given for the industry to nourish, whether the labour which, works it is black or white. In some places, according to Dr. Maxwell, there is a great falling-off of yields. districts which have yielded from 40 to 60 tons per acre the yield dropped last year to less than fifteen tonsa drop of about seventy-five per cent, on the late rate of prowhich would enable the machinery problem duction. The causes are given and explained. Let me pass that matter over by saying that I am sorry that the causes exist, but I trust that with the adaptability of our race, the planters will be able to correct these results by adopting the suggestions which Dr. Maxwell makes. Better evidence than all this is to be obtained from the conference which was held in Bundaberg in June of this very year. Without quoting from the report of that conference, I will say that it bears out Dr. Maxwell's statement. Among the defects in the conditions of sugar-growing, if I may take the very able statement made by Mr Denman, are the short tenancies in vogue, the failure to introduce up-to-date and labour-saving machinery; insufficient ploughing neglect to pub plants in deep enough ; and no care exercised in the selection of plants. This is important, because there are great differences between the sugar contents of various canes. The commission's report in 1889 mentioned a class of can6 recently introduced into Queensland which contained 22-6 per cent, of crystallizable sugar as against 12 to 19 per cenb. contained by the ordinary varieties in use. Then Mr Denman speaks of the carelessness in treating the trash, because, under the method of burning which is employed the soil is deprived of much nourishment. He also refers to the careless methods of planting. These are the causes given by a well-known sugar planter, who has put his views in an admirably clear and A great fallingwell argued fashion. I have but bo mention one more fact, namely, that the progress of mechanical invention will cheapen production, and diminish bhe necessiby for black labour. On bhis point Dr. Maxwell has sbabed in his report that it is impossible to predict, within any near period, when the problem of cane cutting will be solved by machinery. He for the cultivation of sugar, mentions the case of a Queeiislander, who has been studying this question in America, and endeavouring to perfect and patent a In Queensland there machine for the purpose. A late extract from a newspaper which is not to be accused of giving an undue support to this Government, or to our policy of a "" white Australia. I refer to the Brisbane Cowrier of In 10th September-explain s the matter. According to that newspaper, the gentleman who, at the time of Dr. Maxwell's report, had nob apparently made that progress to be definitely settled, has since solved the question practically by his patent, and invenbed a machine which will, by a reciprocating motion, cub the cane close to the ground a process which other machines have failed in-and so prevent bhe failure bo geb healbhy rabboons. The question at issue in this matter has always been whether such a machine could be invenbed, bub if bhe Brisbane Courier is righbly informed, bhe problem is practically solved. We are therefore not so much in the dark about the labour question as we were twenty years ago. If it was then a question only of temporary expediency, the flood of greater knowledge shed upon it of later years makes it not",57,Pateeson Not So Act Of The Series And I F I Speak Of The
250,Mr Barton,"only more just, but more politic, that its temporary expediency merely should be recognised, and that a limit should be put to it . NowI come to my last point. Putting aside all questions but the one great question of right and wrong, this Government thinks that the traffic in itself is bad, and must be ended. . The traffic, we say, is bad, both for the Kanaka and for the white man. It is bad for the Kanaka, because it is not inaptly described by Mr but we point out that human nature has Morehead as limited slavery. I say this because, in some aspects it must be slavery. The difference in intellectual level, and the difference in knowledge of the ways of the world between the white man and the Pacific Islander, is one which cannot be bridged by acts or regulations about agreements. The level of the one is above that of the other, the difference being one in human mental stature-of character as well as of mind-whic h cannot be put aside by passing 50 laws or 1,000 regulations. There must be an inequality between these two classes of people when they come to an agreement, and when we considerthequestion of getting a man-n o matter under what regulations or control-fro m his native island, and asking him whether he understands under what conditions he is to serve in Queensland ever so many miles away, is there any one here who believes that the understanding of the man who explains is the same as the understanding of the man who listens, or that the listener is capable of understanding the facts that are mentioned to him ? Even when the recruiting ship arrives in Queensland, and the agreement has to be signed before the Government agent, however much a man may appear to understand, his degree of understanding can only be measured by his mental capacity, and that no statute can enlarge. He cannot be made to understand the conditions of his engagement. He may be brought to a state of partial understanding, but it is impossible to say that he can have a degree of contracting capacity equal to that of the man who is dealing with him. If that is so, and if this arrangement which takes place must be deficient in some of the essential characteristics of a f u l l and intelligent agreement between two capable parties-betwee n two ordinary men of the world, the one understanding what the other propoundsa Higher power having prevented equality, the result is not an agreement at all, but something which British instincts have always revolted against. I hold that opinion. I do not want to speak too strongly about it, but I believe that is another and a very strong reason why this traffic should be terminated. We admit that restrictions have been placed upon the traffic, and we acknowledge the honesty of the Government and Parliament of Queensland in imposing these restrictions. We have no complaints to make of them, made the difference, and legislation cannot correct it . There is no reflection to be cast upon the character of the employers, and, notwithstanding the complaints I have seen in the newspapers, I believe the Government of Queensland loes its very best to see the Act carried out in a proper and reasonable manner. AlthoughI did not see very much when I was in Queensland, I carried away the same impression about the planters, and 1 came to the conclusion that it was not in the individual that there was a fault, but in the inherent nature of the business. It will never be freed of its inherent character of slavery, because the limits have been set by a power which cannot be denied. The Kanakas cannot understand these agreements, because the nature of a contract is foreign to them. The man who has been in Queensland before may possibly understand the nature of the agreement. By three years of this kind of service he may learn to understand what it is he is to undergo for another three years; but his consent to that may be largely due to causes that we can understand-grea t hesitation ingoing back to the islands unless he is put down exactly where he came from. A t any rate, our system of employment is not based on essentials such as these. Our system of employment as a State and as a nation is based upon wholly different conditions, and these are intrusions into it of elements so hostile to our sense of right and wrong, and of the relations which should subsist between man and man, that the sooner we put an end to them the better it will be for all concerned. Apart from this, the Kanaka traffic is depopulating the islands from which these people come. What evidence is there that it is improving the social conditions among them 1 I do not need to allude to things which everybody knows ; but there are facts enough to show that it implants factors and conditions into these islanders which by their very communication are disastrous to their own people when they return to them. The traffic is had for tlie white man-bot h for the employer and the white population generally; and on this head may I use a few words from the late Professor Pearson's book on "" National Life and Character,"" from which I quoted during the discussion on tlie Immigration Restriction Bill. Professor Pearson saysWhen he (the black labourer) multiplies, the British race begins to consider labour of all but the highest kinds dishonourable, and from the moment that a white population will not work in the fields, on the roads, in the mines, or in factories its doom is practically sealed. We do not want to see any tendency of this kind asserted, and I hope the Bill, regarding which I have now to say a few words in conclusion, will have the effect of correcting any such influences by putting an end within a reasonable and just period to something that we do not want amongst us, and at the same time avert the destruction of an industry. tically-and from the history I have given of these Acts, I think it will be understood that they hinge upon two things-namely , the license to introduce the labourer, and the agreement to be made afterwards with his employer. This Bill sets a period to both, and it sets a shorter period to the licences .than to the agreements, because it is only just that the agreements shall have a certain time in which to run out. No licences will be granted under this Bill except during next year and the year afterwards, but a period of three months after the expiration of the two years is allowed for the introduction of those on board licensed vessels up to tbe 31st March, 1904. allows two years for the issue of licences, and two years and three months for the introduction of South Sea Islanders under licence. licences to be issued next year-and we hope the House will assist us to place this Bill on the statute-book so that it may begin to operate at the latest at tbe beginning of next year-ma y be used tc the extent of replacing not more than three-fourths of the number of labourers who have returned to their native islands during this present year. licences to run ? also provided that during the year 1903 the licences shall not extend to the introduction of more than half the number of Pacific Islanders who have returned to their native islands during tlie year 1902. Then a further period of three months is given so as to allow those who hold licences to complete their voyages. These are the provisions of the B ill as to the introduction of black labour. But the principal provision of this measure is, I think, the shortest, namely, the 7th clause, which reads as follows :No agreement shall remain in force after the 31st day of December, 1906. That is to say, these agreements may go on, subject to existing laws, during 1902, and up to 1906, or for a period of five years. According to the Bill, an agreement meansAny agreement for service made with a Pacific Island labourer within or under the Pacific Island Labourers Acts 1880-1892 of the State of Queensland. Freedom is given in connection with these agreements-and I think there ought to be This Bill deals witb two things pracsuch freedom-to make them for any term the law allows within the period fixed for the continuation of the employment of Kanakas. But there is one term beyond which no agreement can exist, and that ia the 31st December, 1906. During thesefive years we give liberty to enter into agreements-althoug h we terminate the introduction of labourers within a little over two years-so that the planter may have time to turn round, and so that there may not be any unnecessary destruction involved in this process My honourable colleague the Treasurer will show next wee,k that that destruction is not involved, simply because it will probably be to the interest of the sugar planter to substitute In other words, the Bill white labour for black with such expedition as he may. This Bill is a short one, not only because we have endeavoured to make it short, but for the It prescribes also that the additional reason that it could not be a long Bill, because the machinery by which it is to operate is contained in the local Acts of Queensland. So far as it is to be applied in Queensland there is machinery contained in the local Acts, and we religiously refrain from the administration of the Queensland Acts, when it is passed, for two reasons. First of all we do not wish to create any jealousy. We do not wish to change the hands in which the administration of these Acts lies, for two _ reasons. First of all we do not want to :",58,Pateeson Not So Act Of The Series And I F I Speak Of The

It ishave any fnotion with the great and important State which possesses our entire good-will, and which I believe possesses the .good-will and love of this Parliament; and secondly, we do not wish to impose upon ourselves the necessity of handling a traffic whioh, after all, we should not be proud to handle at all. We do not want to touch it 'unless we are obliged to, and we think that ""by altering the administration as far as is -necessary to carry out the provisions of this Bill, and no further, we shall enable the local machinery to do what is required, and a t the same time evoke little or no discontent, -except such as is inseparable from a change of laws. The responsibility will continue to rest in a very large measure where it now rests-that is where the traffic exists. We have a further provision about deportation. It operates in two ways. I wish first to say a word or two in regard to those who are found out of agreement in .any part of Australia during the period covered by this Bill-that is up to the end of 1906. We empower an officer, having authority for the purpose, to bring before .a justice of the peace any Pacific Island labourer found in Australia during that period whom he has reason to suppose is not employed under agreement. Upon the justice being satisfied that he is not thus employed, and has not been so employed for one month prior to that date, he may be returned to the place from which he was originally brought into Australia. Mr V. L . SOLOMON -Will that apply to time-expired men? Are not under agreement. If they are a amendments. month out of employment, they may be brought before a justice of the peace, and if PROPERTY FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES they cannot show that the charge against them of not being under agreement is untrue, they are subject to be deported. Mr ""V"". L . SOLOMON -Hav e we the power to do that ? power, and as I said last night in regard to I wish to ask tbe Attorney-General what .another matter, I will take the risk. further force paragraph 2 of this clause has It is clear that no Pacific Islander ought to than is provided for by clause 43 ? It be in Queensland after 1906. His only exseems to me that the paragraph mentioned cuse for being in Australia prior to that might be omitted if we retain the provision period is that he is here under some agreein part 5. ment. As he will not be able to urge that plea after the date which 1 have :named, heought not to be retained in Australia. Being without the only excuse land). that can be offered for his presence in Australia, we take the power to return him to the place from which he was introduced, and I hope we shall use a little discrimination in that matter, so that he may be returned to a safe place. These are the main provisions of the Bill. It remains for me to apologize to the House for having occupied so much time. I need scarcely apologize, however, because I think it well that certain facts, historical and legislative, should be put upon record the first time that we touched upon this question. I apologize,therefore, only in a limited way, and I hope I have to some extent relieved those who have heard me of the necessity for investigating some of the more intricate points in connection with these statutes. They may take what I have said for granted, and I may add that I have now in print a summary of the legislation enacted in regard to this matter, which will show honourable members exactly the provisions of the statutes relating to it . I thank the House for the tolerance and kindly hearing it has given me from both sides, and I hope to be able to say before this year closes that Australia will have this measure to accompany the Bill which we had in committee yesterday, the two together being not merely the realization of a policy, but a handsome new year's gift for a new nation. adjourned, It will apply to all who Bill returned from the Senate with In Committee (consideration resumed, vide page 5492): Clause9 (Compensation for private lands taken under this Act).

Sir WILLIAM LYNE the honourable and learned member should frame an amendment providing that the appeal may be to the Supreme Court of a State until the High Court is constituted. by giving the option between the High Court and the Supreme Court of a State. I have a strong view personally that a little postponement of the creation of the High Court would be a good thing. It would save a huge expense, and at the same time all, or nearly all, the work could be efficiently done by the Supreme Courts of the States as they stand at present. I do not wish to press that view at this stage, but I merely desire to follow v l m t has been done in the Post and Telegraph Bill, and leave the Supreme Court of the State as an optional court. If afterwards when we are creating the High Court we think fit to take away the jurisdiction from the Supreme Court of a State, that can easily be done by a clause in the High Court Bill. Sir WILLIAM LYNE suggested by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne were inserted it would leave it open for all time for any one after the High Court is created to take his appeal to either the State Court or the High Court. Sir WILLIAM LYNE create uncertainty in the first place, and the High Court is the proper court to deal with these matters.

MrA . C. GROOM (Flinders) -Tli e procedure in the clause seems to be a very expensive one. It would be much simplified, and would be carried out with much less cost, if claimants could go to a court of arbitration in the same way as is done under similar circumstances in Victoria. I would suggest that MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) I thoroughly approve of the suggestion of the honourable member for Flinders. I cannot conceive how it is possible to expect a Judge of the High Court to be competent to deal with all matters of land values, as such competency can only be acquired after many years of practical experience. However competent in other respects a Judge may be, it is unreasonable to expect him to have the necessary training to enable him to properly appraise the value of land. It would be much simpler and less expensive to have these matters dealt with by practical experts who understand the business. I do not know why the High Court was chosen as a tribunal to assess the value of land, or whether a similar course is taken in any of the other States. I have known Judges of Courts to sit as umpires in arbitration, but I have never known of a case of the disputed value of land to go to a High Court. fied they go to the court. If the words MrA . M c LEAN I have been connected with many hundreds of cases, and I never knew one to be taken to court. There ought to be provision made for arbitration as well as for appeal to the court. Surely, it is not necessary to frame our laws in such a way as to find business for a High Court, and pile up the expenses for the I think it would people. It appears to me that the time allowed is unreasonably long, because the Attorney-General, if he were busy with other matters, might delay a settlement for 90 days. I can conceive of cases where the property taken might be the whole of the possessions of the family, and under many circumstances a delay of three months would prove ruinous. agree with the honourable member for Gippsland, that the period of 90 days should be shortened. days. for Gippsland is referring to a subsequent clause. In regard to arbitration, there are two systems by which we assess the value of land in Victoria.

In many cases they are also lawyers. The result is that in almost every arbitration it is the police magistrate or the judge who decides. to tlie Judge. do. In cases that are at all important, the parties if they are dissatisfied with the arbitration go to a Judge and a jury. I commend the Bill for the reason that it does not provide a double-barrelled method of arriving at the result. It has one method, and one method only. There is a provision in clause 15 that if both parties consent they can go to arbitration, but a Judge is not to have power to send a case to arbitration except with the consent of both parties. Mr A. parties be compelled to go to the Judge in the first instance t early stage. I admit that the Victorian law at present is not to be commended, for it is extremely expensive. Arbitrations are far more costly than most people imagine. If I were a litigant and had my choiceI am not speaking from the lawyer's stand-point I would ten times rather have my case decided by the ordinary tribunal than go through the expensive and unsatisfactory course of arbitration. several examples within my own experience where arbitration costs have been immensely greater than those of proceedings in court, even with an appeal. almost interminable. factory. expert evidence before hini is the best tribunal to decide the matter. He is not there to do anything more than properly weigh the evidence. If we have a skilled man to sift the evidence, and do it quickly, I think that is all that is required. As a l it i gant I should prefer the prospect of having a Judge to decide my case shortly, sharply, and cheaply. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) I must confess that my honourable and learned friend's experience differs from my own. I agree with him that when gentlemen Each contending party selects of the long robe are employed to appear in an arbitration, they contrive to make it as expensive as a Supreme Court action, but where the services of the lawyers are dispensed with, as they are in nineteen arbitrations out of twenty, and practical men are chosen, tlie process is not only very expeditious, but A case very rarely gets exceedingly inexpensive. I speak from personal knowledge of these cases. I have known many cases in which no charge has been made by the arbitrators. I have acted frequently in that capacity without making any charge whatever, and I know many others who have done the same. The expense is not worthy of consideration. Of all the cases with which I have been associated, only one was referred to an umpire, although an umpire was appointed for each of them. How is it possible for a Judge to distinguish between expert testimony aud that of some person who is paid to give evidence to suit his side ? Unless a cannot possibly distinguish between the two. I should not like a question affecting any property of mine to be left to the tender mercies of any Bench upon which there were no experts. Whatever confidence I might have in the honesty and probity of all concerned, and I should have every confidenceI say that without a f u l l and' intimate knowledge of the matter it would be utterly impossible for them to arrive at a satisfactory and just decision.

For federal business we should have the Federal Court, and where the Commonwealth is a suitor, the proper and dignified place for it to appear in is the Federal Court. It was considerations of this nabure that led to tbe adoption in the Constitution of the High Court as one of the institutions of the Commonwealth. Now, it seems bo be argued that we do not want such an institution at all, because if the argument is correct in this respect, it is correct in all.

318,Mr Poynton,"Even the lawyersI have a strong sympathy with the view put forward by the honourable member for Gippsland. It is absurd to apply the whole of the complicated and expensive machinery of the Supreme Court or of the High Court to a paltry claim. I think the honourable member also alluded to his desire to allow more liberally for arbitration. In Victoria, to issue a writ costs only Is., whereas to issue a summons in the police court costs 2s. 6d., so that in reality it is cheaper to start proceedings there in the first instance. I think that there ought to be power given to the Judge, as soon as a writ is issued, to refer it to some arbitrator, who could settle it in a simple and inexpensive wa}'. I do not think it ought .to be compulsory for a claimant to have .his case fought out before a court. We. shall not be doing ill by leaving it optional with some authority to say whether any particular case shall go before the court or not. trators frequently regard themselves very much as advocates, and ultimately the matter in dispute is generally decided by bhe judge or umpire. I remember appearing before arbitrators and an umpire some years ago in a certain case, in which they reserved their decision. I went to Hobart some time after, and as I was walking along the street , stopped, and out jumped our arbitrator, who ran up to me and shook me by the hand warmly, remarking, "" Mr Higgins, I am happy to say bhab we Jiave won bhab case."" Any one who has had experience in these matters will bear me out . that the amount of frivolous and unnecessary evidence taken before arbitrators is much greater than that taken before a -Judge. I will support the amendment bo .clause 15 so as bo avoid making ib comtpulsory bhab all matbers shall go before a .Judge. Amendment of bhe amendment agreed bo. Amendmenb, as amended, agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed bo. Clause 15 (Justice to determine compensation). May I say to the honourable member for Gippsland that I refrained from saying anything before with regard to arbitration, because I could nob bub feel bhab as a member of the profession my stabemenbs mighb be accepted with some deduction. My own experience-howeve r short it may have been-wa s for a considerable time largely in connection witb arbibrabion cases. Thab experience entirely confirms the statements of my two professional friends. Those arbitration cases were longer, more expensive, and much more unsatisfactory than they would have been had they been conducted before a Judge without a jury. A t the same time. I admit that where one can get parties to a dispute who are sufficiently near to an agreement, or who have a sufficient knowledge of two men in their own way of business to place themselves in their hands, no better, cheaper, or more expeditious method of settling difficulties can be obtained. But that is not the arbitration that we know, or that can be expected under this Bill. In this measure it is the Commonwealth against the individual. The honourable member for Gippsland knows from experience that when the State is concerned a very different kind of claim is made My experience teaches me that arbito that which is set up between individuals. In this case it is the State thab has bo be probected, because bhe State is not treated as one neighbour would treat another. We have to assume, of course, that in the case of small amounts there will be an agreement, and it will be better to make provision to enable small claims to be settled expeditiously without the claimants a carriage being compelled to go into court. There is bound to be of a large margin between what is asked and what is offered; and then there must be the professional assistance which is thought so disastrous by the honourable member. Under the circumstances, if we agree to introduce some provision by a separate clause, I shall be prepared to make the limit £250, under which settlement may be arrived at in some simple manner. We shall then be able to leave the rest of the Bill as it is. Mr A. C. GUOOM -Cannot bhe claimant be given the option of going to arbitration 1 a simple form, and possibly suggest tlie judge of an inferior court or a police magistrate. We must remember that these are not two private people who are disputing, though I have no objection to arbitration then. MrA .

321,Mr Deakin,"I . shall put the clause i nhonorable member must not take his own experience as being very common, or as altogether an absolute guide for us. However, I have no objection to cases under £ 2 5 0 being settled in the way suggested. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) The cases to which I have referred were cases between private individuals and the State. When the Attorney-General speaks of there not being a large margin between the amounts, I can tell him of one case where the claim was for £ 9 5 0 and the State, after having the land valued by its own valuer, offered £4-60, showing considerably more than 100 per cent, difference. In that case and a number of others where the margin was quite as wide, and much larger amounts were involved, the course pursued was for the Government to appoint some person in whom they had thorough confidence as a trustworthy judge of land, and for the owner of the land to appoint a similar person. sit down and take evidence, but visited the land, and, going carefully over it, appraised the value for themselves. just as two principals, or just as purchaser and seller would act, and in nine cases out of ten they agreed without reference to the umpire, although they always took him with them in case a reference should be necessary. I have been connected with one or two cases in which evidence was taken, but what I heard satisfied me that evidence in such cases is of little value as a rule. Each person brings the witnesses who will make the largest demand, and I have heard a person estimate £ 2 5 an acre as the value of land worth possibly £ 5 an acre, -and was a beautiful site, where persons could tie up their horses and have picnics. It is very much better to get practical men to settle these matters as principals would settle them, because a person who is not a judge or an expert may be guided by the majority of the witnesses, which is not a proper way to arrive at the value of land. In most of the other cases to which I have referred, both sides have been satisfied, and the costs have been small, if anything at all. viding that a claimant may, if be chooses, have an arbitrator for sums under £200. glad to hear what the honourable member for I am afraid that the Gippsland has said, because I know arbitrations which have not, in every case, ended so satisfactorily. The arbitrator often regards himself as practically an advocate for the man who has chosen him, whereas he ought to be in the position of a judge. If the Attorney-General has a course to propose for limiting the amount to be brought within the inferior jurisdiction, the claimant might be left at liberty to go to a higher court if he pleases. Clause agreed to. Clause 1G (Costs). MrA . C. GROOM (Flinders) -If tbe Government valuation is sustained the claimant has to pay costs, but if any amount over the Government valuation is given, then the Government must pay the costs.
