From China, we imported 928,000 lbs.; from Java, 26,000,000 lbs.; and from Japan, 360,000 lbs. Those figures, reveal that a tremendous proportion of the tea imported from outside the Empire is grown in Java, while almost the whole of that obtained from within the Empire is grown in Ceylon and India. Nowadays, we see many people waving the. flag, and we hear them talking with pride and sympathy of the great and sacrificial deeds of our Empire..

Jf we imposed a duty of 2d., per lb. on tea grown outside the Empire, we would receive an additional revenue of £360,000. I cannot understand why tee drinkers should not be called upon to pay-something in this direction towards the revenue.

As we cannot produce tea, there is no reason why we should impose a duty, and the Committee would be acting wisely if tJiey removed the duty altogether. It has been admitted that only 341,000 lbs. nave been imported in 20-lb. packages, and that is very little.

If it remains as proposed the stearine will be imported, and for the manufacture of candles will he required only to be moulded here, which is the simplest part of the manufacture, and thus candles made here from imported stearine will come into competition with the candle industry. Stearine is the most important element of these manufactures, and from it by-products, are used in connection with the manufacture of woollens and also of explosives. The manufacture of stearine, therefore is, in a sense, part of our defence system. The most important consideration is the manufacture of stearine in Australia from our own tallow. While we have increased tbe duty on candles, we have left what is. really the main industry still at the mercy of outside competition as before. I am given to understand that wax can be landed here, paying the present duty, at a less'rate than it costs to manufacture stearine in Australia. If that is so, it proves the necessity for protecting the manufacture of stearine, in order that we may utilize our own tallow. I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs to look into this matter with a view to putting the duty on this article on a proper basis. The paraffine wax imported into Australia is produced by black labour, and that is an additional reason why we shouldput our own industry for the manufacture of stearine by white labour on a proper footing. The industry has been established in every State, and for many years has been employing a considerable number of hands, whilst the production of the article here is of benefit indirectly to numbers of people employed in other industries. The cost of production here has been checked, and the statement that it costs more to pre 1 duce it'than the price at which .wax ean be imported from other countries can be vouched for. I have no objection to people using wax candles where, in this country, they can be used, but so far as. their use in the warmer parts of Australia is concerned there would be ne wiped out altogether. By protecting the manufacture of stearine we give facilities for the production of oline, which is used in the manufacture of woollen goods and glycerine, which is used in the manufacture of cordite. BeforeI submit an amendment; I should' like to know from the Minister whether he will agree to aa increase in the duty on this article on the same basis as the increase agreed to on candles? matter at the moment. "" Perhaps some other honourable members desire to address themselves to the question.' hope the Minister will agree to the. request of the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins). to convert me to belief in protection for the industries of the Commonwealth, I may be a little inclined tp go to extremes in the matter of Protection. In thc production of stearine we have an essential industry closely connected with, the candle industry. The Minister has very wisely consented to give some further protection to the candle industry, and that is appreciated by the manufacturers. The protection of the stearine industry does not mean the protection merely of .the production of paraffine wax and stearine, but of other products manufactured from tallow which are of very great importance.. If we allow paraffine wax to come in under the-present rate of duty, we shall practically wipe out of existence the use of stearine for candle-making purposes. It has already been pointed out that paraffine wax, under the present Tariff, can be brought in .at a price below that at which stearine can be manufactured here.

A ll the money used in the purchase of the material from which stearine' is made, and all the wages earned iu connection with the industry,, are spent in Australia; whereas the money paid for the purchase of paraffine wax is : sent outside Australia; and in the preparation of the wax, black labour 'is employedAs a White Australia community,, we have no desire to encourage black labour. benefits the Australian farmer, the grazier,' ments which have been put forward as to and the worker. In connection with the manufacture of stearine candles in Australia, we produce annually 1,000 tons of glycerine, which is largely used in the manufacture of cordite, and for many other purposes; and if we do not protect the stearine industry, we shall have to bring in' from overseas laTge quantities of that by-product. Knowing that -thousands' of tons of fallow are used annually in . the manufacture. of stearine candles here, the Minister will, I am sure, agree to. increase the duty.

The object sought to be achieved in complaints up to now, and, so far as I arranging the duties on candles and wax has been, as far as possible, to protect the manufacturers of stearine candles as against the wax candle. If honourable members will compare the item relatingto candles with that now under discussion, they will see that the arrangement hitherto has been such that the duty on wax has' been slightly below the duty oncandles.' There has been a difference of i d . per lb. We have now raised the duty on candles The stearine industry to 2id. per lb. I appreciate the arguthe necessity for a slightly higher dujy on paraffine wax, inasmuch as it can be brought here and moulded directly into candles without any further process of manufacturing. In that way, it must become a serious competitor with candles manufactured from the Australian raw material, unless we give an additional protection to the local stearine industry by imposing an additional duty. It seems to me, however, that the same balance as between the paraffine wax and the paraffine candlos-that is a difference of idper lb -shoul d be maintained.

Honourable members should consider the probable effect of this upon the people of Australia.

The TEMPOEAEY CHAIRMAN -I am afraid the honourable member is again getting away from the item. tude is usually allowed during the discussion of the items in a Tariff. No honourable member can have, very much respect for the manner in which the Tariff has been debated up to the present, as item after item has gone through""without even the slightest debate.

I want to show how the woollen .manufacturers of this country have unduly exploited the people. However, I shall take a better opportunity of doing so. I have always been strongly of the opinion that we cannot do too much in the direction of encouraging trade between the variouB portions of the Empire,, and particularly with Great Britain.

BecauseI feel that this is our duty, and also because I am absolutely convinced that the establishment of Free Trade within the British Empire would advance, not only the interests of the Empire as a whole, but also those of Australia, I want to see the adoption of this principle as far as possible. Of course, we should not gb to extremes in anything in politics. One begins to get into trouble at once Friends of the protected emby adopting absolute Free ,Trade or absolute prohibition. I advocate neither course, but simply claim that we should give the Old Land, and the various Dominions, the greatest form of preference, approaching as close as possible to Free Trade, with safeguards which could easily be adjusted to prevent the products of coloured labour from overwhelming those of white workers. Anything we can do to help Great Britain, in the cotton trade, will assist it to maintain its supremacy in that trade, and also its command of the mercantile marine.

We found that the duty under the general Tariff was so close to the duty upon apparel that there was not sufficient margin.

I do not object to fair competition; but we need to see that it is fair, and that we are noi injuring a promising Australian enterprise for lack of reasonable encouragement. While the Minister has been generous I would like to see a slight reduction even upon the rates under the old Tariff. I have been informed that, unless Australian silk tie-makers-wh o deal in a raw material which Australia cannot produce-ca n secure increased production, or be given greater protection against overseas competition, they will be unable to satisfactorily establish themselves. I ask the Minister to postpone consideration of this item in order that he may go more deeply into the matter of local manufacture from English silk piece goods, and, perhaps, agree to an additional 5 per cent, reduction. Sitting suspended from 12.57 to 2.15 p.m. When we were discussing the amendment moved by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) before the luncheon adjournment, I was under the impression that it was a very reasonable one in order to meet the position. But since that, from information I have received, I believe the Minister would be acting wisely if he inserted a sub-item to deal with ties, parasols, sunshades, and umbrellas under departmental by-laws. It haa been pointed out to me that some such amendment as this is necessary if our inwar rates,' but that cannot be' so, as he dustries are to exist, which they cannot do if the Minister's amendment is adopted. that. intend giving some of the reasons which have been submitted to me. It is only right that we should look into these matters to see if the case submitted by interested parties is worthy of consideration or not. take their word. in this respect it will be admitted that I nave been endeavouring to fall in with the Minister's views, because he has adopted England imports her silk free a very fair attitude, and has treated suggestions with consideration. The Minister proposes to increase the British preferential Tariff on silk introduced into Australia for general purposes, which, of course, can be considered a luxury, from 15 to 20 per cent. The proposed rate is evidently for the purpose of obtaining revenue. I do not take any exception to the present rate, and I do not think I would have objected if it were 30 per cent. The position taken up by manufacturing industries in Australia is that silk is used for articles of utility that must be obtained by all sections of the community, and when we consider that phase of the question we have to endeavour, as far as possible, to protect our own industries. honourable member suggest? should agree to an addition to sub-item DD, covering silk for manufacturing ties, parasols, sunshades, and umbrellas under departmental by-laws, making the rate of duty less than on other articles. .That is all I require, because our own industries are not in a position to compete with imported articles. are. that statement, because I have been informed that the pre-war Tariff on raw material was, under the British preferential Tariff, 10 per cent., and 15 pei cent, 1 on foreign silks. I understood from the Minister that he was amending the rates so that they would be equivalent to preproposes increasing the British preferential Tariff to 20 per cent. I am informed say that the great bulk of the trade done by Australian manufacturers was in lines at two prices, namely, 12s. per dozen and 20s. per dozen. Buying with the greatest care, and being extremely keen over each item required i u the manufacture, they were, in the case of the 12s. per dozen lines, just able to beat the imported ties by 6d. per dozen; but, in the case of their 20s. line, more often than otherwise they were imported at 18s. 6d: per dozen, which was Is. 6d. per dozen less than the Australian tie.

Several of the manufacturers at this time imported ties, and were able to sell them profitably in competition with goods of their own manufacture. As this happened with a Tariff of 15 per cent, on foreign raw material, it requires no great foresight to understand what will happen if we are asked to pay 30 per cent, on our foreign silks, which form 80 per cent, of the trade. I ask the Minister to consider this matter, with a view to charging a lower duty on the silk we use in manufacture in Australia, and which thus affords employment to our own people. for Trade and Customs) [2.20] -This matter has been before me on many occasions, and the amendment I have moved is the result of the consideration that has been given to the whole question. If 'honourable members will turn to the Tariff, and compare the pre-war rates with those I am now proposing as between the rate on silk-piece goods and that rate ©n apparel, they will find that there is a difference between the apparel rate and the piece-good rate of 25 per cent, which has been retained. The 25 per cent, in my opinion gives an ample protection for the manufacturer of ties. must remember that the high apparel rate is on the finished article. There is not a further 25 per cent, difference, but there is 25 per cent, greater protection on the finished article than on the raw material. I do not know, but I think it would be fair to assume that the finished article, generally speaking, would be worth double the price of piece goods, which means that there is an actual protection of 50 per cent. forget that he is going to ask the Committee to impose a duty of 60 per cent, ou the parasols when we are dealing with that item. do that. The rates which I have provided in the Tariff have been carefully considered, and are in my opinion ample to give the necessary protection to manufacturers.

Having looked into the matter very carefully, 1 believe that what we are doing is a fair thing in the circumstances. 25 per cent, margin mentioned by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) is in reference to ties imported from foreign countries. rate in the case of foreign countries is 30 per cent. the difference between the apparel rate and the silk piece rate. tinder the amendment the British preferential rate is to be 25 per cent., and the foreign rate 35 per cent. It must be remembered that SO per cent, of the imported ties are made by .British manufacturers from foreign, silk, and they enter the Commonwealth with preference over foreign made goods, so that the manufacturers consider that there is a margin of only 10 per cent. ( bers know as. much about the tie industry as they think they do they will vote for the duties being restored to the pre-war rates. I was under the impression when the Minister very generously (amended the rates to 15 and ,20 per cent, that we were going back to the pre-war rates, but I find that the position is as stated by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton), the duties, in those days, being 10 per cent, and 15 per cent. ber will compare the apparel rates with the piece-goods rates he will find the balance is the .same under the proposal I am submitting. crease. we were paying 15 per cent, in those days it has been altered to 20 per cent.

There are certain subsidiary items, such as silver tops, which are used in the manufacture of umbrellas and parasols, and if they come in as manufactured articles they are cheaper than they would be if introduced in bulk for manufacture here. I do not say that the tie or umbrella industry is of great importance at this juncture, but if the Government will give the industry sufficient encouragement the manufacturers are prepared to invest more capital in it. tection to the extent of 25 per cent. _ for honourable members .to criticise my suggestions and to smile, but even if small amounts are invested in these industries we should give them some Consideration. member would give any mortal thing. to concede more than the honourable member, and I will show him the force of my argument before I have finished. member is doing the industry a lot of harm. ber for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) may have been a member of this Chamber for a very long time, but I intend to exercise my rights, and place the position before the Committee as I see it . I represent as many people, and perhaps more, than the honourable member does. articles that cannot be manufactured in this country to come here, but. we must give our industries an opportunity to compete, not only with Great Britain, but with foreign countries. the honourable member must not lose sight of the revenue point of view. He must remember that silk ties are a luxury after all. a luxury, but a real necessity. I do not know why poor people should not be able to wear a silk tie as others do. If these articles are regarded as luxuries then I see no reason why we should not protect the manufacturer of luxuries in this country as against their manufacture elsewhere. orable member desire to wipe out the duty altogether? that in the case of articles that cannot be .manufactured in Australia. I am as good a Protectionist as any member of the Committee, and I again ask the Minister to put the duties on the raw material used in the tie industry and the umbrella industry back to the pre-war rates. If he does so he will be doing something to assist Australian industries. I support the proposed reduction of the duty on piece silk imported for the manufacture of these articles. Piece silk is not 'manufactured in Australia at all. The idea that silk ties are a luxury is fallacious. A silk tie from the economical point of view is the cheapest tie that any man can wear. I have on a silk tie which I have been wearing for two years. If I w»re cotton ties I should have had to purchase twenty in the same time. Silk piece goods made here into ladies' blouses represent the most economical apparel that ladies can wear. To argue that a duty on the raw material of these industries is justifiable because silk ties are a luxury is merely to cloud the issue by suggesting that the Government desire to tax the rich and leave the poor untaxed. Silk piece goods are manufactured here into articles of utility and the most economical apparel that can be worn. There is no factory in Australia making silk piece goods that We want are made up into ties, and if the tie industry is to be developed the duty must be removed from the silk piece goods used in the industry. The Minister( Mr Greene) argued some time ago that 'bulk tea should be admitted free to Australia because it was put into packages in this country, and the thing to do was to make the packages dutiable. In the same way I say that silk piece goods, used in the manufacture of ties, should be admitted free, or at as low a duty as possible, because, no doubt, the Treasurer must consider the revenue aspect of the Tariff. If that is the intention in this case, why does not the Minister for Trade and Customs say definitely that he is introducing a revenue Tariff, and cut out all the nonsense he has",33,Tempoeaey Chairman The Empire Great Britain Depends Very

My argument is that the Government -are making the people who buy the Australian article, made out of silk piece goods, pay 15 per cent, more than they should be asked to pay for those goods, by imposing a duty of 15 per cent, on the raw material of the articles which they purchase. little revenue, and are protecting the ingoods from foreign countries. dustry as well. that we are protecting the industry by making it pay 15 per cent, duty on the raw material it uses. for Trade and Customs) [2.37] I wish that honourable members would consent to go to a division on this item. We have been talking about it for a long time. I have explained the item to the Committee, not once, but half-a-dozen times, and now we have an honourable member, who was not present during the previous -discussion, standing up and again repeating that the proposed arrangement of the duties does not protect tbe local industry. It does. It gives the local industry a protection of 40 per cent. It give3 it exactly the same amount of protection that it has 'had all along. make out that the protection is 40 per cent. ? member will look at the Tariffh will e find that undeT the proposal I am now making the United Kingdom rate is 15 per cent., the intermediate rate 15 per cent., and the general Tariff rate 20 per cent. If he will look at item 110 he will find that the United Kingdom rate on apparel is 40 per cent., the intermediate rate 50 per cent., and the general Tariff rate 55 per cent. Our manufacturers buy foreign silk piece-goods and their competition is with manufactured articles from Great Britain, which are dutiable at of 20 per cent. Then members must bear in mind that the value of the manufacof the raw material. that from the statistics of the Trade and Customs Department. Therefore the protection which the industry is given on the manufactured article is 40 per cent. I say that that is ample. The proof of that statement is that that is the protection which the industry has had all along, and under which it has been built up and has grown to considerable proportions. I am retaining that protection in the case of imports from Great Britain, and have increased it in the case of imports of these at all, because all the imports are from Great Britain. regard to ties imported from Great Britain, we are giving an effective protection of 40 per cent. per cent. able member realize that the value of the manufactured article is greater than the value of the raw material? been so. say, we are giving the industry exactly the same amount of protection that it had before. The position, as I see it, is that, inasmuch as the manufactured ties from silk piece-goods are worth double the value of the silk with which they are manufactured, if a protection of 20 per cent, in excess is given on the manufactured article the effective protection must be doubled, and, therefore, it is an effective protection of 40 per cent, that is proposed for this industry.

168,Mr Francis (Henty) [2.43],"II am proposing the rates of the pre-war Tariff on the raw material. I want honourable members to recognise that the silks made into ties come from France and Italy. They are manufactured in the Old Country and when sent out here compete in a disastrous way with the local industry. I hope that the amendment will be agreed to. Sir [2.44] I am prepared to take the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) at his word, and I ask him to revert to the same protection as this industry was given before. A difference has been brought about by increasing the duty on the raw material. The Minister is under the impression that by doing so he will increase the revenue, but I do not think he will do anything of the kind. decrease it. if anything, he will decrease it . If the Minister is anxious that the people engaged in this industry should have exactly the same protection as they were given before I ask him to put the duty back to the old figure. apparel rate as well. now about ties only. dustry is a big one here, but the general Tariff duty of 55 per cent, is of no tionist principles are involved. The duties value to the local manufacturers, since ties on both items are of a purely revenue are not imported from foreign countries. Our only competition comes from the Mother Country itself. silk industry the question is whether we should encourage the development of our tie industry by giving the manufacturers the raw material at a reasonable price. I suggest to the Minister that the original duties of 10 per cent, and 15 per cent, on the raw material would produce quite as much revenue as he is likely to get from the increased duties, and that a reversion to the original duties would also have the effect of substantially increasing the tie industry here. It would enable manufacturers to absorb a large proportion of the trade that is at present catered for by imports. It is true that there is a duty of 40 per cent, on made-up ties from the Mother Country, and that the honourable gentleman has added 20 per cent, to that duty. Nominally, there is a protection of 20 per cent., but practically there is a little more by reason of the greater value of the made-up article. The tie manufacturers, however, had the benefit of that difference before. would it not be sufficient to increase the duty on the made-up ties ? ready-made ties, provided the Minister will agree to allow the raw material to come in at a reasonable rate, and, provided also, that we can arrive at some reasonable compromise with a view to further stimulating the tie-making industry, aud enabling our manufacturers to absorb the present trade in imported ties. Amendment of the amendment negatived. Amendment agreed to. I move That after the word ""linens,"" sub-item (K), the words "" tinsel cloths"" be inserted. This alteration is partly an elimination of certain materials which are used only as trimmings, and naturally should fall under item 106B at the same rates of duty. Tinsel cloth is at present included in item 106A, but there is no valid reason, The tie inProtectionist or otherwise, for its insertion there .at lower duties. No Proteccharacter, there being no manufacture of. any of these lines in Australia.

Tinsel cloth and tinsel belting are included in item 106, and are admitted free under the British preferential Tariff, whereas if they were included in item 105E, as proposed by the honourable member, they would be dutiable at 15 per cent.

Had there been any real need for such a change, we should have heard of it long ago. It seems to me that people very often put up these proposals, without first consulting the Department, in the hope that they w ill carry them, and that they have some object to serve, of which we know nothing at the time. If we accepted such proposals off-hand, we might suddenly discover that we had done something that we dfti not wish to do. Unless we have a fair opportunity to look into these technical alterations-and they are very technical in their detail-w e should not be asked to make them. We should nob be asked off-hand to take a line out of ome item and to put it in another when there have been no representations to us in regard to the matter. If there was any grave reason for this change, we should iiave heard of it long ago. I ask that tinsel cloth and tinsel belting remain in the item in which they now stand. We find that there are two items dealing practically with the same article. cording to the departmental classification, tinsel, which is a metallic artificial silk, comes in under item 105E, while what is exactly the same kind of thing is classified differently, and comes in under 106A. join with the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr James Page) in asking t h a t ' both be dealt with in the one item. The amendment means that both will be dutiable, so that no loss of duty is involved in its acceptance.

Without desiring I cannot see any obin any way to reflect upon the Department, I must say that it is absolutely autocratic in its methods. The classification in operation this week may be altered next week. One has only to look at the extraordinary classification book issued by bhe Department to realize the detail involved. I presume a great deal of it is necessary. able. object is', as f a r as possible, to simplify the item as it the Customs procedure, so that every importer may know exactly what duty he has to pay. I am afraid that much of the agitation against the removal of the Seat of Government from Melbourne to Canberra is due to the fact that local merchants and others realize that, while they are able, as at present, to get readily into touch with the Department-and I am not for one moment suggesting anything improper-the y have a better chance of having their cases looked into than has a business man in another State who has to interview the Deputy Controller of Customs, who, in t u r n, is bound by the instructions issued to him under the classification. When several classes of goods are brought out in the one package, the whole parcel has to be opened in order tliat the goods may be examined and classified. I am not arguing as to whether these goods should be dutiable or not-that is a matter wholly for the Parliament to decide; I simply suggest that the amendment would simp l if y the Customs procedure in regard to at least one line. for Trade and Customs) [2.59] I sympaActhize with the view which the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) has put.

I admit that these two articles do look something alike, though one is an artificial silk, with an artificial metallic basis, and the other is a true tinsel, having a small proportion of silk finish with a true metallic base. This artificial silk is probably a copy of the tinsel; and the reason it is put under a different item from tinsel is that it is .a substitute for silk, and must, therefore, be rated as silk. These difficulties crop up in administration in a hundred and one different ways.

Wherei t is shown .by statistics that an industry is languishing, and there is a desire for higher duties, I am prepared to grant them. But has it been shown in this instance that the industry needs more protection? The Victorian State Government appointed a Fair Profits Commission to inquire as to the profits of manufacturers in this State, and that Commission, in its Eeport No. 13, issued last year, saysThere is one other mill, and perhaps two, in whioh the profits have been increased by too high a rate of gross profit on turnover. The other mills, forming a majority, have heen making no more than fair profits. Of the two mills just named as making undue profits, one is a "" private"" business, i.e., not a public company, but its figures for the past three years are as notable as those of the second mill, which is a public company, and so can be freely named, as the Ballarat Woollen and Worsted Company Limited. Some further reference to this company,must be made. It has had many vicissitudes in past years, but of recent years has been very prosperous. After making all allowances for writing off capital in former years, it cannot be said-and the Commission adopts the company's own figures -that shareholders have put more than £60,000 original capital into the business. In addition, within the last few years £30,00.0 of reserves have been capitalized and issued in shares to the shareholders. According to published statements, at an interim meeting of the company, held a few weeks ago, the following distribution of profits for the half-year was made, partly out of accumulated but preas viously undistributed profits, namely:Dividend distributed (half-year), £27,000. Issue of shares as a result of writing-up, plant, &c -fac e value, £30,000; market value, about £90,000. Apart from the shares, the dividend is at the rate of45 per cent, per annum on the total nominal capital of £120,000; . 90 per cent, per annum on capital subscribed by shareholders; About 90 per cent, per annum on the capi-' tal used in the business as shown by the last annual balance-sheet. to in that report? issued last year. the .public during the war. fication whatever for these manufacturers putting up prices as they did. During the general debate on the Tariff. I read a letter sent from the Chamber of Manufactures in Sydney in regard to blankets, This is unjust pointing out that the Australian manufacturers could not supply all the blankets required for the people. Letters have also been appearing in the press recently on this subject. One was published in the Argus only a few days ago, from a draper, who stated that he could not get supplies of the cheaper flannels required for the poorer sections of the community. was largely owing to the strike. gotten that during the war our woollen manufacturers got all their wool at the appraised prices. They were not called upon to pay the high rates demanded of the English manufacturers for the same types of wool, but, nevertheless, they raised the prices of their goods enormously, especially for the articles manufactured from the poorer types of wool.

I have some remarkable information concerning the position of the woollen industry ' in Canada, showing how the manufacturers there fleeced the people during the war. They paid poor rates of wages to the workers, and made enormous profits. We know, also, that during the war there was, in this country, one section of the people always ready to give everything. They were to be seen on the wharfs and in the hospitals, men and women, devoting their daily lives to the task of helping the Empire in the struggle. And there was another crowd, generally to be seen chasing around in .motor cars, waving flags, and always talking about the Empire, but who, at the same time, were robbing the people for all they were worth. stop them, you gave us no support. dorse the remark of President Harding, that special legislation should be brought in to provide that, during war time, every person should have his allotted duty, and that no one should be allowed to make undue profits. I have no time for the man who wants high protective duties, but is not prepared to do a fair thing by the community. And yet we have evidence of ment, in the Industrial Australian, to the effect that, although the capital invested W ill you support us? in the woollen industry in Australia was We will also only about £1,100,000, in three years the manufacturers made profits amounting to more than the whole of the amount invested. yet the honourable member did not -say anything about-it at the time. of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) is not fair to me, because I would have been only too pleased if legislation had been brought in to deal with these people who, during war time, were out to make excessive profits.

232,Mr Gregory,"I think if theis quite refreshing to-day to hear the honourable member for Dampier( Mr get. They felt secure so long as the GoGregory) talk about the advisableness of dealing with the people who make excessive profits. His remarks are iu marked contrast to what we have been accustomed to in this House during the past few years. woollen goods are concerned, I admit freely that during the war, and at the present time, too, the prices charged to the general public are altogether too high. I.also remind the honourable member that the people who support him-the importers of goods manufactured in other countries-as o charged excessive prices during the war period. alter the position. nothing alters the position in tlie opinion he could not support us. It is, as I say. of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster). He knows that during the war the wool produced in Australia was exported overseas, manufactured there, and when returned to Australia was sold at prices far in excess of its true valueI am not justifying high prices at all. I merely want to remind the honourable member for Dampier of the true position; and I ask him if lie has forgotten the very many occasions when this matter was brought up by honourable members on this side of the House during the war, and if he did anything to help us? The Government then had ful l power, under the War Precautions Aet regulations, to do whatever they liked to stop profiteering. When we impaled the Government on this issue, what did the honourable member do? ported those who were plundering the people. Let him not forget that. has little cause to talk at us, and to quesis what I have been endeavouring to emtion my consistency in regard to this matter. matter during the war was quite consistent right through. I always, complained that the Government were permitting the manufacturers in this country to rob the people. The honourable member uow expresses surprise that more revenue was not received through the medium of the war-time profits tax. But, after all, that was only another device to permit those who were inclined to increase their prices to extract from the people more than they were entitled to vernment were able to collect something in the form of excess profits tax. That was the kind of legislation which the honourable member supported, notwithstanding that honourable members on this side I agree with him. So far as of the House frequently pointed to the serious position into which the country was drifting. propose to do ? the Government should take action, under the War Precautions Act Regulations, to prevent profiteering; but the honourable gentleman, on every occasion when there was any possibility of the Government being defeated, was either not in the division, or else some reason was given why refreshing now to hear the honourable member for Dampier talk in this way. goods, and I am replying to some statements made by the honourable member for Dampier. However, if the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) wants to bring me back to the point, I may state that last year we imported woollen goods to the value of £3,500,000, as compared with £2,000,000 worth made up in Australia. It appears, therefore, that there is room for improvement, so far as our own manufacturing industry is concerned. It is essential that we should be a self-contained nation. Honourable members opposite are in agreement on this question. the consumer should be considered, also. phasize all the time. I said last evening My conduct in regard to this and I repeat, that the Minister has promised to appoint a Board to see that justice is done to the consumer as well as the manufacturer and the employee. This policy is on the lines of our party platform. This New Protection is what we have been advocating for years. And this is what we asked of the Government during the war.

Had we the power when we were in office we would Save made an alteration. power was available during the war to the Government of which the honourable member for Dampier is a supporter; and, had the honourable member and his party been consistent, action would have been taken against those who were then robbing the people. for Trade and Customs) [3.30] -It is only fair to the Government that I should point out to the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton), from whom we have just heard a very interesting speech, that he was in this House for a considerable time supporting a Government which passed the War Precautions Act and enjoyed all the powers bestowed by that measure. But what action did he and his party take under that Act along the lines that he is now telling us this Government ought to have followed? We have only to turn up the public records to ascertain that the only party which exercised the powers to which the honourable member has referred was the party now in office. But, after all is said and done, this has nothing whatever to do with the case. The woollen mills of Australia before the war were not able to eam more than a reasonable return on their capital. 5 per cent. on capital invested in those mills prior to the war was never high, and in some cases was very low. Undoubtedly we have the raw material in our own country, and the manufacture of it into woollen goods should be one of our great native industries. I think it will be. I know of nothing more hopeful than the development I have seen in the woollen industry the duties set out in the schedule are agreed to, I have information which leads me to believe that one ortwo of the great firms which have used our wool at the other end of the world are coming here to commence operations on a big I object to the honourable scale. In fact, I believe w.e are on the threshold of one of the greatest industrial developments we have seen in this country in regard to this particular form of manufacture, in which I believe we ought to be able to hold our own with the The world. I am hopeful that the duties provided will be sumcient to encourage -these people to come here, and to give those who are already here that protection which is necessary to put the industry on a thoroughly firm and established basis. If honourable members agree to the item, they will have no cause for regret. manufacture of wool is undoubtedly a natural secondary industry of Australia, and ought to be most successful, seeing that we grow 62 per cent, of the world's merino wool; but I think the Minister( Mr Greene), in view of his experience under the operations of the War Precautions Act, must realize that he is overdoing things when he seeks to impose a protective duty of 30 to 45 per cent. It is likely to bring great profits to those who actually manufacture the wool, and those who invest their money in woollen mills. The extra impost will be absorbed by higher profits and the payment of higher wages for shorter hours of labour. In view of the experience gained by the Government during the war, they must know what pro-fit it is possible to make in this industry. They took over twenty-two mills with a capital value of £1,144,000, and in two years and four months made a profit of £1,177,000 on the output of those establishments. That is to say, they could have paid off the whole of the capital cost of the mills and still made a substantial profit. I do not think that the making of inordinate profits is calculated to develop the woollen industry. When such' profits are made, the people of Australia cannot be getting the advantage they should derive. I am not",41,Eobert Best Kooyong It Is Necessary To Increase The Duty On

In any case, the -Australian woollen manufacturer has ample natural protection. raw material, and it is the best in the world; he has every facility for turning it into cloth-the coal, an ample water supply, and an excellent climate-and he has also the protection of freightage. With all these advantages, the Australian manufacturers ought to be in a position to manufacture every bale of wool that Australia produces, and spurn all opposition. No claim can be advanced upon this item for the imposition of high duties On the ground that it is necessary to fence off the competition of black labour, yet we are asked to impose a 30 per cent, duty against the white labour of Great Britain, where wages have risen, and where the cost of coal and other materials has mounted to a high figure. It seems to me quite unnecessary to have this increased protection for the local manufacturer. I would not mind if the duty were made 100 per cent, against outside nations, but as a matter of principle I am not anxious to see unnecessarily high duties imposed, which have a tendency to make Australians inefficient and lazy in the building up of their industries. [3.39] I am no friend of, nor do I hold a brief for, the "" boss"" manufacturer. He is usually a nasty man, who does not pay decent wages unless he is compelled to do so. Workers in woollen mills aTe among the worse paid in our community. It is true that great profits were made during the war, but we wotild have been compelled to pay double the prices we did pay for our goods if it had not been for the existence of our own woollen f2ills. The trouble in regard to the prices we paid during the war arose from the fact that our warehouses in Flinders-lane were not only sellers of goods manufactured locally, but also sellers of. imported goods. The great mistake made by the local manufacturers was in allowing a yard of their output to be sold in Flinders-lane. During the war. a tailor who bought so many pounds worth of goods per month from a certain than a small percentage of Australian made goods. The serge of the suit I am wearing was obtained by the warehouse from the woollen mills at l is . 6d. per He has at his command the yard, but when it came to be sold to the tailor the firm demanded 27s. 6d. per yard. Flinders-lane also endeavoured to pass off locally-manufactured goods for imported goods, and at high prices. ThoughI hold no brief for the manufacturer, I am greatly concerned as to the interests of the workers. For that reason 1 I would like to see higher duties imposed. Once the importer realizes that he is about to be beaten for the local market, he will lower his prices and take less profits in order to overcome the competition of the local manufacturer. We must be prepared for that emergency. During the present year, thirty companies have been formed for the purpose of undertaking the manufacture of woollen goods, and I understand that a dozen more are in course of formation. This is no proof that the duty is sufficient. The companies are hopeful of getting further help from this Parliament. If the wool-growers had gone in for the manufacture of their own wool, there would not have been the great drop they have recently experienced in the price of their cross bred wools. Those wools could easily have been made up into goods and exported. But the pastoralists have never recognised the side on which their bread is buttered. Honourable members ask what steps can be taken to prevent the manufacturers from raising their prices. I hope that the promise of the Minister( MT . Greene) to introduce legislation to prevent these men from robbing the consumers will be carried into effect; in any case, if the local manufacturers do attempt to rob us by putting up their prices, the importing friends of some honourable members will be more likely to rob us in the same way. member think that the Australian manufacturers are turning out as good a cloth as they should, considering the quality of the wool they are getting? world can turn out woollen goods equal",42,Eobert Best Kooyong It Is Necessary To Increase The Duty On

Yet in the years gone by I have made up thousands of yards of thc same material at 8s. and 9s. per yard. To-day, however, everybody is endeavouring to restore the pre-war conditions. We all recognise that wages must come down in England aud America, because manufacturers there desire to produce cheaper commodities for the purpose of supplying the oversea markets.

During the interval which has"" passed I asked my solicitor to give me his opinion upon that letter. I have no animus against the author of it, but, as he has taken up quite an unwarranted attitude upon behalf of his client, I proSome years ago pose to read the reply to it, which I have received from my solicitor, Mr Joseph Woolf. It is as follows:Melbourne, 13th May, 1921. DEAR DB . MALOXEY, Your letter of the 6th of May duly to hand. I wa3 told It is curious that Messrs. Ellison and Hewison persistently ignore the real facts of your speech as set out in Hansard. The Labour party desires They could not fail to see that the real and essential fact you set out is actually true, namely, that Colonel Walker, as may be seen at page 311 of the evidence following his previous statement on oath, then formally recanted and withdrew his sworn statement on oath. This statement was he deliberately swore that he had seen Mr Caldwelli n the presence of himself and others sign the document produced. He said he was aware of his responsibility and the nature of an oath when he made this In spite of statement. He had previously challenged the Committee to call a -writing expert who wonld verify the signature as Caldwell's signature. Your inference, therefore, is irresistible, I have namely, that he produced a forged document. You, however, omitted thc word "" therefore.""' If yon had said, "" Since Colonel Walker relied for his perjured statement on the document he produced, it must have been such a perfectsignature of Caldwell's as to deceive a writingexpert."" You would have stated a conclusion had you used the word "" therefore."" Colonel Walker evidently believed that he could commit perjury without being found out, I ask the Minas he impudently challenged the Committee to produce a writing expert, because lie believed the signature was such a good imitation of Caldwell's that lie would be borne out. If a signature w ill deceive a writing expert it must be a remarkably good forgery of the original signature. Of course, you could not prove that it was forged by Walker or anybody else, but Walker gambled on the perfection of the forgery. You obviously knownothing about it . Most men would agree with you had you stated this as a conclusion, but you stated it as a fact, and did not preface it with the word ""therefore."" You would not be able to prove as a fact in a Court of law that this si<mature of Caldwell's was in fact a forsrerv. and, therefore, that it would be a foreed document.

These cuttlefish tactics of Walker are obviously designed to save him from further prosecution for perjury. Now he turns round and says, ""AlthoughI committed perjury deliberately and in order to prove I was telling the truth, demanded a writing expert to prove it was a real signature, I now turn round, and say since I committed perjury when I said it was written by Caldwelli t is no longer a forged signaunder our laws, if a man has money ture, and I no longer want a writing expert, and, therefore, Mr Maloney would have independently to prove that it was a forged signature, but he cannot do this, as he is unaware of any of the circumstances. Here, an impudent offender against the criminal law instead of being repentant and humble, actually dares to threaten a member of Parliament, who honorably does his duty, which this unrepentant sinner by threatening hopes to deter him from doing. The crime is denned in the Act of Parliament which constitutes the Joint Accounts Committee, and the punishment for this crime of perjury is five years' imprisonment. Their duty was clearly to uphold the law of the Commonwealth. Of course, it is ridiculous toassume that a man who deliberately sets out to commit perjury does not commit it, because he is found out and forced to recant. You cannot be deterred from doing your duty by any threat or impudent challenge to surrender your parliamentary privilege. The parliamentary privilege is the highest privilege a memher of Parliament has, and that is a very good illustration of its value to the community. Here the facts are absolutely true as a whole, and you have acted as an honourable man in making your statement for the benefit of Parliament and for the protection of public morality, which ought to include that no man who commits perjury, no matter how highly placed, should escape justice. The question is, what does the honour of Parliament demand if the Joint Accounts Committee have failed to observe those principles of honour which should actuate all members of Parliament for the enforcement of the law. Sir Frank Madden, when challenged on oue occasion to repeat outside that he had made in Parliament, to do so, and I shall follow his example in this case, but if a statement is wanted as to perjury, I am ready to make it. I do not know Mr Hewison, but Mr EllisonI have found a decent fellow. that in this case he speaks as a lawyer representing a client, and wishes to make a point, because I did not use the Word to injure a real Australian.
