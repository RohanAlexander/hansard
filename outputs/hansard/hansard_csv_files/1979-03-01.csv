230,Mr Howard (Bennelong,"Treasurer) has been engaged internally for some time inthat the advertising of tax avoidance schemes I understand also that a document which the should be banned. WhilstI can understand some honourable member for Banks euphemistically people feeling that way I think it raises a concepsaid had been 'dropped from a truck' was retual difficulty, one that I certainly have and ferred to during the debate. My understanding is which I am sure my colleagues on this side of the that that particular document was an internal House have. Irrespective of the distaste which paper of the Australian Taxation Office adsome people have for the advertising of tax dressed by an officer to his supervisor and had avoidance schemes it is a fairly serious step for not been directed to the Government. Of the any government to prohibit the advertising of eight matters mentioned, some were alternatives, something which is not per se illegal. I know that some had been attended to in one way or another there are always exceptions to those sorts of and others were not entirely practical solutions rules, but on balance I could not support the aphaving regard to the complexities of the subjects proach of banning the advertising of"" tax avoidto which they were related. I think the point has ance services, however much I might be unhappy to be made that not every trust is set up for tax with the services that are being provided. In the avoidance purposes. I think the point also has to course of this debate it has been suggested that be made that the changes made in the Budget of the amending legislation goes far beyond its inmy immediate predecessor to the taxation of tentions. I understand that one or two of my own trusts reduced significantly some of the tax colleagues raised a couple of problems with the advantages of arrangements through trusts, but legislation. it is generally not correct to say that all trusts are set up for tax avoidance purposes. The other point that I make specifically in reply to the The honourable member for Denison( Mr honourable member for Banks is that I have Hodgman) suggested that a mining company given a standing request to the Commissioner of could lose deductions for development expendiTaxation to bring to my attention as soon as ture, for example $lm where it has an agreement possible details of the nature of any tax avoidwith an associate to market the mine concentrate ance scheme that comes to his notice. for a fee of $100-les s than an arm's length fee. The comment I make on that suggestion is that I think it is correct for me to say that in the for the legislation directed against prepayment time. I have occupied this position most tax schemes-that is the legislation before the avoidance proposals that have come before me House-to apply, thefirstrequirement is that the have been implemented. Some are still in the expenditure must be incurred as part of a tax pipeline; others are under consideration. I know avoidance arrangement.

I acexpenditure of $lm by the mining comany. I say knowledge that. One reason for bringing that further that the second requirement of the legisproposal forward in thefirstplace was related to lation is that there must be a prepayment, that is, tax avoidance, but the greater reason for bringthat the expenditure must be greater than might, ing it forward was to effect an improvement in in the absence of tax avoidance, reasonably be the taxation system as the Government then saw expected to be incurred at the time when it was it. The Government subsequently decided, I incurred. Again, there is no suggestion that the think quite validly, that many broader economic $ 1 m would not have been expended when in fact and commercial considerations suggested that it is expended. In other words there is no suggeswe ought to leave the system as it is. To suggest tion that it is a prepayment.
