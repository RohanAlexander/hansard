As I said earlier, I deny that Australian economic development in believe that, had it not been for some of the mul1976 would not be what it is without the great tinationals operating in Australia, Australian deal of foreign investment that has taken place; industry in 1976 would be very much different but I do not think that should blind us to the refrom what it is. Most of the multinationals, so ality that the majority of investable funds called, as they operate in Australia in my view employed annually in Australia is found within are more 'national' than they are 'multi'.

Very briefly, to take the example 1942-1973. In 1975, 6 Bills were introduced referred to by the Attorney-General( Mr amending the Commonwealth Electoral Act. It Ellicott) in his second reading speech, the reform was difficult in the later Bills to describe the legisis to avoid the necessity to cite a statute by lation that was being amended. Further, all 6 reference, as in the case of the Customs Act, to Bills contained a provision that the basic legisthe years 1901-1974.

That question is: WhatI agree with the that proposition and I hope that advantage does that have over a system by that is one reform of the previous Government which one refers, for example, to the Customs which will be continued by the present GovernAct 1901?
