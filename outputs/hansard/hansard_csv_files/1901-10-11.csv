In Committee of Supply : Treasurer) I move That a sum nob exceeding £928,322 be granted accounts before the 30th June, and, as to His Majesty for or towards defraying the serhonorable members are aware, under our vices for the year ending 30th June, 1902. Honourable members will recollect that some the 30th June. These arrears amount to . time ago the committee passed Supply for a £246,899, and the total expenditure for the period of three months, which ended on the half-year, plus arrears, therefore, comes to 30th September. for the Government to obtain further to £1,010,732, and now-1 am asking for Supply in order that' the Treasurer £928,322, making a total of £1,939,054 or may be able to make the necessary something under the total expenditure for the provision for the payment of salaries', half-year, according to the Estimates. There and the various other claims that are made are no extraordinary, payments provided upon the Government from time to time. for. I have looked carefully over the list, Some days ago I circulated, for the inforand I have provided for just the mation of honourable members, a list of the ordinary expenditure. There are increases amounts asked for by the various departof salary provided for in the Estimates, ments: ' As I said yesterday, however, I but none of these-' increases will be had had no opportunity of checking the paid until the Estimates have been requirements there stated, and when I saw finally dealt with. Honourable members will, the total amount I was satisfied that the I dare say, notice with pleasure that I have heads of departments were asking for more provided a considerable sum for maintenance than I wasjustified.in requesting the House and repairs-abou t £40,000 altogetherto grant. Yesterday I went as carefully as because complaints have been made to the possible through the various demands that department of Home Affairs with regard to were made, and I have mode a deduction of -the delay in carrying out repairs. I put about a quarter of a million from the amount down a very small amount for this work originally asked for. That, I think, was during the previous quarter, with the result only right and fair to the House, because, while the Treasurer may be justified in asking for Supply sufficient for three months, he ought not to request more thanthat, or, at all events, he should not ask for more than will afford a reasonable margin beyond what he expects to expend-otherwisee he might find that he had four months' Supply instead of three. I took out some amounts that were not required to be paid before the 31st of December, I have reduced other payments, and I have only allowed for those amounts which I think it is absolutely necessary to pay during the currency of the three months. The total expenditure on votes comes to £3,636,577, and one-half of that amount is £1,818,288. In addition forward from the last financial year, which would have to be paid either during the quarter which has passed or during the current quarter. The Estimates were somewhat increased last quarter, because these arrears necessarily hod to be paid. The amounts that, in the ordinary course, would be paid before the 30th June to mail contractors and others are, as ' a rule, paid early in July. Supply was was impossible for me to pay these Audit Act we have to close down sharp on It is now necessary £2,065,187:' The first Supply amounted",14,Setup

2,Sir George Turner (Balaclavagranted So Late,"in June that i tthat we have .not been able to go on as rapidly as we ought to have done, and we are therefore asking for a"" larger amount now. to bring down a Supply Bill, but circumstances over which we had no control compelled us to hold over the financial statement until this week. Therefore I am very anxious now to get thisSupply through both Houses to-day. The Senate does not sit until ""Wednesday next, and unless I get the Bill through that Chamber to-day it will be Wednesday before it can bo passed and Thursday before I can get it assented to. In the meantime, there are claims which I am very anxious to pay at the earliest possible moment. I do not know that there are any really debatable matters in the Supply, and, therefore, I would ask honourable members to reserve any comments on the Estimates themselves until we have them before usI hope in a month or six weeks' time at the outside. If , in the meantime, honourable members desire any information in regard to any of the items my colleagues and I will be only too glad to supply it . under the circumstances the committee will be disposed to fully accept the assurance the Treasurer has just given us. ordinary conditions this is a matter which might provoke considerable discussion, but inasmuch as the financial statement has just been delivered, and honoroble members will soon have f u l l opportunities of dealing with every subject which presents itself to us under this motion, I think we might well-unles s some honourable member has some matter of great importance to mention-allo w this Supply to go through without any delay, in the interests of public business. I have a number of observations to make upon the financial administration of the Government, but I can well postpone these until the general debate upon the financial statement of the Treasurer, when I think we shall have much larger scope, and where such a discussion would perhaps he more appropriate. Therefore, I am quite prepared to facilitate the Treasurer in getting Supply through at once. A t the same time, I think honourable members will agree with me that this granting of a three months' Supply should not be made a precedent. The more regular course is to grant one month's Supply at a time, and we must not make it too easy for this or any other Government to dispense with the proper constitutional method of obtaining Supply. It is somewhat late in October for us The Prime Minister has, however, fully recognised this, and has asked us, on this occasion as a matter of unusual urgency, to give this three months' Supply. Under the circumstances, I shall facilitate the passing of the Bill to-day. is not my desire to prevent the Supply from going through, but I should certainly like to have more information as to the expenditure that is provided for under the heading of "" contingencies."" In connection with the Estimates, I find that the word "" contingencies"" covers an enormous amount of money ; and I think it is necessary that we should have the details dearly before us, so that we may know what we are voting. As a matter of fact, under ""other expenditure""-whic h means new expenditure"" contingencies "" represent a greater sum than salaries. I am not going to allow these items to pass, at any rate in the future, without further in formation than we have at the present time. Under the head of the House of Representatives, for instance, there is set down £1,500 for contingencies, and £1,554 for Under salaries. are large, because they all come in during the session, whereas salaries ore spread over the whole year. what these contingencies mean. in the Estimates. large sum of £3,000, in connection with Government printing, put amongst the contingencies. ing is done during the session I could not set out every detail.

Nevertheless, we shall, later on, require more information in regard to old expenditure ; and, as to new expenditure, tlie Treasurer would save time by giving f u l l particulars of what is covered by contingencies. I should like to ask the Treasurer if any of the items under the Defence department include any moneys proposed to be expended from loans ? items are simply revenue expenditure, and are not intended to cover new buildings. new buildings. From the Budget statement. I understand that a quantity of ammunition and other things are to be purchased with loan moneys. to be purchased out of loan moneys.

That can easily be brought out by debiting to loans a great deal of tlie expenditure which ought to come out of the revenue ; it is simply a matter of bookkeeping. Of course, according to the estimate this expenditure should not exceed £300,000. include anything for new buildings, for which I am providing £24,000. drawn off the track. I hope the committee will understand that this loan money is meant to cover a number of other tilings besides buildings. It is meant to cover a number of matters which, ordinarily and properly, in any good system of finance, ought to be provided for out of revenue. I have to warn honourable members that tlie very greediest department with which we have to deal is the Defence department. the way. against the Minister for Defence, but, unless I am not alluding to the right honourable gentleman is careful, he will be helpless in tlie hands of numerous commandants and others. Here we have about 19 pages of supply schedules, and about 13 are taken up with Defence. It is very significant that tlie most unprofitable department is that which occupies most of the space in the Federal Supply schedules. I fancy there will be a big discussion eventually on the question whether we are to give the I have not the Estimates Treasurer power to borrow for the purposes he has mentioned. I feel that we are getting into the old rut of financial policy which has injured several States of Australia. borrowing for purposes which should be defrayed from revenue. I did hope that in starting the career of this new Commonwealth, we should have had an announcement that the Government were going to use none of the loan moneys in this way, except in cases of absolute necessity and of emergency of an extreme sort, or where the expenditure was for remunerative investment. We cannot too soon lay down the principle that we will not allow future generations to be burdened with expenditure which we ought to pay ourselves. Honourable members here represent living persons-the existing electors of Australia-bu t we have none here representing the future electors of Australia. The worse of it is that the whole tendency is to l if t the burden from the present taxpayers and puti t on future taxpayers. Whatever may be said in regard to the expenditure in other departments, there is no department which is so unremunerative, so costly, and so greedy, as the department of Defence.

I am not speaking at present of the permanent forts, which may present an exceptional case from which future generations can reap a benefit; but in the Budget statement there is a clear intimation, ""which we ought to weigh well, that the Treasurer intends to throw on to the £1,000,000 loan, a number of items of expenditure which properly, and in the eye of any business man, ought to fall on revenue to be obtained by our own payments. We have a trust not only for the present taxpayers 'but for future taxpayers, and we ought to see that we do not allow the position to be glossed over.

WhatI am saying is that I object to the Treasurer using loan moneys to meet expenditure which ought to come out of the revenue.

I hope honourable members will allow this general discussion to stand over until we are dealing with the general financial policy and proposals of the Government. I am quite as much in earnest in this matter as the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, but I feel that there is no time, under existing circumstances, to enter into such questions, and I should like to see the rest of the time to-day devoted to important measures now before the House. position has said, but I have to complain necessary public works.

I want to call attention to a very serious disability which the services of the whole of the States are labouring under by reason of their being no loan funds available at the present time. The Post-office, we know, is a constantly expanding department, in which fresh expenditure is continuously required on permanent reproductive works. But there are no loan funds available for expenditure on taking office, either have made. I understand from arrangements with the States to carry on the purpose.

General says that this expenditure must be incurred, and will be incurred as soon as loan funds are available. If the Government, through their own mouth-piece, declare that these works are absolutely necessary, surely some arrangement should have been made with the Public Works departments in the various States for the continuance of extension operations in connection with post-offices. I hope that some arrangement will be speedily arrived at which will enable these works to be put in hand. There is another matter to which I should like to direct attention. In New South WalesI believe that the line repairers are regarded as temporaiy hands. They have not those privileges which attach to the permanent servants of the State. promised 1 promise made by the Minister, but it was capital site. This matter seems to be in a 17 Q taken back by the head of the Government. The latter gave us to understand that there was not much likelihood of the Ministry being bound by the declaration of the Minister for Home Affairs. He would not the commit himself to saying that the promise made by the Minister would be carried out. If what I ask is going to be done, I have nothing further to say. I merely desire that the line repairers in New South Wales should be placed in a similar position to that which they occupy in the other States. Either there must be a levelling down or a levelling up. I hope that tliis Parliament will not The same permit of any levelling down process so far as the ordinary services of the Commonwealth are concerned. The disposition A t one place, with which 1 am should be rather to level up those services to the highest ]jossible point. I trust that we shall soon see a realization of the promise made so definitely to the Houseb y the Minister for Home Affairs. I wish alsoto say a word or two upon the question of increments to transferred officers. It iswell known that in New South Wales certain increments have been restored to officials of which they have been deprived for several years. But whereasour Public Service Bill provides for the payment of increments of £ 1 5 a year up to a certain amount, only £ 1 0 per annum has been given for some years past to these officers by the Public Service Board. Post-oflice to give them what they were entitled to under the laws existing in the States. increments which are being restored to the State officials will also be paid to transferred officers. I gave instructions that they should be paid what they were entitled to under the laws of the States, and in the absence of any such laws that they should be paid according to the practice in vogue in the various' States. We provided £28,000 for that purpose, nearly all of which will be disbursed amongst officials in the Postal department. point which I have raised There is one not that been other subject regarding which I should like some information.

The Minister for Home Affairs says that-he is doing all he .can :to facilitate the seleotion of the -site. On tbe other hand, the Premier of NewrSouth Wales declares that he has already done lall that can possibly be done to assist in its early selection. In other words, he has collected all available information 'and presented it to ithe Minister for -Home Affairs, with a view of .expediting a decision in regard to this matter. What is the cause of the delay in the department .df the Minister for .Home Affairs? orable member wish me to do ? to be selected and operations commenced for the building of tlie capital.

CHAPMAN (Eden-Monaro) I agree with a good deal of what has .been said by the honourable member for Parramatta regarding the Postal department. The delay in erecting new buildings and in extending post-offices which now provide insufficient accommodation for.the.general.pubhc,.has.given rise to keen disappointment in New South Wales. I do not blame the Government for this delay, because they have had no opportunity of getting the public -service into line. Whenever an attempt is >made to do that, it seems to me that honourable members are expected not to voice the wants of their constituents, but to sit quietly by and allow some high officialsas in the case of Mr Outtrim the other day--to do wihat they choose. These officials are permitted to put their constituents to very great inconvenience, and a hubbub is created the moment an honourable member expresses disapproval of what has been done. I wish to enter my protest against the. actions of some of these .gentlemen. particularly. Many officials in New South Wales seem to think that applications from big centres of population' are entitled to every consideration, and that any request from them backed up by a deputation, such as can be .got -together at any moment, ought to receive immediate and -favouaible attention. 'But tlie invariable .reply to .people upon small mining fields .or -in the ""nevernever "" country, who ask for some .trifling consideration, is that an .officer -will be sent to report -upon the matter. Then two or three months-are .wasted .before any -satisfaction can 'be obtained. It -frequently -happens that men are driven off these gold-fields, ^which might, under other circumstances, become centres of .population, because they are denied the most ordinary postal facilities. I wish further to point out that .in many cases new mail services are required. In New South Wales a system was formerly in vogue under -which, when u mail was asked -for a new'.goldExcept for the vague statefield, a report -was obtained from the nearest postmaster upon the matter. If -there -was anything like reasonable justification for the request a small mail service was granted on trial. Owing to the opinions entertained by some of tlie highly-salaried post-office officials that system has now been swept away. There is a .great deal of discontent in New South Walesramongstthe postal officials. They say that a system amounting almost to tyranny is growing up, and there is a very bad feeling right through the department. Sir GiEOEGE TURNER -If tlie honourable member will give me any specific instances of the kind I will have them inquired into. ME , CHAPMAN I shall be very pleased to furnish the Treasurer with particulars. There is a great deal of dissatisfaction caused by the tyranny of some of these officers, and by what is regarded as favouritism on their part. Some of the men are afraid to make representations on the subject lest they should suffer for them, and I think this is the proper place to ventilate such matters. While we can understand that the Government are -not to blame, inas j much as they have half-a-dozen departments to administer undervery difficult circumstances, pending the passage of the Public Service Bill, .nevertheless I think some of these officials should be pulled up with a round turn. As the result of information which I have received during the last two or three I do not single out Mr Outtrim days, I propose to supply the Postmaster General with the names of some of these",18,Supplybill No 4

50,Mr Joseph Cook,"I want the siteofficials. I have no doubt that the Minister will take steps to let them fcmow that thej' do not own this countiy, and that the department is not run for their .especial -benefit. I do not wish to go any further than that. Many of these men require only a little "" shaking up,"" and we shall soon have some changes made. I agree also with some of bhe remarks which have been made upon the question of defence. When the Defence estimates come before us we should take care to see that men in countiy districts who desire to form rifle clubs or corps of the Australian Horse and other regiments -of that description receive some consideration. Very little difficulty has been experienced in securing theexpenditureof large sums of money by the Defence department in the principal centres of population. I hope we shall now give some attention to the residents of countiy districts who desire to train themselves, so that they may be prepared to fight for their country should occasion arise. alarming fact that, .while hundreds of thousands of pounds are spent on city forces, no attempt is made to secure scouts or men with a knowledge of the coast line, who would be invaluable in time of invasion. Something in that direction should be done, and when the vote for 'the Defence department is before us I hope we shall take the matter into consideration. These men in the country districts are ready to train themselves at their own expense, and the Government should facilitate the cariying out of their desires. I would welcome the formation of a corps of scouts, and of men having a knowledge of the coast line. It is unnecessary to make any . further reference to the question of a citizen soldiery, but before I resume my seat I desire to say a few words on the question of the site for the Eederal capital. be getting sick of the delay. getting tired of it. I am anxious that we should settle on the site as early as possible. to fche site which will be selected, but I am anxious that honourable members shall be ^afforded an early opportunity of coming to <i decision. All that the people of Southern Monaro desire is that honourable members shall be given a fair opportunity of judging 17 Q Z of the merits .of the respective sites. The -newspaper paragraphs referring to a proposed parliamentary picnic in connection with the inspection of sites must be taken -with a very large grain of salt. It seems to me, however, that there could be no better -way of enabling Parliament to come to a proper decision than by allowing honorable members to visit the various sites. The experts who have gone into the question of water supply, climate, and other matters should be with us when we make the inspection, and with their statements before -use we shall be enabled to come to an early decision. MrA . McLEAN -Afte r honourable members have seen the sites they will not be in a hurry to shift. that there is a very strong inclination on the part of honourable members to settle down in the comfortable quarters provided for us here. Many have said To my mind it is an that we have not been made welcome, but I do not think that is so. I know of no honourable member who has not settled down comfortably here, and who has not been treated with courtesy and kindness by the people of Victoria. The statement that we have not is only a libel, fomented by persons who have certain objects to serve. Some of the suggested sites are no larger than a garden, with nothing but barren country about them. Honourable members should see them for themselves, and after the inspection has been made we should take a vote on the question as speedily as possible. I entertain no doubt as to the site which will be selected, but I am willing to bow to the decision of the majority. There is no reason why we should visit any place obher than those recommended by the New South Wales commissioner. That gentleman has expended a great deal of time and trouble inquiring into the respective claims. SomeI am certadnly 30 or 40 sites were submitted to him, and he has selected three or four, the merits of which in his opinion stand out conspicuously. If we visit those places we shall have very little difficulty in coming to I have no doubt as a determination. Once the location of the Eederal Capital has been agreed upon, we should proceed with the erection of temporary quarters, so that the Eederal Parliament may settle down with as little delay as possible, in what is to be its permanent home.

I agree with the honourable member for Paramatta as to the unfair and almost improper way in which some of the works are being carried on. Let me cite a case in point. Prior to the taking over of the Postal department by the Commonwealth the people of Preston were promised that a post office would be erected there. That promise has not been carried out. months before the department was taken over. the State Government go on with the work 1 They made a lot of promises which they did not fulfil, and we get the blame. made to the Federal Government for the erection of the post-office, but an answer was received that no funds were available. The people of the district were satisfied with that reply until they saw what was being done elsewhere. The honourable member for South Australia, Sir Langdon Bonython, has made three or four requests for the erection of a post-office at Tarcoola or AValker ville. He has been told again and again that no funds are available, but I suppose that because he has a big newspaper at his back, in which articles have appeared pointing out the delay of the department in dealing with this matter, provision has been made on the Estimates for the work.

A similar reply was given by the Minister representing the Postmaster General, but as soon as articles appeared in the honourable member's newspaper, and pressure was brought to bear, the money was found. That is not fair to honourable members from other States, who have equally pressing claims. work being found out of revenue ? where it is coming from, but I say it is hardly fair, and honourable members are justified in expressing their disapproval of what looks like favouritism. tion for the suggestion of favouritism. favouritism. which I desire to refer is the alleged political influence in the Postal department. That question has been commented upon pretty freely in the public press, and my name has been associated with those of other honourable members, who, it is said, endeavoured to do something improper and unfair in connection with the administration of the department. should be proud of the advertisment. have one side of the case stated in the press, but it is only fair that the other side should be put. It is true that I , with some other honourable members, waited on Mr. Outtrim touching certain departmental matters. The first case was that of a man who had been working for years as a telegraph operator. His right hand had given way, and he had been forced to use his left when working his instrument. He thought that his left hand would also break down, and he desired a change. He asked me if there were any chance, and I recommended him to apply to the department, promising to see Mr Outtrim about it. I laid the matter before Mr Outtrim, who said there was no objection to a transfer if there were an opening. The man sent in an application; and was transcountry. When he asked what was the reason for tliis, he was told-no t by Mr Outtrim, but by one of the other officersthat he should not try to bring political influence to bear, but should attend to his own business. Now, I had asked Mr, Outtrimi n the most friendly manner about this man being transferred, with the result that my action was resented, and that the man who applied for the transfer was sent away 120 or 130 miles into the country. The other case was even worse. A man was sent out to do some telegraph line repairing",20,Supplybill No 4

69,Mr Hume Cook,"It is all very well toand had climbed up a telegraph post, when one of the cross-pieces broke off, and he fell to the ground, and hurt his hip, and was laid up for months. He put in an application, not for compensation, but for sufficient to cover the doctor's fees, amounting to £ 2 0 . He was put off from time to time, but, meanwhile, made inquiries, and found that the very cross-piece that had given way with him , had been reported upon by the inspector iof the department some months before as defective, and re quiring to be replaced. The department, in that case, was clearly to blame in not having the cross-piece repaired ; and yet the man who met with serious injury in consequence of their neglect, could not even get a refund of the money spent in doctor's fees. If he had been an official he would have drawn his salary all the time, but being only a poor working man hedid not even get his doctor's fees. A t my suggestion, he made an application to the Federal Government, but what was the paltry treatment he received from them 1 He was informed that, in view of the fact that this matter was not settled by the State Government, it was now too late for the Federal Government to take it in hand. It was too late to do this man justice. member give me a note of the matter 1 consider that that was a paltry way in which to put off a man. who had a good case and a genuine grievance. Then again, there was the case which was brought forward by the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr shall not develop it at all, but shall have to O'Malley, in which an innocent man was accused of stealing money belonging to the Post-ofiice, and discharged. The honourable member brought the case before the Postmaster-General, and, on inquiry, it was found that the man was absolutely guiltless, and that two messenger-boys had taken the money. If the honourable member had not brought that matter before the head of the department, an innocent man would have rested all the days of his life under the stigma of a crime in which he had no hand. These are the sort of cases which justify members at times in bringing matters before the responsible Minister, and I am rather pleased at the fact that members can go to Ministers of the Commonwealth Government and see that justice is done. I deprecate altogether statements being made in the press which seek to implicate Members of Parliament in attempts to bring unfair pressure to bear upon officials and induce them to do something improper. If all the facts were-stated it would be found tk -if., in most cases at any rate, honourable members act in a perfectly legitimate manner. My experience has been that the Member of Parliament who brings alleged grievances under the notice of the department is in nine cases out of ten convinced by the officials that he has got hold of the wrong side of the story, and he allows the matter to drop, but it is the tenth case in which there is a real grievance that renders it necessary that Members of Parliament should haveopportunities to make their representations to head-quarters. I am glad to accept the assurance of the Treasurer that he will cause inquiries to be made into the matters I have mentioned. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). ---Whilst the question of increased postal facilities is under consideration, I should like to direct the attention of Ministers to what I consider to be a still greater cause of complaint than anything yet mentioned. In the veiy crowded suburb of Erskineville, which forms part of my constituency, the residents have had a post office in their midst for many years, but the honourable now, for some reason which I am quite unable to understand, tlie department are going to close up the office, and it is proposed to substitute mere letterreceivingboxes. It seems to me that if we are going to conduct the Post and Telegraph department on these lines under federation we allow for a decrease in the receipts of the department. One reason given for the proposed change is, I believe, that there is a post and telegraph office at Newtown, which is little less than a mile away, and another post and telegraph office at Alexandra, which is a little over a mile distant, but that seems to me to afford no ground for removing the post and telegraph office from the midst of a thickly-populated suburb such as Erskineville. I desire to express my great gratification that the Treasurer has cut down the Estimates, and I can assure him that he has the great sympathy of honourable members on both sides of the Housei n his efforts at economy, arid that he will be fully supported in any stand he may take in that direction. I have been looking at the Defence Estimates, and it seems to me that there is a terrible crop",21,George Turner Bu T That Is A Ferred To A Position A Long Way Up The

These people in the back, country are quite cut off from the advantages of civilization, except by the communicating link of the Post-office. They were the most enthusiastic throughout the Commonwealth in favour of federation, and some of' them, when the Bill was submitted, travelled hundreds of miles in order to record their votes in favour of unity. But the very first intimation they get after the accomplishof federation, is a notification from, the Government threatening to remove their one link to civilization. The only public money ever spent on these people, so as to induce them to remain in those outlying districts, has been that devoted to the postal services, and I ask that, at any rate, during the operation of the bookkeeping, clauses, no alterations be made contrary to the wishes of: the States Governments. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Minister for Home Affairs) -On e or two expressions have been used on winch I think it is necessary I should say a few words. The honourable' member for Bourke drew attention to the provision of> postal' conveniences at Tarcoola, and I refer fco this because those matters are dealt; with mainly in the department of Home Affairs, which has the carrying out of"" all public works. In this particular case, I found; on m!uking inquiry, that a> promise had been made to provide the dfesired accommodation.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE We have honourable members attacking the Government for putting' too much money on the estimates, and other honourable members complaining that not enough provisionis made for necessary works. I unhesitatingly say that in every State the Federal Government feel bound to carry out these works It is to be hoped that pretty wellin the same ratio as in the past, especially in new mining centres, where 1 development is so necessary. But honourable members must not forget that we have not had time to ascertain exactly what is required in the various States. Mr Ki-RW-AN -Why should the Government do away with existing mail services 1 tlie case to which tlie honourable member refers; andsofar as I understand . the matter,, the Postal department will halve to give up the idea of running tliis and similar services on commercial lines. No railway would ever be built if it were expected to pay from the start, and the same remark applies to postal and telegraphic matters. These services are for tlie convenience of the public, and in no more than one or two o£ the States have they previously paid expenses. In regard to the Preston case,. I do not know the reason, though no doubt there is a rearson, why that work has not been proceeded with. Claims come into the department of Home Affairs, and in almost every case where the postal authorities recommend a work, the money necessary has been placed on the Estimates. But there are bundles of claims in regard to which the postal authorities do not recommend the construction of works, and honourable members, with tlieir past experience in the various States, must acknowledge that claims are sometimes made, on no very solid foundation, for the expenditure of large sums of money. If the Commonwealth is to husband its resources, and not bringdown, for the approval of the House, proposalsfor hurgo and undue-expenditure; we-must be careful not to carry out workswhich are not required in the interests) or for the convenience, of the public. |. place them in a difficulty.",23,George Turner Bu T That Is A Ferred To A Position A Long Way Up The

83,Sir Gboirgu Turner,"If we spend thecase of one work recommended, that the recommendation was sent in too late ? wealth Government has laid down the rule, and I think it is a good rule, that in regard to promises made by the States before the establishment of -the Commonwealth, the Government of the Commonwealth will carry out the works unless these have actually been commenced by the States. In every case where it was possible, I have had an investigation made, and if it appears to me that a work should be carried out, provision is made on the estimates. One honourable member has asked why the States should not be allowed to carry out these works. I may say I am making arrangements with the works department in the various States to, in some instances, borrow their officers to carry out works; but if we are to have a Federal control of expenditure, I , as head of the construction department in the Commonwealth, must know what moneys are being expended, and I shall certainly not give up my right to have that knowledge. Where works have been commenced by a State department, those works are being completed, but in other cases works will be carried out by the Federal Government, so that we may control the expenditure. The work referred to by the honourable member for Newcastle is one that I was veiy anxious to see carried out. The honourable member did not define exactly what the work was, but I suppose he meant the addition of a tower to the post-office in Newcastle. liament voted a sum of monej for a new r post-office in Newcastle, and we generally provide a clock in a tower reared in such a building. There is a very large population in Newcastle, and the post-office is a large structure. clock cost? clock out of the question, a tower would cost £10,000. The honourable member for Newcastle is quite right in referring to the matter, because I was a great mistake to erect the Newcastle Post-office without a tower, seeing that it is a large building of a national character. subscribe and erect a tower themselves. a city should not be required to erect part of a building which is to be transferred to the Commonwealth. In this particular case I do not know whether it was £18,000 or £28,000 that was voted by the State Parliament for the erection of the building. But there was a sum voted, and, though the building is a veiy fine one, it is spoiled by not having a tower such as should form part of a building of the kind. I believe that the sum required to complete the work without the tower is some £8,000 or £8,800 ; but when I made inquiry as to the reason why a tower was not to be built, I found that the plan on which the estimate was based, did not provide for aii addition of the kind. When I approached the Minister of AVorks in New South Wales in the matter, he pointed out that the work had proceeded so far that it would cost £2,000 to pull down a part in order to form a foundation for the tower, and that the latter would cost from £8,000 to £10,000. a tower ? Sir AVILLIAMLYNE If the building had to be commenced now, I should say there ought to be a tower. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN I s it proposed to have a statue of Mr O'Sullivan on top of the tower? Sir AVILLIAMLYNE I should say that Mr O'Sullivan had such a statue in the memory of the people of New South Wales, as not to require another on the top of a post-office. have a statue of Australia facing her creditors. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I am very proud of Mr O'Sullivan as my Minister of AVorks. I know that the honourable member for Newcastle and his constituents are very anxious in this matter, and I want to point out the reason why the work to which he has called attention has not been carried out. think it think that the addition to the post-office could have been carried out for about one-third of the sum estimated ?

Sir WILLIAM LYNE the plan was not properly drawn in the first instance. MrO ' MALLEY £10,000 on a clock-tower, and yet we cannot afford old-age pensions. £10,000 would not be spent on such a work in Tasmania. Sir WILLIAM LYNE £33,000 is to be spent on a post-office, with a tower, in Hobart. The honourable member for Parramatta referred to the difference between the status of the line-repairers in New South Wales and that of those in Victoria. Tliis matter was brought under my notice upon one occasion in New South Wales. No doubt there is a difference in the status of these two sets of men, who are performing precisely similar work. That is an anomaly which cannot be continued under the Federal Government. I have said that it will be rectified, and I repeat my statement. We cannot have one set of men doing precisely similar work to another set, and yet holding an inferior status. I am merely awaiting the passage of the Public Service Bill through the Senate to have this matter and a number of others put right. As soon as that measure is passed, I shall take the opportunitj' of appointing persons who are qualified to grade the whole of the service upon one system. levelling down ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE is one of levelling up, if that can be done, and I believe it can. But the honourable member must not forget that, in dealing with the whole of the service, regard must be paid to the amount of work which is done in the different States. In a very small State, for example, officials may not have to perform anything like the same amount of work that is required of officials occupying similar positions in the larger States. I do not know that the same salaries can be paid to officials in States where there is comparatively small responsibility and work as are paid to those where the responsibilities and work are heavy. Probably all grades will be placed upon the same footing where possible, but officials who have less responsibility and work than others who occupy similar positions in other States will have to be placed in a different grade. I am not going to level down. tween repairing a telegraph line in Victoria and repairing one in Queensland 1 It is proposed to spend Sir WILLIAM LYNE I am not speaking of matters of that sort. The telegraph line-repairers will all be placed upon the The sum of same level. Where officers are engaged in performing the same duties they must, if possible, be put upon the same footing. I think some Some honourable members have complained -and I notice similar complaints in the press-that certain public works are not being carried out. Only yesterday I was looking through the applications received from various States for works of this character. The applications from Victoria are very numerous, but they relate chiefly to small works, such as the repairing of buildings, ifec. Already a large number of works are being proceeded with in this State. From the other States the applications have not been so numerous. My desire is to arrange with the Public Works departments of the various States to lend us their officers to supervise any works which we may undertake, at least for a time. I shall make an arrangement for tlie payment of part of these officers' salaries until the works of the Commonwealth have been advanced to that stage when it will become imperative that we should bave a large department of our own. In the interim, however, so long as the department for Home Affairs can exercise the control necessary to safeguard the efficient carrying out of our public works, it is far My policy better to make an arrangement with the States which will not cost the Commonwealth much for supervision, than to appoint a big staff in each State. The staff which I have at present is ridiculously small for the amount of work that is being done. able gentleman intend to refer to the capital site 1 at heart about it .

I doubt if it is worthwhile insisting finally upon that, as there are other means of attaining the same end. clause 27, in which we proposed to omit the words ""seditious and blasphemous."" The word "" blasphemous "" has been given up by the Senate, but they desire to retain the word "" seditious."" to that. to agree to that amendment 1 to insist upon its amendment, it can do so, but I do not consider the matter of great importance. schedule of amendments, and as it is difficult to understand what the effect of an amendment is without having it before us in print, I suggest that we should wait until the schedule of amendments can be circulated amongst honourable members. with two or three exceptions, we might accept all the amendments of the Senate. If honourable members prefer to wait until the schedule is before them we can adopt that course. As I stated, in clause 27 the Senate propose to retain the word "" seditions."" The amendment in clause 78 is a purely verbal one, omitting the words ""which were"" and ""before the commencement of this Act,"" and inserting further ou iu the clause the words "" in force at the commencemeut of this Act."" The next amendment is in the new clause following . clause 88, which was inserted on the motion of the honourable member for Kennedy, to enable the Postmaster-General to take over any private telephone line at six months'notice. The Senate have accepted that provision, with the condition that the action shall be taken by the Postmaster-General with the consent of Parliament. is no objection to that. It is also proposed to insert the word ""acquired"" after the word "" erected,"" so that if the Postmaster General ever takes over a private telephone he shall have the right to maintain it . That, of course, is a necessary provision. The next amendment is in clause 92, giving power to officers to refuse to transmit objectionable messages, in which we have proposed to omit the words "" a person employed in a telegraph office,"" and insert ""postmaster."" The Senate now proposes in lieu of postmaster to insert"" person employed under the authority of the Postmaster-General."" In clause 93 we inserted The next amendment is in a new paragraph enabling the Governor General to make regulations providing for the payment by tlie receiver or by the Government of any State instead of the sender of tlie rate payable on any postal article. The Senate have now amended that so as to provide that the payment may be made by the Governor or by and other person instead of the sender, thus enabling business firms and friendly societies If the committee desires to make such arrangements as they may desire with the Postmaster-General regarding the transmission of postal articles. This will meet the views of the honourable member for Maranoa, at whose instance the paragraph was inserted. In tlie schedule of amendments made by this House to which the Senate have disagreed, the Senate object to the words in clause 3 extending the definition of "" in decent or obscene matter"" which were It seems to me that, inserted on the motion of the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Piesse. They consider that the words ""indecent or obscene matter "" are sufficient, and that they will cover all the indecent advertisements which it was the special desire of tlie honourable member for Tasmania to preclude from passing through the post. The next amendment to which exception is taken is the omission of the word "" through "" from clause 83. This clause relates to the carrying of telegraph wires through private buildings, and tlie word ""through"" was omitted, but the Senate urges that it should be allowed to stand, because in tunnelling it may be necessary to pass underground through a man's propei*ty or through a cellar, and because the expense of working an underground system of telegraphic and telephonic communication would be greatly and unnecessarily impeded if the There department were not permitted to carry",29,Tubner

This House limited that power by striking out the provision that 'the department should .have the right to lop off the branches of trees without giving any compensation. The object of this -was to require that the department should compensate the local bodies for any trees that were injured or -destroyed. The -Senate, however, adhere to the view that it is necessary, in the public interest, to give the department power to cut down and lop, and that it should be indemnified for any reasonable action taken to insure the proper working of telephone lines. The department consult the municipal authorities, and to meet their views as much as possible, but they are not to be called upon to pay damages. The last amend-ment to which objection is taken is the proposal to omit the words "" unlawfully or maliciously"" from clause 126, relating to injuries to telegraphs. The Senate urge that the importance of maintaining a telegraph system inviolate is so great that no person -interrupting communication by cutting or breaking wires or otherwise should be excused on the ground that he did not act unlawfully or maliciously.

Debate resumed (from 10th October, 1901, vide page 5955), on motion by Mr was fought entirely on this one quesThat the Bill be now read a second time. dressing the House with respect to this Bill, I wish to direct attention chiefly to the question whether we should grant the postponement that has been asked for, and refer The 'the matter to a (Royal commission in the .way suggested 'by the honourable member for Oxley. It seems to me that we should decide this matter now, once and for all, as I fail to see how any postponement .would be of any advantage -to those engaged in the sugar industry. The cry for an extension of time is simply a repetition of the demands that were made in 1-884, 1686, and in 1-889. raised. large vested interest in the sugar industiy, that interest -will not grow less in the future, and if ^vo cannot deal with it now, it will be more difficult to legislate regarding it in ten years' time. I am totally opposed to the proposal 'to remit the matter to a commission for further inquiry, because sufficient inforwill still ibe required 'to mation has been placed before honourable members to -enable them to come to a decision at once. Two commissions have inquired into this question, one in 1885, and another in 1889, and -the reports of both of them were simply directed to asking for more time. Any further inquiry at -this juncture would fail to enlighten us beyond the extent to which we have already been informed by the speeches made during this debate, and by the facts and .figures, derived from various reliable sources, which have been placed before us. It has been urged that we should be very careful in dealing with this question, because sugar growing is practically the national industry of Queensland, and our action is being protested against by the Queensland Government. If I thought that that Government, as at present constituted, represented the people of the whole of Queensland, -I should perhaps be prepared to attach some weight to their views. -But when we know that, under their State laws, a majority of the people of Queensland were not represented, and when we compare the result of the State election with the result of tlie Federal campaign, which tion-and when we consider that there have been returned a vast majority of honourable members from that 'Statei n favour of the abolition of Kanaka labourI am inclined to think that the Federal elections represent 'the voice of Queensland.

Some honourable members who have spoken in support of the continuance of Kanaka labour, have said that the Kanakas are well treated, and that the regulations are properly -carried out, and, further, that the Kanakas are harmless and peaceful citizens of the State. Buti f honourable members examine for .a moment the reports of the Royal commission, they will find that no fewer than .eight vessels were cruising with a view of obtaining Kanakas, and that in almost every case kidnapping obtained -to some extent, while, in the other cases, the islanders were deluded into entering the agreements. which was commenced in 188.9, and extracts from the reports were published in the newspapers of Australasia in 1892, when the final report of the Royal commission was presented. tory. ancient as the honourable member -would no doubt like to make it appeal , but even if it 1 occurred as far back as 1885, I do not think that the honourable member could convince the House that there has been such an improvement as to make it desirable .to have the traffic continued. been an improvement. been some improvement, but when I read an extract from one of the reports it will be found that there is any amount of room for further improvement. The first report stated :Our opinion is that all the the recruits brought by the Ceara on this voyage were seduced aboard by false pretences; that the nature of their engagements was never f ully explained to them ; that they had little or no comprehension of the kind of work they had to perform, and that the period for which they agreed to come was in no single instance three years. That is only one of the eight cases, and there is no suggestion of ancient history about that. every leading newspaper throughout Australia commented on this traffic, and even in England attention was drawn to the fact that slavery was being carried on in Australasia. Calli t what we like-smothe r it up as we like-thi s is what the American people called slavery many years ago. If that be a correct position to assume, I cannot understand, after the experience of Americai n dealing with black labour, how honourable members can stand up in the Eederal Parliament and justify the continuance of -such .a trade i u what is supposed to be a Christian country. in open market in America. the Kanakas were kidnapped in the islands, as the blacks wene kidnapped in Africa for the slave market in America. There may be a difference in the method, but the principle is exactly the same, and if it was slavery in the one instance, it is slavery in the other. We have spractically had .admissions on the floor of the House that the sugar industry cannot be carried on by white labour-that such work is the work of slaves. If that be so, T do not think there is any -need to argue the point further. Asi t presents itself to .me, it is a question of cheapness a question of labour, and nothing else. It is futile to tell a working man, who knows all about the subject, that it is harder for a white man to work in the cane-fields than to work in a railway cutting in -such a climate as that of Queensland. No work is harder in a tropical climate than that in a railway cutting, or anywhere else in railway construction. The carrying of huge iron rails in a -hot climate like that of QueensW e know there has land is much harder labour than I , .at least, 1 would care to perform, and the same may be said of shovel work in an open cutting, where there is no chance of getting any breeze. The white man has done .all the pioneer work in the tropical portions of Queensland. He went there when the climate and .general conditions were much worse than they are to-day and we know that as a country is opened up and railway communication and other agencies of civilisation are brought to bear, the work in such climates becomes easier. With other honourable members, I think that the Queensland people accepted federation believing A t that time, that a federal Parliament would pronounce on this question with -no uncertain voice. I believe that the majority of the people of Queensland accepted federation with the f u l l knowledge, or with the hope, that the Federal Parliament would once and for all abolish Kanaka labour.",31,Barton

It is only a question of degree. years would not be allowed. I would do away with the traffic at once; but I , and those who think with me, accept the five years limit, because it is the nearest possible 1 point to what we desire. be consistent, ought to vote against allowing five years. the five years' limit might result in prolonging the traffic for twenty years, and in placing the advocates of the traffic in a better position. diminished in the meantime. 1SS9 the supporters of the traffic asked for nine or ten years, and by this time they should have made preparation for doing without coloured labour. The time they then asked for has now expired, and we should be quite justified in stamping the traffic out at once. Asi t is, however, we propose to allow five years, with a diminution in the traffic as time goes on. The ablest minds in public life, not only in Queensland, but in all the States, have at one time or another spoken against the employment of aliens in this industry. Sir Henry Parkes spoke against it, and we have had other gentlemen, whose names have been mentioned, taking a similar course. But there is another phase of the question. AVouldi t be a fair thing, now that Inter-State free-trade has been established, to allow one State to employ coloured labour in competition with another State where only white labour is employed? In New South Wales most of the sugar is grown by white labour, and it would be totally unfair to the people engaged in the industiy in that Statei f their ports were thrown open to sugar grown by Kanaka labour, when all are subject to the same Tariff. New South Wales a lot of Hindoos are still It was the one great employed. Mr AV ATKINS -There are about 300 Kanakas and some Hindoos employed, but the Kanakas will come under this Bill, while the Hindoos will be dealt with by another measure. AVe. must not forget that we found it necessary in New South Wales, even under a free-trade Government, to levy a £ 3 duty on all sugar, because the majority of the people engaged in the industiy were white, and because we had to compete with If I had my way, five the black grown sugar of Queensland; and if it was necessary to impose a duty of that kind then, it is more necessary now that there is Inter-State free trade, and all Australian-grown sugar is placed on a level. No one can make me believe that those engaged in the sugar industiy of Queensland will under this Bill be in any worse condition than they are in at But to vote against the present time'. The Government propose a Tariff of £6 per ton, and give an advantage to those who employ white labour instead of Kanaka labour, and, with Interstate free-trade arid an extended market, traffic is being those engaged in the industry in Queensland will be more than compensated for any loss which they may sustain by the abolition of alien labour. But, apart from questions of trade or labour, the facts laid before us by the honourable member for Maranoa show that it is time the people of Australia dealt with this matter from a racial standpoint, and let the people of Queensland know that we are determined to no longer permit this black hlot on the Commonwealth map. I shall not weaiy members with quotation after quotation, but we have had it pointed out that at Cairns, when a petition was presented to the local council, with a view of abolishing Japanese brothels, which at that time were increasing very rapidly, the council, by its vote, declared in favour of their continuance, in order, as it was Said, to piotect white females. If there were only that example, together with the quotations laid before honourable members by the honourable member for Kennedy, there is disclosed a disgraceful state of affairs, which this Parliament should not tolerate for one moment longer than we can help. I do not think it is the desire of any honourable member here, on the threshold of our federal career, to continue this traffic in flesh and blood. AVe have had placed before us the",32,Barton

Irrespective of what may transpire during the next few weeks, it would be to tlie interests of Australia generally to grace the opening of our Federal Parliament by ridding at least one State of this traffic, which carries such dread consequences in its train. If we do that, and that alone, in the next few months, we shall have done a great deal. We shall have earned the thanks of many thousands of people, and we shall have told the world, once and for all, that we in Australia are not prepared, directly or indirectly, to countenance anything in the way of slave traffic. My only regret is that the Government have not tackled the whole alien question in the same firm way. has been familiar to a people for over 30 years is one the solution of which, I think, cannot be said to have been in any way hurried. As Australians, we have been for over a generation painfully familiar with the presence of the Kanaka on our soil, and through the whole of that time there has been one thread of constantly increasing determination that sooner or later this traffic must be ended. Speaking for myself, and as a representative more directly of the southern portion of Australia, I consider that the people of Queensland are entitled to hear from us the reasons why we have come to the conclusion at whioh I believe we have nearly all -arrived, and which, I trust, will very soon be put into statutory form. labour is, I fensible, and I have not been able to gather that any person dares, in view of his own conscience as well as of the great mass of public opinion, to defend thab traffic upon its own merits. I think that when we face the evidence before us-as we 17 n are bound to do-calmly , coolly, and considerately-as calmly, at any rate, as our sentiments as human beings will permit us for Maranoa, -w e are forced to the conclusion that we say that we must regard this cannot temporize with this evil any longer. I believe, with many of those who have preceded me, that by overwhelming numbers the people of Queensland are against the continuance of this traffic, but I should be sorry if even that portion of the Queensland community whose sentiments have been voiced fearlessly, courageously, honestly, and with considerable force by the honourable member for Oxley and tlie honourable and learned member for Brisbane, imagined for a moment that we are endeavouring to ride rough-shod over a veiy important industry regardless of consequences. I do not hide from myself that if I had my choice between suppressing the Kanaka traffic and putting an end to the sugar industiy, I should vote in favour of suppressing the Kanaka traffic. Happily we are not placed in any such position. I agree wibh the view expressed by the Prime Minister in his able, temperate, and logical speech, which abounded in information and argument, that we can-and will-preserv e the sugar industry, which is so important to Queensland and the whole continent and yet abolish the evils attendant upon the employment of Kanaka labour. By what means, then, are we to satisfy our compatriots in Queensland that we are not carried away by any sudden gust of passion or any momentary sentiment, but are guided by considerations of humanity and consideration even for the planters? The Prime Minister traced clearly and succinctly, down substantially to the year 1895, the progress of thought and the public expression of opinion on the part of Queenslanders in regard to this matter. We have been referred by some honourable members on the other side of the House to an alleged change of opinion on the part of some of Queensland's leaders, notably in the year 1892, when Sir Samuel Griffith, the then Premier and Chief Secretaiy, issued a manifesto and The maintenance of Kanaka altered tlie existing law. Anything that venture to say, indeSir Samuel Griffith says is in my opinion worthy of the greatest consideration. He is a man to whom all in Australia look with respect aud esteem. I have looked at his words, and have carefully read the debates which took place at that particular juncture, and I",33,Barton

I propose to make one or two very short extracts from it, because I think that not only should we state that we have arrived at our conclusion upon a consideration of the evidence, but we should also place upon record, so that it may be read by those who cannot hear us, what were the particular points of that evidence which appealed most strongly to our reason. I was very much struck by a letter, which no doubt other honourable members have reoeived in common with myself, and which was alluded to by the honourable member for Oxley yesterday. It was a letter from Mr Crespin, who is writing on behalf of the planters. In that letter an appeal is made for more time. By questions put to various honourable members, such as the honourable member for Wentworth, and the honourable and learned member for Brisbane, I endeavoured to ascertain what practical advantage would be derived by the planters if we gave them a further extension than that which is proposed in the Bill. I could get no answer. answer. heard it . It is a significant fact to my mind that no person can give an answer except that if the planters can only delay the final settlement of this question, a chapter of accidents may enable them to get a further postponement in the future. BeforeI close I shall point out, not merely that there is no positive advantage in delay, even to the planters, except the mere permission to carry on under present conditions, but that history affords us one remarkable example of the danger all round of acceding to any such request. If we consented to prolong the time-as is desired-w e should be making, a precedent and an admission which, in my judgment, are positively in opposition to the position whioh we are taking up to-day. If we concede tlie request that we should postpone the eradication of this evil for five or ten years, or any suggested period, what does it mean ? It means that we cannot at present carry on that industry with white labour. It is an admission that we cannot at the present time do. wibhout. Kanaka labour. The planters tliink that if they secure an extension of time they may find for Kanaka labour a substitution that is not white labour. Therefore they say, "" Let us have time, and see whether we can do it . "" I am not going to yield to' any such suggestion, because that would be an admission that we are not going-to put an end to this traffic in Kanakas until some other coloured or inferior labour can be substituted for it . If we adopt that course once, we may fairly be expected to adopt it again. In the letter from Mr Crespin, there is, perhaps inadvertently on the part of those who have published it , a singular piece of evidence that carries to my mind the whole point of the planters' contention, which is that they desire to carry on with Kanaka labour indefinitely. I shall read what is a very important passage, because the words it contains are those of the Hon. A. J. Thynne, who is quoted and relied upon by Mr Crespin. The passage reads as follows:In one of Mr Thynne's letters, in which he presents results inseparable from the abolition of Kanaka labour, hesay&^-""So far there are two alternatives; the substitution of other coloured labour, and the extinction of the industiy."" I wish to emphasize those words because Philp gives an the position which is really taken up-no t on the surface, but substantially and fundamentally-by the planters is, "" We shall have to give up the industry unless we are permitted to use inferior labour."" I think that ought to be distinctly understood to be the issue. Apart altogether from what I have said, if we were driven to face that issue, the evidence is overwhelming that we are not confronted with those alternatives at all. There is no reason, according to the evidence of witnesses who are relied upon.by the sugarplanters-evidenc e that is convincing"" enoughs-wh y we should not pass this Bill. My doubt' really ig as to whether we ought not to go further than this measure provides. I am satisfied to take the Bill, because it appears to meet with general assent. But I cannot see why we should not stop the importation of Kanaka labour at once. I am not satisfied with the Bill in my own mind as a matter of pure reasoning, but I see that, the sentiment animating the Government is that it is not altogether unfair to postpone the cessation of the traffic for two years, or until the 31st March, 1904, after which no more Kanaka labour-is to be introduced into Australia under any circumstances. That is a small period in the life of the continent,",34,Barton
150,Mr Sawers,Mr,35,Barton
151,Mr Isaacs,"What is it? I have notbut it is a definite one, and I am prepared to accede to it, especially as the Government have taken care to diminish the evil as we go along. What is the position with regard to this question ? The honourable member for Melbourne said that the crux of it was, ""Can this industry be carried on with white labour'?"" He appealed to the manifesto of Sir Samuel Griffith. In the first place the manifesto was published, as I understand, at a period when circumstances external to the sugar traffic, and circumstances which are, unfortunately, common to Australia, involving depression and severe commercial stricture, prevailed all round. For a temporary purpose, for a moment of urgency, the Government saw fit, in that particular crisis,, to relax the then existing Kanaka law. But the urgency of Queensland in 1892 is not the urgency of the Commonwealth in 1901, and the period that was then looked forward to by the Queensland Parliament has practically passed. Apart altogether from that consideration, if the matter came up in the Queensland Parliament, I do not see that the Queensland sugar planterscould rely with reason on the argument then used. A t page 8, volume 67, of the Queensland Hansard of 1892,1 find the manifesto set out at length. In that manifesto, Sir Samuel Griffith makes ing statement at the very moment, it wil)' be understood, when he was advo-^ eating and proposing to carry a Bill to relax the Kanaka labour lawI t has been proved that in Queensland cane can be grown by white labour. I am aware that this position is still disputed, but it is admitted by most of the more liberal-minded planterswith whom I have been in communication. That is convincing in my mind. A t a later stage Sir Samuel Griffith goes, on to say that there isa danger of the Kanaka coming into competition with white labourers in other occupations. These are most important statements to make in a manifesto of'this kind, statements which must force themselves upon our consideration. The debate upon the Bil l which he introduced, and which has since become law, was contributed to by many honourable members of note, the late Mr Salkeld amongst them, and I find the statement made that in many occupations the Kanaka labourers do come into actual competition with white men. BeforeI pass from this manifesto, I wish to emphasize what I call the third ground of 17 B 2 Sir Samuel Griffith's original objections to Kanaka labour. He did not abandon that ground in hismanifesto, nor has he ever done so. It is thatThe permanent existence of a large servile population amongst us, not admitted to the franchise, is not compatible with the continuance of our free political institutions. Speaking of this and other objections, he said in his manifesto"" I recognise the force of these reasons as fully as ever."" I trace in this manifesto the honest expression of a most profound conviction on the part of that great' Queensland statesman, that even at the moment when he felt the extraordinary circumstances of Queensland demanded extraordinary action, he was still, as ever, profoundly impressed with the necessity of making his proposed measure only a temporary one, and of taking strong steps at as early a date as possible to put an end to an acknowledged and a growing evil. In the course of the same debate, I find the strongest evidence of an unabated and engrossing conviction on the part of Queensland people, that this Kanaka traffic was a cancer which must be eradicated. How do I make that discovery ? We have had the overpowering weight of all thequotations which the Prime Minister has this clear and assurgiven us. They go as far as 1885, but in 1888 we have a document, not of a fleeting nature, not a mere statement made at a public meeting, which might be explained away, but an authoritative and considered expression of opinion, and a pledge, by Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, as to his views. That gentleman knew what he was talkingabout. In the letter which he wrote to the press on that occasion he pledged himself solemnly and publicly to a certain policy, and I think it ought to be placed on record in our Hansard. A t page 148, vol. 67, of the Queensland Hansard for 1892, Mr Glassey is reported' to have spoken as follows :Sir Thomas Mcllwraithwho, by the way, was a member of the Government at the time Opposition. was the Colonial Treasurer in Sir Samuel Griffith's Government. letter he was leading the Opposition at a general election.",35,Barton

Mr Glassey said :Sir Thomas Mcllwraith was most emphatic in his declaration on the subject of coloured labour. In the manifesto which lie issued to the electors of North Brisbane, to contradict the statements which had been made by the Chief Secretary, he said :Now comes the letter, and I think it speaks -.trumpet-tongued as to the honest opinion of -Queensland statesmen, when they felt themselves untrammelled by considerations of financial urgency of an extraordinary natureGrentlemeu,-With a view of showing you the absurdity of the statements made by my opponents I now pledge myself to the following if I am returned to power:-Not to allow tlie introduction of coolie or other coloured labour ; not to strong continuous stream all over Australia. allow the introduction of Chinese; not to pay the -survey fees of the Transcontinental Syndicate ; not to introduce or support a Transcontinental Railway Bill or scheme; to oppose a land tax ; to encourage local industries by protection. I am gentlemen, Your obedient servant, What does that letter show ? It shows not reasons why I think we should not, aud only that a prominent statesman -pledged they are fundamental reasons. It would himself, and his party, I apprehend, to amount toanadmission on our part that would oppose the introduction of any more coolie be converted into a precedent, and would or coloured labour-no t ten years ahead, but be used more forcibly than any arguimmediately-bu t it also shows that ment I have heard used at the present the public sentiment of Queensland was time. I have said that there is a precedent so that for support by giving the same pledge. Sir told that if the planters can only, by means Thomas Mcllwraith felt that the chances of of the progress of invention or by some unhimself and his party were being injured by expected event, secure a device for doing what he considered to be the inaccurate the work more cheaply than white labour statements of the leader of the opposing can do it , they will be ready to surrender party in saying that he was in favour of Kanaka labour. Every one familiar with the -coloured labour. posing party was Sir Samuel Griffith. there was practically a consensus of opinion on tlie part of the two competing parties in Queensland on this important subject. Mcllwraith made another statement on the same subject at the same time. time. duce it. believe that at the very moment he was giving this definite statement in writing, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith was saying something different. power, too. distinctly that we have one continuous stream of public expression of opinion on the part of Queenslanders in favour of the abolition, and apparently tlie immediate abolition, of coolie labour. But we must remember that at that time the Act of 1885 was in force, and everybody was looking forward to the termination of the traffic in 1890. In 1892, for the reasons that I have mentioned, what has been called the "" Kanaka bridge"" was built. That structure has given us a great deal of trouble, and I think it is time it was swept away by the current of public opinion that is flowing, undoubtedly, in one I have demonstrated to my own mind, and I hope to the satisfaction of honourable members, that, so far as the possibility of carrying on this work is concerned, it is an admitted fact. We are asked to postpone this legislation. I have already given some distinctly felt and understood in history the repetition of which in Ausboth parties were competing tralia I am very anxious to avoid. AVe are history of slavery in the United States knows perfectly well how one little invention accentuated the whole difficulty, and brought about a condition of things that led to enormous trouble at a time when it was thought the slave trade was going to die away. I am not alluding to the original compromise in the Constitution, which was considered to be necessary in order to achieve federation. We have no such excuse as America had, because we have not our Constitution without it .

It was thought, therefore, that slavery would die a natural death, but one day an inventive American devised the cotton gin. MrO ' MALLEY means of the cotton gin it was found that the negro slave could multiply his work infinitely, and it put cotton on the market to a much greater degree than before. That sent up the price of slaves at once, and made the evil more difficult of eradication than ever it was before. We do not know what the future has in store for us. We do not know how invention will turn. It may turn in a direction which will involve the extension of sugar-caneplanting in Queensland, and the use of these Kanakas, or their resultant product, in some way which will accentuate the evil, may extend vested interests in opposition to the principles of humanity, and put us in a worse position for dealing with the difficulty than we occupy at present. I propose that we should deal with this matter at once ; that we should not wait for a future time which may bring more difficulties than facilities for doing what is required. I can see no reason why any postponement should be granted. I cannot absolve our Australian people from blame in this matter. I think we are greatly to blame. There have been already, as it seems to me, three eras in the treatment of Kanaka labour. In the first era there was an open violation of the rights of the Kanaka by kidnapping. The Imperial Statute of IS72 (on its very forefront) has the charge perpetuated that it was by reason of the criminal offences committed upon the Pacific Islanders that that measure was passed. That was the first era. The next era was marked by the inconsiderate treatment of the Kanakas by the sugar planters, which resulted in an enormous number of deaths-6 6 per 1000 from 1885 to 1890. I get that evidence from the Queensland debates at page 173. It appears from the Registrar-General's returns that, from 1885 to 1890 inclusive, the number of islanders in the State each year, added together, made a total of 5,577. During the six years 3,689 of these men died, or at the rate of 66 per 1,000. That was leaving out of consideration the year during which there was a visitation of measles and the year before it, so that those were normal years. The third era is the present, during which the death-rate of the Kanakas, though very much less-les s than it was by more than 50 per cent -is still abnormally high. I find from the 1901 report of the immigration agent in connection with the Pacific Island immigration, presented It was Whitney. to tlie Queensland House of Parliament, and dated 4th June this year, that, independenly altogether of 940 labourers who returned to their homes during the year 1900, and who, no doubt, carried with them the seeds of disease and death, the mortality on this continent was extremely large. There were 9,324 labourers in the State, and of these 274 died. Now, if we say, roughly speaking, 5 so that we may calculate it mentally, that among 9,000 there were 270 deaths, that is equal to 30 per 1,000. The general mortality in Queensland, I find from "" Coghlan,"" page 258, is less than 13 per 1,000, and that includes, of course, the Chinese and other Asiatics. The normal mortality of Queensland, therefore, is less than that of Victoria, showing that Queensland is really a healthy countiy. Thus we find that 14 deaths per 1,000 among the Kanakas are' < due practically to the causes attendant upon the sugar-cane work. That is a tremendous mortality when we consider it in conjunction with the diseases from which the Kanakas may possibly recover, and the other troubles they have, and I think that if we have any regard for the welfare of these unfortunate beings these inferior beings who are dragged, so to speak, at the chariot wheels of our progress-w e ought, out of consideration for them alone, to abolish this traffic, and at the earliest moment possible. I am reminded by the honourable member for Darling Downs that if we take the percentage of deaths, and even assume that it has not recently been diminished, but has been at this reduced rate during the ten years since the re-organization of the laws, and bhat there have been 140 deaths per annum among these islanders occasioned by this traffic alone, we find thab, roughly speaking, 1,400 deaths lie at our doors. Tliis is an appalling result. When we are told by men whose words can be relied on, thab white labour can do this work, and when we see bhab bhe sugar industry is not retrogressing, bub is progressing, I cannob frame any reason in my own mind bhab would be satisfying to any humane conscience why we should delay as desired the definite, final, and, I hope, irrevocable solution of this monstrosity. Ib has been stabed that the",37,Thomas Mcilwraith
164,Mr Isaacs,"Yes ; E l i Whitney. Byplanters are entitled to notice, but what notice can t h e j have more than they have had for the last 40 years 1 Year after year they have had warnings, and Parliament after Parliament has legislated against them, and kindly and considerately, and fattoo generously in my opinion, has the path been graded for the disappearance of the Kanaka. I have had placed in my hands the words uttered by our late honored colleague, MrW -H. Groom, formerly then-ember for Darling Downs, who, in his speech in 18S9 in the Queensland Assembly, pointed out what was well understood, namely, that the abolition of the Kanaka was in contemplation at no distant date. He says I have found prevailing among a large section oE the inhabitants of the North the feeling that Kanaka labour is.merely a stop gap for coolies. : That shows that as far back as 1889 the planters understood perfectly well that the Kanaka had to .go. There is no indication that they have made any preparation for it, but there is this indication, that when they were free from tlie trammels of the law-I did not hesitate ,to steal away the islanders from their homes, regardless of tlie consequences, and the Imperial Government had to stigmatize such action as a crime, and furnish the Queensland authorities power to stop it. Then came the force of public opinion, unexpressed, but decidedly felt, which desist from their wholly inconsiderate treatment of the Kanakas, which led to the mortality of 66 per 1,000, so that the death rate to-day, although abnormal, .is marveb lously smaller. Now, the time has come when public opinion must be -formulated in -the direction in which it has been expressed articulately at the polls, .not only in Queensland, but in all the other States, that the Kanaka trade must definitely be put an end to. I do not hesitate to say that this traffic is a reproach to us at the present moment, and I should be wanting in my duty if I did not express myself as I have done, and if I did not do all in my power-to wipe out this blot as soon as possible. I can.give no-ear whatever to.the direct proposal for delay, nor to the other-proposal for delay which takes tlie shape of the appointment"" of a commission or a select committee. think that the matter is perfectly plain to all the people of all the and I believe passed this Bill, and carried it stringently Mr Isaacs. into operation, we shall have simply done our duty. Now, with regard to the measure itself, it is proposed that after the 31st March, 1904, no Pacific Island labourer shall enter any part of Australia. The Queensland Acts, as explained by the Prime Minister, are to be left in f u l l operation, except so far as they are controlled and restricted by this measure. The responsibility of the limited administration which will be left to them, will lie upon the Queensland authorities, and what we say is that in the meantime, from the moment this Bill is passed until the 31st March, 1904, no Pacific Islander shall enter Australia except under licence. That licence is to be granted by the Queensland Government, but they are not to have power to issue licences at their own sweet will, and are to be restricted by the diminishing provisions of the Bill. Therefore, it seems to me that the termination of this business is very nearly at hand. They may bring in these islanders until the 31st March, 1904, but no licences are to be granted after the 31stdo not say the present men-they December, 1903, which is to be the final point of permission, and unless the planters make three years' agreements fronrthat time they will not be able to keep the men as long as 1906. There is no necessity to make with out the agreements for one year, but there is an almost .absolute necessity from the point of view of the planter to make the compelled the planters -to agreements for more than one year. Therefore the argument that has been used in connection with the limitation of 'the period of the agreement to one year is divested of all reason. Clause8 is one of the most important in the Bill. We know that under the terms of the Constitution, after the imposition of uniform duties, the intercourse between the States with regard to persons as well as goods is to be absolutely free, and I welcome the provision that is sought to be made by tlie Government in clause 8 against the danger that would otherwise exist in regard to the rest of the States. After the imposition by law-no t merely by the proposal of the Tariff that we have before us, but by Act-of the uniform duties, in the absence of any other provisions, these islanders would, under the provisions of the Constitution, be at I liberty to wander all over Australia But by sub-section (26) of section States, 51 of the Constitution, -power is that when we have given to legislate for any race as to which we desire to make special provision. I have been anxious on this matter, and the Attorney-General has been good enough to permit me to GOnsult him on the subject. I believe that clause 8 will, upon the whole, render impossible such a disaster as permitting those coloured aliens to wander at liberty over the length and breadth of Australia. 1906, Pacific Island labourers, supposing all other conditions are complied with, may be lawfidly employed in Queensland, under labour agreement, but they are not allowed, up to that date, to wander about, even in Queensland, nor to be there, unless they are actually employed under agreement. Kanaka is not to be let loose to roam about and come into competition wibh white men, even in Queensland, and certainly not in the rest of Australia; nor is he permitted to. remain in Australia, up to the 31st December, 1906, unless actually emploj'ed under a Pacific Island agreement. Sub-clause (2) provides that practicalb/ under no circumstances after ""that date is a Pacific Tslander to be allowed to continue in Australia. There may be some question as to the form which thab provision has taken, but, on the whole, I commend the Government none the less'foi"" that provision than for the obher provisions of the Bill. have foreseen, and, on bhe whole, practically provided against, what would obherwise be a greab danger bo us all.

I can tell those honourable members who advocate the continuance of the traffic, that I have stood up in the streets of Mackay itself, and for two or three hours held forth against the Kanaka traffic. There the toast of the day used to be ""Down with Griffith,"" because he attempted to abolish the traffic. But shortly after Sir Samuel Griffith made that attempt, I stood up in the streets of Mackay, and in the presence of hundreds of the people who are most affected, I spoke on this subject, and my remarks were received as heartily there as they were in the southern parts of the State. honourable member for Brisbane soiight to impress on the House'that he was returned for an electorate which comprises constituencies represented by labour members in the local Parliament. tion to that, I want to point out that the electorate I represent returned nine members to the Parliament of Queensland, and every one of these is supporting the Philp Government to-day.

I have seen them engaged in the work in Northern Queensland, and I have seen them buried there without any more ceremony than is observed in burying a dog. I know of what I am speaking just as much as does the honourable member for Brisbane. As to these Kanakas being harmless and docile creabures, I would like to read a lebber I have received from a genbleman who was an eye witness of bhe scenes he describes. I wrote to him for this information, knowing bhab he had been presenb, and bhis is whab he senb bo meThe In June 1884, at the annual race meeting held in Mackay, between 7th and 14th of that month, a fight between Kanakas and whites occurred. In reply to your first queiy, I saw the first missle thrown by a Kanaka, who had been refused a drink by one of the barman at the booth ; then a In contradistincfusilade of bottles came out of tlie adjacent canefield. Two or three whites got scalp wounds, and were foolish enough to stand and throw the bottles back at the Kanakas. After about ten minutes of this kind of work, the whole of the whites, both on foot and horse-back, madeouton to the open course, and the Kanakas followed them; and as soon as the blacks were on the open, the whites charged them, the horsemen using their and the Philp Governstirrup irons or riding whips, and a large have a majority. Yet when number of Kanakas were left lying all about the were course wounded; their brains were oozing out of their heads, anil with each dying breath they vomited blood. Leaving that scene, I followed the whites as they broke into Raymond's padAustralia. dock, and there was a large number of Kanakas lying bruised and bleeding amongst the cane, whilst the owner was veiy near frantic at bhe way the cane was being knocked down. From there I made my way towards Raymond's house, of Darling Downs, which and there were a couple of white men who had Queensland, followed a Kanaka into the house and pulled him out, and gave him a good hiding, he having Parliament thrown a missile at a woman riding along the road. The owner took the names of the two , supporters. whites, and they were afterwards summoned and imprisoned for breaking into Raymond's house. Two supposed ringleaders of the Kanakas were also arrested, and they were tried and sent for Darling Downs to goal for a couple of months. What led to the fight ? For some time previous bo the races, There can be no question as to the Tanna boys had resolved amongst themselves bhab they were as good as bhe white men, and they determined to test the question at bhe races, viz., bhey would have grog the same as All that the supporters of the the whibes, and, when refused, bhe fun began.

Was there any inquiry ?-No, nob to my knowledge. Everything was. hushed up, I can remember when the except that the Governmenb organ, the Mercury, Said that three Kanakas.had been killed, so far as fchey had been officialiy:irifermed"" The then member for the district, and Minister of Lands, H. Black, f ren, for safety. I have sent you this very hurried description, and hope you will pardon the erratic way it is written, but if necessary will give you further particulars after the recess. That description is furnished by an eyewitness who, from his pugnacity, I know must have taken a pretty active part in the fight. Speaking further of the docility of the Kanaka, I should like to refer honourable members to the number of undiscovered murders and other crimes which have occurred in Northern Queensland. Up to 1896 no fewer than seventeen murders had been committed, the perpetrators of which had not been traced. inference drawn from this fact is that the Kanakas, who resemble each other very closely, rush out of the cane-fields and commit outrages, the authors of which it is thus impossible to trace. Despite all attempts to Christianize him the Kanaka is still a savage. We cannot eradicate his savage instincts in one or two generations. I have in my mind a Kanaka whom I have known for over 30 years. He is a member of the Salvation Army and beats the drum. He stands in the streets and exhorts the white people to repentance, and thinks that he is better thau the Europeans. But he is a savage none the less. During the course of this debate the reason has been given why the white people permit certain low classes of women to inhabit the towns in which these Kanakas are congregated. I have not been sparing in my denunciation of the Chinese quarters of Melbourne and Sydney, but there are canker spots in Queensland just as there are elsewhere. Where the Kanakas are brought here without tlieir women we may depend upon it that there will be a degree of immoralitv which we in our civilization do not desire to see perpetuated in Australia. Some honourable members have asked for an extension of the period during which the planters shall be able to employ Kanakas, in order that the planters may have an opportunity of accommodating themselves to the new set of circumstances. I admired much of that was said the other day by the honourable member for Wentworth. But he pleads for time. I should like to ask that honourable member, as well as the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Oxley, whether, if they saw one of their loved ones suffering from a cancer, ot on the top of the booth, with his two chilthey would delay the surgical operation which would be necessary to cut the cancer away 1 Certainly not! They would permit the operation to be performed, and afterwards by tender nursing would endeavour to heal the wound which the knife had made. That is what the Government propose to do. Thej' desire to cut away tliis cancerous growth from the sugar industiy, and afterwards, by offering practically a bonus for sugar grown by white labour, they hope to heal the wound which has been made. They have no desire to kill the sugar industiy, but merelj' wish to get rid of an evil which threatens the life of the Commonwealth. I am proud that I gave I cannot say. The a vote the other night in support of a Government which I know to be earnest in its endeavour to bring about a white Australia. I am not a bit ashamed of that vote. The evils regarding tlie recruiting traffic have alreadj been referred to. SomeT honourable members saj'"" Let us continue the recruiting for five years "" ; others plead for an extension to seven j'ears; and others again favour limiting the period to ten years. I am pleased to admit that the evils of recruiting have been very much diminished of late years. But thej have not been entirely r abolished, nor can they be. Where many men-som e of them utterly unscrupulousare out upon the ocean plying a trade which brings them gain, we cannot keep them all honest. We may send inspectors to the islands, but we cannot alwaj-s get honest inspectors. I have in my hand a letter from a man who has been on the "" black-birders."" He writesLooking at this question honestly in the face, one can only come to the conclusion that greed and selfishness are at the bottom of the matter. The author of this letter is now resident in a sugar district in Southern Queensland. He continuesI have the journal of a gentleman who was three years sailing amongst the South Sea Islands. He was on a religious mission, and he had time to make obsei-vations at each island he visited. There was food everywhere in abundance, and, as the weather is nearly always warm, clothes are very little used. The natives require to labour very little. Fishing, or the planting of a few yams, is about all the work they do. Those wbo come to Queensland may make a little money, but it is of little use in the islands, so that when about to return they generally expend it in clothes and knicknucks for their friends and relations. The question naturally arises, "" If the",40,Thomas Mcilwraith
167,Mr Deakin,Ove r how long a period 1,42,Thomas Mcilwraith
168,Mr Wilkinson,"islanders have all they require in their own islands, why do they come to Queensland ?"" Is it to improve their position-to take home money with which to buy land and houses ? The thing is absurd. The schooners engaged infchisblackbirdiug carry men who are called recruiters. They make arrangements with the chief for so many men or women, and, of course, the chiefs have to get presents. This a recruiter, is a bit lavish over it when he is aure of a good number. Then the relations have to be provided with presents, and, of course, all the grand tilings which the islanders are to get when they arrive in Queensland are not forgotten, but, of course, the hoe and cane-fields are not mentioned. But, to satisfy those who are not engaged in growing cane in Queensland by Kanaka labour, tbe Queensland Government step in aud say that all vessels engaged in this business must carry a Government agent. Simply a farce ! He is supposed to explain to the islanders what they are coming or being brought to Queensland for, and the wages thej' are to get, &c. Now, the cost of keeping one of these vessels at sea is from £70 to £90 per month, according to size, &o. and no time must be wasted in getting a full slup; and if the Government agent is in the way there is one way he can be got rid of. The golden key can open a door when others fail, and I suppose human nature is the same on the high seas as on land. Then, as I told you in a previous letter, there are many Kanakas in this State, wbo, when tbey left their island homes, did not know what part of tlie world, they were being brought to. The old plan was to heave the schooner to, well off the land, get the islanders to come on board for trade, &c.,. throw pig iron into the canoe and sink it, and moke all sail away with all those ou board. We know that that was the practice in the old times. Proceeding, the writer saj's :We have islanders here who were brought to this country against their will, when the3' were quite young lads. They have no wish to return, and if they were sent oufcof the country it would be as great a hardship to them as it was when they were first brought here. I have eveiy faith in the author of these statements. Kanaka traffic is viewed, it is one that Australia should endeavour to get rid of at the earliest possible moment. ing, I wish to saj' a word or two in regard to the allegation that it is impossible for white men to do the work which is now being performed by Kanakas. 'I have been the .guest of a number of Melbourne manufacturers since my arrival in Victoria. deed, I have only failed to avail myself of one invitation which was forwarded to me. I visited the Colonial Sugar Refinery works, and 'there saw men working under worse conditions than prevail in an ill-ventilated coal -mine. I saw men working there-attired in loin clothes. The atmosphere was not merelj' onlj' warm but humid. Mr Wilkinson. seen men in the cane-fields of Queensland working under such conditions. Yet we are told that while white men can perform that sort of work, thej' cannot work in the cane fields. Buti t is merely a matter of paj'ing a proper wage, and the men will be forthcoming to do the work. Malarial fever, too, is held up as a sort of scarecrow. I remember when malaria was just as/rampant about Moreton.Baj' as it is to-day around the Johnston River. I remember when nry father used to suffer from thatf ever, but to-day he is still alive and can walk out hand in hand with his great grandchildren. Four generations have lived there, although it was said at the period I refer to that white men could not people that district. Honourable members are aware that in the early history of the Botany Bay settlement, it was said that white 'men could not thrive there. The settlement was upon the verge of famine on two or three occasions, notwithstanding the fact that it had the rich virgin soil of a continent at its back. It was simply because tlie people' did not t ry to avail themselves of the advantages which nature had placed at their disposal that they were reduced to such dire extremity. Soi t is with the planters of Queensland to-day. So long as humanity is cheaper than machineiy, humanity will be used. So long as human beings can be procured at a cheaper rate than machinery, theplanters will not bother-about-machinery. Necessity is the mother-of invention. Jf we -create the necessitjvthe.machinery will come all the quicker. I am perfectly satisfied-as was pointed out by tlie honourable and learned member for Indi-.that just as the cotton gin was introduced in America, so some machine will be invented for the From -whatever standpoint tlie far-ashing of Gane if that trashing be necessary. I know that in the Southern 'States of America, a machine revolving at a very Before concludhigh rate of speed brushes the cotton. If dry leaf gets into the cotton, there is a machine in use that will -separate it from the cotton. Surely that is a much more difficult operation than the trashing of cane in the canefields. Thepeopleof Australia have declared In-and no part -of this continent has done -so more -emphatically than Queenslandthat the 'Commonwealth shall 'be white. In order that no one shall suffer, the ipeople have willingly said that if it costs more to produce sugar by white labour thej r are prepared to paj' more for it . The proposals of the Government are eminently 1 have never fair. In addition to the duty to be imposed on' sugar corning into the Commonwealth, they propose to offer a bonus of £ 2 per ton to those who employ white labour in the industry as against that from the Polynesian Islands, India, China, Japan, and Java. I do not know that I would be justified at this late hour in falsing up the time of the House further, but I should like to thank those honourable members, who representconstituencies other than electorates in the State of Queensland, for their advocacy of this measure and their support of the policy of a white Australia. The people of Queensland realize, perhaps more than those of any other State, what the cry means, and I refuse to believe that there is any part of my native country which cannot be peopled aud populated by men as good as those who occupy the more temperate portions of the continent. I have travelled from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Wilson's Promontory, but I have not yet seen any part of Australia where the white man could not accommodate himself to the circumstances and surroundings in which he has to work. I have seen white men working on the arid plains of the west, in the jungles along the coast, and in the tropics, and as far as my observation goes thej'have not degenerated. The honourable member for Kooyong says that the men who do this work may be able to stand it themselves, but that their children will show signs of race deterioration. We can .go to these places, however, and see, the children of the second and third generation showing no signs of deterioration. about the third generation ? gentleman as an authority against my own observations. of the second or third generation ? I am not big physically, but I am one of a family of fifteen, several members of which are over sbc feet high; and we are all Queensland natives. There is no reason, so far as I can see, why white people should degenerate if they only take care of themselves, and work under proper conditions. It has been pointed out that the hardest work of the cane-fields is done in the coolest months of tlie year men are not deteriorating. instead of working in the heat of the day, those engaged-in the industry were to adopt the system in force in some parts of Europe, and work in the cool of the morning and the evening, they would avoid the great heat which is supposed to be ""the chief objection to the employment of white men in these localities. Having regard to the assistance which it is going to receive from the Commonwealth Parliament, there is no reason whatever why this industiy should be destroyed because of the abolition of Kanaka labour. I am sure we are going to give it that assistance, and that the industiy will survive the passing of this measure. There is no country which does not possess some territory which cannot be utilized. I have no desire to see the sugar industry of Queensland injured, but, if it came to be a question between its abolition and its perpetuation at the cost of a white Australia, I should say-""Awaj' with the industiy, even if it represents seventy millions instead of seven millions of capital."" Eveiy country has its deserts, its mountain ranges, and its swamps, and if any portion of Queensland territoiy is found to be unfit for occupation by white races let it remain as it is. That is tlie position I take up, for the poet's lines are as true to-day as when they were written111 fares the land, to hastening ills a prey, Where wealth, accumulates, and men decay. If we admit races to our country which will contaminate the blood that has peopled the world, which has come forth from the northern parts of Europe, and'from Great Britain particularly, to cultivate and gladden the waste places of the earth-if we allow any I do not take that deterioration in that blood-then , I say that, even though wealth maj' accumulate, our race may well decay.

The paragraph deals with newspaper suprjlements, and was debated by us at great length. As honourable members will recollect, the question relates entirely to tlie letterpress of these supplements, and the provision, as finally modified by us, was that the letterpress should be set up within the Commonwealth. Jn view of the importance of the discussion here, I think we should ask the Senate to reconsider its decision. respect, I should like to ask the Attorney General how often he is able to change his mind in a day ?

I did not understand him to say that we should accept this amendment. MrM AHON -The Attorney-General distinctly referred to the honourable member for Bourke, who, it will be remembered, moved this amendment to the clause when it was originally before us. He said the honourable member would have no objection to forego this amendment now, and he indicated, so far as it was possible to do so, without committing himself absolutely, that the Government did not intend to ask the committee to dissent from the action of the Senatei n this matter. committee was prepared to take the whole of the amendments without criticism, and adopt them, I should offer no objection, but not otherwise. appears to be willing to swallow anything, and he thinks the committee has an equally capacious windpipe. I am certainly not going to let this matter pass without a protest. I disagreed with the Government proposal before, as a protectionist dodge. After three or four weeks' consideration, I repeat that this is a protectionist dodge, which will do the Government no good, nor I think, as we are to will it help the parties concerned. The Attorney-General is always willing apparently to do everything he possibly can to impose some little protection on the unfortunate people of this Commonwealth. When this matter was being debated by us on a former occasion he actually consented to an amendment, suggested by the honourable member for Bland, that supplements printed from matrices set up by linotype should not be deemed a supplement to a newspaper for the purposes of this measure. It is a difficult matter to explain to honourable members who do not understand the technique of the printing trade, but when I pointed out that we do not print from matrices, but from the stereotyped plates cast from them, the proposal was reluctantly withdrawn. I hope honourable members will coincide with the amendment made by the Senate. I shall divide the committee on this question, if necessary, for I think we ought to have No . a little respect for the mature judgment of legislators in another place. against tlie honourable member. something to them.

If it could have been foreseen that the honourable member was to be elected for Melbourne Ports, what a splendid sarcasm that mail must have possessed who named' that electorate, for it is now represented by an honourable member who does not want a port. He thinks apparently that a harbour is one of the mistakes of Providence, and would erect a barrier across every port in Australia. I hope the committee will see fit to respect the judgment of the Senate, who have conceded many things to us, and have shown a very good spirit towards this branch of the Legislature. Government may give way on this point, as a little later on we shall have an opportunity of dealing with the subject of blasphemy, and we may then reasonably ask the Senate to agree with us. standing the statements of the honourable member for Coolgardie, who seems to always become very much irritated at the mere mention of protection, I hope tlie Government will stand by the former decision of this committee. I do not see that there is any force in the argument that we should give way to the Senate. . I hope the Government will not insist upon any amended by the Senate. When this matter was discussed in the committee previously, the question of free-trade and protection was unnecessarily raised by the not right to introduce an amendment importing the fiscal issue into a purely machinery Bill of this sort. The Attorney General led honourable members to believe that he would accede to the Senate's amendment upon our amendment, and many the chamber believing that no difficulty would be raised in regard to it .
