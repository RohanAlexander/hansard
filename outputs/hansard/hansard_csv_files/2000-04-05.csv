205,Intellectual Disabilities And Acquired Brain Mr Mcgauran To Present A Bill For An Act,"Wednesday, 5 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15345 Wednesday, 5 April 2000 ----Social Security: Welfare Benefits to the social security system highlighted in the recent welfare reform report released by the Minister for Family and Community Services, Jocelyn Newman. This report has generated considerable interest in my electorate and, one would imagine, in everyone else’s electorate as well. I want to place on record part of a letter written to me by Phil Nichol of Lymington who, on hearing the minister’s comments on Radio National, wrote to me as follows: Anyway my feelings and those of others I know were one of optimism and I would hazard a guess that many people who feel left out of the prosperity of this present society felt good about what they heard. Most people receiving benefits and even low income earners hope others in society want to share in mutual obligation and social cohesion. Most recipients of benefits, no matter what type, I am sure would welcome organized community involvement but NOT if it is portrayed in a negative fashion, if there is stigma attached to the work, if it is seen in any way like a punitive measure, if there is resentment in the air and if it is not flexible and chosen in some way by the participant. Many people on benefits live busy exciting useful lives even with small amounts of cash. If people on small incomes pay little tax that will also be rectified after July when benefit recipients too will be GST taxed. Senator Newman on 29/3/00 indicated that Centrelink in the past has portrayed an abrupt noninclusive type of front. The new Centrelink would be different. Personally I have always found individuals in Centrelink very nice-its what the people working there have been asked to carry out. To my thinking her comments the next day ... seemed to backtrack from the 29/3/00. The whole feeling of trust, fellowship and furtherance seemed now to be at odds with comments the previous day. She seemed political and divisive. Imagine thinking low income earners would be glad that those receiving benefits would be obliged to do their dues. Why did she pick LOW INCOME EARNERS? Why not the rich, say those on $1 million a year, would those people also not feel glad of mutual obligation? This welfare reform must: have no stigma of a negative kind attached to benefit recipients; have no negative stigma attached to the type of work they do; they, mutual obligers, should not be ‘told’ what to do but should in agreement with a broad selection of community members choose the work they do for the benefit of all; it must be flexible. N.B. Benefit recipients might even be able to do or help with some of the work low income earners do then we can all be friends together bettering our communities. Regional Forest Agreements: Victoria west RFA outcome in Victoria. The Victorian timber industry can now get on with the job of attracting new investment and value adding. There were a number of important aspects in these RFA negotiations. Firstly, there will be no net job losses as a result of the final two RFAs in Victoria. I am very pleased that we are going to achieve that. The Commonwealth and state governments together are providing a package of $42.6 million under the Commonwealth-Victorian Hardwood Timber Industry Development Restructuring Program to help businesses take advantage of RFA certainty and adjust to changes in resource availability.

The program also provides a safety net for businesses and workers. This brings the available cash under lion from the state of Victoria. A further $20 million is committed by the Victorian government to silviculture and plantation initiatives, improved inventories and tourism development. The resource reductions that were part of the RFA will be phased in over two years which will help the value-adding projects get off the ground. The conservation outcomes are also outstanding in Victoria. More than half of the total public land across all five RFA regions is now protected in the comprehensive adequate and representative-CARreserve system. Overall in Victoria, 68 per cent of all old-growth forest in the five RFA regions are in reserves. In west Victoria the RFA adds about 194,000 hectares to existing reserves. This brings the total CAR reserve amount to 633,000 hectares, which means that 65 per cent of the region’s public land is now set aside for conservation. Significant additions to reserves include the Pyrete Range in the Wombat State Forest, which is added to the Lerderderg State Park, and Tallageira, which becomes a nature conservation reserve. I would like to pay significant tribute to both Minister Tuckey and Minister Garbutt in Victoria, who I think had very sensible discussions in relation to a very difficult issue. Also, there has always been a strong relationship between Minister Tuckey and the union movement in Victoria, who have worked very hard to protect the interests of their workers in conjunction with both the federal and state governments. In the 30 seconds remaining to me, I would like to talk about the behaviour of the Department of Natural Resources in Victoria. The difficulty with this RFA was very much to do with a significantly reduced sustainable yield figure which was brought out late last year. Everyone involved in the industry had been relying on the figures of the state department. This is not a political comment; it is a comment about the state department, which had been telling us that all was well and then it turned out that it was not. This has caused enormous difficulties. (Time expired) Swan Electorate: Road Safety Initiative tiative that is operating in my electorate of Swan which targets primary school students. This initiative was started last year because we felt that young people returning to school needed to be made fully aware of road safety issues. We needed to look at issues such as how they could safely ride their bikes, skateboards and rollerblades. If they were having to cross streets on their way to school, we needed to make sure that they could do so safely, without being hit by vehicles. We looked at implementing a road safety competition. We involved local primary schools. We approached the principals and asked for their support and we found that that support was quite overwhelming. We talked to parent groups and found that they believed there was a real need to teach young people about road safety issues. Of course, we talked to the young people themselves and asked them what they believed would be a good way of getting them to become aware of road safety issues. We also approached an organisation called Constable Care. Constable Care in Western Australia is a child safety program. They run a whole raft of programs dealing with the whole issue of child safety-stranger danger issues, road safety and a whole raft of activities aimed at ensuring that children are protected. When we came up with the competition we thought we would need to have two groups of primary school students, so we looked at grades 1 to 4 and decided that we would introduce a drawing competition for them, whereby they would have to do a drawing on road safety and include a number of different points-which I will cover later.

We asked the representatives from Constable Care to judge all the entries. We asked the young people to look, in their drawings and essays, at the issues of children wearing bicycle helmets, children on skateboards et cetera, wearing protective pads, and children using the term ‘stop, look and listen’ when crossing the road in order to ensure their safety. We asked them to illustrate crosswalk attendants in their drawings to show that they knew that the crosswalk was where they needed to go to cross the road on their way to school. We also asked them to mention or include a picture of Constable Care and to mention their school so that we could promote the activities of the school in supporting parents. I am pleased to say that we have received hundreds of entries. The program has been extremely successful. I commend the program to the House. If any member would like some more information on what we have done, I will be pleased to provide it. Aged Care: Riverside Nursing Home the member for Isaacs, Mr Wilton, in the House yesterday, particularly in relation to the Riverside Nursing Home and the Minister for Aged Care, Mrs Bronwyn Bishop. I would like to quote from an article in the Australian of 18 March 2000 by Amanda Hodge. She quotes the St Vincent’s aged care chief executive, Kerrie Cross. The article stated that initially: Relatives feared that moving Melbourne’s Riverside Nursing Home residents would kill them. But just 10 days after the move, nursing staff say the improvement shown by some of them is so remarkable they are comparing it to the restoration of the senses depicted in the Robert De Niro movie Awakenings. Kerrie Cross stated: ‘What we found is most of them were either overmedicated or receiving inappropriate medication ... We did expect residents to improve once they settled down, but we’ve seen some remarkable transformations in the health and well-being of residents, and relatives have commented on that.’ From all that Ms Cross has already seen, there is no doubt in her mind that despite the initial trauma it caused, federal Aged Care Minister Bronwyn Bishop did the right thing by revoking the Riverside proprietors’ licence. Joe West, 64, is equally convinced. Eighteen months ago he entered Riverside to help mend a broken hip and in that time he developed such horrific foot ulcers, ‘the size of CDs’, that he could barely walk. Now on the mend and one of only a few residents not suffering some degree of dementia, he regularly takes himself down in the lifts of St Vincent’s for a cigarette and some sunshine. Like many of the former Riverside residents, Joe has no idea where he will go from here. All he knows is, even if the Riverside proprietors do have their licence reinstated, he never wants to go back. And for the benefit of those opposite I would like to repeat the fact that all he knows is that even if the Riverside proprietors do have their licences reinstated, he never wants to go back. For the benefit of the member for Isaacs, I believe a few facts need to be incorporated into Hansard. The government’s aged care reforms are designed to improve the quality of care and the vast majority of the ‘good’ facilities are getting on with the business of providing high quality care and services. The poor performers are now under scrutiny and the media are highlighting this fact. This is a sign that the system of ensuring quality care in residential facilities is working. It is not simply a matter of closing a home. We must protect the health and well-being of the very frail people in the home and, if one is closed, find suitable accommodation elsewhere. It is only with the most careful consideration and planning that we would move residents. (Time expired)",130,Representatives Main Committee
210,Mrs Draper (Makin),"I would like to take this opportunity to refute comments made by15348 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 5 April 2000 Veterans: Far East Strategic Reserve of the House, I have pointed out to the government the injustices that arise from anomalies in terms of eligibility for some categories of repatriation benefits for Australian former servicemen who served in various theatres throughout South-East Asia over the last 40 years or so, most specifically naval personnel associated with the Far East Strategic Reserve during the Emergency in what was then Malaya in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Several years ago, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs did provide some limited relief to these veterans in terms of repatriation benefits. However, he failed at that stage to rectify the most substantial anomaly, which was denying the former RAN personnel access to service pensions which Army and RAAF personnel from the same theatre are entitled to. Really, the only justification that was ever offered for failing to correct that anomaly was a lot of legalistic mumbo jumbo that seemed to come out of the bureaucracy. Last year, in May 1999, the minister announced a review of these matters and appointed Major General Mohr and Rear Admiral Kennedy to carry out a review of anomalies in respect of South-East Asian service. I will read a couple of paragraphs of that review. The key aspect is the recommendation that is now before the government: It is recommended that such anomalyThat is, the anomaly in respect of service pensionshould be removed by placing naval seagoing personnel serving with FESR in the period 01 July 1955 to 31 July 1960 on the same basis as other members of FESR and in particular, to grant them qualifying service so that they will be eligible for the Service pension. The review makes the point that seagoing naval personnel formed part of the RAN contingent to the British Commonwealth Far East Strategic Reserve. These personnel have never been eligible for repatriation benefits until 1997. In 1997, the government accepted a recommendation that their service be classified as operational service. Ex-service personnel organisations representing the interests of seagoing naval personnel, however, continued to press for the period of service to count as qualifying service for the service pension. The minister now has this recommendation from the review he has commissioned before him. The recommendations are quite clear. I must indicate that the review is a little late; the minister expected it in October last year, but in due course it has arrived in February this year. He really now has no justification for failing to correct the long standing injustice. East Timor: Support for Service Families Workplace Relations and Small Business)-Last week I found myself in Darwin on my parliamentary duties and I had great pleasure in catching up with an old unit that I served with, the 5th/7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. I only caught up with one of the officers because the unit is in Timor at the moment. They have been over there for seven months and they return on 3 May. I rise today in the Main Committee to commend the 5/7 RAR pit crew. The pit crew are the ladies who are supporting their husbands whilst they are overseas. All the attention-and rightly so-goes to the service personnel who are obviously doing a great job in Timor. But quite often we forget that the family members left behind have to carry on, run households and look after the children, and they need a great deal of support. I believe the CO’s wife, Patti Jane Gould, instigated the very first pit crew, as she called it, and appointed a committee which was brought from all ranks-no rank-specific involvement at all. This committee was headed by Mrs Rebecca Tufekic, who I believe has done an absolutely fabulous job in keep-",131,Representatives Main Committee

They have run a number of functions. They have produced continual newsletters. They have actually had their own operations room set up in battalion headquarters. I am led to believe that they could well be doing a better job than some of their husbands. In fact, that is what they are trying to lead me to believe. Perhaps their husbands, when they return, may find themselves out of a job. There have been some very important aspects to their job because, as you can appreciate, in all walks of life we all have little crises that crop up from time to time, and not having the husband or the boyfriend around can obviously lead to greater distress. They have set up welfare phones lines so that they know where the soldiers are at any particular time, what operation they are on and when the mail is likely to be getting through. One quick story that was relayed to me was that each of the soldiers gets five minutes every week to ring home. This has been set up through Optus and it is a great initiative. One particular fellow rang home to find that home was not there any more. That was his first fiveminute call and, obviously, there was a bit of concern. The following week he rang his mother-in-law-for five minutes-who told him where his wife now was. So three weeks later, on the third five-minute phone call, he finally found where his wife had been relocated to. It was all fine, it was all above board, but can you imagine the angst for a soldier in the field having to wait an additional week to get a five-minute phone call. It was here that the members of the pit crew were able to come in and support the families on the ground. I would also like to add congratulations to the two assistant adjutants, Lieutenant Paul Greive and Lieutenant Damien Kook, who both, I am told, have done a fabulous job in maintaining the morale of the battalion. They are due back in Darwin on 3 May. I am sure all of Darwin wishes them well and will give them a welcome return. A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FAMILY ASSISTANCE AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 2000 Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 March, on motion by Mr Anthony: That the bill be now read a second time. Assistance and Related Measures) Bill 2000. This bill forms part of the government’s overall tax package and is all about how this bill is going to interact with the GST, family payments and a whole range of payments that families are going to get. That leads me, quite clearly, to talk about where the family is in today’s society. The family is the backbone, the centre, of everything we do in this country. The family is that unit in our society which really holds us all together. It is really about what keeps us going, and it is the part that the government should be placing the most importance on to be able to deliver something positive. This is where this bill absolutely fails, because there is no way in the world that there is anything in this bill that looks to build on the family or to assist the family or to somehow compensate or make life easier in relation to the huge impost that the GST will have on families. Families are a changing composition in our society. What was previously seen as the nuclear family has changed somewhat today. We are finding that more people are choosing to have fewer children, and there is probably a variety of reasons why that is the case. But it is clearly evident that today there are just not many people deciding to have three or more children. In fact, more couples are deciding to have only one child or to have no children at all. There is almost a trend developing. Australia is becoming a childless society. I think part of the reason for that is that people are actually struggling and finding it more difficult to make ends meet. They are finding that to have a family is actually a huge burden. There is not just",132,Representatives Main Committee
213,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (9.58 A.m.),"I rise today to speak on the A New Tax System (Family15350 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 5 April 2000 the financial burden; there are all sorts of other burdens. Government policies are not family friendly-they are very much antifamily. If we have a close look at this bill, what we will find is a whole raft of antifamily policies. Every single one of them is part and parcel of the antifamily policies of this government. If we have a look at the GST to start with, we can see that the whole GST is based on consumption. Who consumes more? Is it the upwardly mobile yuppie living on his own in a nice unit in the North Shore of Sydney, or is it the family with three children? Who has the most disposable income? Who actually consumes more in terms of disposable income? It is the family. The family with two or three children actually suffers. They are the ones who have less opportunity for work because they have children to care for, so they cannot do the overtime. They are the ones who have bigger costs when they go shopping. They are the ones who actually carry the burden for the high income earners. That is what this policy is all about. But it goes much further and much deeper than that. We have all talked a lot about the costs and the problems associated with the GST for the family, but what about education? How does GST impact on education? We are all told that education is GST free. I beg to differ. I do not think it is GST free at all. I think education has a huge GST component to it, but I will have a look at that in a minute. If we look at health, who is it that pays the majority of the health cost? Is it the single person living in a unit on the North Shore of Sydney? No, it is the family. They are the ones that have to take the children to hospital. They are the ones that are being forced, through legislation, to have to take up private health insurance. So when I say that this government’s policies are all antifamily, I am quite serious about that because every single area you turn to, every place you look at, every policy that this government has is antifamily. In particular, the A New Tax System (Family Assistance and Related Measures) Bill 2000 that is before the House is actually very much antifamily. I think we need to take a new approach. It is time that this government and all governments looked very carefully at what government policy is doing to families. There needs to be a new approach, an approach that says, ‘We support families. We will do that not just through rhetoric, but we will do it through our policies. We will actually give you something concrete. We will give you family assistance that means something. So that if you want to go from welfare to work, then you actually have an incentive through government policy,’ not a disincentive. That is what this policy is about-disincentives for people to go from welfare to work. I talk to people all the time who come to my office and say, ‘I would love to be able to go out and do a little bit more, but if I go out and I try to do a bit of overtime to give my family a little bit extra, the government slugs me. Not only am I slugged through tax, but I am slugged through family assistance.’ So it is always a double whammy. Now, for the first time in this country, we are about to see the triple whammy take place. Not only are families going to be slugged on tax, not only are they going to be slugged on family assistance, they are about to be slugged with the GST as well. On1 July the triple whammy hits, because on 1 July they will also carry the new burden in this country that is squarely being shouldered by all the families. It will be low and middle income families that will carry the load. It is not going to be a burden on the people earning $50,000, $60,000, $70,000, $80,000 or $90,000 a year. They are going to be better off. So if they are not carrying the burden, who is? Who is going to be carrying the burden for this country in the future under a supposedly new tax system for a new century? That is quite easy to answer-it will be families. Again, when I say that this bill and this government’s policies are antifamily, I am quite serious about it because everywhere I look I see only antifamily policies. The government also talks a lot about what we might do in terms of education. There is talk of literacy and a whole heap of things, but there is very little talk in terms of money going back to families through early intervention programs and trying to do something positive. You do not see too much money going to early intervention programs. You do not see too much Wednesday, 5 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15351 money going to programs that will assist people and take them from where they are today and give them a hand up, or just a bit of assistance. Rather, you see measures that are designed to create more bureaucracies, and more measures that are designed to move the goalposts just a little bit further every time, just to make it that little bit more difficult. There is a raft of things in here, which I will talk about shortly, that actually covers that. The government also claims that inflation will be only 1.9 per cent-and it made a very big issue at the last election about that. This was the key to compensation packages and to selling this policy and legislation to the people. We all know that that is absolutely incorrect. The 1.9 per cent was probably blown on the first day. It is just not the case. Try about five per cent. Try a little bit more. What are we seeing today? What is the evidence we have right before us? If you pick up Choice magazine, they say, ‘You might be $3 better off with your shopping.’ I do not agree with them. I do not think that is true at all. I and a lot of other people have actually been doing a price watch survey out there to monitor the cost of a fairly reasonable standard basket of goods, not after GST, but right now. What has been the cost over the last nine or 12 months? Let me tell you. Since this government has put forward its policies, there has been a steady increase, an inflationary rise based on the expectation that GST will cause prices to go up, and not just in the services or goods sector where we know GST will be applied but also on things that have no GST, such as basic foods, milk and bread. I was shocked to see some of the results that have come out of that price watch over the last six months. What we have seen is what I would describe as some people taking the opportunity to actually raise prices and increment them slowly. That is all fine and well-1.9 per cent means absolutely nothing to most people because 1.9 per cent does not represent anything to do with reality and the real costs. If you talk to a family about their real costs-what it costs them to survive week to week, because for a lot of them it is just survival-you will see the real picture, and that 1.9 per cent soon means absolutely nothing. What does the government do? It claims that raising a child under the GST will cost an extra 30c a week. I cannot even begin to imagine where that statement or a figure like 30c a week would come in because, through my own calculations, I can tell you now that it is not 30c. If we talked dollars, we would start getting closer to the figure. It will not be cents. It will be dollars and it will be big dollars-double-digit dollars. That extra cost has already occurred since 1998 and we have not even got to 1 July as yet. It is ridiculous for the government to make all these claims about how the GST is somehow miraculously going to put some money in your back pocket. There is going to be no extra money in your back pocket. You are going to end up with a lot less. This bill is called ‘family assistance’. It is not family assistance, it is family dis-assistance. It is family anti-assistance. It is family anything but assistance. All the measures that are contained in this bill are about keeping people on welfare and keeping people down. There is nothing in here about giving people a hand up. It is almost about punishment. There is talk in this bill about zero tolerance. There is talk in this bill about a whole range of things, but there is nothing in here that says, ‘We are going to try and move people out of welfare traps and give them a hand up.’ It is just not in here. There is nothing in here about trying to help a parent who is unemployed and give them more incentives. None of that is contained in here. The recent welfare reform interim report recognised a number of problems contained in this bill, in particular the way the antifamily Youth Allowance interacts with family tax benefits. The report actually stated that this is: ... an extreme case where tight and poorly integrated social security income tests can severely discourage workforce participation. People who have looked at this quite closely actually concur that this is not about encouragement, it is not about existence, it is actually quite the opposite. Over a period of 15352 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 5 April 2000 time we have become used to the fact, as my good colleague and friend, the member for Port Adelaide, has said on quite a number of occasions, that this is a government that uses newspeak, the language of government in 2000-that is to say, more is less and less is more. That is what this is about: more is less, less is more. It is amazing-and this is coming through in a whole range of government policies and bills-that somehow by giving you less the government is actually being good to you and giving you more. love. It is all about less being more. The government claims in the interim report that, once again, this is all about families. I dispute that completely. It is all about punishing families. It really reinforces-and this is what concerns me-at a deeper level, I suppose, the long-term effects. This policy is antichildren. It is about childless societies. That is what we are pushing. That is where these policies are going. It might sound a little out there to make those sorts of comments, but what are the long-term effects when you look at the trend in today’s statistics? There is a statistic out there that says something like, ‘If you have three children in your family, you represent only 17 per cent of the community.’ I have three children, and I can tell you now that having three children is wonderful, that it is fantastic. It is great to have a family, but there are not too many policies out there that would actually encourage you. When I talk to my friends they say that I am crazy. They say that my wife and I are mad and that we are totally different from the rest of the community in that everyone else is having only one child. They ask, ‘Why would you have more children when you cannot afford it as one of you would have to give up work?’ They say that a family with one working parent is finding it more and more difficult to survive. So where does family assistance come in in this bill? Nowhere. It is nowhere at all, because there is nothing in this bill that actually encourages a family to either stay a family or become a family. This bill discourages families, it discourages people having children. When we start talking about the backbone of society, what Australia is about and how we are all about families, I would like to see that backed up by a little bit of policy that actually supports it. I would also like to see it backed up with a reversal in trends. Somewhere down the track we actually have to look at the much deeper problem that exists. What we are also seeing in this bill which is extremely disturbing is the new income estimates rule. This is very disturbing in the way that low and middle income families can incur debts. You are required by Centrelink to actually go in there on a fortnightly basis and estimate your income. On the surface, that sounds quite fine. You might not think there is a problem with that. But if you make a mistake of $1 or if there is an overestimation, you have to repay the debt incurred. That is fine. No-one disputes that if you incur a debt you pay it back. But I think the problem here is that currently 32 per cent of family payments are in error. They are in error because it is almost impossible to actually estimate your income from fortnight to fortnight and get it spot on every time. If you do not get it spot on, what is your reward? If you do not get it right with Centrelink, you have to pay back the debt. Okay, so you pay back the debt. What happens when you have to do that? You get less money and that makes it tougher for you. What happens then? Again, life becomes harder. For the 32 per cent of families out there who have incurred a debt of, on average, about $1,000, that is $1,000 less they are going to have. Sure, they had it in the first place, but they have to pay it back. It is always easy to say, ‘You earnt that money. You got that money. We gave that to you, so give it back.’ You hardly notice a couple of dollars a week or a few dollars a month coming in, but you really notice it when it is going out. When it is coming out of your pay and the government says, ‘Give us back our money,’ then we have a real problem.",133,Representatives Main Committee

It is all about tough love: there is a lot of tough and very littleWednesday, 5 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15353 Currently there exists a margin for error, because the government has realised that it is not always possible to get it spot on. If you are working overtime, and you are doing those normal things that a family does, then the errors can creep in. But now the government is talking in this bill about ‘zero tolerance’-no 10 per cent margin, no buffer zone. These families are not cheating the system, they are just going in there and honestly trying to estimate. It is almost impossible because you work a couple of hours overtime one week and none the next: it is all over the place. So what happens under zero tolerance? If you are $1 out, you have to pay it back-you incur a debt. So you become a debtor to the government. And if you become a debtor to the government under this bill, you then cannot claim an advance. Again it is every little bit, always that little increment. It is always about ratcheting it up one more level to make it harder and harder. I keep questioning: what is the purpose of this; what are we doing? What is the purpose of handing out a few dollars to some people to try and assist them, and then making it as hard as possible, not only to qualify, to actually get the assistance in the first place, but to maintain it? What zero tolerance means for this government is zero tolerance for families. That is what it is about. Zero tolerance means, ‘We are not going to tolerate your making a $1 error. We are not going to tolerate your making an estimate.’ I always thought that an estimate was just that-an estimate. ‘Can you please give me an estimate of what you think this might be for the next fortnight?’ ‘Well, since it hasn’t happened yet, I will give you an estimate. That estimate might be out by a few dollars, and, sure, I might incur a debt and have to pay it back.’ Why can’t this government look a bit more closely at doing something positive, instead of trying to slug these people with an average debt of about $1,000, which they incurred quite unjustifiably? Again it is all about newspeak by the government: more is less, less is more. There is a range of other parts of the legislation which are quite disturbing. A funny situation arises with regard to the incurring of a debt, in that if you are a high income earner you can make your claim at the end of the year. You do not have to estimate anything; you can actually do it dollar for dollar. You can get the accountant to do it for you. If you are in that comfortable bracket and you are getting a little bit more, you are fine, but in the lower and middle income earners bracket-where the majority of people are and where this debt is actually incurred-people actually need the money week to week. They need those few extra dollars. That is why the dollars are there. So they are the ones that carry the burden. Everywhere you turn in this bill, you find it is quite clear on a number of things such as zero tolerance. And who carries the burden? The burden is shouldered by those least able to afford it. The legislation contains also a number of issues about shared care arrangements. Currently there is a 30 per cent care arrangement with the non-custodial parent, where if you care for the child for 30 per cent of the time, then you get part of the allowance and so forth. The government is going to reduce that to 10 per cent. It is an absolutely ridiculous proposition. There has been no consultation. The Single Mothers Council of Australia has rejected this idea, saying it means that, if you care for the child for one day a week or a little more, you can claim part of the allowance. So the main carer, who might have the child for 90 per cent of the time, suddenly loses money. To wrap up: there is a whole range of issues in here and it would take me hours to go through them one at a time. WhatI would like to say is that this clearly demonstrates the antifamily values of this government. (Time expired) Related Measures) Bill 2000 amends, to make viable, the consolidation of 12 family payments into three. The original act has merit, in my view, but this bill is a very lengthy one and reveals some faults, at least in the planning process for the implementation of the government’s",136,Representatives Main Committee
216,Mr Emerson (Rankin) (10.18 A.m.),"TheA New Tax System (Family Assistance and15354 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 5 April 2000 intentions-announced at the election-for the consolidation. I believe consolidation is a step in the right direction, because the overlapping of a plethora of family payments with the tax system has created a lot of complexity. It has also created the problem of high effective marginal tax rates. As benefits are withdrawn with earned income, the tapering effect of that withdrawal rate in relation to a number of the family payments is very high. Also, you are paying income tax on every extra dollar beyond the tax-free threshold. So to obtain the effective marginal tax rate is quite simple: you add together the marginal rate of income tax and the withdrawal rate or the taper rate. Some of those effective marginal rates of tax are quite horrific. The damage that they do is concentrated on lower and middle income families because it has the effect of creating poverty traps, of making the transition from welfare to work that much more difficult because the incentives to move from welfare to work are greatly impaired. Put simply, when someone who is receiving some form of government payment looks at the amount of money they will have in their pockets from making the decision to move from welfare to work or to move from, say, casual or part-time work to full-time work, they realise that there is very little left in their pockets. Quite rationally, in many cases, they make the judgment that it might be better not to take that extra work, not to take that extra job, but to wait for something better to come along because they are able to retain only such a small proportion of income from that extra effort, that extra work. I have to say that some of these high marginal rates or effective marginal rates of tax are, in fact, the result of a number of very good initiatives that were taken by the previous Labor government to increase payments to low income families. I refer in particular to Bob Hawke’s child poverty pledge when he was maligned for setting as a goal-and it was a goal-that no child shall live in poverty by 1990child need live in poverty, and that did not make it into the speech. That is history. But behind that election statement were a huge number of dollars for low income families. It gives me, as a former employee of the then Prime Minister Bob Hawke, great pride to be able to report some of the impacts of that child poverty pledge and other initiatives taken by the Labor government at that time. It is a fact that earnings inequality in Australia widened more sharply over the 20-year period from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s than in any other OECD country. But this was almost fully offset by the progressive income tax system and government transfers to low income earners, and government transfers to low income earners is really what we are talking about in this legislation. As a result, over that period from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, Australia achieved a fall in poverty, as was the intention of the child poverty pledge, which ‘was concentrated in the second decade when Labor was in power’. That quotation comes from Access Economics in a major report that it produced in 1999-just last year. And these findings of Access Economics have been confirmed by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, NATSEM, which found, for the period 1982 to 1993, that: Changes in the tax transfer systems appeared sufficient to fully offset growing inequality of market in-comes, resulting in little change in the aggregate distribution of disposable income. What these two studies reveal is that market incomes did widen quite dramatically over the 30-year period from the 1970s through to the end of the 1990s, but in the latter decades, when Labor was in power, the transfers associated with the child poverty pledge and other commitments to lift up low income families meant that the inequality in Australia overall did not widen in spite of that dramatic, sharply widening gap between the earnings of high income and low income earners. I think it is actually a cause for great pride, on both sides of the parliament, that that was achieved. But what it inadvertently did was that, by piling these extra",137,Representatives Main Committee
217,Mr Sawford,You missed out a word.,138,Representatives Main Committee
218,Mr Emerson,"In fact, the technical section of the whole documentation said that noWednesday, 5 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15355 payments on top of each other, the withdrawal rates all compounded, so you did get very high effective marginal rates of tax. It was not an intended consequence; it was unintended. There has been a great opportunity for this government to deal with that problem. Unfortunately, in the legislation, it makes some progress in some areas but, particularly in the area of the unemployed-people on Newstart-very little progress has been made. I refer to the example of an unemployed person receiving Newstart who is offered a job, say, in the range of $10,000 to $15,000 a year, which is quite common; if you have been out of work, it is not highly likely that you will be offered a $50,000 or $60,000 a year job. You may be offered a part-time job, putting a toe in the water so that the employer can have a look at you and you can have a look at the employer. The effective marginal tax rate over that range of $10,000 to $15,000 has been reduced under the legislation from 90 cents in the dollar to 87 cents in the dollar. That is due only to the reduction in the marginal rate of income tax for lower income earners from 20 cents in the dollar to 17 cents in the dollar. So nothing in this legislation involves a reduction in the taper rate for people on Newstart over that income range, which I think is a great pity, because we could really have made some progress for those people. They remain, therefore, very much caught in a poverty trap. The incentive to move from welfare to work, I would argue, is very low when you are sacrificing, effectively, 87 cents in the dollar for every extra dollar of income earned. So an opportunity has been missed. It is quite clear that, on the part of this government, reducing effective marginal tax rates for welfare recipients is not a priority. As I said, this legislation fails to do that for people on unemployment benefits. The government has completely rejected the idea of tax credits. It has rejected, for example, the Keating-Lambert proposal which would have consolidated the payments even further and which would have meant that there was a single taper. That was covered in the Financial Review today. There is some merit in the Keating-Lambert proposal, but the government has said, ‘No, we’re not interested in that.’ I think it does reveal its social agenda. That social agenda is one in which we get the sort of rhetoric and inferences that people on welfare are bludgers. I refer to the words of the employment minister, who regards them as ‘job snobs’. There is this denigration of people on welfare who face effective marginal tax rates of 87 cents in the dollar, and even higher rates in some cases. These people are supposed to be welfare bludgers, but for high income earners who face a marginal tax rate of 48½ cents in the dollar, the government considers that that is a punitive rate of tax and that it removes the incentive to work harder and improve oneself and one’s family. But an effective marginal rate of 87 cents in the dollar is fine for low income earners because it allows the government to continue to label them as ‘job snobs’ and ‘bludgers’. The Treasurer has said, ‘We’ve got to get this top marginal rate of tax down.’ I refer here to statements that he has made. He finds that this is a great disincentive to work and he has declared himself to be an ‘income tax cut man’. He said that in a statement after delivering an address at the forecasting conference of the Economics Society of Victoria on 19 August 1999. That was reported on page 1 of the Australian Financial Review on 20 August 1999. He said that he was an income tax cut man and that he wanted to get the top marginal rate pushed out to be ‘multiples of average weekly earnings’. He said that in an interview on Meet the Press on the Ten Network on 30 May last year. So we have got the Treasurer of this country saying, ‘Oh, that 48½ per cent rate is punitive; it robs people of incentive to work. But 87 cents in the dollar is fine for low income earners because we can continue to label them as welfare bludgers and job snobs.’ Such are the priorities and such is the philosophy of this government. 15356 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 5 April 2000 The government have said that the tax package, of which this legislation forms part, is going to be magnificent for families. They have now fallen into their own trap of making wildly exaggerated claims about the benefits of this risky tax scheme. The Prime Minister has said on a number of occasions that the average family will receive $47 a week in their pockets. The Deputy Prime Minister went one further-I think there is a bit of an auction going on here-and said in the parliament on 5 February, talking about a single income couple with a baby in Collarenebri on $30,000 a year-a typical family in that little townthat they will have an extra $65 a week in the home to spend. And then, not to be outdone, the minister for workplace relations, Mr Reith, said on 2UE recently, ‘What about an assurance for someone on 30 grand a year who, under us, is going to have $71 a week more in their pocket. For that person on $30,000, $71 a week is a lot of money. That is $3,500 a year.’ So we have the Prime Minister saying $47, the Deputy Prime Minister saying $65 and, not to be outdone, the minister for workplace relations saying an average family is going to get $71 a week. Each and every one of them completely failed to mention the war, the three-letter word-GST. They all failed to mention the GST. What is the latest assertion? Is it that the GST will cost people nothing? I believe that this will condemn them once the GST actually comes in because I reckon that there will be very few Australian families who believe the government when it says, ‘You are $47 a week better off,’ or ‘You are $65 a week better off,’ or ‘You are $71 a week better off.’ They will say, ‘Funny, it does not feel that way.’ So the government is sowing the seeds of its own demise in making these wildly exaggerated claims about the impact of this risky tax scheme. It is a fact that with the GST, every time you have a child you enter into a higher tax bracket because those children consume, and what is being introduced is a tax on consumption. It is a tax on virtually all of the things that babies consume-all of their clothes, all of the services that for the first time are going to be subject to tax. Overall, when you weigh one side against the other you realise that essentially what this legislation is about is an attempt, but not a very good attempt, to compensate families for the impact of the GST. Really, this is compensation. On its own there is merit in it, and we supported the original legislation last year because it did provide extra family payments, but it fails the test of adequately reducing the effective marginal tax rates for low income earners. It has to be seen in the context that it is really an attempt to compensate for the GST, and for lower and middle income families that compensation is not adequate. I ask members of parliament to spare a thought for that other category of people, single people, who are the forgotten people in this tax package because they get very little. It is quite easy to demonstrate that single people on low and middle incomes are going to be clearly worse off under the risky tax scheme that the government is putting in place. Another category of single people is age pensioners. Many age pensioners, obviously, live alone; they have lost their partners. We have had the government saying, ‘But age pensioners are going to receive this bonus of $1,000,’ which in most cases is just untrue. They are going to receive dollar for dollar on any investment income that they have. In my electorate, and in the electorates of the members for Sydney and Melbourne Ports, there are thousands of pensioners who derive no income at all from investments. They have not got any investments because they could never afford to have them. They will not get this $1,000 bonus. The government have been quite misleading before, during and after the election in asserting that as well as getting this $1,000 bonus-which many age pensioners will not get-the age pension is going to go up by four per cent. What they failed to mention, other than in the fine print, is that there will be an initial four per cent in the pension but half of that will be grabbed back on 31 March next year. Half of the four per cent will be clawed back-so there will be a two per cent rise, not a four per cent rise. And this is meant to compensate for all of the price impacts of the GST. Clearly, it will not be able to compensate adequately for that. Wednesday, 5 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15357 The consolidation of family payment does have merit, but the government has squandered an opportunity to improve the incentives to move from welfare to work. This is just another instalment in widening inequality in the information age. There is a new economic agenda that is only being pursued by one side of politics-and that is the Labor Party. It is part of being the knowledge nation to put extra resources into making sure that young people and older people, through lifelong learning and reskilling, have the skills to be able to compete for jobs successfully in the information age. Over three years, $20 billion of government surplus is being taken from the new agenda and from giving skills to people from disadvantaged areas to pay for the old agenda. The old agenda is a GST. The Australian government said that because Europe has a GST we have to have one. This is the old economic agenda. Labor pursued an economic agenda of microeconomic reform through the 1980s and the 1990s, reducing tariff barriers, deregulating the financial system, floating the dollar and creating more competition in the economy. Most of those measures were supported-sometimes grudgingly-by members of the present government. But the government says there is unfinished business in the old economic agenda. We have to have a GST, which Labor has not supported and has never supported, and we have to have further changes in the industrial relations system to make sure that we can depress the wages of families who are already on low incomes. The government have taken $20,000 million from the new economic agenda, including from education and all those vital social services that would create a proper and decent fair society, and used it to pay for what they consider to be the unfinished business of the old economic agenda. What we face now, as a result of the government’s inaction on the new economic agenda, is a fractured and increasingly unequal society. A fractured society is an unsafe society. If high income earners cannot find the motivation from altruism to pay their fair share of tax and stop engaging in aggressive tax avoidance schemes-more of which we have seen revealed in the last few days-and cannot find in their hearts the altruism to say, ‘We have to pay our fair share of tax so that kids from disadvantaged areas can be lifted up and given a decent education and future,’ they may have to look at the motivation of self-interest and understand that, as income inequality continues to widen and social exclusion becomes more commonplace, this fractured society is becoming an increasingly unsafe society. They are going to have to confront the reality that, if they are to look after themselves and their families, they are going to have to pay their fair share of tax. The government talks about welfare bludgers and job snobs, but it never talks about tax bludgers. The country is full of high income earners who go to all these respectable functions. They present themselves as respectable people in society and yet they are engaged in aggressive tax schemes to minimise tax. If they paid their fair share of tax, they could contribute to the new economic agenda to a fair and more decent society. Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (10.38 a.m.)-I rise to speak on A New Tax System (Family Assistance and Related Measures) Bill 2000. I was struck by the inclusion of the term ‘family assistance’ in the title of the bill. I sometimes wonder whether these bill titles are ironic. The other reminder of the irony of the titling of bills was ‘more jobs, better pay’. While much of this legislation is uncontroversial, there are aspects that will undoubtedly hurt families and, particularly, hurt children. With this bill coming in the week after the release of Jocelyn Newman’s report on welfare reform, people might be forgiven for wondering whether this government’s support for families is no more than rhetoric. The aspect of the bill of greatest concern to me relates to the cut to the family tax benefit for the primary carer when the non-residential parent has more than 10 per cent care of a child. Under previous policy, family payments were shared once there was a minimum of 30 per cent care from the non-custodial parent. That is consistent with child support payments 15358 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 5 April 2000 which currently recognise that a significant commitment of 30 per cent care is needed by the non-custodial parent before their child support liability is reduced. This legislation proposes that the family tax benefit for the primary carer would reduce as soon as the non-residential parent has 10 per cent care. That is less than one day a week; it is only 36 days a year. It is likely to cause significant hardship for single parents who stand to lose up to $40 per fortnight for each child that is subject to these arrangements. Of course, anyone who has primary care of children realises that your expenses do not necessarily diminish that much if you do not have the children one day a week. You are still responsible for rent, clothing, putting food on the table and all of the ordinary expenses of child rearing. This government is full of talk on how it supports families, yet it looks for any opportunity to take money away from the poorest families. The government has cut child-care assistance, axed retraining programs and severely restricted employment support schemes such as JET, aimed at getting parents back into work. The recent report so paraded by the Minister for Family and Community Services just continues this trend. Patrick McClure, Chief Executive of Mission Australia and the chairperson of the federal government’s reference group on welfare reform, stated quite clearly: Without a fundamental change in the direction of the nation’s social support system, far too many Australians are at risk of long-term poverty. This is one of the findings of the interim report. He is right in saying that the risk of poverty is much too high, but this report and this government have no solutions for that. This minister does not see it as her job to address unemployment and disadvantage, or intergenerational poverty. She sees it as her job to save a few dollars on the budget bottom line, to throw a few single mums off the pension and get those lazy disabled people back down the mines or up the chimneys. To do the job of welfare reform properly, the minister would have to get her government to commit to a program over many years, indeed decades, and to spend billions of dollars to actually get people from welfare to work. Such a program would have to address social and educational disadvantage, parenting skills and, most particularly, support for working families. Welfare reform is not just about saving nickels and dimes; it is about helping people to become independent when they can be and it is about giving security and peace of mind to those people who continue to rely on benefits. Providing support and assistance to sole parents and disability pensioners may be the emphasis of the report but, as Tony Eadley points out, ‘it is underpinned by the government’s veiled threats of compulsion and sanctions’. It reminds me of some of the more punitive measures that were taken up by some of the North American states. In a book called No one left to lie to, Christopher Hitchens says: ... we are endlessly instructed, while rich people will not work unless they are given money, poor people will only work if they are not. (These are the two modern meanings of the term “incentive”: a tax break on the one hand and the threat of the workhouse on the other.) And, once the Democratic party had adopted this theology, the poor had no one to whom they could turn. The immediate consequence of this was probably an intended one: the creation of a large helot underclass disciplined by fear and scarcity, subject to endless surveillance, and used as a weapon against any American worker lucky enough to hold a steady or unionised job. The evidence lies all around us, and will be around us for some time to come. Whether it is gleaned from the most evenhanded and “responsible” reporting, such as that of Jason DeParle atop the great rampart of the New York Times. He goes on to say: ... we shall have to accustom ourselves to stories like this. In Missouri, under the Direct Job Placement scheme (such schemes are always known officially as “initiatives”), the state bureaucracy mutates itself into a hiring hall for cheap labor in junk-nutrition conglomerates such as Tyson Foods. Welfare recipients are told to sign on and gut fifty chickens a minute, or be wiped from the rolls of the new Poor Law. They are directed to an industry which is well used to turnover among employees: Wednesday, 5 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15359 Here is a story of a particular person affected by these laws. He writes: As one woman on welfare discovered [never mind her name] even having a newborn baby and no means of transportation is no excuse. When the thirty-year-old mother informed her case managers of these extenuating circumstances, they were not sympathetic. “They told her she had to work at Tyson’s even if she had to walk to get there-a six-mile trek,” says Helen Chewning, a former family advocate with the Missouri Valley Human Resource Centre in Sedalia. “They sanctioned her while she was pregnant, and then ordered her to work at Tyson’s when her baby was just eleven days old. She hasn’t had any income for six months. How are they supposed to live?” That, of course, was all reporting from Christopher Cook, but Christopher Hitchens goes on to say: The process of “sanctioning”-the new state euphemism for coercion via the threat of cut-offinvolves facing defenceless people with the rather old choice between “work or starve.” It is the tactic by which welfare rolls are being “trimmed”, if you will allow another Clintonian euphemism. You can be “sanctioned” if you refuse any job, or miss any interview. I did not select Missouri because it’s a famously unsentimental state. I selected it because President Clinton in an August 1997 address to businessmen in St Louis, touted it as the model laboratory for his welfare reform. It’s useful only for dialectical purposes to mention that Tyson Foods uses the Direct Job Placement scheme as its taxpayer-funded recruiting sergeant. The first shock of recognition, experienced by those who are supposed to be grateful for a dose of nonalienated and dignified labor, is the “puller job.” This involves gutting birds-later to provide tasteless nourishment at the tables of the badly off-at a rapid rate. The fingernails of the inexperienced are likely to be the first to go; dissolved in bacteria and chicken fat. Of Missouri’s 103,000 poultry workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, almost one-third endured an injury or an illness in 1995 alone. That this may be an undercounting is suggested by the experience of one hard-pressed toiler on the Tyson chicken-thigh assembly line named Jason Wolfe: “They want you to hang forty or fifty of these birds in a minute, for four to six hours straight, without a break. If you miss any, they threaten to fire you.” He himself was fired because of too many “sick days.” Supplied by the state with a fearful, docile labor force, the workhouse masters are relatively untroubled by unions, or by any back-talk from the staff. Those who have been thus “trimmed” from the welfare rolls have often done no more than disappear into a twilight zone of casual employment, uninsured illness, intermittent education for their children, and unsafe or temporary accommodation. Only thus-by their disappearance from society-can they be counted as a “success story” by ambitious governors, and used in order to qualify tightfisted states for “caseload-reduction credits” from the federal government. The women among them, not infrequently pressed for sexual favors as the price of the ticket, can be asked at random about the number of toothbrushes found in the trailer, and are required by law to name the overnight guest or the father of the child if asked. Failure or refusal to name the father can lead to termination of “benefits” or (an even better word) “entitlements.” Christopher Hitchens goes on to describe in quite a lot of detail what the effects of the American states’ views of mutual obligation have been and, in fact, the deleterious effects that they have had, of course, on the welfare recipients but, perhaps even more importantly, on the children that rely on those parents. Mike Steketee wrote in the Australian of this government’s attitudes towards people receiving welfare benefits that show they have lost touch with the community when they believe that ‘... a strongly performing economy must have opportunities for everyone and those that remain unemployed are bludgers’. He is pointing out that for most people, the vast majority of people, unemployment is not a choice. It is not a lifestyle decision. The government has tightened economic policy at the expense of programs to help the long-term unemployed. The government has clearly betrayed families, contrary to the Prime Minister’s assertion that ‘families are the essential building block of a dynamic and decent society’. If the Prime Minister believes this, it is difficult to understand how 770,000 children now grow up in families where neither parent has a job. When the figures were last taken in 1999, that was an increase of 96,000 people since the election of the government. In a speech 15360 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 5 April 2000 to the Australian Federation of Childcare Associations in 1997, Senator Newman promised ‘a high quality child-care system ... flexible, affordable and accessible’. Yet, child care under this government has gone up at least $20 a week for most families following cuts of $850 million from the child-care budget. It is obvious that these measures have been responsible for the drop in the participation rate of women in the economy and, certainly, for increased insecurity and cuts to the hours of numbers at work. It is unfortunate that, on the one hand, the Minister for Family and Community Services is undermining every effort of families to return to the work force, particularly burning the bridges that are necessary for single parents to re-enter the work force, and then feels it necessary to punish those people who are suffering from these cuts to programs. Peter Edelman, a US worker in the area of welfare policy, points out that there are class issues involved here. Of a similar situation in the United States, he said: There is a submerged class question here. I always get at it in my speeches by pointing out the hypocrisy in the rhetoric as to who should stay home with their children. Many on the right (and elsewhere) are saying mothers should stay at home with their small children because the new research data on brain development shows that small children need that stimulation. These same people then turn around and say poor moms have to go out and work immediately. (Many states have work requirements beginning when an infant is twelve weeks old, and the vast majority of the remainder require work when a child is a year old. That is a pretty class distinction.. It is interesting as well that this minister who seems to believe that caring for children is not valuable work on its own and who ignores the fact that there are currently 28,000 disabled people on waiting lists for training-these same people that she is saying need to undertake some work tests-manages to claim two pensions herself. On top of her salary as a cabinet minister, the minister is entitled to a parliamentary widow’s annuity and a defence force spouse benefit. Of course there is no reciprocity demanded of her-and nor should there be. She is entitled to these benefits and she claims them. Yet at the same time as she is claiming these benefits she is looking for ways to trim the social security lists. Surely is it obvious that there is some irony here, where people who do not need benefits are allowed to stick their hand out and claim them and those people who are just getting by, who are just managing, are being told to get out there and get off the social security lists. The agenda of the government is based on their view that the disadvantaged, the sick, the disabled, those raising children, the unemployed, the carers and those struggling to survive owe a debt to society rather than that they are Australians who need a hand in unfortunate times. Gerard McEwen of Glandore in South Australia put it very clearly in his letter to the Australian in March this year. He stated that the current government’s definition of mutual obligation is: ... in return for less money than it takes to live, the recipient agrees to be grateful for being humiliated and bullied. Adele Horan, of the Sydney Morning Herald, has suggested a number of times over the last year that one way in which the necessary costs of welfare reform could be found would beand the member for Rankin spoke of it earlier-if the government were willing to crack down on tax dodgers, the big end of town cheats. She said: Where might the money come from to provide the extra Centrelink staff, the social workers and the psychiatrists, the job training and the childcare that the committee sees as prerequisites for many sole parents and disability pensioners to make the transition to work? Who will pay the very necessary increased rate of benefit implied in the report? I think the sad answer is that no-one is going to pay it. This government does not have a commitment to making the investment that is required to get people from welfare to work. To blame those most disadvantaged in society, to penalise them, is wrong. To set up a situation where people are punished for not complying with mandatory work is wrong. To fail to acknowledge that work undertaken by a single mum in caring for her baby is wrong. This Wednesday, 5 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15361 difference between the Howard government’s rhetoric on welfare and the reality of its policy in action is wrong. Labor’s vision for welfare reform and an adequate welfare system involves acknowledging the work that parents do-the importance of caring for children and for caring for people with disability. We believe that it is necessary to protect people from poverty and destitution. That seems a very obvious thing to say but, given the experience in many states in the United States where these most punitive measures have been introduced, it is not something that modern civilised societies can any longer take for granted. Those social payments that were instituted, very often 60 years ago, during the 1930s, can no longer be taken for granted. There is no assumption that children born into poverty will actually receive a helping hand. There is, in fact, every indication that the trend is being reversed. Labor believes also that we need to give people choices about how they manage their family and work responsibility in early years of child rearing and about the types of activities they undertake to get back into work. There is no point in asking people to weed along railway tracks if that is never going to lead to a real job, if it is going to be a cycle of punishment and humiliation that does not deal at all with the underlying problems that have led to the unemployment in the first place. What we need to do in welfare reform is to help people to move forward and to become independent, rather than just to threaten, bully and harass them, and pull the rug out from under them. (Family Assistance and Related Measures) Bill 2000. In some respects this bill sums up the whole folly of the government’s tax reform proposal. It is some 300 pages long and it has an explanatory memorandum of some 203 pages, so we have over 500 pages of detail. Its development lacked consultation with the opposition subsequent to its introduction, and it amends eight other acts. In some ways it demonstrates, in this drive for simplification around tax reform, actually more complication and more confusion. When we look at the issue of family assistance in the context of the new tax system we have to look also at the question of whether that assistance is in fact fair, reasonable and just, particularly in relation to compensation on the basis of the changes that have been made with respect to the GST. What we see is a number of flawed assumptions that have come in as the basis for how compensation has been worked out, a number of flawed assumptions around the question of what has occurred. We now know that the figure for inflation that was estimated in the first place is not correct-that the impact on inflation and therefore on prices has been underestimated. Beyond that, having seen the development and the consideration of this system in respect of a range of different areas, we know that the price implications for a range of goods and services have been underestimated. That is going to have an impact on Australian families and on the assistance that they require in order to meet their daily bills. In particular I would like to focus, very briefly, on the health area in relation to that, because it has implications for many Australian families. All of us are users of health care products, and, in the circumstances, that area is something that the government has got terribly wrong. The government said continually that health would be GST free, and only recently has it actually started putting a few riders on which products are covered and which are not. When we look at that area we see some very interesting implications. Let us look at the circumstances of people who need family assistance and people on benefits. Often they will be in a situation where they are on pensions such as disability pensions and often they will be sufferers of various types of chronic illnesses. Those who are suffering from chronic illnesses often require health care which involves a range of different products. Some of those will be prescription products, which therefore are GST free, but often they will be products that are not GST free: although they are clearly of medical benefit, they have not",138,Representatives Main Committee
219,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (10.56 A.m.),"I rise to speak briefly on the A New Tax System15362 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 5 April 2000 made the poisons schedule as, effectively, products that require supervision by medical practitioners with respect to how they are used and so they will be subject to GST. When you look at the question of people with chronic illnesses, you often find that we are talking about significant amounts of expenditure being required. People with some skin diseases sometimes require a range of different products, including things like specific shampoos to deal with skin conditions, and ointments and creams for those conditions. Many of those products will not be GST free. The estimate from within industry about the price rises expected in these areas is of up to eight or nine per cent on occasions, depending on the product, so it is almost the entire 10 per cent. And the assistance and compensation packages outlined do not take into account the level of requirement for people in those particular sets of circumstances. I have seen letters from members of the community saying that the bills they could be facing over a monthly period could be as high as $150 to $200. The circumstances are that they are going to rise seven to eight per cent. This goes right through to herbal remedies and a range of other products that are used in preventative health care. This government has really only focused on four issues in the preventative area: sunscreen, condoms, personal lubricants and folate. AlthoughI support those four exemptions, there is a range of other products that should be considered, like calcium for people with osteoporosis. So we see with this bill that a range of amendments are required. It is a huge bill and it requires huge adjustment because this system is just not right. It was not right when it was brought in, it has not been right since then in terms of the adjustments that have been made, and I am sure we are going to be seeing many more amendments to this bill right up until 1 July and, also, post the event. First of all, I thank all the members for their contributions to this debate on the A New Tax System (Family Assistance and Related Measures) Bill 2000. Admittedly, many from the other side were misguided. But I would particularly like to thank the members for McPherson, Hughes and Mitchell. This bill is part of the government’s vision for a new tax system. As part of the government’s plan for a new tax system, the structure and administration of family assistance is being recast and simplified with effect from 1 July 2000. This bill complements last year’s tax reform legislation and, in particular, the family assistance package provided primarily by A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999 and A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999. These acts have already made huge contributions to reducing 12 forms of assistance currently available through the tax and social security system to three new family assistance payments: family tax benefit part A, family tax benefit part B and child-care benefit. The bill refines the existing legislation package to clarify the operations of various aspects of family assistance law, to replace regulation making powers with substantive provisions, to insert relevant savings and transitional provisions and to make miscellaneous technical amendments. It also makes consequential amendments to other relevant legislation. I would like to talk in some detail about some of the provisions contained in the bill. Under the current family assistance arrangements, many matters are dealt with by way of regulation making powers. The bill replaces existing regulation making powers with substantive provisions in the primary legislation. This replacement provision includes claiming, determining and payment of the child-care benefit-CCB-obligations of claimants and approved care services and payments of advances to services. The bill refines and clarifies the operations of the family assistance law and makes some technical and consequential changes to the family assistance law and other Commonwealth acts. The bill contains necessary transition and savings provisions. The bill provides for special benefit recipients who would otherwise not be eligible for family tax benefit or child-care benefit because of the residence rules to access these",145,Representatives Main Committee
220,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Minister for Community Services) (11.01 a.m.)-in replyWednesday, 5 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15363 payments. This means holders of temporary visas who satisfy the residence requirements for special benefit will also be able to access the family tax benefit, FTB, and the CCB. This change mainly affects the holders of spouse temporary visas who retain the care of the children after a partner’s death or desertion or separation due to domestic violence. Under the current rules these people can access special benefit but not family allowance or FTB from 1 July 2000. I cannot understand why the opposition would oppose that. This also ensures that refugees holding a temporary protection visa who receive family allowance will continue to receive FTB. There are provisions in the bill which ensure that any unrepaid family tax benefit advance is a debt under the family assistance law. This is in cases where the advance recipient ceases to be entitled to family tax benefit part A before the advance is repaid or the recipient’s part A rate drops to a level which is insufficient to recover the advance in the advance period. The debt provisions will also be amended to prevent entitlement to an FTB advance arising where a person has an existing debt. These changes are consistent with the treatment of unrepaid advances of income support payments under the social security law. The bill provides for amendments to overcome a technical anomaly relating to the payment of rent assistance. Amendments will be made to ensure that a person who only has the shared care of a child or children is assessed for rent assistance at both the ‘with child’ and ‘without child’ rates and paid at the higher rate. Amendments of the CCB rate for formal care ensure that the CCB hourly rate for the fourth and subsequent child in a family will be the same as for a family with three children in care, including indexation. The bill provides for amendments to child-care benefit to taper out the 10 per cent part-time loading in long day care centres so that families using less than 34 hours of care continue to get the 10 per cent loading. However, families using 34 to 37 hours get a lesser loading so that they do not get less CCB in total than those using 33 hours. Changes are also made to the child-care benefit so that the minimum rate for informal care for school children will be reduced to below the corresponding rate for younger children. The bill will allow the childcare benefit eligibility provisions to align the child-care benefit immunisation requirement with the current child-care assistance and child-care rebate immunisation requirements. The amendments exempt children born before 1 January 1996 from the immunisation requirement. The bill also contains provisions allowing an approved child-care centre to have the discretion to decide the CCB rate applicable to an individual experiencing hardship. Amendments provide that a service can lose this discretion if it has demonstrated a pattern of inappropriate use of the discretion. Other amendments in this bill increase the rates of the CDEP participation supplement, pensioner education supplement and carer allowance by four per cent. This increase will compensate recipients for the effect of the goods and services tax. The bill also makes minor technical changes to the A New Taxation System (Bonus for Older Australians) Act 1999 to take account of the subsequent enactment of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. I take this opportunity to address some of the comments made by opposition members, particularly the honourable member for Lilley. As usual, the member for Lilley embarked on his standard diatribe. He spoke of his ‘insecurity index’-an insecurity index which makes no sense. Madam Deputy Speaker, this government is certainly about helping families, as you well know. It is not about scaring families. This is certainly in contrast with the member for Lilley’s so-called family insecurity index. Like the member for Lilley, the index is based more on scare than on substance. When you take a closer look at this farcical index, to start with, the figures used are from the time of the last Labor government. The last time he was in this place, of course, was back in 1995. Of the 61 numbers used in constructing his index, 29 are wrong. It is hardly 15364 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 5 April 2000 surprising that, with 29 incorrect numbers, it is hard to take this index seriously. With 29 incorrect numbers, you cannot provide a measure of anything, let alone changes to family insecurity. Some of the index’s components are irrelevant, while other important elements are missing. The index has been weighted incorrectly. Some statistics used have been measured incorrectly. Finally, the index is being used in a selective and misleading way. Rather than providing security to Australian families, many members of the opposition are more concerned about scaring people and scaring families. The member for Lilley has accused the government of pushing this legislation through at the last minute. The opposition believes that there has not been enough time to analyse the bill. Nothing could be further from the truth. The government introduced the bill into the House four weeks ago. The member for Lilley has been given ample briefings from my department on issues relating to the bill. I am certainly quite happy for the member for Lilley to receive further briefings-perhaps it will enlighten him. It is a bit rich for the opposition to feel that it has not been given adequate time to look at the bill. I would like to explain in detail some of the aspects of the bill that obviously have been lost on many members of the opposition, and particularly the member for Lilley. For a start, he claims the family tax benefit B reduces a single family’s tax-free threshold by almost $5,000 when a child turns five. However, additional assistance is provided to single income families with a child or children under five to enable these families to choose a balance of child care and work responsibilities appropriate to them when their children are very young. The additional assistance ceases to be paid once the child is five years old on the basis that this is the age when children generally commence school and many parents have a greater opportunity to take up part-time or full-time employment. I do not think that is unreasonable. The member for Lilley is also concerned by the estimate rules contained in the bill. I would like to clarify some of these things for the benefit of the opposition. This was passed in the original act almost a year ago. Where family tax benefit has been paid based on an estimate of family income, the family’s actual entitlement will be reconciled at the end of the financial year when their actual taxable income is known. A top up payment will be provided if the customer has received less than their entitlement, and a repayment will be sought if the customer has received more than they are entitled to. The reconciliation process will ensure that the customer receives their full entitlement for the financial year. Reconciliation addresses one of the major complaints about the current family tax system which recoups overpayments but does not top up underpayments. Customers will be able to opt to overestimate their income so as not to incur an overpayment because they know they will receive a top up at the end of the financial year. Reconciliation will also mean that families claiming through the tax system will generally receive the same level of assistance as those who receive fortnightly payments. There will be no need for a margin of error when estimating income, as exists under the current family allowance system, as the reconciliation process addresses both underpayments and overpayments. Income support recipients will receive the maximum rate of family tax benefit A, which will be quarantined from the reconciliation process. The member for Lilley and the opposition have also raised concerns about the shared care arrangements contained in the bill. The 10 forms of assistance that will make up family tax benefit parts A and B currently have their own separate and different shared payment arrangements. The current arrangements vary from little or no restriction on the shared payment-for example, family allowance, dependent spouse rebate with child, and sole parent rebate-to no sharing at all for some payments such as guardian allowance and the basic parenting payment. The 30 per cent threshold applies only to the family tax initiative. The government considers that 10 per cent is a reasonable test for material care, recognising parents with this level of Wednesday, 5 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15365 care will incur significant costs in caring for children. Parents with this level of care or higher incur relatively significant costs due to the need to provide a bedroom, furnishings, food, clothes, health care and entertainment. This measure forms part of the response to the 1996 family law reforms which were introduced with the intention of promoting the parenting role of both parents and their continuing role in the lives of their children following separation. The member for Lilley claims that the tax reform will not benefit low income families. The opposition appears to overlook the generous compensation provided to low income families as part of the new tax system. Generous ongoing compensation will be provided to compensate income support recipients for the impact of the GST. This consists of a four per cent upfront increase in payments. This will apply to all payments, except the maximum rate of rent assistance, which will increase by seven per cent. For all pensions, a four per cent increase will be paid as a supplement in addition to the basic pension that will continue to be indexed to male total average weekly earnings or inflation, whichever is the greater. As part of a compensation package, there will also be a 2.5 per cent increase in the incomes and assets test. Free areas apply to all income support payments and there will be a reduction in the taper of the income test for pensioner payments from 50 per cent to 40 per cent. As I have already said, this bill forms part of the government’s vision for a new tax system. It builds on last year’s tax reform legislation and complements and consolidates the family assistance package this government has delivered. The 12 forms of assistance currently available through the tax and social security system are reduced to three new family assistance payments: family tax benefit part A, family tax benefit part B and the new child care benefit. This bill gives effect to the family assistance package provided by the new tax system. Many of the provisions debated in the House over the last two days have already been incorporated in the new taxation system bill last year. This includes the share care measures and the 10 per cent estimated provisions, so I am a bit surprised that there is this sudden revelation of indignation by the opposition. This is a great achievement and will benefit all Australian families immensely. I commend the bill to the House. Motion (by Mr Anthony) agreed to: That further proceedings on the bill be conducted in the House. Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Report Debate resumed from 6 March, on motion by Mr Hollis: That the House take note of the report. report of the visit to East Timor on 2 December 1999 of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, not only as a member of the delegation but also as the deputy chair of the committee. It was particularly appropriate that a delegation from this committee go to Timor, as we did in early December of last year, not only because of the work we do on that committee but also because each of the subcommittees that we have was very involved in what is happening in Timor. There is the foreign affairs subcommittee itself; there is the human rights subcommittee-and it is very important for us to get a first-hand view of what happened in the human rights area in Timor; and there is the trade subcommittee. I see the chair of the trade subcommittee is here. Unfortunately, he was in New York when we visited East Timor, but we had a briefing in Darwin before we went to Timor and briefings when we came back from Timor about the trade potential there for Australia in Timor. There is also, of course, the most recently formed subcommittee which is looking at Australia’s relationship with the UN itself.",146,Representatives Main Committee
221,Mr Hollis (Throsby) (11.15 A.m.),"I am particularly pleased to be talking today on the15366 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 5 April 2000 It was important for the committee to have a look at the way the UN responded to the crisis in Timor, and especially important to know the lessons that can be learnt from that. I thought it important that most of the members of the delegation were either a chair or a deputy chair of the various subcommittees. We also had Senator Maurice Payne and Senator Vicki Bourne, who had been there during the so-called consultation period. They could give a perspective on what they had seen when they were there a couple of months before compared to what Timor was like when they returned on that December visit. Few Australians today would not be aware of East Timor, but for many years from 1975 East Timor was said by some to be an embarrassment or an irritant to successive Australian governments. Governments did not want to know too much about our nearest neighbour. That was except for a small group of Australians who kept East Timor on the agenda. Within this parliament there has been a parliamentary East Timor support group which has been quite active. The numbers were very small; when East Timor became fashionable, they suddenly grew. Xanana Gusmao visited this parliament before going back to East Timor. Many members of the parliament did not even know who he was before that, but within that fortnight I was amazed when I went into a room and I saw about 50 or 60 members of parliament there all shaking his hand and having their photographs taken. I remember that for years when the East Timor support group used to meet, you would be lucky to get four or five members therepeople like Laurie Ferguson and Peter Andren, after he came in here, and a few others. So it did seem thatbecame very much the flavour of the month. I do not know whether it was because of the tragedy, but let us hope that an interest remains in East Timor because it most certainly will need it. There has been much discussion about the timetable leading to the vote and what has happened in East Timor and there have been arguments about how much Australia knew or did not know. I do not want to enter into that debate in any great length, except to say that I believe that our foreign affairs department knew a lot more than has been made public. I say that because, if for no other reason, I believe our intelligence and our knowledge on Indonesia, for all sorts of reasons, is the best of any country. Of all the countries in the world, the department and various officials in Australia would have had a fairly good idea of the possibility of the wanton destruction that happened afterwards. Whether we responded appropriately or not I leave for others to debate, but I think that we had a fairly good knowledge of the possibility of what could happen there. Having said that, there are some people who were involved in East Timor in that difficult period that I do not think adequate recognition has been given to. I pay tremendous tribute to our Australian forces there and all the forces there. It seems to me a great pity that we have not given that same recognition and tribute to members of the Australian Federal Police who went there and were there at a period when they had very little back-up support. Some of those people have been severely traumatised by what happened in East Timor. I think it is a great pity that there has not been adequate recognition of their work. Indeed, some of them were not paid for some time after they came back. One Australian Federal Police officer who served in Timor said to me and to other members of this parliament, ‘If you-’ that is the parliament ‘-are going to send us to hell and back, don’t have us grovel for our entitlements when we return to Australia.’ That is true. They had to grovel for their entitlements. SoI just want to put on the record my appreciation of what the Australian Federal Police did there under terribly difficult circumstances.",149,Representatives Main Committee

223,Mr Hollis,"I was too modest to say that, but it did seem that East Timor suddenlyWednesday, 5 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15367 Everyone was shocked at the mindless, senseless violence that we saw in Timor. We saw it on our television night after night. I, like many other people, felt absolutely frustrated about our inability to be able to do anything. SoI think it was very satisfying when in early September the INTERFET forces eventually went in there. On 15 September 1999, the Security Council voted unanimously to authorise the establishment of a multinational force under chapter 7. I think it was very important that it was under chapter 7-and I would say that only under Chapter7 could it have been successful-that the Charter of the United Nations, to be led by Australia, authorised the states participating in the multinational force ‘to take all necessary measures to fulfil its mandate’. That last point-‘to take all necessary measures to fulfil its mandate’-is very important. The force was to be known as INTERFET. This force was asked to restore peace and security in East Timor, protect and support UNAMET in carrying out its task and, within force capabilities, to facilitate humanitarian assistance in operations. The first elements of INTERFET arrived in East Timor on 20 September and, at the time of the visit by the joint standing committee, the force comprised some 9,000 personnel from 20 nations. There have been some comments on the force. Some Indonesians and others have criticised the INTERFET forces and said there was an unnecessary show of force. What did they expect? They were not going to village picnic parties. They have seen death and destruction wrought there. Bear in mind, when we are talking about these forces, in the main we are talking about young people-20-year-olds, 21-year-olds and 19-year-olds. Most of them had not been in a combat situation before. Despite all their training, unless they had actually been in a combat situation, they and their officers would not know what to expect. They did not know when they went out on the streets of Dili in the evening when they arrived how they were going to be met or what to expect. It was very important, I believe, that that show of strength be made. You have got the militants there terrorising people with all sorts of equipment. You are not at a party; you are in a life and death situation. I think that any criticism that has been directed has been unnecessary criticism. The proof has been in the result of what was achieved. They achieved the mandate that the United Nations gave them to achieve and without loss of life. I think it has been a magnificent effort and I think that the criticism that has been directed, such as it is, has been totally unwarranted. There are all sorts of questions of course coming out of the Timor exercise. One that I know my colleague the member for Chifley will probably elaborate on is this ongoing debate about whether we train our forces for peacekeeping or for combat duties. One subcommittee I unfortunately did not mention when I was listing our subcommittees is the defence subcommittee. In one of the inquiries we are holding at the moment on the suitability of the Australian forces we are grappling with this problem. You may have seen some comment in the media recently regarding New Zealand who have made a comment that they are going to train their forces for a peacekeeping role. This happened with the Canadian forces with, some say-I do not say-disastrous results over the last couple of years when the Canadians put a particular emphasis on peacekeeping. My own view is, and I think it has been shown to be true in Timor and other places, that if you train your forces for combat duties they can adapt to the peacekeeping role. That is what I feel in the main. Except for one officer who briefed us who argued very strongly that there should be training for the peacekeeping role, most of the other people I have spoken to, especially in Timor, have said that Timor showed that training for combat duties was the right decision to take. We are going to be engaged in Timor for many years. We have got a role there and other countries have got a role there. I actually have a personal resentment of the Portuguese over the whole Timor thing. It annoys me considerably when they pontificate and take the high moral ground. Always bear in mind that Portugal was a colonial power in Timor for over 400 15368 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 5 April 2000 years and, apart from teaching a bit of the Portuguese language, did absolutely nothing. The Indonesians, for maybe all the wrong reasons, did a hell of a lot more in Timor than the Portuguese ever did. This is one of the surprises that the Indonesians had in Timor. Because they had put so much infrastructure there compared with the other provinces of Indonesia, they were surprised that the Timorese were not more grateful for them. The Portuguese, when they were there, did very little but they are now taking the high moral ground. I think nothing prepares you for actually going to Timor and seeing the destruction thereeven if you have seen photographs of it. During our visit there we travelled to Suai, which is on the border. It was interesting to note that when the Australian forces arrived there-I do not know how many people were in that town, perhaps 7,000 or 8,000-there was not one person in that town. When we went there, all we saw was a blackened spot on the ground where a wooden hut or a grass hut had been and no corrugated iron left where a concrete house or something like that had been-that had all been taken away. We were flying by helicopter, and this came across very visibly to us. Interestingly, when we were returning from Suai to Dili we were caught up in quite an interesting storm and had to divert. That enabled us to fly over a couple of other towns where, again, we could see the wanton destruction throughout that area. There will be some challenges facing us in Timor. One of the great challenges now is not only the rebuilding but also employment. The young people, especially, have no work, and until we can get them doing something instead of standing around, resentment is going to build up as they see the lifestyles of some of the aid agencies in the floating hotels. So it is important that we do what we can to ensure there is work there. There has been some criticism that the UN and other aid agencies are moving too slowly, but you have to realise the level of destruction and the huge task ahead. I was criticised recently because I said that there had been some duplication within the aid agencies. I still think there is an amount of duplication, but I do acknowledge that ACFOA is doing a good job in coordinating those aid agencies. When you have over 70 aid agencies theresay, 50 from Australia and also a number from other countries-there is going to be a certain amount of duplication. But it is an important point, because there is a lot of work to do in infrastructure, schools and health-in a whole range of things. The one thing we must never overlook is the psychological impact on the people there. We have to take account of that. It is very important, too, that the rebuilding is done by Timorese. We have to have consult with them. It is their country, and we have to be aware of that. I was very worried when we had the ‘Thongs for Timor’ campaign and everyone sent in their thongs and then the ‘Teddy Bears for Timor’ campaign at Christmas. I did not criticise at the time, because I thought that was not appropriate, but it was during the rainy season and all these teddy bears-the Timorese do not celebrate Christmas as we do; Bishop Belo said that-did not fit in. I had visions of all these houses in the wet season without roofs and all these sodden teddy bears, and I thought their only advantage would be as pillows. People gave their thongs and their teddy bears with the best of intentions, but how Australian-thongs and teddy bears. What the aid agencies needed was some cash to start rebuilding and to buy things. I hope that we have learnt a few lessons from that and that we take advice from the Timorese on the rebuilding. Everyone wants the relationship with Indonesia restored, but we do not want it restored at any cost. There are problems with foreign affairs and the military, but Australian troops did not burn the villages or kill the Timorese or drive the refugees across the border, and they are not terrorising the refugees in the camps and stopping them returning from West Timor. The other point I want to make is that those responsible for the terrible violence, the violations of human rights, must be brought to account. If the UN as a world body, and world opinion, mean anything, it is no good the current government of Indonesia or anyone else Wednesday, 5 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15369 saying, ‘Look, this all happened in the past. Let’s move on to the next chapter. Let’s forget this as being in the past.’ We will not forget it as being in the past. And the reason why we will not is that we must never let this happen again. Such things will happen again; it is inevitable-the violations of human rights in so many parts of the world are a tragedy. But we must make sure that this does not happen again. Our relationship with Indonesia is important, perhaps the most important relationship that we have with any foreign power. We will re-establish that relationship, but I hope on a more realistic line. Finally, I would like to place on record my thanks to both the foreign minister and the Minister for Defence for making the trip, and especially the plane for it, available. I would like to pay a special tribute to the leader of the delegation, Senator Alan Ferguson, who led the delegation with great distinction. We were there for only a day, but all members of the delegation worked well together and since we have come back it has had an impact on us all. I pay tribute to our adviser, Lieutenant Colonel M. J. Ward, and most of all to our hard working secretary, Margaret Swieringa, who accompanied the delegation and did so much to make the trip the outstanding success which I believe it has been. Thank you very much. for Throsby left off and sincerely congratulate the leader of the delegation to East Timor, Senator Ferguson, and the deputy leader of the delegation, the member for Throsby. I reiterate our thanks to Colonel Michael Ward and to Margaret Swieringa, the secretary, who accompanied us. I think I can say for all of us who went to East Timor that it was a privilege. I would like to read into the record one bit of the report: The members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade are grateful to the members of the Australian Defence Force who have deployed to East Timor in support of INTERFET. We acknowledge the sacrifice that this entails for each of you, particularly those who will remain in East Timor over the Christmas period. You should be conscious that the thoughts and good wishes of the Australian people go out not only to you but also to your families and loved ones. We can be, and are, justifiably proud of our Defence Force and the people who comprise it. We wish you all continued success in your mission and a safe return. In a way, that sums up the report, A visit to East Timor, 2 December 1999. I can say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that as in Bougainville-to which you and I went-and in Rwanda and Somalia, to see our peacekeepers in operation makes us intensely proud to be Australians, not only because of the efficiency with which they do their job but because of the real esteem in which they are held by people who are the victims of massive human rights abuses. I would like to comment on the debate that the honourable member for Throsby talked about as to whether training should be for peacekeeping or for war. The lieutenant colonel who was attached to the committee, Simon Gould, made the very good point that there is no doubt that you need to have your fighting force trained for combat, for killing-that is what you have defence forces for; it is a most unpleasant business-but, when you are aware that there is a likely deployment, some valuable time can be spent in thinking about what the likely humanitarian or chapter 7 task is going to be and what you are likely to do, to start preparing for that. The Australian defence forces have yet to learn that lesson and it is something that we can pick up in our current report. This deployment, unlike any other, included not only full-time soldiers or ADF personnel but also some 600 reservists, and they not only served in East Timor but also filled holes back in Australia. We owe them a special thanks, particularly when you recollect the figures quoted by my colleague the shadow minister Mr Ferguson that some 20 per cent of reservists who served in the Gulf War-I think there were about 100,000-lost their jobs on return to United States. I ask the minister to keep a tally so that we have some understanding of the circumstances of people, reservists in particular, returning to Australia.",150,Representatives Main Committee
224,Mr Price (Chifley) (11.36 A.m.),"PerhapsI could take up where the honourable member15370 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 5 April 2000 I have a lot of concerns about our defence situation and the lessons that may need to be learned out of East Timor. I particularly regret that neither the Minister for Foreign Affairs nor the Minister for Defence is really putting on the table what their experiences are, what their views are and what direction they will take. The honourable member for Throsby made a point that I think is a deeply disturbing one, and that is: was there, as the government has insinuated, an intelligence failure in the likely outcome of the poll? If there was a failure, the important point is that we need to understand what that failure entailed and how it may be addressed. I still think there is some benefit in a public discussion of this and in the ministers putting the matter on the public record. But clearly, from the Four Corners program and the leaked documents, there was no intelligence failure. Where does that leave us? Given Australia knew very well the likely implications of the post-ballot period, what action did we take? It is true to say that it is without precedent that we did not have a secretary of Defence at the time. We had a secretary, Paul Barratt, who had got a good report card from Max MooreWilton and continued on in his post, and suddenly there was this confrontation with the minister. Putting that to one side, the result was that we did not have a secretary of the department. You have to understand the lengths the ADF went to, on both the military and civilian sides, to build relationships in our region. But the situation meant that that secretary could not pick up the phone and talk to his Indonesian counterpart. The other issue of concern is that I think it was also unprecedented that the calls that Minister Moore made to his counterpart, General Wiranto, were not answered. I cannot recall a precedent for this. It is most alarming. I asked what we could do with the intelligence that we had. Could we have tried to play the connections that we had made within Indonesia? Clearly that was failing; that was not possible. But it would be interesting to know the extent to which we tried. The other thing we could have tried was to call in the one power that was going to have an effect, and ultimately did have an effect, and that was America. We are not in a position to know-and we should be in a position to know-whether or not attempts were made in that direction and what the response was, for whatever reason. That is the situation. I want to say-and I want to be generous about this point-that I thought the government did a very proper thing in getting an extra brigade up for extra readiness. Some might say, ‘Well, blind Freddy could have done that.’ But they did it, and it is important that they did it. It would have been absolutely horrific had that not been done. SoI credit the government with that. I want to make this point: had our INTERFET forces been required to stay there for a longer period-some 18 months-we would have been awfully stretched. Also, I do not believe we could have handled a second emergency. From the parliament’s point of view, it is wrong to have a member of parliament speculating about these matters. Where is the ministerial statement by the Minister for Defence that discusses these issues of our rotation and our ability to sustain another operation involving quite a number of personnel, albeit not on as large a scale? There is none. Questions were asked in the parliament on several occasions about how the troops were going to be rotated. Of course, the minister was most dismissive of the issue. ‘Don’t you worry about that sort of thing’-apparently a Queensland mentality. Of course, the cat was out of the bag when one of the military officers briefed the press on rotational issues. It is disappointing that the minister could not have taken the parliament into his confidence. There is not only an issue of rotation; the issue is the extent to which we have had to scramble for equipment to get these extra units in readiness as a rotational force. What has that meant in terms of our other battalions? What is the manning level of those battalions? What is the equipment level? We do not have a picture of the actual numbers of people in battalions, their equipment level and what we need to remedy it. Here we are, in the largest deployment since Vietnam, having a debate in which we are speculating about these issues. Wednesday, 5 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15371 This should not be a matter of speculation; it should be a matter of the Minister for Defence taking the people of Australia into his confidence and saying, ‘These are the things that I confront. These are the things that we need to see opened.’ We have had two cabinet submissions lodged on the reserves. I do not know how long it has been going on, but we know it has been going on for months and months. There has been an announcement that we are going to be able to mobilise the reserve for peacekeeping. I absolutely support that. But the really difficult cabinet submission deals with the structure of the reserves and what is going to be done. Again, there is a real hiatus on the part of this government while we await the outcome of the strategic white paper. Are we saying that the government, which has commissioned the paper, which has a cabinet subcommittee dealing with the issues that will be in the white paper, has such a lack of knowledge about what the outcome will be that it cannot make critical decisions, that it cannot make a decision on the reserves? I think those decisions need to be made. I absolutely question the ADF’s proposition that the only way we should use the reserves is to fill gaps in the full-time Army. I think it is an absolute waste of our reserve potential. We have 23,000 reserves, an establishment of 30,000, and they are a phantom army. We cannot use them in the way we are supposed to use them. I do not blame this on the government but I say that we need to address this issue. We have to work out where we are going to go. I am saying that this minister and the government should be taking the people of Australia into their confidence. Do they think that we need another Ready Reserve type scheme? Or are they quite satisfied with the current situation of the reserves? I am not; the reservists are not. The Army is not. They believe radical changes need to be made. Why can’t we discuss these issues? Why is it that I am raising these issues in the House and the Minister for Defence is not putting out a statement about the current situation and the parameters for reform, so that we can have a decent debate? Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would know, the joint committee has had a tradition of bipartisanship. We think these issues of national security are so important that, irrespective of our parties, we should work together in the national interest. But you cannot work together in a vacuum. SoI am really disappointed. We have also got in the department this curious phenomenon of almost communist like self-criticism, as if they have been sent to special camps and need to confess their past sins. Any department needs to change and improve. I know this department is highly capable and professional, but still it would be the first to argue it should be improved, even significantly improved. We know that there is going to be a purge of staff. We know the Chief of Army is going; we know the CDF is going; we know the Secretary has already gone; and we know most of the deputy secretaries are on the way out. Is this the way to run such an important department, by purging the staff of the department? I have never seen a situation comparable to this. Talk to people and find out what their morale is. Here we are at a critical point in our nation’s history where we need to make some real changes, and morale is at absolute zero. Despite this, we have a minister who will not make a statement, who will not take us into his confidence, and who cannot show us his light at the end of the tunnel. We are actually demonising the submarines to such an extent that the other weekend the Prime Minister had to say, ‘I think these subs are going to be a pretty terrific purchase.’ That was the extent of the demonising of the acquisition process. More than most, I know what needs to be done to improve the acquisition and logistics process, and I support some changes there. But to get changes you do not have to demonise a department or demonise individuals. (Time expired) 15372 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 5 April 2000 comments on the report, A visit to East Timor, 2 December 1999, I feel somewhat inadequate after hearing both you and the member for Chifley. Both of you have been on so many of these critical defence visits. You have been to places like Somalia, Rwanda and East Timor. Nonetheless, as a new member I would like to make some comments that I believe take up some of the issues that both you and the member for Chifley have raised. Firstly, I would like to note that in my electorate one of the local government organisations, the City of Port Phillip, has organised what I hope will be a precursor to what many other cities in Australia will be doing: it is forming a joint relationship with the city of Suai, a city which is described in your report. In your remarks earlier you described the total destruction there, the burning down of all of the houses, the wrecking of the solid concrete buildings, and that there was not one person left in Suai when the ADF got there. Abel Guteress, the representative of the CNRT, was at the joint launch of the Port PhillipSuai relationship, and I was very proud to see a municipality in my electorate initiating such a joint relationship. I hope that such a joint relationship will be established with a lot of towns in East Timor. I note that when Senators Payne and Bourne went to Suai-they had been there earlier to do the report around the time of the referendum-they said that the TNI-sponsored violence that destroyed Suai had left the entire place, like Dili, almost totally destroyed. They had seen it before the destruction, and they saw it afterwards when they were there with your mission, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let us remember the vote on 30 August in East Timor. Ninety-eight per cent of registered voters went to the polls and, of those, seventy-eight per cent voted for independence. What a triumph for the democratic spirit that was, that in the difficult circumstances of early last year 98 per cent of the people in that country who were registered to vote voted, and despite the violence 78 per cent of them voted for independence. I know there are some difficulties with the remarks by the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, about Indonesia and East Timor and that just this week, the foreign minister has been attempting to score points off the former Prime Minister. I was not in this place when the former Prime Minister was here but I do remember seeing him and the current foreign minister, who was then the Leader of the Opposition. It seems a shame to be very courageous in attacking the former Prime Minister when he is not here. Some people would say that the current foreign minister’s courage in attacking Keating is in inverse proportion to the ability of the former Prime Minister to respond in this place and to his presence in the parliament. The Minister for Defence, Mr Moore, prior to the 30 August referendum, suggested-and so has the government-that the critical issue we should be looking at is the role that the government took in demanding that there be a referendum. They argue-and this, in my view, is a simplicity that both the members for Chifley and Throsby addressed-that, if there had not been a referendum, there would be no independence in East Timor. No-one can disagree with that. If we had demanded, they say-as the shadow minister for foreign affairs requested continually through the first half of last year-that there be a UN peacekeeping force, then there would have been no referendum. I do not think there is such a simplistic equation. The member for Chifley made a very interesting point when he focused on the inability of the Minister for Defence to get through to General Wiranto. It is interesting to note that when General Shelton, the Head of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, eventually spoke to General Wiranto on the phone afterwards he was immediately able to call off the TNI dogs of war and the violence in East Timor ceased almost immediately from the time that the head of the American Defense Force contacted General Wiranto. In a question on notice to the Minister for Defence, I asked: Since he has held the portfolio and prior to the 30 August 1999 referendum in East Timor had he (a) met with or (b) spoken in 1999 on the telephone to (i) Lt General Shelton, the Chairman of the US Joint",153,Representatives Main Committee
225,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (11.51 A.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, in making someWednesday, 5 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15373 Chiefs of Staff, or (ii) William Cohen, the US Secretary of Defense; if so, (A) when and where was or were the meeting or meetings held, (B) where was or were the telephone calls made and (C) are there any notes, memoranda or other documentation concerning the (I) meeting or meetings ... The minister confirmed in his response to me that he had, in fact, spoken to General Shelton and Mr Cohen once in the entire period between becoming the minister and the violence in East Timor. I think that once is very significant in its singularity. In my view, the Minister for Defence should have been on the phone to the Americans in that period alerting them to the situation in East Timor. I believe that the Minister for Defence met the US Joint Chief, Gen-eral Shelton, at a public gathering in Washington on 5 May and that he spoke to Secretary Cohen at the same time. I believe that there were a number of opportunities that he did not take up in that period mentioned previously by the shadow minister for foreign affairs and the shadow minister for defence, and they should have been taken up. In that historical conundrum we will find why the Indonesian military thought it could unleash its militia dogs of war. Much more positive circumstances have happened since then. I want to mention particularly the President of Indonesia, the new, democratically elected President Wahid, and his visit to Santa Cruz cemetery accompanied by the leader of the East Timorese people, Xanana Gusmao. That was a great act. It was an act of reconciliation that will perhaps in the future lead to some relationship between the Indonesian and East Timorese people being put on a more sensitive basis than the relationship has been conducted in the past. We still have some 1,500 Australian troops deployed in East Timor with the UN forces that are there. I note that 150 of them are reservists who have volunteered for full-time service and have undertaken months and months of training to achieve the kind of proficiency that our regular forces have. I can only echo what the member for Throsby and the member for Chifley said with regard to the professionalism of our forces. I have not been, as they have, to the various trouble spots in the world to see the ADF, nor have I been to Timor but recently, as the co-patron for the last several months of the Bandiana Safe Haven, which has been administered by the ADF, it has been my pleasure to see the total professionalism with which those very sensitive circumstances have been conducted. If that is their behaviour overseas, then we have everything to be proud of. I believe Australia will have a presence, perhaps not militarily, in East Timor for a long time. The situation has been calmed down to a great extent by General Cosgrove and which 25,000 troops in the TNI were not able to. I am sure the Blue Berets of the UN will continue their work, but Australia will have a relationship with East Timor that goes far beyond our military involvement and deployment there at the moment. The member for Throsby remarked rather ironically on the few people who were interested in the issue of East Timor and were able to be active in this parliament in keeping that issue alive over the last 25 years. Those people of course should be honoured, but I think the issue now has been burnt into the Australian consciousness. I hope the efforts of the municipality in my electorate in Port Phillip will be indicative of the Australian people’s attitude to people in East Timor from now on. discussion this morning. I was not part of the delegation to which this report entitled A Visit to East Timor, 2 December 1999 refers, but I was in East Timor at about the same time on a trip with the Leader of the Opposition, and I have been there on one other occasion around that time. I think the fact that this parliament has taken such an active role and that the committee was so quick to make itself available, and indeed get the support of the government to take a trip to East Timor so early, is very important. It raises significant issues, as has been pointed out by the various speakers who have made a contribution. But as someone who has been associ-",156,Representatives Main Committee
226,Mr Snowdon (Northern Territory) (12.02 P.m.),"I am very pleased to participate in this15374 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 5 April 2000 ated with this issue since 1975 and someone who has spoken in this parliament on a number of occasions prior to the East Timorese being given their independence-at least in so far as they no longer have the Indonesian occupying force as an invader-I said that the Australian community owed the East Timorese a debt of honour. That debt of honour originated in the contribution made by the East Timorese to Australia’s war effort in the protection of Australian commandos from the 2nd/2nd and 2nd/4th independent companies during 1942 and the early part of 1943. The records are clear about this. It is asserted that perhaps as many as 40,000 East Timorese died directly or indirectly as a result of the protection of a handful of Australians and there were very few casualties among those. It is therefore with some pleasure that I noted a report very recently in the media in which the East Timorese independence leader, Xanana Gusmao, gave Australia and General Cosgrove, who did such a magnificent job, high praise. He said that Australia had now repaid the historical debt owed to East Timorese soldiers killed by the Japanese in World War II for protecting Australian diggers. I quote, ‘Peter, you have now repaid the debt and we honour you for that.’ I regard that as a very important statement. It is very important for Australia to understand that, as a result of its efforts over the last while, in the minds and eyes of the East Timorese leadership we have been able to settle that debt. I do not believe we have actually settled it in whole but at least in part. The work which has been done by the Australian military in particular, needs our highest commendation and it has been given on a number of occasions by many people in this parliament, including the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, so I am not going to repeat that praise. The contribution has been recognised of General Cosgrove and the Australian troops and indeed all of the forces from the United Nations who were involved. As the member for Chifley commented, the troops who are about to move into East Timor from 6RAR will be replacing the Darwin based 5/7RAR under the control of Lieutenant Colonel Simon Gould. I just want to make the observation that these are troops from my electorate. A large number of them have been involved in East Timor since the United Nations force went in. They have done a magnificent job. I had the fortunate experience to be able to visit Lieutenant Colonel Gould in his headquarters whilst I was in Dili. I had a meal with him and met some of the troops. To me that was very important but really no more important than accepting that, whilst we give appropriate praise to these people who have been doing a very fine job in East Timor, we should also acknowledge the support that is being given to those troops by their fellow armed service personnel in Australia who, unfortunately from their point of view, were not able to share in that experience of being in East Timor, yet were vital to the success of that operation. I am now talking about the support people who have worked in and around Darwin in particular, whether military or civilian or police or customs, in assisting with the United Nations effort in East Timor. The defence force personnel who have worked their backsides off on an ongoing basis in Darwin in particular, I do not believe have received adequate recognition for the work they have done. I want to place on the public record-and I am sure it would be shared by all members of this parliament-our respect and applause for the very important and dignified way in which they have carried out their duties in supporting our personnel in East Timor. There is a range of issues which is now confronting us in relation to East Timor and I think those issues need to be recognised. We have an opportunity here, with the assistance of others, to be involved, in a very fortunate and important way, in developing a new nation. We need to acknowledge that it is a difficult task and that the East Timorese have required extreme patience in dealing with the presence of the United Nations and all the non-government organisations who have visited the community since the Indonesians withdrew. It is my belief that the United Nations administration has not been an altogether happy experience for many Wednesday, 5 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15375 people. We need to acknowledge that, whilst we see on the surface the fine works that have been done and the words uttered by key personnel within the United Nations administration, a great deal of frustration is being felt by many within the United Nations bureaucracy in East Timor about their inability to be able to deliver services as promptly as the East Timorese would expect. That is something of which we should be very mindful. It is also important-and I believe it is a very important issue for this parliament and, indeed, for this country-that there ought to be the level of expertise available to the United Nations to carry out their work. It is my humble view-and I might well be wrong-that, in selecting the key leadership personnel to be involved in the United Nations administration, they have not necessarily chosen the right people. I believe that there is a shortage of people with appropriate public policy and public administration experience within the United Nations administration. That has been the cause of a lot of frustration. I have been involved directly in providing assistance in the form of getting gowns and wigs for judges in East Timor and in providing contact for people to provide furniture for these judges so that they can furnish their courts. I would have thought that was pretty pathetic, given the nature and importance of the maintenance of law and order. You would have expected that the United Nations would have moved heaven and earth to ensure that the resources were made available so that these judges and other court officials could be properly kitted out so that they could undertake their functions in an appropriate way. That was not done. That was no fault of the people in charge of that part of the operation in East Timor. It was simply as a result of the failure of the United Nations administration to ensure that funds were made available and that those resources were appropriately allocated so that the work could be properly done. It is also worth noting that there is a deal of dissatisfaction within elements of the United Nations administration about some of the policies which are being pursued within it. I note a report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 13 March relating to infighting involving senior United Nations staff. It asserts that this is threatening the transition to independence. I believe that is true. I believe that much more needs to be done in terms of auditing the United Nations’ performance in East Timor. Indeed, Australians should have a particular interest in that audit function. We need to be concerned that what we understood to be happening in East Timor is in fact happening. I am uncertain, frankly, whether the United Nations administration in East Timor is properly audited or, indeed, how the United Nations administration as a whole in relation to the East Timorese operation-that is, the headquarters in New York and the administration in Dili-is being monitored in terms of evaluating the outcomes of the investment which is being made. I quote from the article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 13 March: The policy dispute has led to the resignation of the UN’s head of district administration, who claims “Stalinist” and “colonialist” practises by several senior staff members are jeopardising the UN mission. I know quite a few people who work within the United Nations administration and I have to say that, sadly, that view reflects theirs: there is potential for a real problem. We need to make very clear, through our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, what we think are acceptable performance criteria for the United Nations. There are very willing people involved in working with the United Nations in East Timor who are keen to facilitate the transition in a way which is acceptable not only to the international community but, most importantly, to the people of East Timor. I could say a great deal more about that but I will address, briefly, just one very important matter, the role of entrepreneurs who are going into East Timor. We should be very aware that there are a lot of carpetbaggers and spivs who have made it their will and their intention to rip off the East Timorese and the international community, and we have got to be concerned that these people may be given credibility by the Australian media. I have heard a story which is very unsettling to me, that a reputable organisation from Australia went into East Timor in 15376 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 5 April 2000 October or November, made an arrangement with a person who occupied a dwelling that they could use that dwelling for administrative purposes and subsequently, through a range of processes, demolished the dwelling and built a hotel. This was without the approval, I understand, of the United Nations, the local administration or the person who owned the property. It seems to me that, if this sort of practice is happening, we as Australians should be most concerned. I note a report from the Age of 26 February of some words by a leading East Timorese businessman, Oscar Lima, a person whom I know: Oscar Lima says business is welcome, but only in legitimate joint ventures that ensure some profits stay with the Timorese people. Anyone seeking a quick buck need not apply, he says. “You see, we’ve heard it before. In the old days the Indonesians said they were going to come here and help the Timorese. In the end they left nothing, they took everything, and left us here to start again from zero. This time we want people who are going to help us, to teach us, to assist us and when they leave us we have something to continue on with.” That should be a fundamental objective. We should be most concerned that any Australian businesses which are seeking to operate in East Timor do so with the highest regard to their obligations to the East Timorese community and to the Australian community. (Time expired) Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on its report A visit to East Timor, 2 December 1999. This very useful report covers a range of issues arising from the led by General Cosgrove. I would like to address just a couple of issues which arise from the report and which are related to it. The first concerns the events leading up to the initial deployment of INTERFET; the second is our current delivery of aid to East Timor, and in that respect I note and support the comments just made by my colleague the member for the Northern Territory; and the third is our aid delivery and broader diplomacy as it relates to the repatriation of the 100,000 East Timorese still resident in refugee camps in West Timor. On the first of these questions, which is the events leading up to the INTERFET deployment last September, I noted carefully and support entirely the comments made by my colleague the member for Chifley on this point earlier in this debate. There was no failure of intelligence, as far as the Australian intelligence community is concerned, about a probable range of scenarios which could have ensued after the conduct of the ballot on East Timorese independence on 30 August 1999. What we do not know, however, is the nature of the analysis made by the Australian policy community in response to that intelligence, nor do we know precisely, in all the detail, the arguments underpinning the precise nature of the government’s response to the analysis thus delivered. I am not privy to the intelligence traffic, I am not privy to the policy analysis undertaken, nor am I privy to the ultimate policy advice provided to the government and the basis for it. I have, however, worked in this sphere for many years in a previous incarnation. I would simply observe, as an external analyst of those events, that it was an entirely credible scenario that, in the event of the East Timorese voting decisively for an independence outcome on 30 August last year, there would be an adverse reaction by pro-Indonesian militia and that that could or would have been supported by the regular armed forces of the Republic of Indonesia, TNI. It was not necessarily the case that that would have been the only scenario but, using the tools of credible policy and intelligence analysis, it was a credible scenario which could have ensued. The government’s policy response to the intelligence that it was receiving seems, to the external observer, to have been one which was primarily driven by hope over analysis; a hope that things would turn out in the end; a hope that, if there was a strong and decisive vote for independence on 30 August, the Indonesian government of the time, exercising command and",157,Representatives Main Committee
227,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (12.18 P.m.),"I rise in the Main Committee today to congratulate theWednesday, 5 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15377 control, as it hoped, over the Indonesian armed forces at the time, would have accepted the outcome of the verdict and simply packed up and gone home. As we know from the events which did ensue, that did not occur. The argument which I wish to advance today is simply what could have occurred and should have occurred in the immediate weeks prior to 30 August last year and immediately subsequent to it. I refer to the specific diplomatic challenge which existed at that time-given there was a credible scenario that things would go radically wrong after 30 August in terms of the maintenance of security within Dili and elsewhere in East Timor-on the negotiation of heads of agreement of a prospective and possible multinational force for immediate deployment to East Timor should that scenario have unfolded. As I said before, the government seems to have operated at the time on the assumption that it would all work out in the end. When it unfolded that it did not work out in the end, the previous policy position of hope over analysis seems to have yielded to one of panic over analysis, because what then unfolded was the unsightly public performance of a prime minister and a foreign minister publicly negotiating with the President of the United States and the Secretary of State of the United States about when, if and in what form the United States would participate in any military deployment in East Timor. The member for Melbourne Ports, who spoke earlier in this debate, made similar observations, which I would support. There was a mad scramble to cobble togetherA division having occurred in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 12.24 p.m. to 12.50 p.m. Timor immediately after the independence ballot on 30 August last year, there was not an orderly policy response from the government to what was previously quite a conceivable scenario. What we saw, in fact, was a mad scramble to try to cobble together two things: at the diplomatic level, a coalition at the United Nations in order to obtain the necessary mandate to underpin any subsequent deployment of an international force; and, secondly and simultaneously, a credible multinational force capable of giving execution to such a mandate. As I said before, we saw the public manifestation of all this when the Prime Minister and the foreign minister became engaged in a public debate with representatives of the US administration on the extent of US participation in such a multinational force. In fact, this was handled in such a manner that it led to something approaching an Australian public opinion confidence crisis in the ultimate underpinnings of the alliance. We had been taught for generations in this country that if we were part of the ANZUS alliance and Australia found itself in difficulty, under the terms and spirit of the treaty, military assistance from the United States could comfortably be relied upon. Short of the formal terms and operational clauses of the treaty, the treaty had nonetheless provided a framework within which such consultations could occur over a long period of time. The disturbing thing from the analytical community’s perspective is: what substantively did the government, prior to the events of 30 August and the two weeks subsequent to it, do in their highest level diplomatic communications with the administration in Washington? The Prime Minister, not long before then, had visited Washington and met with President Clinton. We presume that the foreign minister, Mr Downer, had met on a number of occasions with his US counterpart. We presume also that there had been some contact between the Australian defence minister, Mr Moore, and his American contact. What we know as an empirical fact is that by the time we got to the first week after 30 August last year, when all of Australia could see on their television sets that the security situation in East Timor was falling apart at the seams, the plain reality was that we had no heads of agreement for any level of military cooperation with the United States, nor any public statement from them in terms of the extent that",160,Representatives Main Committee
228,Mr Rudd,"When events turned sour on the ground in Dili and in other parts of East15378 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 5 April 2000 they were willing to participate in such a force. Things became so desperate that we had public beratings of President Clinton by the Australian Prime Minister as the Australian public and community reaction became more intense. As I said in my earlier remarks, I, as a member of the opposition, was not privy to any of the diplomatic communications which occurred at this time, nor to the precise content of the intelligence despatches which would have been delivered to the government here in Canberra, as well as, I presume, in part if not in whole, shared with the US administration in Washington. However, at about that time. I actually had the chance to meet with the chairman of the US House Subcommittee on Asia and Pacific Affairs, which is a subcommittee of the House Foreign Relations Committee of the US Congress. I had extensive discussions with him in Sydney and some later discussions with him here in Canberra. This was just prior to the events of 30 August. The discussion was about possible US participation in such a force should the scenario which I referred to earlier in my address to the Main Committee today actually come to pass. Very interestingly, the congressman’s response to me was that there was zero possibility of the United States participating in an up-front military involvement with Australia. There would be some capacity for the United States, he told me at that stage, to participate in the provision of heavy lift capacity in order to deliver international troops to East Timor as well as broader support in communications and intelligence. However, the proposition that there would be American foot soldiers landing on the equivalent of Omaha Beach with Australian diggers in the deployment of an INTERFET force was not on the radar screen of possibilities. I would submit that the chairman of the relevant US house subcommittee on this matter was in a position of reasonable authority to speak on these questions. His reasons were simply that this was our theatre of engagement and the US was more than happy to play a support role but not a direct role. That conversation occurred just prior to 30 August, yet for the two weeks subsequent to 30 August we had the Prime Minister and the foreign minister engaged in this extraordinary public diplomacy, the implication and often stated assumption of which was that a credible US deployment would only consist of troops on the ground. The consequence of this was that we had, for a period in excess of a week, coming out of the Prime Minister’s management of this diplomacy, a substantial public questioning in Australia of the continued relevance of this alliance. What the Australian public were not aware of was that at a substantive level the US was never going to commit to troops on the ground, whatever the public rhetoric of the Australian government may have been at the time. I believe the Australian government should have brought the Australian community into the picture, there and then, that this was not a prospect. But instead we had some damage done to public standing of the alliance. This is not a view held uniquely by me; it is a view held by others, who have professional custodianship for the US-Australia bilateral relationship. There was a second consequence of the failure on Australia’s part, at a private diplomatic level prior to the events of 30 August, to have a heads of agreement as to precisely what would constitute the elements of a force in being. That consequence was that what General Wiranto and others saw on their television screens from Jakarta was a weak and divided rabble which was the broader international community of nations’ response to the unfolding security scenario on the streets of Dili and elsewhere in East Timor. We can safely conclude that when General Wiranto saw one thing-weakness, and a lack of resolve and of unity on the part of the countries which were interested in possibly participating in such a forceWiranto’s response on that basis was that TNI, supporting the militia, could afford to continue the sorts of tactics which they were then adopting and which, as we know, were highly destructive, in terms not just of the civilian population but also of the public infrastructure of Indonesia. Wednesday, 5 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15379 We know also that the only time at which Wiranto and others finally took heed of the international community’s reaction and acceded, through the Indonesian government, to the deployment of an international force under a UN mandate, was when the US administration got on the telephone to him and told him the game was up. My simple thesis, as it relates to those critical events at that critical time juncture, is this: there was a failure of Australian diplomacy. Those sorts of communications should have been held on the basis of credible scenario planning well prior to 30 August-even two weeks prior to 30 August would have been sufficient-so that, if that scenario unfolded in the first week of September, as subsequently proved to be the case, then both the negotiations with the Americans on the composition of a military force and the appropriate statements to be made by the US administration to Indonesia would have been secured, and we would probably not have seen the level of destruction and loss of life that we saw in the period which followed. We have seen in the House of Representatives this week some extraordinary performances by the foreign minister, criticising former Prime Minister Keating and others associated with his administration in terms of their knowledge of Asia. I would simply suggest that we would have faced a much greater crisis in our diplomacy in the region, and in relation to East Timor, had the minister’s diplomacy not been masked to some extent by the professionalism of his department and the professionalism of General Cosgrove on the ground. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Neville) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 12.59 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Health: Hearing Impairment Programs (Question No. 885) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 26 August 1999: (1) Will he provide details on the level and effectiveness of Government programs since 1996 designed to deal with hearing impairment within the indigenous community. (2) What funds have been allocated to hearing services since 1996, and what proportion of those funds was used to service the needs of the indigenous community. (3) What proportion of funding for hearing services was used in programs to prevent hearing impairment in Aboriginal children. (4) Will he provide details of hearing impairment programs to prevent the onset of hearing impairment for indigenous children. (5) Is he able to say how long it will be before it will be possible to provide preventative medicine for all newborn indigenous children so that they do not contract hearing impairment diseases. (6) Are future programs proposed to eradicate all acquired hearing impairment from the indigenous communities; if so, what are the details. (1) The Government’s approach to hearing impairment within Indigenous communities is based on recognising the importance of primary health care in preventing ear diseases which may lead to hearing loss, and the provision of hearing services to assist where hearing impairment has occurred. General Primary Health Focus The Department of Health and Aged Care has developed a comprehensive long-term strategic framework for improving Indigenous health. Implicit in this framework is the recognition that there are no easy or quick solutions in the area of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. The strategy has four main components: Developing the infrastructure and resources necessary to achieve comprehensive and effective primary health care for Indigenous peoples; Addressing some of the specific health issues and risk factors affecting the health status of Indigenous peoples; Improving the evidence base which underpins the health interventions; and Improving communication with primary health care services, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the general population. Achievement of the first component is primarily through the funding and development of a national network of Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations. As the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations provide comprehensive primary health care, it is not possible to report on the extent to which resources in any service are specifically committed towards the prevention, identification and treatment of hearing impairment among Indigenous people. The Commonwealth has increased the level of funding provided through the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health from $130.6m in 1996/97 to $155.2m in 1998/99 with a further increase announced in the May 1999 budget of approximately $100m over the next four years. Hearing Strategy Building on the national network of Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations and in response to recommended goals of the National Aboriginal Health Strategy (1989), the Minister in December 1996 approved implementation of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Hearing Strategy 1995/96 – 1998/1999.",161,Representatives Main Committee
229,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The aim is to provide a strategic approach to improving Indigenous hearing health by targeting children 0-5 years through primary health care organisations, with a focus on hearing and broader child health services. The strategy consists of four main elements: Child Hearing Health Sites : 30 Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations were identified as the Child Hearing Health Sites to incorporate hearing screening and treatment into a comprehensive 0-5 year old child health program. Specialist hearing health workers have been employed in some centres to improve coordination and continuity of care between health care and education sectors at the regional level. Equipment and Training : An audiometric equipment and two-stage training program is being provided to Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations funded by the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (OATSIH). The equipment and training program is delivered by Australian Hearing Services through a MOU with OATSIH. Since 1996, 466 Aboriginal Health Workers have participated in hearing health training, with 191 Aboriginal Health Workers having completed both stages of the training program; To date, 95 sets of audiometric equipment have been issued to Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations together with an ongoing equipment maintenance and calibration regime. Capital Infrastructure Program : Soundproof testing facilities have been provided in 15 Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations (with a further 14 awaiting completion) to improve access to community based specialist hearing testing facilities. Strategic Research : The Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health in conjunction with the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Aboriginal community controlled health sector, have undertaken a process to identify agreed best practice evidence based protocols for secondary and tertiary treatment for hearing impairment. This has provided a framework for a more strategic approach to hearing health research which reflects the importance of otitis media and hearing impairment as a key health issue in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. In addition, this shifts the historical focus from medical and epidemiological issues to service delivery and action-oriented research. Two projects in this area have recently been funded through the NHMRC. An evaluation of the hearing services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, involving the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health and the Office of Hearing Services will be conducted this financial year. (2) As indicated above, it is not possible to identify, from the funding provided to Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations, the proportion going towards Indigenous hearing activities specifically. These services adopt a holistic approach to primary health care of which hearing health is but one component. The 1995/96 Federal Budget allocated $5.7m over four years for the specific Hearing Strategy described above for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. Australian Hearing Services (the public hearing services provider) is funded to provide a range of services as ‘community service obligations’ (CSOs). Last financial year total funding for ‘community service obligations’ was $26m. The funding is for the provision of hearing services to Australian young adults and children up to 21 years of age; eligible adults with special needs or living in remote areas; eligible Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; and for research. It is estimated that 2728 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people received services from Australian Hearing Services in 1998-99 through the CSO funding. In addition, about 100 applicants (out of a total of 130,000 applications for a Hearing Services Voucher received by the Office of Hearing Services) identified as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults and received hearing services through the Voucher System. These numbers are almost certainly an underestimate because they are derived from self-identification by the client on the Voucher Application Form. (3) As already noted, Australian Hearing Services is funded to provide a range of functions that together are called ‘community service obligations’. Last financial year total funding for ‘community service obligations’ was $26m. The Government currently does not specify how the funding is to be broken down against these groups, but expenditure on all children (including Indigenous people) was approximately $17m in 1998-99. (4) Australian Hearing Services has a full-time National Indigenous Services Manager. In each State and Territory there is a senior audiologist who is the Australian Hearing Services Indigenous Programs Co-ordinator. Each Australian Hearing Services Hearing Centre has a designated Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander contact officer. All of these people work closely with local Indigenous community organisations and individuals. Australian Hearing Services works collaboratively with various government and non-government agencies who are also involved in the provision of services to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. An example of this would be the Australian Hearing Services program of assistance to the Tiwi people on Bathurst Island, where they work closely with the Menzies School of Hearing Research and the Northern Territory Health Department. During 1998-99 Australian Hearing Services audiologists made a total of 260 visits to 97 Indigenous communities and sites. Many of these visits were for a period of up to one week. Specialist audiologists who deal with these children are able to relate to and work with Indigenous individuals and communities, and to have a thorough knowledge of otitis media and its sequelae, especially as it affects Indigenous children. Services are delivered to Indigenous Australians either in a Hearing Centre, or through an extensive outreach program. There is emphasis on working with the family and community to get the best outcomes. Ongoing arrangements for outreach services are negotiated with the community, taking into account the numbers of new and on-going clients who require services, and the level of support required by Aboriginal Health Workers and teachers. Australian Hearing Services also provides appropriate individual and classroom amplification devices. (5) Essentially there is no medicine to absolutely prevent hearing impairment diseases which are the result of the interaction of a complex number of factors. Factors including inadequate accommodation, overcrowding and limited access to clean water, contribute to high rates of cross-infection. Poor diets also place the population at risk because of lower immunity to infection. (6) In addition to the above, in October 1998 the Government, recognising the need for further research in this area of hearing health for Indigenous people, called for expressions of interest to conduct research into the priority areas identified as primary prevention, secondary prevention, social and behavioural factors and surgical issues. The criteria used in the selection process included, in addition to scientific merit and relevance to the objectives of the program, three others specifically identified as relevant to research in Indigenous health. These were the transferability and sustainability of the research and the level of community participation. The two projects recently approved for NHMRC funding include a focus on the major priority areas identified for research including surgical and social/behavioural issues. The first project at $178,840 to be administered by the Kimberley Public Health Unit is to conduct a two-year scientific project; “Evaluation of tympanoplasty in Aboriginal children in WA and factors associated with successful outcome”. The project will evaluate the outcome of operations done to repair ear drums in Aboriginal children and identify factors associated with a successful outcome. The second project at $153,458 to be administered by TVW Telethon Institute of Child Health Research is to conduct a two-year scientific project; “Socioeconomic risk factors and treatment-seeking behaviour for otitis media in the Aboriginal population of Kalgoorlie-Boulder region.” The project will investigate socioeconomic factors predisposing to ear infections and their effect on compliance with treatment in Indigenous populations of the Kalgoorlie-Boulder region. Aged Persons Saving Bonus: Qualification (Question No. 1068) Mr Ripoll asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 6 December 1999: (1) How many aged persons does the Government estimate will qualify for the Aged Persons Saving Bonus component under subsection 12(1) the A New Tax System (Bonuses for Older Australians) Act. (2) How many qualifying persons does the Government expect will receive less than $500 under the scheme. (3) How many aged pensioners does the Government expect will receive no bonus at all. (4) How many self-funded retirees does the Government estimate will be eligible to receive the SelfFunded Retirees Supplementary Bonus component pursuant to subsection 12(2) of the A New Tax System (Bonuses for Older Australians) Act. (5) How many qualifying self-funded retirees does the Government estimate will receive less than $500 under the scheme. (6) How many self-funded retirees does the Government expect will receive nothing at all. (1) 1,160,340. (2) 838,818. (3) This will be known once the final number of claimants is known. (4) and (5) Subsection 12(2) refers to Family and Community Services customers of aged pension age, who are neither in the tax nor social security system. Between 15,000 and 20,000 of such persons are estimated to receive the Self-Funded Retirees Supplementary Bonus. Of these, few are expected to receive less than $500 of the Self-Funded Retirees Supplementary Bonus, as they are expected to have savings and investment income and spouse income high enough so as to make them ineligible for the pension. (6) The Department of Treasury does not hold income information for the entire Australian population of self-funded retirees. As such, it is unable to reliably estimate the number of self-funded retirees who will receive no bonus at all. Prospect Electorate: Nursing Homes and Aged Person Hostels (Question No. 1106) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Aged Care, upon notice, on 9 December 1999: (1) Enter all parts of the question as they appear on the notice (2) How many nursing homes and aged person hostels are there within the electoral division of Prospect. (3) How many of these nursing homes and aged person hostels are operated by (a) private companies and (b) church organisations. (4) What sum of Commonwealth funding did each nursing home and aged person hostel within the electoral division of Prospect receive in (a) 1999-2000, (b) 1998-99, (c) 1997-98 and (d) 1996-97. (5) How many beds are there in each nursing home and aged person hostel. (6) How many beds are being used in each nursing home and aged person hostel. (7) How many beds were there in each nursing home and aged person hostel in (a) 1998-99, (b) 1997-98 and (c) 1996-97. (8) How many persons are on waiting lists for each nursing home and aged person hostel. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The answers to questions 1 to 6 are provided on the attached table. Question7 cannot be answered as we do not collect information on waiting lists, which are managed by individual residential care services. I am releasing this information in respect of 1996-97 and 1997-98 under the National Health Act as being in the public interest. 97 98 Needs bits from TO 1996 / 1997 1996 / 97 OUT_ELECTOR OUT_OUTLET_I OUT_NAM SumOfPAY_AMO ATE D E UNT PARK LODGE 7 1 8 D NURSING 129 8 107 6 HOME",168,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice

231,Mr Moore,"The Minister for Industry, Science and Resources has provided the followingAccording to IP Australia’s records, both the patent and the application have lapsed. (3) There are a large number of Australian and international companies involved in underground mining. My Department does not have details of the particular types of technology all these companies are using. (4) The Government is not in a position to determine the value of this intellectual property. This is a matter determined by the market, and is dependent on many factors. Success in the marketplace is the ultimate test of the commercial worth of an invention. Mobile Phones: Contract Complaints (Question No. 1275) Ms Hall asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 16 March 2000: (1) Have mobile phone complaints increased by 42% nation-wide in the last twelve months. (2) Do the majority of complaints relating to mobile phones relate to users not being made aware of the terms and conditions of the contracts they have entered into. (3) What action is the Government taking to ensure that users are aware of the terms and conditions of their contracts. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: The Government does not have data on the total number of complaints about mobile phone contracts and therefore cannot confirm whether complaints have increased by 42%. The Government would expect that most complaints would be made directly to the telephone company. Complaints may also be made to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO), the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), and various State and Territory courts and tribunals such as the New South Wales Office for Fair Trading. As the Government is not a party to complaints made to telephone companies, the TIO, the ACCC or State and Territory agencies it is unable to confirm whether the majority of complaints regarding contracts relate to users not being made aware of the terms and conditions. The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts sought input from the TIO and the ACCC regarding complaints related to mobile telephones, and in particular complaints relating to contracts. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO), the body responsible for handling complaints about mobile phones that are not resolved by the telephone company, has supplied the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts with a breakdown of mobile telephone complaints received by them over the last two years: . In the period 1 March 1998 to 28 February 1999 4,782 complaints about mobile telephone services were received by the TIO; and . For the period 1 March 1999 to 29 February 2000 the total number of complaints rose by 22% to 6,150: . Over this period the proportion of complaints related to mobile telephone contracts remained steady at around 63% of all complaints to the TIO. This suggests the increase in complaints to the TIO is probably due to a greater awareness by consumers of the TIO scheme, and not due to increasing problems with mobile contracts. The ACCC has informed the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts that it received 241 complaints regarding mobile telephones for the period 1 March 1998 to 1 March 1999. In the period 1March 1999 to 1 March 2000 the total number of complaints received by the ACCC increased by 13% to 278. The ACCC is not able to say how many of these complaints related to contracts. There are a number of existing safeguards to protect consumers from unfair or misleading contracts: . The Australian Communications Authority (ACA) has made a requirement that all telephone services, including mobile telephone services, that are supplied under a standard form of agreement must be accompanied by a plain language statement outlining the terms and conditions of the agreement.",173,Sparc2822 Nyora 251130 02 97 10 Prospect Gardens Nursing Home Sparc2822 Nyora 360976 14 Fy96 97 Prospect Gardens Nursing Home
232,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the ArtsAt present mobile telephones that are supplied on individual contracts do not have to be accompanied by such a statement. . General rights under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA). The TPA is administered by the ACCC. . Access to the TIO scheme. . Industry codes of practice developed by the telecommunications industry’s self-regulatory body: the Australian Communications Industry Forum (ACIF). In September 1999 the Communications Law Centre (CLC) released a report into the usage of mobile phones by young people. This work, which was funded jointly by the Commonwealth Government and the Victorian Consumer Credit Fund, found that a large number of young consumers did not fully understand the individual contracts that they were asked to sign. The CLC report recommended that: . All mobile phone contracts should be accompanied by a plain language statement explaining the terms and conditions of the agreement; and . The Australian Communications Industry Forum (ACIF), the telecommunications industry’s selfregulatory body, should develop an industry code of practice that: Incorporates the plain language statement explaining the terms and conditions of the agreement; and Includes a cooling off period, and guidelines allowing consumers to change mobile plans without penalty, other than the reasonable costs of effecting the transfer. The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts subsequently wrote to the Chief Executive Officer of ACIF on 21 January 2000 to draw its attention to the findings of the CLC report. The Government believes that ACIF, as the telecommunications industry self-regulatory authority, is the appropriate organisation to develop a code of practice for mobile telephone contracts. If ACIF chose not to develop a code of practice for mobile telephone services the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts may issue a Direction to the Australian Communications Authority to develop a compulsory code of practice that all telephone companies must adhere to.",174,Sparc2822 Nyora 251130 02 97 10 Prospect Gardens Nursing Home Sparc2822 Nyora 360976 14 Fy96 97 Prospect Gardens Nursing Home
