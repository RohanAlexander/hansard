I support the comments of our Prime Minister, who while opening National Carers Week said: The great thing about what you are doing here is giving a truly personal dimension to what is an extraordinary national story. The story of carers in our country is a narrative about Australia itself, it’s a narrative also about those who provide that care individually and each story is different. One statistic I found amazing is that around five per cent of Australians under the age of 25-that is, 350,000 young people-provide care for another person. Furthermore, Thursday, 13 November 2008 ----North Sydney: Graffiti immense damage to the appearance of properties and infrastructure and can reduce the degree of pride and comfort that residents have in their own neighbourhoods. TodayI want to talk briefly about the campaign of one of my constituents, Mr Peter Nardone, to reduce the capacity of aerosol cans-the favoured implement of graffiti vandals-to be used for this illicit purpose. Mr Nardone is one of those people who reached the end of their tether after his business premises were continuously vandalised with graffiti. He set his mind to thinking of ways to make it harder for people to use aerosol cans for that purpose. His solution is an invention which would prevent aerosol cans from being refilled and also prevent spray nozzles from being replaced with nozzles that better serve those intent on vandalising people’s property. Normal spray nozzles on aerosol paint cans spray paint widely and in a fine mist, and obviously are not designed to be used for graffiti. But they can be easily replaced. I was shocked to learn that there is a thriving market in nozzles specifically designed for graffiti that can be easily purchased over the internet. Graffiti vandals simply remove the nozzles and replace them with the ones specifically tailored for their needs. You only have to do a quick Google search to find hundreds of suppliers. That is why Mr Nardone has been campaigning to Standards Australia to alter the standards for aerosol dispensers to ensure that, firstly, these products are incapable of being refilled and reused and, secondly, that the nozzles are tamperproof-in other words, they cannot be replaced with nozzles specifically designed for graffiti. It has been something of a personal crusade by Mr Nardone to get action in this area. Unfortunately, his efforts have so far been unsuccessful. While Standards Australia has given him a hearing, it has not been prepared to change the standards in a way that would mandate this approach. There are always a million reasons not to do something, but my concern is that the greater good of reducing graffiti has been sidelined, particularly by Standards Australia. All levels of government must work together in tackling graffiti, and I urge the regulatory authorities and the federal government to ensure that their actions are helping rather than hindering the efforts of state and local authorities in deterring graffiti vandals. Shortland Electorate: Redhead Centenary Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.32 am)-This year is a very important year for Redhead, which is a very special place in the Shortland electorate. It is very important because it is the centenary year of the Redhead Surf Lifesaving Club and the centenary year of the Redhead Public School. On 31 OctoberI attended Redhead Public School’s ceremony to celebrate its centenary. At that assembly, captains of the school from the 1980s opened a time capsule that had been sealed 25 years previously. It was really interesting to see the information that came out of that time capsule. Redhead is a very special place. It is one of those places that has managed to keep its identity.

The working of the mine was very much a part of the way the community survived and lived. It was the lifeblood of the community. The school still has that very special feeling about it. It was a wonderful day. There were celebrations by the children and considerable reference to the history and the past events of the school. It has been a year of celebration by the school. In December this year Redhead Surf Lifesaving Club celebrates its centenary. It was formed on 12 December 1908 by the residents of Dudley Redhead. The first president was GH Thomas and the first secretary was EJ Doyle. It was actually the fifth surf club to be formed in the Newcastle area. Redhead Surf Lifesaving Club is a very special club. It is a very strong club-it is the strongest club in the Hunter. It has performed very well at the state titles and at the national titles. It is a club that performs well not only in competition but also in patrols on the beach. On 12 December it will be 100 years old. On6 December there will be celebrations of the club’s centenary.

Kingston Electorate: Remembrance Day Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (9.38 am)-This week we observed our national day of remembrance for the many service men and women who left their homes and their loved ones to fight in a foreign land for their country. This year’s Remembrance Day also marks the 90th anniversary of the end of World War I, a war in which more than 60,000 Australians lost their lives-at Gallipoli, on the Western Front, in the Middle East, on the high seas and in the airmaking their final resting places in foreign soil. In 2002 I had the privilege of visiting the Gallipoli Peninsula, where I visited the battlefields where many Australians fought and also the cemeteries where many Australians have been laid to rest. On this visit I was particularly struck by some of the photos that sat at the top of the tombstones. What especially struck me was how young some of these men who bravely fought for the country were. These young men paid the ultimate sacrifice on the battlefield, many of them never having the chance to fulfil their full potential or have a family. A further 156,000 men were wounded, gassed or taken prisoner. I think it is very important to remember some of these casualties as well. These figures are immense losses, and striking, considering that Australia had a population of less than five million people at the time. In my electorate, more and more people are participating in ANZAC Day services and Remembrance Day services. This is in part due to the great work that the local RSLs do, and this includes the Christies Beach-Port Noarlunga RSL, the McLaren Vale RSL, the Morphett Vale RSL, the Willunga RSL and the Beachvale naval association, who do a great job in providing education to the wider community about the sacrifices that were made by the Australian service men and women. As parliament was sitting, I was unable to attend the Remembrance Day services that took part in my electorate in the McLaren Vale memorial park, the City of Onkaparinga Memorial Gardens and the Christies Beach-Port Noarlunga RSL. However, I am informed by people that did attend that these were very emotional and moving services. 11 November is an important day for Australians to remember and certainly, as I have also heard from my electorate, there were many services held in schools around my electorate. I think we need to remember the contribution and sacrifice of the Australian soldiers and their families, and this continues more recently in the sacrifices made by our soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. Successive generations uphold the values for which these brave Australians fought and I think we need to acknowledge that the spirit and dedication in Australia lives on.

The city of Liverpool today is a vibrant city on the move. The current population is estimated to be over 155,000, up from 120,000 in 1996. Liverpool is also one of the largest growing local government areas in New South Wales. More than 56,000 new residents have made Liverpool their home in the last 10 years and population projections predict that Liverpool’s population will reach 260,000 by 2019. Liverpool is also a young and diverse city. The median age is 20 years, a third of the population is 19 years or younger, 38 per cent of the Liverpool population was born overseas and 62 per cent of the population speaks a language other than English. But because of its youth Liverpool has a strong family focus, with 88 per cent of people living in family households. Couple families with children make up 71 per cent of family households, with only 4.5 per cent of the Liverpool population made up of lone person households. I would like to congratulate the new Mayor of Liverpool, Her Worship Councillor Wendy Waller, and the new deputy mayor, Councillor Peter Harle, on their election. I would also like lam Gillani, Mr Tony Hadchiti, Ms Nadia Napoletano, Mr Ned Mannoun, Mr Mazhar Hadid, Ms Anne Stanley and Mr Jim McGoldrick-on their personal commitment to serving the people of Liverpool and on their successful election to office.

I look forward to working with the new councillors for the advancement of the people of the shared representative area of responsibility that we have in the greater city of Liverpool. HMAS Sydney Australia) (9.44 am)-Rockingham is home to Fleet Base West. Rockingham produced a proud son awarded a VC in World War II and we are home to many of the 2,000 young Australian men and women who serve in our forces overseas. We are home to some of the brave young men of Western Australia’s own 11th Battalion, whose distinguished service began when they received enemy fire as the first ashore at Gallipoli, providing cover for the ANZAC landings 93 years ago. One of the tragic mysteries for Australia has been the disappearance of and the search for HMAS Sydney. Today we are closer than ever to discovering what happened on 19 November 1941 when all hands were lost, 645 brave men of the Royal Australian Navy. Sydney’s loss created a lifetime of mixed emotions in our community, the unending devastation to family and friends, lives destroyed and dreams of youth lost forever, and lifelong struggles over whether the Sydney would or should ever be found. It took some time for family members to know that HMAS Sydney was lost. Telegrams were being received as Pearl Harbour was bombed on 7 December. Ten weeks after that, Darwin was bombed. The war was at our front door. In Rockingham, Leslie Taylor told me about losing his 21-year-old brother, Able Seaman Kenneth George Taylor. In November 1941 Les was a 17-year-old serving with the coastal guns stationed at Rottnest Island. The loss of his brother was crushing. He knew the Sydney had gone down after a fierce battle but how could his brother have gone with it? Les says it left a hole in his life.

Les Taylor is 84 this year. He donated $100 towards the search effort when he heard they were looking for the Sydney: ‘I wanted them to find her,’ he said. Les describes the finding of the Sydney as the best day of his life. He described it as being a relief to know at last where they are. Barbara Woods was the 14-year-old little sister of Ray, who also served on the Sydney. Barbara remembers her mother getting the telegram. She remembers the confusion and the search for her 22-year-old brother. She remembers never having closure. Barbara told me of her sense of relief at seeing the pictures of the Sydney in the newspapers and on TV and of now knowing what happened to her brother Ray. War creates loss, uncertainty and unending devastation for families. It creates many stories like that of the Sydney. But for Les and Barbara 19 November 2008 has special meaning. Now they know what happened, where and how. In Rockingham on 19 November we will hold special commemorative ceremonies and also two public information lectures to describe to the residents of Rockingham, a Navy town, what happened that day in 1941-so not only will closure be created; the people will also have more knowledge about those events. Naltrexone Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (9.47 am)-I wish to raise the issue of Dr George O’Neil’s Naltrexone clinic and the dire need there is for urgent funding approval by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. As I mentioned in May this year, Dr O’Neil’s clinic does a magnificent job in producing implants, administering them and providing the vital follow-up services to help drug addicts and alcoholics reform their whole lives and become functioning members of society. The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided information on the current level of federal funding, which is about three-quarters of a million dollars. However, Dr O’Neil estimates that it costs $2 million to $3 million a year to produce the implants and treat the patients who come to his clinic not just from around Western Australia but from all over the country. Therefore, while the current federal funding is welcome it does not come anywhere near the true cost which Dr O’Neil and his staff have been underwriting for some years. But this much dedication to improving the lives of others does have its limits. Obviously, the approval of the TGA for the treatment is vital and hopefully will be achieved shortly. However, more funding is essential. According to the government’s first hundred days orgy of self-congratulation, the government announced $50 million in funding to each state and territory to provide additional drug and alcohol rehabilitation services to Indigenous communities. Given that many programs have not had the tremendous success rate that Dr O’Neil has, perhaps the money would be better used replicating Dr O’Neil’s programs. The Indigenous communities could shake off the scourge of substance abuse, the root cause of so many Indigenous problems, and the wider community would have better access to treatment as well. My challenge to the government is to stop thinking like process driven bureaucrats and look at the big picture. Here is a program which is successful, economically responsible and so, given the massive burden of substance abuse to our society, I say: ‘Bite the bullet, Prime Minister. Ensure the program gets the TGA’s seal of approval as soon as possible.

Show true leadership and put our money where it is shown it can do the most good.’ Lowe Electorate: Mrs Janice Daisley This morning I give a brief history of a remarkable constituent in my electorate of Lowe. Jan Daisley is a finalist for this year’s National Disability Award. More than 40 years ago, during a routine medical procedure, Jan experienced a cardiac arrest where she suffered severe physical impairment. This included speech impairment, spastic quadriplegia and loss of sight. If this were not enough, Jan later fought breast cancer. Despite her multiple disabilities, Jan did not stop living or achieving. Moreover, Jan set about changing the way society thinks about people with a disability. Described as a social educator who has influenced many of her teachers, lecturers, carers, colleagues, family and friends, Jan has been active in focusing not on her disabilities but on the needs and rights of others with a disability. After years of rehabilitation, Jan was transferred to institutional care. It is where many spend the rest of their lives, but not Jan. After years of campaigning, she was one of few to be transferred to a relatively independent group home. As a life member of People with Disability, Jan has since advocated for the rights of others to live in the community. Jan has been a source of hope for others that relative independence can be achieved with the support of groups such as People with Disability and a change in the attitude of governments to provide appropriate accommodation and care. What is so remarkable about Jan Daisley is her spirit to continue fighting for her independence and her tenacity to seek a change in attitude of those who told her it could not be done. Jan is a university graduate with a Bachelor of Education (Habilitation). She has also been awarded the Carroll and O’Dea Scholarship for her efforts in raising critical awareness on community issues, particularly in the area of ethics. In her spare time Jan has written two books: I Hear More Than You See and Rebels with a Cause. Both books describe the challenges she faced living with her disabilities. There is no doubt that Jan Daisley is a truly inspirational human being. I have had the pleasure of knowing Jan for many years, and I am very proud to be her federal member. I congratulate Jan for her tremendous achievements, and I am delighted that her efforts have been recognised. On the International Day of People with Disability, I will be attending the gala dinner where the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon. Jenny Macklin, and the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services, the Hon. Bill Shorten, will honour 15 extraordinary people for their contribution to society. I salute Jan Daisley and the other 14 finalists. They are truly extraordinary human beings. I wish Jan Daisley and the other nominees the very best of luck. They deserve it.

238,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (9.53 Am),"I thank everyone for attending my maiden Mainticular, I highlight two particular projects-one good, one bad-in regard to relationship with government. The first is a good news story: the Hastings Early Intervention Centre improvements. The facility will be opened on Friday. The renovations provide a larger classroom, parent therapy and meeting rooms, storage for toys, a nappy change area and kitchen facilities. The Australian government provided $158,897, which was pur towards the construction and fit-out of the project and the project audit. The upgraded facility will benefit the Port Macquarie community significantly by providing a facility which addresses intellectual, physical, emotional, social, speech and communication development for children in the local area. I would like to take the opportunity to thank a few of the partners. It has been a very good community exercise, not only by the committee and former committees and staff of the Hastings Early Intervention program but also by the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council, which did a lot of work. Several local bowling clubs, West Port and Port Macquarie City, provided support. Support was provided by a local credit union, Coastline, and by the Port Macquarie Panthers Club, and there was also in-kind support from King and Campbell. It is very much a good news story and I congratulate everyone involved. Now onto the bad news story. Through the Regional Partnerships program there was a period in the six months leading up to the last election when politicians were behaving badly. Handshakes were done for photos, fingers were crossed behind the back, and unfortunately good community projects were left swinging in the breeze. The Wauchope-Bonny Hills Surf Club is one example of that. They just had their 50th anniversary. They are desperately in need of a new surf club, a new building. It is a good project. It is a community facility, not just a local surf club. Unfortunately, despite handshake commitments pre-election, it is a project that government has not felt committed to fulfil, rightly or wrongly. I guess that is politics. I will continue to chase that project. I think it is a good community based project and does deserve the support of all three levels of government. I would hope, through speeches such as this and through lobbying, that the minister in particular can also see the benefit of supporting Wauchope-Bonny Hills Surf Club and similar projects in the Lyne electorate. Bonner Electorate: Juvenile Diabetes Walk Ms REA (Bonner) (9.56 am)-I rise this morning to talk about a very special young man who lives in the electorate of Bonner. His name is Joshua Burton. Joshua is a sufferer of juvenile diabetes and he is also a youth ambassador for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. Joshua and his family deserve to be praised on the public record because of their tireless work to raise the awareness that is needed around this terrible disease, to encourage more in our community to be aware of the significant impact that suffering from juvenile diabetes has on many young people in Australia today, and to support the foundation and many others who are trying desperately to find a cure for this life-threatening and debilitating illness. As many people are aware, we talk a lot about diabetes in our community today. We talk about it in the context of the need for a healthier lifestyle, changing our diets and being more physically active, as a way to prevent the onset of diabetes. Juvenile diabetes is often caught up in that discussion and that campaign, but juvenile diabetes is quite different. It is not a lifestyle caused disease; it is in fact a disease that we do not understand. If we did, we would certainly develop a cure for it. It is not because of the way these children live, it is not because of what they eat-it is a disease that they have developed from childhood and so it is one that MAIN COMMITTEE they have no control over. We must as a community support the foundation and these young people and their families in looking for a cure. Unfortunately, there are around 1,000 young people-that is, children under 18-diagnosed each year with juvenile diabetes. It is something that we in our very modern and technologically and medically advanced society could focus more on, not just as a government but as the community, to try and raise the muchneeded funds to find a cure. I had the privilege of participating in the walk for a cure event that occurred on 12 October. I was there with Joshua and his family, walking on a very pleasant and sunny Brisbane Sunday morning. This was a tremendous way for people to raise awareness about this very important foundation and the work that it does. relaxing walk through the middle of Brisbane. I also had the very pleasant honour of launching the walk and saying a few words about this very important issue before the walk started.

Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 November, on motion by Mr Brendan O’Connor: That this bill be now read a second time. rity Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008. The Rudd government made a commitment to a fairer, more compassionate Australia, and since November last year we have been reshaping society on a number of fronts. I think it was the Hon. Paul Keating, the former Prime Minister, who said that when you change the government you change the country. We have certainly seen that in Australia and more recently, in the last couple of weeks, in the United States. It is amazing to look at what has happened in the United States. TodayI will refer to a little bit of literature to illustrate how much things have changed in the United States. One of my favourite books is The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave by Frederick Douglass. If you look at when that book was written and then move through to one of my top five books, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, or Samuel Langhorne Clemens, you see in that narrative the way that Huck treats the slave Jim and how controversial that book was. It is obviously a great work of literature, but at the time, in the late 1860s and 1870s, it was quite controversial. I did my honours thesis on The Autobiography of Malcolm X, by Alex Haley. It is strange that you could have an autobiography written by someone else, but in the story presented by Malcolm X, or Malcolm Little as he was originally known, you see how the United States has changed its relationship with what they call the original sin-that is, slavery. The United States was based on slavery, despite the fine words in its constitution and in the Declaration of Independence. When we look at 2008 with Barack Obama being elected President of the United States, we see how much that story has changed.

242,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (9.59 Am),"I am pleased to speak in support of the Social Secuother, how when you change a government you change a country. Thankfully, that is what happened in Australia in November last year-we changed the direction of the country. I will now take us back to Australia in 2008 and the Rudd government. We are creating a new industrial relations system-a much fairer industrial relations system that is bringing fairness back to Australian workplaces. We are delivering a better, fairer deal for pensioners and carers, we are stepping up to our obligations to boost international aid and, through the bill that is before the House, we are putting an end to the harsh and unfair compliance system put in place by the Howard government for people receiving social security payments such as Newstart Allowance, Youth Allowance, the parenting payment or special benefit. The previous government’s welfare reforms were more about penalising non-compliance than encouraging compliance. Unfortunately, it seems to be true to form for the Liberals to be all stick and no carrot. They have no faith in an Australian’s capacity to hear their better angels. They are more interested in penalising people rather than appealing to their better nature. Unfortunately, the Howard-Costello government blindly pursued these reforms despite the warnings of numerous welfare agencies. The National Association of Community Legal Centres described the Howard system this way: … at the core of the regime is an illogical and counterproductive eight week no payment penalty. It will be applied not only when a person commits a third offence (such as failing to attend an interview or a training course), but also as an immediate cut in payments for a “more serious offence”, including: refusing an offer of a suitable job (without a reasonable excuse); resigning without a good reason; failing to participate in full-time “Work for the Dole”, and being dismissed from employment due to misconduct. For the first time this harsh no payment regime will apply to parents with children and people with disabilities. Back in June 2006, the National Association of Community Legal Centres also warned the coalition government that they would see a surge in no-payment penalties. Once again the coalition ignored the NACLC’s advice. I refer to an article on the ABC News website by Simon Lauder on Wednesday 19 December 2007, with the heading ‘No sound legal basis for Centrelink penalties: Ombudsman.’ The article says: The Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor John McMillanvery well trusted and respectedsays, people were effectively forced to breach their obligations because they could not lodge their regular paperwork while they were being investigated. “Once a participation failure was under investigation, in some of the complaints to my office Centrelink officers had refused to accept the continuation form, which meant that the person would certainly be in breach and unable to demonstrate their continued eligibility for payment,” he said. … … … “But it certainly put the person in a real quandary about how they could reconnect and get the payment and what the future held for them.” “These were people now not receiving any payment and clearly, in some instances, in quite distressing circumstances.” MAIN COMMITTEE Unfortunately that meant that we had a tenfold increase in the last three years. In 2004-05, there were only 3,800 non-payment penalties. However, last year there were more than 30,000 non-payment penalties, double that of the previous year. These are not just figures and statistics; they are actually real, living, breathing people like you and like me, and as a result of these penalties many of them have suffered terribly. Homelessness Australia estimates that at least 30 per cent of people who had an eight-week non-payment penalty imposed lost their accommodation. In other words, last year more than 3,000 people would have ended up living on the street as a result of these penalties, and as anybody who has ever worked in or visited a homeless shelter knows this can begin a spiral that takes somebody’s life out of control and into a world where nobody ever wants to know them, a life where stench and the loss of dignity are commonplace. Many Labor MPs, as you know, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, went to visit homelessness shelters between the election and the commencement of parliament. It certainly was quite an experience for me to return to a place that I used to take school kids to to help in the soup kitchen and to see, 10 years on, some of the same people and certainly hear some of the same stories and understand how horrible a life it is when suddenly you do not have a roof over your head. Those 3,000 stories, which I have merely touched on, must be quite horrific. This bill before the House introduces a fairer compliance regime. It amends the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to introduce a new compliance framework for around 620,000 people. The coalition system was more about penalty and less about support. However, the approach contained in this Rudd government bill is much more carrot and much less stick. Firstly, the legislation introduces new no-show, no-pay failures. If a job seeker fails to attend a required activity such as Work for the Dole training or to seriously complete a job interview, they will lose one-tenth of their fortnightly payment for each subsequent day that they do not attend. This does not affect payments such as rent assistance or pharmaceutical allowance but will apply to Work for the Dole supplements. Next, this bill retains connection and reconnection failures. This will apply when a job seeker, without reasonable excuse, fails to attend an appointment with an employment service provider or does not meet their Jobsearch requirements. There is no financial penalty. However, the job seeker must attend a reconnection requirement. If they fail to do so, they will incur a one-fourteenth reduction in fortnightly payment for each day that they fail to so comply. Further, eight-week non-payment penalties will be imposed for persistent and wilful non-compliance. This will only be as a last resort and accompanies a new, comprehensive compliance assessment. For example, if a job seeker refuses an offer of suitable employment, Centrelink will impose a serious failure. Also, if a job seeker misses three appointments or six days of activities such as Work for the Dole, Centrelink will consider whether their participation requirements are suitable, whether they should be referred for a job capacity assessment or whether a serious failure should be imposed. That is, we will look at the individual characteristics of the person in front of us. Obviously, with this personal touch comes dignity and the person is much more likely not to get into that spiral that I talked about of becoming just another homeless person. Nevertheless, a serious failure will result in an eight-week non-payment penalty. As I said, we have mainly focused on the carrot but there is still a stick to be used if necessary. MAIN COMMITTEE The big difference between the new system and the harsh Howard-Costello regime is that a non-payment period is reversible, depending on the circumstances. Under the current system, once a job seeker receives an eight-week penalty, they are not required to have any contact with Centrelink for that period and there is nothing they can do but ride out the eight-week non-payment period. That is often a very traumatic time, when they must turn to charities for support-or, even worse, to loan sharks and the like to get them through, where they pay exorbitant interest rates. The government believe that job seekers receiving taxpayer funded income support should work hard to find work and that job seekers who refuse to do so should be penalised. But we also believe they should be given the chance to explain themselves and to redeem themselves. This is the fundamental difference between the Labor Party’s approach to humanity and the Liberal and National parties’ approach to humanity. I know this from having spent a lot of time working for one of the community organisations in my electorate, the Kyabra Community Association, which deals with people in housing stress or people who, just because of their refrigerator breaking down, can end up living in their car. Circumstances have got to that point. A simple little payment like that can trigger someone being in rental arrears. Once they are in rental arrears they are on the black mark list for tenancy and they cannot get a house. They end up couch-surfing or, if they have kids, living in their car. My electorate is a reasonably well-off electorate, but people still turn up at the Kyabra Community Association needing money for petrol so that they can drive on to another park. It is incredible. Every morning when I go for a walk around my suburbs, I see a homeless guy who sleeps in the street in front of the shopping centre in Moorooka. It is incredible to hear his story. He is still able to receive payments; he is definitely not starving or anything like that. He chooses to live in the outer suburbs rather than in the city, where it is a lot tougher on the streets and people get rolled a lot more. He is able to stay in the outer suburbs. That is why it is so important that the government get these policies right. The cruel policies that were put in place by John Howard and Peter Costello were not appropriate. They looked good for that little bit of public posturing that John Howard like to put out there to show how tough we were on ‘dole bludgers’. But, unfortunately, they had horrific consequences and destroyed people’s lives. The Rudd government’s approach is much fairer. What we need to remember is that the overwhelming majority of job seekers do the right thing. There are a few who deliberately rort the system, and they should be penalised, but it should not be presented as if all of the people seeking work are an evil underclass. This is especially the case with the tighter economic times in front of us, when we will be looking to blame someone. Certainly, members of my family have been unemployed. I have even been to a CES on occasion-not for very long. That was the good thing about being a teacher and a lawyer: there was always plenty of work around. However, the new system before us provides a safety net for vulnerable job seekers to ensure that if they do the right thing and meet their Job Search requirements their payments will be reinstated and they can stay on their feet. In line with this government’s priorities, this bill also contains particular measures to improve the compliance regime in the bush. As someone who comes from the country, I am particularly interested in how this applies. The previous government, the coalition, failed to stand up for their electors in rural and regional areas. That is why we saw so many Labor people whose electorates touch on the bush being swept into power in November last year-because MAIN COMMITTEE the National Party had betrayed the bush. I remember the National Party when I grew up; they stood up for the bush. Now they are too closely aligned with the Liberal Party. In fact, in Queensland we do not even have a National Party anymore. We have the Liberal National Party, or LNP. In inner city Brisbane, in my electorate, I go to functions and there is a Liberal National Party councillor attending with me. It is quite strange. It is like being back in St George, really. The new system in front of us will ensure that Centrelink considers a job seeker’s individual circumstances. So we are going from having a sausage machine to treating people with dignity and as human beings. For example, if we are looking at a job seeker in the bush, we look at the availability of transport, which may impact on a job seeker’s ability to attend meetings and meet their participation requirements. It is one thing to say in the middle of Brisbane that you can catch the train or, in Melbourne, that you can catch a tram. For places like St George or Cunnamulla the nearest town is 300 kilometres away, so petrol-or even getting a car-is a significant consideration. That is why we have a much fairer approach to the specific job-seeking circumstances of people in the country. As we all know-or certainly everyone on this side of the chamber knows-the world has changed significantly, economically, over the last few weeks. The global financial crisis has meant that the floor has shifted for so many people and so many businesses. So many decisions that were made by people with the hope and optimism of the beginning of the year have changed significantly. So as we face these uncertain times as a nation, when growth is forecast to slow and unfortunately we might see a rise in unemployment, we need to make sure that, with the few levers the government has, we get the mechanism just right. Now, more than ever, we need to see a fair employment service that focuses on our most disadvantaged job seekers. I return to what I talked about at the start: how when you change a government you change the direction of the nation. I said that about the Rudd government. I also said that about the government of Barack Obama, who will be inaugurated as President on 20 January 2009. That will be 200 years after Abraham Lincoln was born, and I think that is the theme the new regime will be going for on that day. It is amazing how much things have changed since Abraham Lincoln made the Gettysburg Address, probably one of the most famous political speeches ever. It was a two-minute speech that followed a two-hour oration from someone noone remembers. Some other politician had gone on for two hours, probably trying to filibuster or expand to fill the day-you know how politicians are asked to do that on occasion!-so everyone was dozing off. Then Lincoln got up and made that brilliant, incisive speech that defined what America was about. Now here we are, 200 years after Abraham Lincoln was born, with a black American President, Barack Obama, being sworn in on 20 January. I hope to be able to watch that on TV, although I think I might have a new child by then, so that might keep me busy-but maybe, hopefully, it will give me time to watch the TV. These are incredible times. As I said, it is amazing to see how times have changed, from the story of the life of Frederick Douglass, a slave who became one of the great AfricanAmerican activists, through to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn-written by a white person, but one of the most confronting books about slavery and probably up there with Uncle Tom’s Cabin, which I also think is a great work of literature though not of the quality of Huckleberry Finn-through to The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Incidentally, that is one of MAIN COMMITTEE Barack Obama’s favourite books. It is not on many of the lists, where he goes through more mainstream literature, but he has said elsewhere that it is one of his favourite books. I am impressed by that. It is certainly a book that moved a lot of people, and the Spike Lee film is true to the book. To return to the legislation before the House, the change of government has changed the direction of policy and we can see that we have a much fairer employment service that focuses on our most disadvantaged job seekers. I commend the bill to the House. on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008. I am not sure that I can quite follow the contribution made by the member for Moreton. It was quite an extraordinary piece! But I will do my utmost to talk to this very important legislation. This bill distinguishes Labor from Liberal. It distinguishes the conservatives from the progressives. It is an example of two different philosophies. The Liberals and the conservatives have always fundamentally believed that disadvantaged people have only themselves to blame and, therefore, the only way to help the disadvantaged is to punish them. The conservatives believe the only way to deal with the disadvantaged is to blame them, shame them and vilify them. Labor have a different view. We believe disadvantage arises for a multiplicity of reasons. We believe helping people with disadvantage makes us a stronger community. We believe the conservatives’ view of punishing the disadvantaged is not just old-fashioned but also totally counterproductive. It leads to demoralisation. It puts families at risk. It puts workers who deliver these services at risk. Ultimately, it costs us more as a society and it costs us more as an economy. Labor believe in justice and encouragement. Labor believe in providing fairness and incentives. And we believe in evidence based social policy. This bill redresses the failures of the current system imposed by a former, mean Prime Minister. The purpose of this bill is to ensure compliance through a more understandable and equitable means of encouraging participation. This legislation establishes a framework that makes job seekers more accountable for their efforts to find and keep a job but also provides encouragement and support along the way. Encouragement, support and accountability are the values of this bill. The Rudd government is introducing these measures as part of a $3.9 billion package of reforms to the Australian employment services to commence on 1 July 2009. This legislation provides a new compliance framework for approximately 620,000 people who receive Newstart allowance, youth allowance other, parenting payment or special benefit and have participation requirements. This bill will amend the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to give effect to the measures announced in the 2008-09 budget. These reforms are critical because over the past 10 years employment services have been operating under a policy and administrative constraints that have failed disadvantaged job seekers in the extreme. Just over 10 years ago the unemployment rate was 7.7 per cent. Whilst unemployment is now around 4.1 per cent, a significantly higher proportion of job seekers are highly disadvantaged and long-term unemployed. The increased proportion of long-term unemployed is a direct result of the previous, conservative government’s flawed policies. I want to make a specific point here. Let us think about it. We have had a significant increase in the proportion of MAIN COMMITTEE",133,Social Security Legislation Amendment Employment Services Reform Bill 2008

244,Mr Cheeseman (Corangamite) (10.19 Am),"It is a great pleasure to rise today to speaklong-term unemployed when we have had the longest-lasting economic boom in the nation’s history. What an opportunity that has been missed. What sort of heartless policy did the previous government put in place? We had a unique opportunity of economic good times to help the long-term unemployed, and what did the conservatives do? They punished them. They created a greater problem than was required. The conservatives’ punitive social policy hurt the unemployed, and it has cost our society, I believe, dearly. People who, for example, suffer from mental health issues or other disabilities such as language or literacy issues have found it even more difficult to work, due to the nature of this current framework. The current policy has created a harder core of long-term unemployed. But it is not just the unemployed and the disadvantaged who have suffered under the conservatives-business has suffered, too. These policies and constraints have also failed employers who desperately need skilled workers to fill vacancies. Australia is experiencing skill shortages in a number of critical areas and is looking at a shortfall of up to 240,000 VET qualified workers by 2016. It is vital for our economy and the future of economic growth that unemployment services and the compliance regime that underpins them work. This legislation is not about providing a free ride. That is the rhetoric of the conservatives. That is the ugly myth that the conservatives promoted to justify their punishing regime. It is absolutely too true that Australians believe that if you are on taxpayer funded income support then you should work hard to find work. The first goal of the new compliance system is to ensure job seekers meet their participation requirements and make every effort to get themselves off welfare and into the workplace. Job seekers who will not look for work will have their support reconsidered, and this is one of the key differences between the old legislation and the new. The new system will give job seekers the opportunity to explain the circumstances that led to the breach. In the case of the alleged breach, a job seeker will be asked why they are not conforming. This has the effect of providing an opportunity for both sides to discuss the issues. It is an opportunity to get a better understanding of why the breach has occurred and to give the job seeker a chance to respond. Centrelink will use a comprehensive compliance assessment to determine whether there are good reasons for a job seeker to not be complying-for example, someone who is in stream 1 but has recently become homeless and should therefore be in stream 4. Where an eight-week non-payment period is applied, the new compliance regime will encourage job seekers to take responsibility for their actions and to re-engage. Redemption is often the turning point-it can be invigorating; it can reinstil the confidence to continue. By humanising the process and recognising the breach, both parties can go forward, instead of welfare organisations being left to pick up the pieces and the front-line public servants being left to deal with the rage through the process. Australians with the right support and encouragement are more likely to overcome an extended period of unemployment. The key is to get the positive outcome, to avoid a welfare mess. Madam Deputy Speaker, excuse me, I have to pause for a moment. I have a dry throat. ery; a costly welfare process. Of course, keeping people engaged also provides better access and a window of opportunity for welfare organisations and our employment service providers to use their professional judgement. Under the current arrangements, job seekers who have MAIN COMMITTEE",138,Social Security Legislation Amendment Employment Services Reform Bill 2008
245,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),That is perfectly all right.,139,Social Security Legislation Amendment Employment Services Reform Bill 2008
246,Mr Cheeseman,"The alternative is disengagement; a downward spiral of human misfailed to take part in an activity or program miss at least a fortnight’s pay before action is taken. In other words, there is a problem-which may be for any number of reasons-yet, instead of support, the first thing a person would get under the previous regime was a kick in the guts. In many cases, that is goodbye to hope; that is a downward, sometimes irreversible, spiral-often a personal crisis, a mental health decline, a physical health decline. According to Homelessness Australia, up to 20 per cent of people who underwent an eightweek breach lost their accommodation or were forced to move to less appropriate housing. Let us pause and think about that: 20 per cent of people at the end of eight weeks of loss of payments lost their accommodation and had to go to worse accommodation. How is that good policy? Does this help people to get back to employment? Does it help families in distress? Does it help the children of these people? No. The penalise-first approach costs the individual and the community. It costs us in welfare, it costs us in health and it throws many people over to already overworked charity organisations. The new compliance arrangements encourage participation and re-engagement as quickly as possible, in stark contrast to the current system. The new arrangements strike the right balance between participation and penalties for those job seekers who do not comply. A key element of the new system is a similar work-like culture to employment cultures. I will finish at this point because my voice is gone. That was remarkable. Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008, I feel great sympathy for the member for Corangamite for the condition of his voice. This is a great piece of legislation. It is something that everybody in the community should be really proud of. I believe it is a great piece of legislation because it really restores some balance in the employment participation area. If there is one thing that Labor can be truly proud of with this it is that we want to strike the right balance between fair and decent participation for job seekers, the unemployed, so that they have access to the right job network type of system to make sure they have the tools at their disposal not only to look for work but to gain work and that those who do not participate or meet their obligations to the community are penalised in a proper and fair manner. I think that is a reasonable position to take. It is a reasonable position to strike a balance between encouragement and incentive, and penalty and punishment. I have to say that it is quite sad that, for the past decade or more, that just has not been the case. I say that is sad because I think it has actually provided a great disservice to fair dinkum job seekers who are trying to do the right thing. The majority of Australians understand quite clearly that if you are out of work you should genuinely look for work and find a job because it is always better to be in a job than to be unemployed. On our side of politics, from Labor’s point of view, we believe very strongly that people who can work should work, and they should always be actively out there contributing to society-contributing to the community, contributing to the tax system and playing their partand that for those who do not, who would deliberately shirk their responsibilities, who for one reason or another do not meet their obligations, there ought to be some sort of penalty. We do not walk away from that. We do not walk away from the fact that those who deliberately abuse the system should be penalised in some way, punished in some way, because they are MAIN COMMITTEE",139,Social Security Legislation Amendment Employment Services Reform Bill 2008
247,The Deputy Speaker,I thank the member for Corangamite for his sterling effort.,140,Social Security Legislation Amendment Employment Services Reform Bill 2008
248,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (10.32 Am),"While I say it is a great pleasure for me to speak on thedependent on the goodwill of the taxpayer and taxpayer dollars. We do not make any bones about the issue of dealing with people who deliberately and repeatedly shirk their responsibilities, who do not meet their part of mutual obligation. They have an obligation to society to be out there and, if they cannot find work, to at least genuinely be looking for work or enter into training programs-to participate in the system. I think that is the bare minimum, the minimum requirement: that they actively seek employment or actively participate in training and actively engage with the requirements that they need to meet as put by their case manager or someone else. So let us be clear at the outset of the debate that this bill is not about somehow weakening or growing soft or taking just a lighter view. This bill is actually about fairness, about restoring balance, about doing the right thing. It is about doing the right thing for job seekers and it is about doing the right thing in terms of the taxpayer and the taxpayer dollars. But what is wrong and what is sad is when you have a government, the former Howard government, enter into arrangements where job seekers were either harshly penalised or otherwise harshly dealt with in a manner which did not encourage them to participate. You had a contrary, contradictory system, which implied that it was trying to get greater participation from job seekers yet instilled and compounded a penalty system which actually discouraged people from participation; it actually removed them from the system. So we had a situation where the former Howard government gave the impression to the community that it was out there doing its bit, that it was being tough on job seekers, those who are unemployed, but their policy and their punishment regime really did not encourage job seekers or in any way give people an incentive to participate. When, for whatever reason, people were breached, they fell through the system and their entitlements were removed for a period of eight weeks-non-payment for eight weeks. What did it actually mean? It meant the government washed their hands of that person, completely washed their hands of them, and walked away from them. No longer was that person required to participate, no longer was that person required to connect, no longer was that person required to engage. It was merely a punishment system: ‘We will punish you by taking away from you any source of income that you have without consideration of its impact.’ But at the same time, which I think made it much worse, there was no compulsion from the government to require that person to do anything during that eight-week period. Where is the sense in that? If you are going to punish someone, fine; do that. Breach them, take away their payment, but do it in a fair manner and then require them to make amends, to rectify that position. Look at why they are in that position; what should they now be doing? You cannot just wash your hands of them and say, ‘Right, for eight weeks we’re not paying you; we don’t want to see you, we don’t want to know you; go and sit on your hands idly and do nothing.’ That was all that was required. That was all that the previous system contained. We on this side of the House have a different view, and we have maintained that view: people should participate. There should be incentives in place to make them participate and there should also be penalties in place for people who do not want to participate. I fear that, while that is common sense and that would make sense to people listening, it is not just about punishing someone; it is also about trying to address their behaviour. Perhaps there is a particular issue for them. But if they just do not want to work they deserve to be punished by MAIN COMMITTEE having their payments removed for a period of time. During that time, people should be retrained or required to participate, not just disappear for a period of eight weeks. I will get into the detail of some of the impact of that policy of the previous Howard government, not only on the job seeker but also on the community, on the Job Network agencies and on the charitable organisations that look after people who cannot look after themselves or who find themselves in desperate circumstances. I think the great tragedy of the Howard government’s ideology on this was that it was just about punishment. It was about removing somebody’s income for a period of time. There was nothing else in the former government’s policy that encouraged people to do anything, bar sitting on their hands. The former government’s policy was: ‘We’ll take the money off you. Now go away; we don’t want to see you.’ That was the clear message and the clear policy. What we are doing today through this bill is finally restoring some balance between participation and penalty. We believe that both should occur and both should occur in a balanced manner. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill before us today is a positive step for welfare compliance. It is in stark contrast to what we saw from the now opposition for more than a decade. What the Rudd government has done is to introduce legislation that will give effect to measures that were announced in the budget, and they are designed to introduce a new job seeker compliance system. The changes are part of a broader scheme-New Employment Services, a new scheme that will begin on 1 July 2009. The reality is that the welfare penalty system, the punishment system, just did not work. It did not encourage anybody to seek work-in fact, it was a disincentive. If you think about it in practical terms as to what it would mean for those who may be doing the wrong thing-and there is always a bludger here or there, and they should be punished; we are not disagreeing with that-not everyone should be thrown into the one basket. If you are going to punish someone, do it with measure and do it with some recourse in mind-some sort of rehabilitation, some sort of avenue to say, ‘We’re going to do something extra. We don’t want to just continually punish a person over and over; we want to get them into a job. We want to get them to participate. We want to get them to contribute to the tax system.’ Shouldn’t that be the goal? Or was it the goal of the previous government, the Howard government, to simply punish people? ‘Blind punishment-outcome irrelevant.’ It is just about withdrawing their payment for a period of eight weeks. I am sure that some people who received a number of breaches and had their payments removed for eight weeks said, ‘I’m not happy. WhetherI was in the right or in the wrong, my payment has been removed for eight weeks and I now don’t have to do anything. I can just sit at home.’ Maybe, out of spite, some of them did do that. ‘Stuff them all,’ might have been the view of some people, ‘If no-one’s going to require me to do anything during that period, I’m not going to.’ It is the wrong message. It did not carry with it any incentive and it was bad government policy, bad public policy, bad welfare policy. It was bad work participation policy, and the evidence of that is all around us. It is all around us in the simple statistics that come out of the Job Network and out of Centrelink. During the period of change when the Howard government introduced this penalty system, this punishment system, there was a doubling of the amount of non-payment periods from previous years. It seems that at the same time the punishment came in there was this zeal from the then government to enforce it even harder. The old system was a populist policy of ‘three strikes and you’re out’. That always MAIN COMMITTEE sounds good. You can always carry on and hype it up. The old ‘three strikes and you’re out’ always sounds good, but what does it achieve? What does it do? What is the outcome? What is the intended public policy outcome from the government? I think I have some idea. Firstly, it was just about the politicking, because ‘three strikes and you’re out’ just sounded good. Who cares about the job seeker? Who cares about work participation? Did it achieve a goal; did it actually achieve an outcome? In public policy and in government, you should at least have some goals and outcomes to say, ‘We’re trying to achieve this end, we’re going to do it through this public policy and we’re going to penalise people along the way and reward people along the way.’ What was the intended outcome? One would have to assume that the intended outcome of a penalty system for job seekers not participating would be to encourage them to further participate, to actually go and get a job, and, if they cannot get a job, to attend training, to further attend courses or to at least participate, turn up to interviews and do all of that. Was that the outcome of their penalty system? No. In fact, there was no change; none at all. Participation rates did not go up, turn-up rates did not go up and the number of people actually finding more jobs did not go up as a result of this policy. SoI think it is clear to anyone who understood it or who perhaps was impacted by it that in the end the government were not interested in actually getting people into jobs. They were just interested in penalising them because it looked good-‘three strikes and you’re out’, that sort of image. There are always a few who think you have just got to keep punishing people without a view to actually reforming some of their behaviour or actually getting them into a job in the first place, which might actually help. The previous government, the Howard government, also did very little to actually look at the specifics of the problems that people might have had, why they could not comply or did not comply. For a whole range of people there were some very serious issues. We know as a matter of fact, from a number of agencies, that around 15 per cent of those people who received an eight-week non-payment period and lost their income for eight weeks actually had a mental illness and really struggled. They really struggled with daily life and, for their troubles, the already complicated life and struggles they had were further complicated by having eight weeks-two whole months-of any income removed from them. No consideration was given to their plight. There were a further five per cent who were already in very unstable housing arrangements, which complicated their ability to turn up to a job interview or to participate in some way. AndI have got to say this, even though it is pretty hard: the government did not care; they were not interested. It was never about trying to improve the lot of these people; it was just about punishing them and having this populist image out there of being tough-‘We’ll just keep punishing people’-but never really taking into consideration just what impact their policies were having on ordinary people. In the end, punishment for punishment’s sake is always bad public policy. Punishment should be about sending clear messages that people need to change their behaviour. If you can do that punishment in a measured way and escalate it up rather than have an all-in, all-out type method, then you have got some hope. The previous government’s policy was ‘three strikes and you’re out for eight weeks’, a non-reversible decision which left people in a position where they could not really alter what had taken place-whether they were right or wrong, and there would have been both. There MAIN COMMITTEE would have been some times when they were in the wrong and deserved it and other times when they had some really genuine extenuating circumstances, but you could not do anything about it. Under our policy, it is an escalation process. We will actually work with that person. We will breach them and we will give them a penalty and we will punish them, but we will escalate it up. We will say, ‘Here’s your first punishment and it will be commensurate with what you have done. If you do not turn up for one day, you will lose one day’s pay.’ I think that is a fair thing. That is what we all expect in our working lives. I think that is what a fair Australian would expect: if you do not turn up for a day, you will lose a day’s pay unless you have got a very good reason-unless you are sick or there is some really good reason why you could not be there. And there are good reasons. Sometimes people cannot get there because their public transport fails them or their car fails them. We are not talking about wealthy people. We are talking about people who might be really struggling, and there are these circumstances. By escalating it up, you give people an opportunity. You say to them, ‘We’re going to punish you today because you have done the wrong thing, but we’re going to give you an opportunity to redress that. You have an opportunity to grow and learn, to participate and do the right thing by the community and the taxpayer by further participating.’ This legislation does that. It is measured, it is structured and it is about delivering an outcome that it is in the best interests of the two most important people in this debate-one, the job seeker, who needs to actually find a job; and, two, the taxpayer. They are the two most important people in this debate. It is not about populist policy. It is not about looking good or looking bad or ‘three strikes and you are out’ and other catchphrases. It is about actually delivering an outcome and making sure that those people who can work do find work and that, for the people who struggle to find work, we find the cause of that struggle. An effective use of taxpayer dollars means that, when we spend money on people looking for a job, we get an outcome. It is not just about penalties; it is not just about punishment. Punishment with no goal in sight is useless. We have the data and statistics on this: it did not actually effect any change. If the goal was to punish people to get them to change their behaviour, it did not work. It is as simple as that. Find anywhere where it worked. What we actually saw was a doubling, on average, if not moreand in my electorate of Oxley it went up to 109 per cent-of the breaching and penalty regime. It actually doubled. Was there a better outcome? No. That is unfortunate. I have to say that that is unfortunate because at least if the policy had worked you might be able to stand up and say, ‘I did not like the policy because I thought it wasn’t measured and scaled and a whole range of things. I thought it was punitive. But at least it did have an impact. At least there was a 50 per cent reduction and there was incentive for people and they were encouraged to go out there and find work.’ But the outcome was the opposite. It was a disincentive. Instead of re-engaging the job seeker, it turned the job seeker against the agency. It made it even harder for them to go out and find work. For eight weeks that person understood that they would not get one cent and it was irreversible. So what did they do? They went off and sulked and did nothing. They were required to do nothing. If the government had been serious, they would have breached them for eight weeks, taken their payment away from them for eight weeks and then said, ‘Now you will attend this or there will be further breaches. You now will participate and you will understand that you need to MAIN COMMITTEE meet your obligations.’ But the government did not do that. Their policy was just about the punishment; it was not about participation, reconnecting or doing something for the taxpayer. As a taxpayer, I think there is an expectation that my tax dollars will be spent in a way that means they are not continually respent on the same problem because you cannot fix it. Fix the problem. Deal with the core issue. We are not defending anyone who is a shirker. If you are a shirker and you are not meeting your obligations, you will be penalised. Under our policy and legislation the penalties still exist, but they escalate through. We are going to give people opportunities. We are going to make sure that we work with them. We are going to make sure that, in the end, the goal is good public policy. It is about saving taxpayer dollars. It is about getting people into the workforce and making sure that they contribute to the tax regime in this country and to the community. (Time expired) day on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008. I would like to commend the member for Oxley for his impassioned speech. He understands the nature of his electorate very well and how the current legislation has certainly had major impacts on electorates like Oxley. It is not unlike the electorate of Forde where we do have a lot of dislocation and problems that are enhanced by the draconian approach of the current legislation. It is important in the current economic circumstance that we encourage people into the workforce. This bill will encourage participation and compliance. This will be achieved by establishing a framework for a new compliance system that will make those who are seeking employment more accountable for their efforts to find and keep a job. This is very much along the lines of the policy of Labor governments generally and certainly the Rudd government in terms of a need for social reform. Looking at the previous government’s approach to this issue, I think it was just too hard. Our view, with the Labor Party’s very strong understanding of social justice, is to consider ways to support people who find themselves in the difficulty of being unemployed. The way to support people back into the workforce is not to have a penalty that is very hard and has major effects across the board. For electorates like Oxley and Forde, the current legislation is very city-centric. It does not understand or have consideration for the difficulty that people have in their mobility around an electorate such as mine. I have spoken many times in this House about far-reaching areas to the southern end of my electorate, and those who have heard me talk about Duck Creek Road before will understand that it is an area of extreme remoteness. There is no public transport and very poor road infrastructure. That has a major effect on how we apply legislation to support people to find a way back into the workforce. I think the Howard government became tired on a whole range of issues. This was one issue that they felt it was better to leave in the too-hard basket. Essentially, it left a whole range of people finding themselves dislocated in our communities. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008 will amend the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to give effect to the measures announced in the 2008-09 budget to support the new employment services, in particular the introduction of a new job seeker compliance system. The new compliance framework will apply to Newstart allowance, youth allowance for persons who are not MAIN COMMITTEE",140,Social Security Legislation Amendment Employment Services Reform Bill 2008
249,Mr Raguse (Forde) (10.52 Am),"It is certainly a pleasure for me to get up and speak tofull-time students or new apprentices, parenting payment for persons who have participation requirements and are not new apprentices, and special benefit for nominated visa holders. A key feature of the new framework is the no-show, no-pay penalty. This new penalty will deter non-compliance and encourage re-engagement. As I said, re-engagement is what this is all about-giving people opportunities to train their way back into the workforce. It applies to a job seeker who, without reasonable excuse, fails to attend an activity or a job interview or intentionally acts in a manner that is reasonably foreseeable which may result in an offer of employment not being made. The no-show, no-pay penalty will be equivalent to one work day of a job seeker’s basic rate of payment and any approved program of work supplementnormally 10 per cent of a job seeker’s 14-day instalment. When you compare this with the current eight-week, non-payment penalty, which is counterproductive and has wider impacts on society, it is clear that the new legislation will better incentivise job seekers, and that is really what this is all about. The bill contains several minor technical amendments designed to clarify and improve the operation of the current paymentpending review provisions, particularly in relation to the start date of penalties following the decision to apply a penalty. In his second reading speech the Minister for Employment Participation stated that the key reason why these changes are necessary is that the current compliance system has resulted in thousands of counterproductive, non-discretionary and irreversible eight-week, non-payment penalties. For the duration of these eight-week, non-payment penalties there is no requirement for the job seeker to look for work or to have contact with either their employment service provider or Centrelink. The consequence of this failed approach to compliance and an obvious defect in the system is the eight-week separation of job seekers from participation requirements, including looking for work, gaining skills or undertaking work experience. My background is as a TAFE institute director, a position I held for some time. Training was a very big part of our role in society-certainly for governments at all levels. In the years of the Keating government, training was a major focus. Essentially, training to a large degree has to be part of how we support people through these changes. The results speak for themselves. The former government system has failed on non-compliance. In 2006-07 there were around 16,000 eight-week, non-payment penalties applied. In 2007-08 this had doubled to around 32,000 eight-week, non-payment penalties. If the current system were effective, it would have resulted in decreasing numbers of penalties because more job seekers would be participating. These figures confirm that the existing arrangements are just not working, particularly in an environment of strong employment growth. Certainly in South-East Queensland in my electorate it is quite difficult for large employers to get adequately trained staff. To have people falling out of the loop at a greater rate certainly rings the alarm bells. The change to the compliance system set out is part of the $3.9 billion package of necessary reforms to Australian employment services that commence on 1 July 2009. These reforms are crucial because in the last 10 years employment services have been operating under policy and administrative constraints that have hindered disadvantaged job seekers, their families and their communities. These policies and constraints have also failed employers, who desperately need skilled workers to fill vacancies. I have used the example of the electorate of Forde, but it applies generally to many parts of Queensland. Certainly in the resource MAIN COMMITTEE rich areas of Queensland, where a lack of capable and competent people to perform tasks means that we have high demand, we should be able to channel people who are available into those job opportunities. In the last 17 years of economic growth we have had improved job prosects for thousands of people. On the other side of the coin, many others have had a bleak employment outlook. As I just mentioned, we are still experiencing skill shortages-something that was not addressed by the previous government-and this has been clearly identified by the Rudd government as our priority. There is a priority for training and support. The member for Oxley has made the point very well many times that this is about giving people opportunities. Without a doubt the best social security we can have in this country is through giving people job opportunities, a career path and the ability to increase their skills. The general well-being-certainly psychologically-of any person, and that person’s family and all of their contacts, depends on their self-reliance and independence, and their ability to look after themselves and to take advantage of great job opportunities without considering penalties simply because of their circumstances. The harshest element of the current system is the eight-week, non-payment penalty. It is not hard to envisage the situations that come out of eight weeks of non-payment-people unable to pay their bills or their rent. This can cause people to become destitute and dislocated, just adding to the potential for community stress and dysfunction. As I have mentioned before, in my electorate of Forde we have a major demand on rental properties. At one stage people had access to affordable rent and there were available rental properties. If you consider that people have no continuity in their income you can imagine the stresses of being unemployed. They may then be further concerned if a breach occurssometimes because they did not receive a letter or because a piece of information went missing. They were very much dependent on the administrative systems being able to accommodate and understand the processes. I am sure that the staff of Centrelink were very understanding of people and their situations, but at the end of the day they had very little latitude in terms of how they could ease the distress of people who, for whatever reason, may have breached a particular condition of their payments. As I said, not having the income stream for two months, and having people evicted, certainly leads to issues of hunger. While that almost seems, in this day an age, an anomaly in our society, I know, from the groups that operate in my electorate-I am sure it is the same in many other electorates-that much support goes to families who simply do not have enough food to put on the table. A large component of that is people who are not only unemployed but have, for whatever reason, been penalised for some form of non-compliance. We can see how this issue can contribute to the housing crisis and charities being overwhelmed by people needing food and clothing. As I said, the unfortunate part of our modern society is that there are people who are in all sorts of situations at different levels. There are people who have quite generous salaries and there are people who are simply not getting by, who are highly dependent on a government system. For that reason we should not be penalising people who find themselves in that situation-not to the degree of this eight-week arrangement. This legislation allows a more measured approach to people being penalised for non-compliance, whatever might have caused that non-compliance. It is an irony, when you consider MAIN COMMITTEE the global financial issues that confront us now, that a major questioning at the moment is about executives on high salaries and benefits. As I understand it, one company in the US-a failed bank-had paid their top executive over $468 million over a period of 10 years, in salaries and bonuses. I remember that in the inquiry there was a great protest from that particular individual who said, ‘No, it wasn’t $460 million; it was only $320 million.’ It was an enormous amount of money. The reality is that people who were operating in that environment had major failures and were noncompliant in terms of the sorts of things they were doing and yet they still got a benefit. Yet the people who are least able to look after themselves in our society get punished in such a harsh way-through taking the very means of their existence away from them. The dependency that people have, in receiving those sorts of benefits, shows that this is not an adequate way to do this. A measured approach is certainly the way to approach it. According to Homelessness Australia, up to 20 per cent of people who underwent an eightweek breach lost their accommodation or were forced to move to less appropriate housing. These job seekers are some of our community’s most disadvantaged people. Against the issue of the excessive executive salaries that I spoke about, it just does not make sense that people are having their means of survival taken away from them when they are breached. This issue with job seekers is one that confronts us all. The first goal of the new compliance system is to ensure job seekers meet their participation requirements and make every effort to get themselves off welfare and into a job. As the member for Oxley said, this is about making people responsible for their actions. A system of breaching is an important part; it is part of the incentivising. But the harshness of the penalty has to be something that is very measured and I believe that this legislation will certainly resolve that. The current system provides little of deterrence or early intervention. A major concern is the lack of immediate consequence for initial failures to complete activities. It comes as one big wallop-and the eight-week breach of payments is a major wallop. An important element of the no-show, no-pay failure is to promote a work-like culture to employment services. If a job seeker does not attend an activity that they are required to attend without a reasonable excuse, it will result in the job seeker losing one-tenth of their fortnightly payment for each day they do not attend. This does not affect rent assistance, the pharmaceutical allowance or the youth disability supplement, but it does apply to any supplement the job seeker is receiving for participating in Green Corps or Work for the Dole. As is currently the case, access to healthcare cards and family tax benefits will not be affected. When the job seeker resumes participation, it will result in a resumption of payment. Resuming participation will result in resumption of income support. A no-show, no-pay failure means that non-compliance will have an immediate financial impact, but the extent of the penalty will be in the hands of the job seeker. Another key difference between the current and the new system is that in the current system a job seeker who gets an eight-week penalty must serve it no matter the circumstances or if they assume an activity. As I said earlier, this is draconian and certainly puts more pressure on the services, particularly the Centrelink staff who have to deal with enraged people. If you have ever looked at or joined the queue at a Centrelink office, or have an understanding of the frustration of people in this process, you will find Centrelink staff are very dedicated to their job-but it is a tough job. Adding this level of pressure is just not fair on those people who are MAIN COMMITTEE working hard as servants of the public but are being berated by people who for some reason have been dislocated in the system. Under the new system, any job seeker subject to an eightweek, non-payment penalty for persistent non-compliance or refusal of a job offer can have their payment reinstated if they agree to undertake a compliance activity. This will generally be 25 hours a week of full-time Work for the Dole for eight weeks, but may include other similar activities as appropriate. We need to provide encouragement to people to engage with the system and get people back into the workforce. The electorate of Forde is part rural-regional and part metro. It has quite a diverse range of communities. The lack of services and public transport means that people have added pressure when they are looking for a job. It is necessary for our economy and future economic growth that we try to get people into the workforce, and it is important now, more than ever, in the current economic climate. The current global financial situation will put pressure on all areas. Employment will no doubt be a possible victim. Manufacturing industries are usually the first affected by slowdown or some cataclysmic financial event, such as what we are seeing in other parts of the world right now. The seat of Forde has some major industrial areas-the Yatala Enterprise Area being one. It is currently one of the largest industrial areas in the country. It also has a fairly large manufacturing base. They are continually looking for workers and people with particular skills. When there is a downturn, people in the manufacturing industry are usually the first to suffer. Contact made with my office about the system has been made by people who have been concerned about the way the current legislation has been enacted, and this is something that has been going on for many years. As a new member I very quickly became aware of the pressures that people found themselves under in dealing with the whole job-seeking arrangement. Of the areas in the south of my electorate, which I have said before are large areas for future growth, the area of Bromelton has been announced as a state development area, which means an area of development controlled by the state. It will be a major area of investment for infrastructure in building what will be the largest industrial centre in the country. Currently I have one of the largest areas of development, in the Yatala area, but for the future it is considered that within only seven or eight years there will be 8,000 jobs taken up by that particular development in the Bromelton area. The positive side is that, with the economy running at a certain level, there are huge opportunities in my electorate for 8,000 people in what will be service and manufacturing industries. Those people would also be victims of any major change in the financial circumstances. If, for whatever reason, bad times come, we must ensure that people who are locally and regionally based who do not necessarily have the opportunity to travel out of their areas will be looked after under our systems and ensure that they will not be penalised simply because of the circumstances of where they live and issues of mobility. As I have said many times in this House, my electorate of Forde at the northern end is only 40 kilometres out of the city of Brisbane. From that point to the farthest end, a distance of some 160 kilometres, there are seven or eight communities which are not serviced by adequate infrastructure or public transport. People who lose their jobs in regions of my electorate cannot necessarily afford to run the two cars that they need to get around the electorate. If they are out of work, a breach because of non-compliance for whatever reason puts them in an MAIN COMMITTEE even worse situation. They do not have the opportunities that many people in the city regions have and I am sure that any member of this House who represents a country, regional or remote area will understand exactly what I am talking about. So, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, for all of those reasons I commend this bill to the House. been called today at various times Mr Speaker, Mr Deputy Speaker, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker or Mr Deputy Acting Deputy Speaker, I note that the correct term is Deputy Speaker. Ms NEAL (Robertson) (11.13 am)-Thank you for clarifying that vexed issue for us today, Mr Deputy Speaker! I rise in the chamber in support of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008. This bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 and principally concerns the introduction of a new job seeker compliance model. The bill will introduce a new social security compliance structure for approximately 620,000 people receiving Newstart allowance, youth allowance, parenting payment or special benefit for those who have participation requirements. The measures contained in this bill will restore balance, fairness and equity to the job seeker compliance regime. Not only will the compliance regime be made fairer but it will also function more effectively. Over the past decade the former Howard Liberal government presided over a harsh regime based on inflexible punishment of apparently non-complying job seekers. This rigid and increasingly flawed approach saw serious breaches punishable by an eight-week, non-payment period more than double from 1,600 to 3,200 people in the financial year 2007-08. Not only were noncompliers deprived of all financial benefit for that eight-week period but they were also effectively locked out of the job seeker system. There was no requirement for them to seek work at all during that period, nor was there any requirement for them to make contact with Centrelink or their employment service provider. Under the former, Howard government, this perverse compliance regime amounted to a double disincentive to good outcomes for the unemployed: the system punished noncompliers but did nothing to improve their chances or their likelihood of finding solutions. This system was a manifest failure, especially for the vulnerable and disadvantaged unemployed. The greatest tragedy was that, despite falling unemployment levels in the 10 years from 1999, the proportion of people on unemployment benefits for more than five years rose from 74,000 to 110,000. Many service providers and welfare agencies have reported that the system originated by the Howard government relies on a ‘penalise first’ approach that alienates noncompliers further from help. This system can also tend to exacerbate situations of severe personal crisis for vulnerable job seekers, including homelessness. Homelessness Australia has estimated that up to 20 per cent of people who underwent an eight-week, non-payment period lost their accommodation or were forced to move to less appropriate housing. I know this has been noted by many speakers before me. It is a point that is extraordinarily important. The current compliance system has resulted in many thousands of eight-week penalties which have produced no productive outcome. In addition, the breaches are non-discretionary and they are irreversible. Job seekers suffer an eight-week separation from their participation requirements, which produces no benefit to anybody. MAIN COMMITTEE",145,Social Security Legislation Amendment Employment Services Reform Bill 2008
250,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Pd Secker),"For the information of the House, havingThe bill before us today, however, proposes changes to the existing regime that will actually encourage participation. Participation is the goal of the new system proposed in this bill, and the measures contained within it will do much more to ensure compliance. The bill retains an appropriate balance between participation and penalties for non-compliance. This balance between carrot and stick is evident in the detailed provisions of the bill. To encourage a worklike culture in the provision of employment services, a no-show, no-pay arrangement has been introduced. Failure to attend a required activity, without a reasonable excuse, will see noncompliers incur a penalty of one-tenth of their fortnightly payment for each day of nonattendance. Failure to connect with a required job seeker activity, without a reasonable excuse, will invoke a mandatory reconnection activity. If this is not attended, it will cause a financial penalty of one-fourteenth of payment for each day missed. The eight-week, non-payment period penalty will be retained but only for persistent and wilful non-compliance, such as missing three appointments or six days of job seeker activities or refusing a suitable job. There is no room in this legislation for tolerating those people who deliberately rort the system. Once penalised, a job seeker will have to undergo an intensive compliance activity of up to 25 hours per week. Under the existing system, a job seeker need have no contact at all with employment services during an eight-week penalty period. In contrast, the new system requires them to actively look for work during that period, to take responsibility for their own action and to reconnect with the job seeker network. Another measure in the bill ensures that a job seeker can have their payments re-instated if they participate in a compliance activity. This could not happen under the old system, where the eight-week breach was irreversible. One of the significant differences between the old system and the new system is that job seekers will be asked, during their compliance activity stage, why they are not complying. They may, for example, have recently become homeless, a circumstance which can have devastating personal consequences and can materially affect a person’s ability to participate and seek work. Of course, the new arrangements contain hardship provisions that may be applied at all stages of this process. There is a strengthened safety net that protects vulnerable job seekers. The measures I have just outlined mean that the employment services bill brings into existence a strong but fair and equitable compliance regime. The stark contrast with the Howard government’s policies on employment services cannot be clearer. When the present opposition was in power, it had no concept of fair and reasonable reciprocity between job seekers and the government. On the contrary, its compliance system was harsh, inflexible and punitive. The facts are these. During the year 2006-07 there were approximately 16,000 eight-week non-payment penalties applied to non-compliant job seekers who had failed to show up for scheduled appointments. In 2007-08 this had doubled to around 32,000 eight-week non-payment penalties. The opposition’s position in relation to the treatment of Australians seeking employment is uncharitable and punitive. It is not only harsh policy but also a failure-a failure because, instead of decreasing the number of non-compliant job seekers in the network, this system doubled the numbers of disenfranchised and marginalised job seekers. These people had an eight-week breach slapped on them and had to find the means to live without any income support whatsoever. It is hard to believe that the numbers of people wilfully and deliberately thumbing their noses at the system could have doubled overall in the space of just a year. In my electorate of Robertson, over this period the rate of applied penalties rose by a staggering 79 per cent. MAIN COMMITTEE The policy of the Howard government failed because the application of an eight-week non-payment period as a response to a technical administrative breach is fundamentally flawed. It does not recognise the wide variety of events that have led to non-compliance. It cannot recognise blameless non-compliance because the measure is mandatory and non-discretionary. Herein lies the fatal flaw. A punitive act employed as a means to ensure compliance fails when a large number of non-compliance situations arise from circumstances largely beyond the individual’s control. In simple language, there are situations where calling Centrelink is not the first thing on your mind. They are crisis situations that occur in life when you have little time to deal with anything but the immediate emergency. When a person loses their job or is hit by some other major catastrophe, this has a roll-on effect on the stability of their home and family. This can have serious, adverse effects on their self-esteem and their coping mechanisms as well as their ability to change their circumstances. There is nothing more time-consuming than being homeless, jobless or both. Living handto-mouth, moment to moment, borrowing cash from family or friends to see you through and putting in applications for rental accommodation in a market with vacancy rates of less than one per cent, as there are on the Central Coast-nothing can be more exhausting. Yes, there are circumstances when letting Centrelink know about your changed circumstances is the last thing on your mind. On the scales of justice, this non-compliance does not actually constitute a breach of the implicit social contract between you and the rest of society that you undertake when you receive participation payments as a job seeker. For those individuals who wilfully and persistently seek to dodge their responsibilities and refuse to participate in employment and employment-readying activities, the eight-week non-payment option remains. What will be interesting to see in the coming years is the number of breaches recorded for wilful and persistent non-compliance. I pause to consider the competing claims made by the parties in the parliament. Some honourable members have fallen into the trap of typifying welfare recipients, particularly many job seekers, as dole bludgers. I quote National Party senator for New South Wales John Williams from his maiden speech on 15 September 2008. He referred to some unemployed people as ‘simply getting a free ride on behalf of taxpayers of Australia, and it is about time they received a touch on the backside with a cattle prodder to get them off their butts’. This statement reveals simple and blunt language, of course, but also the prevailing attitude of the opposition. It is not a truthful or accurate portrayal. Is the senator saying that grandparents under the age of 65 who have primary care responsibility for their grandchildren are in fact dole bludgers? In my electorate I have spoken to members of the community who find themselves in difficult straits trying to juggle primary carer responsibilities with the obligations required by jobseeking appointments and interviews. That is not because they are lazy or wilfully avoiding responsibility; quite the opposite. These are individuals who have taken on a second parenthood when their own children, for whatever reason-be it death, mental illness or addictionhave become unable to parent their children. These grandparents have become full-time parents but they are not fully recognised for the role that they play. Meanwhile, they must keep up with the narrow and non-discretionary obligations placed on them by the current legislation. Relief for this group must be found. The legislation before us today goes some way towards providing room for circumstances such as these, but further work still needs to be done. MAIN COMMITTEE The old and hackneyed stereotype that the opposition still holds about job seekers is just too simple and fails to really look at the circumstances that lead to individuals becoming chronically unemployed. Without intelligent examination of the socioeconomic, educational and health circumstances affecting people experiencing these difficulties, the opposition has systematically marginalised and derided large numbers of people. These are people whose only crime, perhaps, is having a mental illness or having experienced a life crisis with which they have failed to cope. The current employment services regime, put in place by the former Howard government, makes for bad public policy. It has led to mounting pressure on the charitable and community sectors, which are seeing the increasingly negative impacts of harsh policies as people pile into homeless shelters. Many who experience an eight-week non-payment period do not stay afloat. It is also recognised that the mandatory application of the eight-week non-payment period has increased the likelihood of individuals losing their current accommodation and standing a much higher risk of becoming homeless. The Welfare Rights Network has reported: The relationship between this penaltythe eight-week non-payment policyand major dislocation, including homelessness, relationship breakdown, increased mental stress, illness, violence and crime is both categorical and direct. This is simply not acceptable. Government policy should never contribute to such outcomes. Policy should not be the device by which hardship becomes poverty and disadvantage becomes disenfranchisement. The Rudd Labor government is committed to social inclusion and a fair balance of mutual obligation that takes into account the full circumstances of the people involved. The previous government’s policy did not improve compliance for job seekers; it systematically failed to do so. Fear is not simply a motivator that will keep job seekers reporting to the employment services when life’s problems crash in upon them. The Rudd government is determined to do better. I quote Sally Sinclair, from the National Employment Services Association, who, on 24 September, said: A major improvement [introduced by the legislation] will be the introduction of Comprehensive Compliance Assessments to ensure that we have a safety net for vulnerable job seekers. These assessments will identify if a job seeker cannot comply as a consequence of complex life circumstances such as domestic violence, cognitive impairment and mental health issues, rather than being wilful in their failure. The government’s policy takes adverse circumstances such as these into account. It directs agencies to pause a moment and ask of job seekers: ‘What is going on? What are your circumstances?’ Not everyone on the dole is looking for a free ride. Many are experiencing personal difficulties. That is why the safety net is there. There is no doubt that there should be a reciprocal relationship between unemployed people needing assistance and society providing them with interim support. The terms of that support-where it ceases; what triggers can rightly show the intention, or lack thereof, of a job seeker-are all subject to debate. The government believes that the measures contained in this bill strike a sincere balance between positions. They do not deny the possibility of wilful non-compliance, but neither do they unjustly aggravate the dire circumstances of individuals caught in tough times who are just trying to find their feet. I commend the bill to the House. MAIN COMMITTEE the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008 I have been sorely disappointed at the presentations of government members. They failed in their addresses to look at the history of this issue, when breaching first began with the HawkeKeating government. That government struggled with how to get unemployed people reengaged in the workforce. That is what it was all about. The process of Welfare to Work was to get people re-engaged in the workforce. This has been a crucial issue for people, particularly people in my electorate, who found great difficulty in being able to cope with that which was put upon them, especially the punitive measures that affected women in rural areas. So what did we do? We did not just can what had gone on in the past. What we said recently was that we would go to Brendan O’Connor and tell him, with Salvation Army support, that we will get a group of people together and have a discussion, which we did. Everybody involved with unemployed people in the electorate of McMillan was invited to come to a forum. We had the forum and we put the issues that were raised in that forum to the minister. Some of this legislation has actually come out of the forum that we ran on behalf of basically rural women with regard to the effects on them in their given electorate. This has been an issue all the way through from the Hawke government to the Howard government. The intention of Welfare to Work was always well based, with the support and welfare of the unemployed person at its pinnacle. That is what the program was all about. These are minimal changes. What you have seen in the addresses today were attacks on the Howard government, basically for no reason, and an expression by every member that the actual program was correct-that the legislation was correct and that this is what we want to achieve. The new government is trying to achieve exactly what we were trying to achieve, just in a new way. That further proceedings be conducted in the House. Question agreed to. AGED CARE AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES No. 2) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 October, on motion by Mrs Elliot: That this bill be now read a second time. (2008 Measures No. 2) Bill 2008. At the outset, let me say that the opposition has a number of reservations about certain aspects of the bill. I shall elaborate on those reservations further in my speech. That being said, the bill is largely uncontroversial. It seeks to ensure that provisions of the Aged Care Act accord with changes in the aged-care industry and addresses gaps in the aged-care framework. Caring for older Australians is a huge challenge. It requires careful planning, appropriate funding and dedicated staff. It requires acknowledgement that the ageing of our population is undoubtedly the biggest social issue that Australia and indeed the developed world faces. The challenges are enormous, but even more challenging, I would argue, is the planning that must begin now in response to our rapidly ageing population. In September, the Productivity Commission released a research paper titled Trends in aged care services: some implications. It paints an alarming picture of the future of aged care in MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Social Security Legislation Amendment Employment Services Reform Bill 2008

252,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (11.32 Am),I move:,154,Social Security Legislation Amendment Employment Services Reform Bill 2008
253,Mrs May (Mcpherson) (11.33 Am),"I rise today to speak on the Aged Care AmendmentAustralia. According to the paper, there will be a significant increase in demand for aged-care services over the next 40 years. The number of people aged over 85 is expected to increase fourfold by 2047. Today, approximately one in seven Australians is aged 65 years or older. That is 2.8 million people, or 13.4 per cent of our population. By 2050, the percentage of people over the age of 65 is expected to rise to one in four. The impact this will have on the agedcare sector over the coming years should not be underestimated. We live in a society that demands, and rightly so, that we take care of our older citizens and give them every opportunity and support to live with dignity and with respect. In order to achieve that, we as legislators must provide policies and legislation that give all Australians confidence that our aged-care sector is delivering the optimum level of care for all senior Australians who require it. That optimum level of care will need to become more diverse and deliver a more flexible service that will respond to the changing health needs of the aged. The former coalition government placed significant emphasis on wide-ranging reforms to deliver a high-quality, affordable and accessible aged-care system that met the needs and preferences of older Australians under the act. In her second reading speech, the Minister for Ageing correctly asserted that the aged-care industry has matured significantly since the Aged Care Act 1997 was first introduced under the former coalition government. With that maturity over the past decade, the sector has evolved from one where the owner of an aged-care facility also provided the day-to-day operation of the facility to one where increasing levels of investment in the sector are coming from larger corporate entities. There is no doubt that a consistent and modern regulatory framework must support this evolution in the industry. One does not need to be a particularly gifted prophet to predict that the aged-care sector in a decade from now will look vastly different to the aged-care sector delivering services today-and, of course, today’s aged-cared sector looks vastly different to a decade ago when the Aged Care Act was first introduced by the former coalition government. This bill before the House today will bring about greater consistency between the regulatory framework and contemporary business practices, recognising the change in business models over the last 10 years. The opposition supports the measures in the bill for clarifying and identifying key personnel and the role they perform within an organisation. This measure is about transparency and accountability of those delivering aged-care services to older Australians. Another measure that the opposition supports is the further protection of accommodation bonds. In recent years, there has been significant growth in the value of accommodation bonds held by aged-care providers. In fact, more than $6 billion is currently held by approved providers in accommodation bonds. I am sure members on this side of the chamber need no reminding that it was the Howard government who introduced the Accommodation Bond Guarantee Scheme in 2006, which guaranteed the repayment of bonds if a provider were to enter into insolvency or become bankrupt. The introduction of the guarantee scheme was a good thing, both for providers and for residents. Without a doubt it brought about greater confidence in the industry. The measures in this bill will further strengthen the protection of accommodation bonds by extending the scheme to include lump sum payments which are paid by residents to enter a facility that, at the time the payment is made, is not an approved provider but subsequently becomes an approved provider. Under the measures introduced in this bill, should that provider enter into MAIN COMMITTEE liquidation, residents’ lump sum payments will be guaranteed through the scheme. This is an excellent measure and brings about more confidence for those paying those bonds. Another excellent measure in this bill is the aim to reduce the number of unnecessary assessments by aged-care assessment teams. There are some assessments, it is fair to say, that are either unnecessary or that are being reviewed too frequently. This includes the need for an annual assessment for residential respite care and approvals for high-level residential care. Given ongoing approvals are generally granted at the time of reassessment, it is unlikely that the person being assessed will no longer require these services. This measure is in fact aimed at streamlining assessments, reducing red tape and, hopefully, reducing waiting times for assessment of older Australians. This can only be a good thing, particularly as I know that in many areas waiting times for ACAT assessments can be weeks and sometimes even months. The minister has indicated in her second reading speech that following these amendments to the ACAT assessment process negotiations will commence with the states and territories to ensure that the greater efficiencies provided for in the bill will result in shorter timeframes for ACAT assessments. I hope the minister will report back to the House on these negotiations, as I can advise the chamber today that lengthy waiting times for ACAT assessments are causing unnecessary stress on our elderly residents. As I indicated at the beginning of my speech, I do have a number of reservations with regard to this bill, which I would like to outline to the chamber. These reservations and concerns have in fact been raised with me by the aged-care industry. I think that it is important to advise the minister of the issues and encourage her to work with the aged-care industry to seek some positive outcomes to these concerns. There is no doubt that the aged-care industry is at crisis point, and providers around Australia are experiencing low and deteriorating financial returns. Given the funding constraints that providers are experiencing, it is extremely disappointing that section 22 is not being amended to address inequities in the system where a resident is assessed as being low care when in fact the resident is high care. Stakeholders involved in the consultation process of this bill were led to believe that these inequities would be addressed. Under the new aged-care funding instrument, aged-care providers are frequently finding that an aged-care assessment team’s assessment of a resident’s care needs do not reflect their true care needs-that is, many residents are being assessed as low care when in fact they require high care. The difficulty lies in the delay that a reassessment of a resident’s care needs takes. This reassessment by an aged-care assessment team-an ACAT team-can take a number of months. Hopefully that will be streamlined, but there are cases known to us where it can take weeks and even months for that reassessment to occur. During that time, however, the facility is only being paid a low-care subsidy, even if the resident is found to be high care. Upon reassessment, payment of the subsidy is not retrospective. What this means, in essence, is that providers in many cases are taking care of high-care residents but are only receiving a lowcare subsidy until a reassessment has been undertaken. This non-retrospectivity of the level of subsidy paid is having a big impact on the bottom line of providers and needs to be addressed immediately. Another area which I have real concerns about is items that come under section 65 of the act. The clause introduces an unreasonable degree of subjectivity that I believe undermines the integrity of the act. Clause 65-2(c) widens the power of the department to enable it to imMAIN COMMITTEE pose sanctions on behalf of future aged-care residents. The department already has wide powers to impose sanctions where breaches have been found to have occurred. I am therefore at a loss as to why the bill seeks to insert a new clause which deals with future care recipients. Further, clause 65-2(da) of the bill introduces a new concept, which is the ability of the department to impose sanctions to act as a deterrent against future non-compliance. Again, this is of concern to me, as the amendment widens the secretary’s power to make a judgement about the use of sanctions as a deterrent to future non-compliance. Noncompliance occurs at a point in time. The power to impose sanctions as a deterrent against future non-compliance introduces ambiguity and complexity into the legislation. The subjectivity of the above two provisions introduces an amount of uncertainty that does nothing to strengthen the act in any way. I respectfully suggest-I ask-that the minister look at these areas of concern and engage in discussion with the aged-care industry to address these issues. Each of these issues has been raised by the aged-care industry itself, and they are issues, I believe, that should be considered as part of the inquiry by the Senate committee to which the bill has been referred. The safety and protection of elderly residents is of paramount concern to both providers and families of residents. The minister, in her second reading speech, alluded to changes to the aged-care principles under the Aged Care Act which directly address the safety of residents, and this is a measure the opposition supports. In fact, this measure strengthens the principles which were introduced under the former, coalition government. The detail of what is intended has not been provided, but I understand from the minister that these amended principles will be introduced on 30 November. Of course, the safety of residents should never, ever be compromised, and these principles will ensure that unsuitable people are not working with frail older Australians. For the record, I read a recent report from Aged and Community Care Victoria regarding the current system of police checks. A number of concerns were raised in the article about the current arrangement and the fact that it does not provide for continuous tracking of offences and that police checks only reveal a snapshot of the criminal history and do not give an ongoing, up-to-date record. There were also concerns raised about the variations in spent conviction schemes from state to state and varied definitions in categories of crimes and offences. I would ask the minister to consider the proposal from Aged and Community Care Victoria about whether or not a national system could be administered by one federal government department or agency to replace the current system of police checks. For the most part this bill is supported by the aged-care industry, but it would be remiss of me today not to highlight some of the concerns we in the coalition hold for the future of the industry and, indeed, concerns the industry itself has for its future. Despite the positive attempts at reform contained within this bill, I still believe there is a long way to go in reforming the aged-care sector to reflect the needs of our ageing population. The industry needs a bipartisan approach to deal with the range of challenges currently on the radar. I do not exaggerate when I say the aged-care industry is in crisis. Without the right approach to policy and legislation, without the right approach to addressing the needs of Australia’s ageing population over the coming years, the viability of the industry will be in extreme jeopardy. Many providers are operating in the red due to funding constraints. Only last month, Grant Thornton’s interim survey was released, and it showed that the return on investment of a high-care MAIN COMMITTEE bed was 1.1 per cent and, because of the non-viability of the sector, industry is finding it difficult to attract capital. With regard to this bill, I believe there will be additional financial burdens on approved providers in complying with their new and amended obligations. This will act as a further deterrent of investor confidence in the industry. This is a very real concern, because we need to encourage providers to take up more bed licences, but the opposite is happening. Providers are walking away from the industry. They are returning bed licences and making decisions at a board level not to apply for further licences. There is in fact an undersubscription of those bed licences, and we saw that in the last funding round in Western Australia and Tasmania. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.50 am to 12.06 pm decision is the volume of red tape, paperwork and compliance requirement which is taking the focus away from the care of Australians. I therefore urge the parliament to consider the extent to which the additional and amended obligations proposed in the bill will affect the ability of industry to provide the high level of care that older Australians expect. The Australian community take the care of our most elderly and frail very seriously. We expect older Australians to have access to high-quality and affordable aged-care services, but as staff are weighed down by paperwork the focus is taken away from care. In the coming years, the aged-care industry will need to respond to the changing health needs and longevity of Australians. As a country we will need to respond to the increasing number of Australians suffering from dementia. There will be a growing prevalence of comorbidity-people living with two or more diseases at the same time. The changing patterns of disease will create the need for greater diversity in the care needs of older Australians. But diminishing returns on investment may in fact see providers exit the industry and the needs of caring for older Australians will certainly suffer. Baby boomers will want more choice in the type of facility in which they want to invest or indeed spend the remaining years of their lives. As I said, the viability of the aged-care industry in this country is under threat. It is under threat at a time when the ageing of our population is growing at an alarming rate. The industry is facing numerous challenges to deliver first class aged care to older Australians. To meet those challenges, the industry needs confidence and assurance from this government that it is listening and will address the funding needs of the aged-care industry. At the end of the day, it is the frail, older Australians who are going to be affected. In closing, I do commend the minister today for strengthening the Aged Care Act 1997, but I urge her to work cooperatively with industry and indeed the opposition to develop policy that will sustain a healthy, vibrant industry that will meet the needs of our ageing population. It is imperative that a review of our aged-care regulatory and funding arrangements is undertaken as a matter of urgency. The opposition is not opposed to this bill. However, we reserve our opinions on a number of matters pending receipt of further information from the Senate inquiry. Aged Care Amendment (2008 Measures No. 2) Bill 2008.

254,Mrs May,"In continuing my remarks on this aged-care legislation, a further factor in the",158,Social Security Legislation Amendment Employment Services Reform Bill 2008
255,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (12.09 Pm),"I rise today to take the opportunity to support theof changes for aged care under the Rudd Labor government. Older Australians deserve highquality care regardless of whether they are in residential care or receiving community care in their own homes. Older Australians are and have always been an incredibly valued asset in our community. They have helped shape this country. They have shaped the composition of modern Australia, and they will continue to make a significant contribution to society with a lifetime of skills, knowledge and experience. This bill before the chamber today highlights how serious we are about older Australians and how committed we are to one of the major challenges faced by the nation-that is, protecting our aged and frail. I regularly take the opportunity, as I am sure most members do, to recognise the contributions of older Australians in our local communities not only to their families but also within the communities themselves. I encourage the participation by older Australians in various community activities. Only last month, I had the opportunity of presenting six community service awards to older Australians on behalf of my community of Werriwa. Between them, the six recipients clocked up almost 20 years of service to our community. Such an effort is more than worthy of recognition and appreciation. The award recipients were: Samuel Oliver, who was nominated by the Lurnea Adult Activity Centre; Alf Cooper, Elizabeth Henderson, Gwen Scherer and Dorothy Kerr-Lansom, who were nominated by the Pembroke Lodge in Minto; and Jean Cameron, who was nominated by the Campbelltown City Senior Citizens and Pensioners Welfare Club. Without these amazing people, so many things that we ordinarily take for granted in our communities would simply not take place at all. Whether it is organising the regular bus trips, organising activities and outings or working to assist in various charitable works in our communities, these things, unfortunately, fall to people in some cases who have the time but above all who have the commitment, wherewithal and ability to keep making these contributions. Like other members, I do try to recognise and honour that continued community activity by many of the older Australians in my electorate. By the way, they do not do it to compete for awards or honours. There is no fuss or fanfare about these people. They are very committed and they worked diligently to ensure that our communities are the better for it. This bill will go a long way to continuing to please and reward older Australians by amending the Aged Care Act 1997 and the Aged Care (Bond Security) Act 2006 to address current legislative inadequacies and maintain effective regulatory safeguards for ensuring highquality care for our older Australians. In particular, these amendments will link approved provider status to the allocation of aged-care places directly linked to the Commonwealth funding. They will modernise the legislation so that it better aligns with contemporary business practices and applies to all approved providers regardless of their corporate structures. They will streamline the assessment of frail and older Australians to ensure that more timely, consistent and quality assessments are provided. They will ensure that any accommodation bonds or like payments paid by our older Australians for entry into aged care are fully protected under the Commonwealth bonds guarantee scheme, and they will make some minor operational changes to improve the administration of the legislation so that it operates in a more efficient and effective manner. The Minister for Ageing outlined in her second reading speech that the features of this bill are significantly different to what existed in 1997 when the Aged Care Act came into effect. A bit over a decade later, the sector has, quite frankly, evolved from one which was typically a MAIN COMMITTEE one-site, one-service type where the owner of the facility was also the operator, to now oneand my electorate is no different to many others here-that is often a multi-site, multi-state and certainly multi-service operation using complex financial and legal arrangements. In other words, there are large business models underpinning these facilities. That is really what has eventuated over the last 10 years or so. The last decade has also seen a significant increase in the levels of investment in the sector from large corporate entities, where the owner and operator of the facility have distinct roles and distinct responsibilities which are often very separate. They cannot, in other words, be considered one and the same. Therefore, in many instances, the current business model that exists now does not actually lend itself to scrutiny of these complex corporate structures. The changes which are laid out in the bill are now very much intended to ensure that the regulations do keep pace with these changing developments within this industry generally. The bill is aimed at a range of people who are considered to be the key personnel for the proposed regulatory scrutiny. Currently, as the minister put it in her second reading speech, the existing legislation is aimed at those who pull the financial strings. But they may not necessarily be considered the key personnel. The amendments before us will ensure that an inspection of all of those who pull the financial strings and the relevant provisions apply consistently to all approved providers. The bill will provide better protection for residents and promote public confidence by increasing the capacity for the Department of Health and Ageing to consider the record of the related entity when making decisions about approvals. This is very important. It is not just about whether the entity has the ability to bankroll a development; it also goes to the actual record in service delivery. So it will assist people, not only the frail and the elderly but also their children who are helping to make decisions on their behalf in some instances, to see the company’s record of service delivery and therefore to judge suitability. I think that is also significant. From the department’s position, this will allow them to assess suitability by having regard to the delivery of service record of those who are seeking approval for these developments. Importantly, the bill also makes changes to the regulatory and administrative framework. The bill will make clear that only aged-care services are regulated under the Aged Care Act, removing uncertainty about which aged-care services are regulated by this legislation. This is necessary given contemporary developments. What we are now seeing-which, again, I think is pretty consistent across all our electorates-is that developers are sometimes developing aged-care retirement villages and disabled care all in the same development. That gives rise to a level of uncertainty as to the regulatory regime that actually applies throughout that total development and particularly how it impacts or does not fully impact under the Aged Care Act. These reforms all add up to greater confidence for aged-care recipients and their providers about their rights, obligations and protections that apply under this scheme of regulation. As the shadow minister indicated, she understood that these amendments had the support of industry. It is important to note that the changes outlined in the bill have been subject to significant consultation with the aged-care sector, largely undertaken through the Ageing Consultative Committee. In addition to the committee’s activities, there was broad consultation through the distribution of a paper prepared by the Department of Health and Ageing that reMAIN COMMITTEE sulted in substantial written submissions received from stakeholders that informed the development and finetuning of the complex legislative and policy reform process. I would like to spend a little time talking about some aged-care facilities in my electorate of Werriwa. Like all members, I visit aged-care facilities and these ones in my electorate operate at a very high standard and have a proven record when it comes to aged care. For instance, the Blue Hills Village at Prestons is a market leader in the field. They have a very close cooperation with their local community and provide high-quality service, particularly for veterans. Maurice Tulich is the CEO of the village and is a bloke I have known for many years. He is certainly committed to excellence. It is a family owned and operated business and continues a proud tradition of growth and change to meet community needs and market demand. He has just opened a new facility on the outskirts of Menangle in the electorate of my colleague the member for Macarthur. It is a state-of-the-art facility and one that we can be justly proud of in the south-west of Sydney. It was not all that long ago that the Minister for Ageing, the Hon. Justine Elliot, paid a visit to the Blue Hills Village to pay tribute to Ian Monro for his voluntary work with members of the community at the Blue Hills Village as well as the wider community of Prestons. The minister also went to the Frank Whiddon Masonic Nursing Home, Easton Park, at Glenfield. She met with residents at two of the facilities and gained a greater understanding about Masonic homes generally throughout New South Wales. Robert Hillier, the CEO, and his staff are highly trained and professional people. The significance of the Frank Whiddon Masonic Nursing Home is that it is the headquarters for all the Masonic homes operating in New South Wales. The minister was able to spend an hour or two with Robert and his staff discussing a broad range of issues applying to the industry. We are very fortunate to have people of that calibre in my electorate. Two other local aged-care facilities I would like to mention are Maple Grove at Casula, which is managed by Barbara Mullen, and Pembroke Lodge at Minto, which is managed by Joseph Zhou and the director is Lorraine Rushbrook. Lorraine only recently visited my office with a number of residents from Pembroke Lodge, ones we specifically recognised for their continued commitment to the community of south-west Sydney. Many people agonise over decisions to move their parents-or grandparents, in many respects; in my case, my parents-to a retirement community. As the previous speaker-the shadow minister for ageing-has said, a lot of this in terms of community expectations goes back to people seeking to have the standard of care that we want to afford our own parents, and there certainly are changes in expectations in that respect. The retirement community in Werriwa have excellent choices in terms of their retirement community providers. BeforeI finish talking about my local providers I should say-on behalf of the government but certainly on my own behalf-that there is a genuine appreciation for the time, the effort and the commitment that the wonderful staff of the community providers show and the dignity they provide in looking after the older Australians in my electorate of Werriwa. I will return now to what this bill is about. This bill comes about in the midst of a global economic crisis but, again, we are taking decisive actions to strengthen the Australian economy. This bill will make a significant amendment that will help protect the accommodation bonds of older Australians. By the way, as at 30 June last year there was $6.3 billion in bonds held under the guarantee scheme. Currently, under the accommodation bond guarantee scheme, repayment of the bonds is made only in the event of the provider becoming insolvent MAIN COMMITTEE or bankrupt. As we have discussed over the last number of years, there are many business structures operating out there that simply being insolvent or bankrupt may not be the sole protections required in terms of these guarantees. Many have been put in, as I know myself, on behalf of parents and others, so a level of financial security is required. This bill will strengthen the protections of the bonds by ensuring that they are fully protected by the guarantee scheme, not just in instances of insolvency or bankruptcy, and therefore these assets will be protected. And, by the way, these are sometimes the assets of some of those most vulnerable in our society. The other proposed amendments concern police checks. At the moment, under the existing legislation, police checks are provided only for people who are working as staff with unsupervised access to residents. This government is committed to ensuring that older Australians in nursing homes and hostels receive quality care in a safe and secure environment. As such, the amendment before us will ensure that all persons working in these facilities, regardless of their activities, are obligated to undergo police checks. As I say, this will extend police checking to all staff, regardless of whether they are supervised or unsupervised. The only criterion is that they have access to residents. Further, the waiting time will be reduced for aged-care assessments by streamlining the assessments. During the consultation stage, as I mentioned a little earlier, it was identified that one of the major causes of discontent is the level of time it takes for an individual to be assessed by an aged-care assessment team. This is now going to be streamlined to best meet the needs of the people concerned and to ensure that the services being provided are the most appropriate. Nevertheless, the amendments to the bill will make the assessments more efficient and more effective. Finally, the bill will also provide for a more formal arrangement in respect of notifications of missing persons and for those notifications to be put through to the Department of Health and Ageing when residents are reported missing to police. This is to ensure that appropriate safeguards are put into a system so that, when a person has gone missing, appropriate action is being taken by the provider to ensure that, where possible, we guard against similar breaches occurring. Again, that is a significant measure of security. Over the next four years, the Australian government will provide more than $40 billion in funding to aged and community care, including $28.6 billion to nursing homes and hostels. As I said at the outset of the speech, this legislation provides extensive change, which is long overdue, to the Aged Care Act. More importantly, it is about protecting the most vulnerable members of our society: the frail, the aged, and the infirm. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lindsay) adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. La Trobe Electorate: Bushfires season. Around our nation, families pack the car and head for the beaches or go camping in the bush. Throughout Australia there is the smell of sausages sizzling on the barbeque, sparking happy memories for many.

Last February marked 25 years since the catastrophic MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Social Security Legislation Amendment Employment Services Reform Bill 2008
256,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (12.30 Pm),I move:,162,Adjournment
257,Mr Wood (La Trobe) (12.30 Pm),"In Australia, summer brings the start of the holidayAsh Wednesday bushfires swept across South Australia and Victoria, tragically killing 75 people and destroying thousands of homes. Cockatoo, Belgrave Heights and Upper Beaconsfield, in my electorate of La Trobe, were the hardest hit areas, accounting for more than a third of all fatalities, with 27 people perishing in the intense blaze. The Ash Wednesday fires left an indelible mark on the community of the Dandenong Ranges. For many in summer, the smell of smoke or the crackle of fire evokes terror in their hearts. You can imagine the fear many felt when they learned of the Bureau of Meteorology’s grim warning that the Dandenong Ranges is at extreme fire risk this summer. The hills are experiencing their worse fire conditions in over 15 years-worse than the conditions of January 1997, when, tragically, three people were killed in Ferny Creek and more than 40 homes were destroyed in the Dandenong Ranges. The extreme dryness caused by the drought has made the hills a ticking time bomb-one spark could set them alight, with devastating consequences. Sadly, it appears that nearly every year we have some idiot going around the hills trying to deliberately start fires. Water storages have dropped in Melbourne from 40 per cent this time last year to 33 per cent now. For these reasons, it is essential that aerial firefighting helicopters known as the Erickson Air-Cranes be made available to the Dandenong Ranges. The Erickson sky cranes are the most effective tool in aerial firefighting, being able to draw water from water sources as shallow as 45 centimetres deep, able to refill in less than 45 seconds and able to carry as much as 10,000 litres of water per load. They are essential to the CFA’s firefighting efforts this summer. La Trobe is protected by some 27 CFA brigades. I am going to name them because they all do a magnificent job. They include Boronia, The Basin, Belgrave, Belgrave Heights and South, Beaconsfield, Upper Beaconsfield, Berwick, Cockatoo, Ferntree Gully, Upper Ferntree Gully, Upwey, Clematis, Selby, Sassafras and Ferny Creek, Olinda, Macclesfield, Emerald, Gembrook, Kalorama and Mount Dandenong, Menzies Creek, Narre Warren East, Narre Warren North, Kallista-The Patch, Officer, Pakenham, Pakenham Upper and Toomuc Valley. These brigades not only have fought fires in La Trobe but have also assisted with many fires right across the state of Victoria. I would briefly like to mention two dedicated local CFA volunteer members: Peter Marke, who incredibly is in his 50th year of service with the CFA and recently retired as captain of the Upwey brigade after 35 years of service; and John McLeod, who is in his 54th year of service with the Boronia CFA and received in 1990 the Australian Fire Service Medal for his dedication to the volunteer brigade. I congratulate them both on their commitment to fighting fires in the Dandenong Ranges. The dedication of our local CFA brigades has protected La Trobe for many years on many occasions. Many of our local brigades could not survive without the loyal volunteers who balance their commitments to volunteer firefighting with full-time jobs and family commitments. We must provide our CFA brigades with as much support as they need to fight bushfires. Each year, the Australian government leases several Erickson sky cranes such as Elvis and the Incredible Hulk from the United States to assist with firefighting. The sky cranes do an amazing job, and this year the Australian government has leased five sky cranes and I congratulate it for that. Two of those will be allocated to Victoria. WhatI am asking the government to do is to make one specifically available on stand-by for the Dandenong Ranges. The simple reason for that is that the Dandenong Ranges come second only to California as the MAIN COMMITTEE most fire-prone area in the world. So, again, I call on the government to make a sky crane available on stand-by for the Dandenong Ranges. Robertson Electorate: Medical Services Ms NEAL (Robertson) (12.35 pm)-I rise today to inform members of a serious deficiency in medical services in my electorate of Robertson. Based on the Central Coast towns of Gosford and Woy Woy, Robertson is a rapidly growing region with a significant percentage of aged people in its population. Despite these facts, there is no public radiotherapy unit on the Central Coast to service the medical needs of my constituents, many of whom are suffering from debilitating and life-threatening cancers. To access public radiotherapy treatment, the people of the Central Coast have three options: firstly, they can choose to pay many thousands of dollars at a private facility in Gosford; secondly, they can choose to travel to the nearest public facilities at hospitals located in Newcastle or North Sydney; and, thirdly, they can choose-or, to put it more accurately, they are forced-to refuse treatment for their cancers. This is an intolerable situation that constitutes a serious deficiency in the public health facilities for many thousands of people. The Central Coast is part of the Northern Sydney Central Coast Health service area. By 2016, New South Wales Health estimates that there will be approximately 2,596 cancer patients in the area health service region. This amounts to a 30 per cent increase in the number of people requiring treatment for cancer over the period from 2006 to 2016. It is clear from these alarming statistics that something must be done to relieve the severe financial, emotional and practical hardships placed upon my constituents. A public radiotherapy facility must be built in Robertson. Sadly, there is distressing anecdotal evidence that some Central Coast cancer patients have been forced to forgo life-saving cancer treatment, thereby putting their lives at serious risk. Among the major reasons they do this is that either they cannot afford the costs of private treatment in Gosford or they cannot travel to North Sydney or Newcastle every time they need treatment. This is a scandalous situation that my constituents have suffered for too long. Compared to their neighbours in the northern Sydney section of the area health service region, the people of the Central Coast experience poorer health and have higher mortality rates. They have high rates of behavioural health risk factors such as smoking and obesity. Importantly, they also have poorer general access to health practitioners, to primary care and to diagnostic and specialist health care than their northern Sydney neighbours. The disparity between my constituents and the residents of the North Shore is nowhere more starkly illustrated than in the complete lack of radiotherapy services on the Central Coast. A single private radiotherapy service operates in Gosford. In-patients in Gosford Hospital have access to this service but there are many more cancer sufferers who are no longer in-patients who simply cannot afford to pay for treatment at this private facility. The alternative is to travel to hospitals in North Sydney or Newcastle, which are generally at least an hour and a half away on public transport. For many cancer sufferers, some of whom are desperately sick, this is not a desirable or even a possible outcome. Lengthy and frequent trips on public transport to and from treatment have a devastating effect on the finances, working routine, family life and emotional stability of these people. MAIN COMMITTEE I intend to take whatever necessary steps there are to remedy this problem. In February this year I met with a local advocacy group that is campaigning for the establishment of a public radiotherapy unit to be located at Gosford Hospital, and I have spoken with them again today. My office has been alerted to instances of severe hardship suffered by local people trying to access radiotherapy treatment. One 67-year-old man was faced with a bill of between $3,500 and $4,500. He was unable to pay until a generous donor provided him with that money. The services of a radiotherapy unit are required for my electorate. I am determined that the healthcare needs of my constituents will not be compromised in the manner that they are being and have been for so long. I will be making the strongest possible representations to the Minister for Health and Ageing about this matter. The Central Coast must have adequate public radiotherapy services, and I will be fighting very hard to ensure they get them. Kokoda Campaign Ms MARINO (Forrest) (12.40 pm)-It is very important that as a nation this week we acknowledge the service men and women who have served this country particularly well. I would like to acknowledge all those involved between 1942 and 1943 on the Kokoda Track in what was one of Australia’s most significant and historic conflicts in any theatre of war. We should not forget the desperation of the early 1940s. Nazi Germany had conquered and was in control of most of Europe, and the Japanese had taken the Philippines and attacked Siam, Malaya, Hong Kong, French Indochina, the Dutch East Indies, Burma and Borneo. They had bombed the American fleet in Pearl Harbour; captured Singapore, taking 22,000 Australian troops prisoner of war; and bombed Darwin, killing 243 Australians. Japanese submarines had entered Sydney Harbour. In July 1942, Australia had only two militia brigades in Port Moresby. The Japanese were ordered to take Port Moresby overland from Buna and Gona. The port facilities would have provided an ideal base to attack Northern Australia and the US Navy in the Pacific. The inexorable, ruthless march south of the formidable Japanese imperial forces appeared to be allconquering-they had not yet lost a battle in the strike through Malaya, Singapore and the Philippines. After Kokoda airfield was lost to the imperial forces, the only barrier between the Japanese forces in the north and Port Moresby on the south coast was the rugged, steep Owen Stanley Range. With our Allied forces fighting throughout Europe in various areas of engagement, the Australian and Papuan forces made a last, desperate attempt to repel the Japanese. They were outnumbered five to one by battle-hardened, highly trained forces and had to deal with malaria, tropical rains and diseases, mosquito infested swamps, stinking mud, leeches and searing heat and humidity, but the Australian troops displayed stoic defence, courage and determination, and their capacity to inflict as much harm as possible on the Japanese was assisted by the local Papuan people. Papuan porters, affectionately nicknamed ‘the fuzzy wuzzy angels’, provided the primary, essential transport of supplies and extracted the sick and wounded with great care in almost impossible circumstances. The fuzzy wuzzy angels’ bushcraft, knowledge of the land and unending assistance was invaluable to our troops. It has been stated that no known wounded soldier who was still alive was ever abandoned by the fuzzy wuzzy angels, regardless of MAIN COMMITTEE heavy fire or extreme forms of conflict or conditions. At times, it would take up to six days walking through thick jungle to reach a hospital area. I would also like to take this opportunity to recognise the significant contribution made by the Salvation Army. The uncle of one of my constituents from my electorate of Forrest fought in the Kokoda campaign. He said that the dedication of the Salvation Army could also not be spoken of more highly. In his words: After meticulously preparing a camp invisible to the enemy and just when you thought nobody could see you, the Salvos would often tap you on the shoulder, having crawled through the bush to deliver you a cup of cocoa or something similar. Syd Heylen, from the 39th Battalion, said in an interview: Thank God for the Salvos. I know the nicest thing I ever had on the Kokoda Trail was a cup of tea given to me by the Salvation Army. AndI hated tea that never had milk or sugar in it; this didn’t have any in it and I loved it, I wanted more. I had half a cup, that’s all they had. I never forgot that one. Major Albert Moore, the Salvation Army’s representative attached to the 21st Brigade, later wrote of his experiences: I look back on those days as among the greatest in my life, never again do I hope to hear the sighs of relief that I heard during those days, as men, utterly exhausted, weak, sick and wounded, would well nigh fall at our feet. Those words were from Major Moore himself. Six months of some of the bloodiest and most difficult land fighting of the Pacific war, including the battle of the beaches, ended on 22 January 1943. Australia lost 2,165 troops, and 3,533 were wounded. How many of the wounded would not have survived without the help from the fuzzy wuzzy angels and the Salvation Army is not known. This campaign forever sealed the relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea. We should recognise sacrifices made by people who did so much for our forces and our country. The fuzzy wuzzy angels stood beside our troops on our sovereign soil and helped defend our country during such an important time. It is with great respect and gratitude that I acknowledge this week the efforts of all our Australian service men and women who have, and do, serve this nation. Community Health Research sity of Queensland Ipswich Campus, where I met with Robert Bush PhD, Professor of Community Health Research, and Dr Kathryn Ahern, from the School of Nursing and Midwifery. The University of Queensland Ipswich Campus is the location of the Healthy Communities Research Centre, which was established in September 2007 and is an international hub for community health research. The centre arose in part from a population health profile of the Ipswich and West Moreton Division of General Practice, and I commend former CEO Kevin Pitman, who had the foresight to seek Australian government funding for that study, which was conducted by the Public Health Information Development Unit at the University of Adelaide, South Australia. The study established that the socioeconomic status of the Ipswich and West Moreton area was lower than Brisbane’s and also lower than the Australian average. There were more single-parent families and a high proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, full-time secondary education participation was lower and more households were receiving rent assistance. Health indicators also showed the local community was more disadvantaged in terms of respiratory system diseases, asthma, circulatory system diseases, diabeMAIN COMMITTEE",162,Adjournment
258,Mr Neumann (Blair) (12.45 Pm),"RecentlyI had the privilege of attending the Univertes, injury, mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal system diseases, obesity and overweight generally. Sadly, also, the number of smokers was much higher and people were more physically inactive. As a result of that study, the Ipswich Hospital Foundation decided to strengthen the focus of research in the local area and, with the participation of the University of Queensland, came up with the idea of the Healthy Communities Research Centre. It will carry out a longitudinal study that will be known as the Ipswich Study, examining health related projects and the interface between the various determinants of health using both longitudinal and comparative methodologies. It will be looking to integrate what should be done in terms of future growth in communities. This is being done because Ipswich will grow faster than any other area in South-East Queensland. Because it is also an area of low socioeconomic status, it is a perfect laboratory for this kind of study. People at the Healthy Communities Research Centre are very excited about this prospect because Ipswich is a mixture of urban, rural and cultural communities, with substantive changes taking place. So this rapidly changing environment will be the perfect catalyst for this type of study. Professor Bush said recently that the Ipswich study can become the hub around which an international centre for research on community health can be built. But, of course, it needs support. I am pleased to say that the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland has provided funding of $300,000 to employ a research fellow for the study, Dr David Marshall, who joined the centre in July this year. However, the study also needs the support of the local community, not just of the council but of other partnerships, business and local, individuals and community organisations, churches, charities, the RSL and sporting and other community groups. It needs sufficient funding, both federal and state, as well as from the University of Queensland. The study will go a long way to assist the objectives of the state government’s South-East Queensland Regional Plan to secure well-designed, safe and healthy local communities. It will also encourage active community participation in these types of events, because we have to plan things properly. We have to plan our hospitals, our health services, our roads and our schools. Just south of where I live, 120,000 people will live in the Ripley Valley in the next 20 years. We have got to plan properly, and we need the research to be able to do that. The Ipswich Study is very important for this reason. I urge the local community, including the local council, to get behind this study. This is worthwhile and will create an international hub for future development. It will be great for South-East Queensland and great for Ipswich. Rudd Government: Economic Security Strategy Legislation is both a serious business and a distinct honour. Today in the parliament, however, the Rudd government trivialised the business of government and brought distinct dishonour upon itself. How and why did it do this? I am not sure why but I know how. Today in the House of Representatives, in our parliament, the Rudd government closed debate for members of the opposition on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Economic Security Strategy) Bill 2008 and cognate bills, legislation that seeks to inject some $10.4 billion into the Australian economy. The federal opposition supports the legislation. However, while it supports it, it also believes its members have the right to speak on the bill and to express their views. I, as the federal member for Ryan, have not had that opportunity today in the House of RepresentaMAIN COMMITTEE",166,Adjournment
259,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (12.50 Pm),"Governing is a serious business. Governing Australiatives. I have not had the opportunity today to express my views and my thoughts on behalf of the people of Ryan. The Prime Minister has described the global financial crisis, which requires the leadership and the goodwill of all governments and of all peoples, as a ‘rolling national security crisis’. On this basis, I believe that not only government members but, indeed, opposition members should have the right and the opportunity to speak at length and in depth on the legislation. The legislation is important because it has invested and injected across the country some $10.4 billion of taxpayers’ money. It has invested this in a whole range of stakeholders, from pensioners to people in the Ryan electorate who are receiving family tax benefits. Therefore, I think that as the member for RyanI ought to comment on the taxpayers’ contribution to the global financial crisis and redressing and minimising its impact on the Australian economy. The Rudd government was able to spend some $10.4 billion of taxpayers’ money because it had the surplus of the previous Howard-Costello government. Half of the surplus is now invested in the community-that is, some $10.4 billion of some $22 billion left by the previous Howard government. So, at the stroke of a pen, an enormous amount of money-in anybody’s language-has been injected into the Australian community. The people of Ryan will know that the federal opposition supports this action. I support it because it is seen to be in the interests of the Australian people. But, as the elected member for Ryan, I consider it my responsibility and indeed my duty to speak on behalf of the people that I represent, to speak on behalf of the people of the western suburbs of Brisbane, to give them my views and my concerns and to raise issues in relation to elements of the $10.4 billion. We remain a parliamentary democracy. When I was a member of the Howard government, opportunities for members of the then government and the then opposition to speak were of fundamental importance to me, and when I felt that those opportunities were not presented to members of the then government and the then parliament I raised it with those in positions of leadership. I am a firm believer in the democratic process. I would not be in the parliament without the mechanism of democracy that we have in this country, a mechanism we ought to cherish. In a week when we celebrate and honour Australian men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the last 90 years in the name of freedom and under the Australian flag, I express my profound disappointment, as someone who cherishes the freedom and democracy of our country, at the government’s actions. As the son and as a grandson of people who wore the uniform in two theatres of war and in different times, in different generations and in different places, I express my deep disappointment at the decision of the government today in the House of Representatives to prevent members of the opposition and indeed some of their own members from speaking on this important bill. When the opposition is next in office I intend to maintain the position I have put. I believe that all members should have the opportunity to speak in debates on bills of profound importance, especially given that the world now confronts a global financial and economic crisis. Many commentators and experts say the world has not seen a crisis of such significance since the days of the Great Depression. I feel strongly enough on this to say shame on the Rudd government, shame on the Prime Minister and shame on all those who share this view. I will inform the people of Ryan of my position. MAIN COMMITTEE Corio Electorate: Local Government of Geelong as part of the City of Greater Geelong Council elections. CanI start by wishing all the candidates in the council elections all the very best. I think running for public office at the best of times is a difficult task, but I have always felt managing the City of Greater Geelong is a particularly difficult task. Effectively, those people are being asked to fulfil a full-time position yet they are only paid a part-time allowance. I take my hat off to all those who are willing to have a crack at the council elections. What a council election does, as every election does, is afford an opportunity for all of those within the Geelong community to debate the big issues which are affecting our city. CanI say at the outset I think it is very important that the debate actually occurs, that we do have a discussion about the things which really matter to the people of Geelong. To that end, I would like to make my contribution to that debate here by talking about what I think is easily the biggest issue for the people of Geelong right now-that is, economic development. Australia’s economy has been in transition. The proportion of the labour force employed in manufacturing, say, in the seventies was about twice what it is now. We have seen no greater shift in that regard than the one that has occurred in Geelong. That has been exemplified recently by the decisions taken by the Ford Motor Company. Over the last 15 months, we have seen decisions resulting in 1,000 jobs being shed from the 1,900 strong workforce at Ford-and that will be completed in the next two years. No doubt those decisions have been accelerated by the current global financial crisis. Just as state and federal governments need to do, the council must respond to the events of the last couple of months and put in place a package which will help get the people of Geelong through the current economic crisis. At a council level, I think the structure around economic development is sound. There is a councillor who holds an economic development portfolio and indeed that has been Councillor Peter McMullin. He has done a wonderful job in that capacity with a number of initiatives. As he is not recontesting this election, I certainly wish him all the best for the future. In relation to the structure of the paid staff who underpin the council, I would make the following observation. The coordinator of economic development within the council, who is the most senior council officer solely responsible for economic development, reports to the manager of planning strategy and economic development, who in turn reports to the general manager of development sustainability, who in turn reports to the chief executive officer, who in turn reports to the council. Having so many layers between the key economic development adviser and the council means that the advice is diluted by the time it reaches council. It means that the ability to place pre-eminence on economic development, which at this moment in time is absolutely critical, is, in my view, being lost due to the current structure of the council. I think it would be far better if there were a dedicated economic development officer, who existed at a general manager level within the City of Greater Geelong, reporting directly to the CEO and having direct access to the council. In that way, you would have a much firmer basis of advice for the council. Both state and Commonwealth governments are acting fast at the moment in putting forward economic stimulus packages for our state and our nation to get us through this economic crisis. The council has to do that as well. In order to be able to act nimbly, swiftly and deciMAIN COMMITTEE",167,Adjournment
260,Mr Marles (Corio) (12.55 Pm),"Last Tuesday, election packs were sent to the peoplesively on this, you have to have the appropriate staff structure underpinning the council to allow that to occur. I think this election affords a wonderful opportunity to discuss issues of that kind. For the new councillors elected there is a real opportunity for them to review the structure of the staff so that they can see whether economic development within the staff structure can be given a higher priority. I will finish the way I started by wishing members of the new council the best of luck. It will come into being at a very difficult time for Geelong, but it is also a time of great opportunity for its members to make a difference for their community. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 pm MAIN COMMITTEE (Question No. 342) Mr Ian Macfarlane asked the Minister for Trade, in writing, on 22 September 2008: Will he give a commitment that workers in the automotive and textile, clothing and footwear industries in Australia will not be worse off as a result of the implementation of the ANZ-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement. The ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA) will provide Australian industry with opportunities to expand their export markets in a more open trading environment. Improved export opportunities will be particularly apparent in industries such as automotive and textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) where ASEAN’s tariffs are relatively high compared to Australia. Tariffs in 30 per cent to 100 per cent for passenger motor vehicles; 5 per cent to 40 per cent for textiles; 5 per cent to 50 per cent for clothing; and 5 per cent to 50 per cent for footwear. generally in the range of 90 per cent to 99 per cent of all tariff lines. Detailed information on outcomes, including for particular countries and sectors, cannot be released until the Agreement has been signed. However, significant liberalisation will occur in both the automotive and TCF sectors. The more open trading environment provided as a result of the FTA, together with the regional rules of origin which will govern trade under the Agreement, should encourage greater use of regional supply chains that should support higher productivity and greater innovation. Australia’s automotive sector already has a strong export profile and AANZFTA will provide new opportunities for the industry. Opportunities also exist for the TCF industry through reductions in tariffs in ASEAN countries. Australia’s TCF industry has undergone substantial restructuring in recent years and there should be opportunities for it to gain greater access to ASEAN markets for its distinctive and innovative products, such as technical textiles. The recently released “Building Innovative Capacity: Review of the Australian Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industries” report underscores that the industry’s future health lies in focussing on innovation and high quality textiles in a global market marked by diminishing levels of tariff protection.
