9,Mr Snedden (Bruce,"Leade r of theThis socialist Government has given the Australian people 11 months of hard labour. Its achievement has been to prove itself the most incompetent government Australia has had for over 40 years. Its bungling in so many major areas has been reckless beyond reason. It has demonstrated beyond any doubt that it simply does not have the capacity to govern this country. It is chained by ideology, laced with mediocrity and sustained only by demagoguery. The public is fearful of just where this socialist Government is taking Australia. Business and industry are unable to plan for the future. Nationalisation remains a constant threat until it is taken out of the Labor Party's platform. The economy is in a shambles. Inflation has soared with no prospect of early relief. Industrial lawlessness is the rule. Australia's defence system is threatened to be reduced to a mere token gesture. Our relations with many countries have been torn by dissension and mistrust. Our stable and prosperous democracy has degenerated into a divided and bitterly disillusioned nation. Yet the Government merely continues along its bumbling and arrogant way, caring nothing for the welfare of the people who elected it. It consistently fails to reply to the questions being asked of it by every group in the community. lust yesterday I asked the Treasurer ( Mr Crean) a question concerning the Government's monetary policy. He refused to answer it, even though his name is Frank-poo r old Frank. I asked the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) for a statement on the Government's future actions about inflation. All he did was to repeat the same old list of past measures which have been such an abysmal failure. This Government has been rightly referred to recently as uninitiated, inexperienced twits, by a leading member of the business community. The Government simply does not care about the astonishing damage it has done and will continue to do to Australia. It is squeezing the economy and burdening every Australian taxpayer. Collections from income tax on individuals will increase by more than $1,000m this financial year. With6 million taxpayers in Australia this represents an increased income tax payment of over $160 a year for each taxpayer. Average earnings are estimated in the Budget-estimate d by the Government to increase by 13 per cent. It takes little mathematical ability to realise that the average wage earner at the end of 1973-74 will have suffered a huge price and tax increase and that he will be worse off than at the commencement of the financial year. This irresponsible approach is typified by the nor) who is strangling the mineral and oil industries. His actions sum up so well what the Whitlam Government is slowly doing to Australia. Secretive, incompetent, deaf to any views but his own, he has 'plans'-in inverted commas-whic h are alarming, unworkable and downright dangerous for the country. He is the symbol of the socialist Government's maladministration. It is he who has the gall to describe journalists, fulfilling their responsibilities, as the apes of the"" Press. The Australian economy is in tatters. Inflation is running at a staggering 14 per cent. Strikes by unions have been allowed to get completely out of hand. The people who are suffering most from these results of the Government's policies are those who can least afford it or protect themselves from it-the pensioners, the superannuitants, people living on life savings, students on scholarships and others on fixed incomes. The housewife recoils at the prices on every visit she makes to the supermarket. But she is powerless to do anything about the situation. Her husband demands more pay to compensate for rising prices, and the whole cycle is repeated. There is virtual industrial anarchy. Sydney has been plunged into chaos by the power strike in support of a 35-hour week, in which the Minister for Minerals and Energy played such a discreditable role. The recent airport stoppage, transport stoppages, garbage strikes and building bans have been imposed on the city. Honourable members opposite know all about the garbage strike. Sydney and other major centres have been hit with strikes covering everything from postal services to the meat industry. A colossal 860,000 working days were lost in the 3 months to 30 June this year, compared with 536,700 in the same period iast year. Thefiguresfor the September quarter will certainly be worse. Many strikes attract little media attention simply because nowadays a strike has to be dramatic to be noticed, because it has to compete with so many others. This intolerable situation exists under a socialist Government which claims a special relationship with the trade union movement; which claims to be the friend of the workers. With friends like that this country could not afford to handle enemies. All its task forces are civilian. Its military exercises",18,Whitlam Government

The Prime Minister shuffled 'Well, it is like the words of that Irish song his pack of cards a little to paper over the ""Kathleen Mavourneen""-it may be for years difficulties in his Ministry. But nobody was and it may be for ever'. Within a week he had impressed with that, least of all the Ministers brought legislation for a prices referendum into who were concerned, and those winds are still this House. The Caucus refused to include blowing around that lean-to of the Ministry. incomes with the prices proposal. Then, after The Minister for Labour( Mr Clyde Cameron), the Prime Minister had delivered his plea, the the man who virtually guaranteed industrial Caucus decided that it may as well throw in peace and stability under a Labor Government, an incomes referendum for good luck.

He has succeeded in having afirst-classrow with the medical profession, although not over fees because his own tribunal upheld the fees claim. The medical profession does not accept the imposition which he intends to heap on it. With the background of a government-medical profession confrontation, how can a health scheme work? This is compounded by the fact that the private hospitals threaten to close if the scheme is put into effect. The patient-nobod y else-wil l suffer. In the field of education the Government has made a completely unrealistic and discriminatory decision. The Minister for Education ( Mr Beazley) achieved a confrontation with State education authorities as soon as he came into office, and then by refusing the per capita grants to the children in the private schools he broke a promise made by the Prime Minister, by the Deputy Prime Minister( Mr Barnard) and by himself. This should not happen. Children at school-a t whatevef school they attend-shoul d have a per capita grant. That is the policy that we on this side of the House have. Both foreign policy and defence have the Government misled the Australian become matters of controversy since 2 people to the extent it has in defence. It has December. We are no longer understood by cut back defence spending and manpower in our friends and allies, and we are treated with our defence industry contrary to the wishes suspicion.

At the same time even though it pretends, by words, that it will units and sections of the armed forces are continue with it. Then we had the most extraordinary situathe morale of ourand tion of eight of the Prime Minister's Cabinet weakened while officer resignations soar. The Ministers and 36 other members of the Labor Minister for Defence will not answer questions Caucus sending a telegram to the Chilean on these matters. He has become incompetent Ambassador in Australia referring to the new to the amusement of the Opposition. HisChilean Government as illegal and indicating that they would undertake to help the Chilean people to regain their freedom. The Prime Minister should make it clear that those 8 Cabinet Ministers and 36 other Labor members have withdrawn what they said in the telegram or else there is no meaning in the Prime Minister's announcement of recognition of the Chilean regime. So the confusion grows. At least the Prime Minister has decided to abandon the task of the foreign affairs portfolio. We might hope that somebody else will do a better job, but with the ineptitude of and continual interference by other Ministers in the job of administering foreign affairs, it seems a rather forlorn hope. After all, the Minister for Overseas Trade is still available to lend a helping hand in foreign affairs. Do honourable members remember when the Prime Minister said: 'From now on there will be only one voice in foreign affairs'? The Minister for Overseas Trade, stripped of his responsibilities in respect of secondary industry for the favoured Mr Enderby, will now have more time to concentrate on helping Senator Willesee with his foreign affairs efforts. I turn now to defence and the hapless Deputy Prime Minister. In no field has the Treasurer, the Minister for ably amount to only 2.6 per cent of the gross product, a drop of almost a full 1 being dismantled by stealth, without public announcements with false assertions that forces has not been seriously incompetence is manifest. Last week he stood at the dispatch box to answer a question. He felt pleased with himself because he had a written statement but he misread it to the extent of including as Latin American countries the United States of America, Canada and several European countries. Because we laughed we were called larrikins. There was no larrikinism about it; it was our sheer amusewell as an incompetent government. ment at the incompetence to which the honourable gentleman has sunk. HoweverI am glad to say that his mistake has been corrected in Hansard. This is typical of the way this Governpanies is no less iiflationary than spendment works-blunder s followed by cosmetic patching. I turn now to the Government's handling of the economy. In the December quarter of 1972 the previous Government had managed to reduce the rate of inflation to an annual rate of less than 5 per cent. During the whole of 1972 prices had risen by only 4.5 per cent. In just over 10 months of office this Government has managed to treble the rate of inflation in Australia. It is now at the rate of 14 per cent a year and the Treasurer expects the December quarter to be as high. Not only are costs out of control but also runaway demand inflation has arrived. It is being reflected in widespread shortages throughout the economy. Industry cannot get labour which is adding to wage pressures. Companies cannot obtain raw materials in the quantities they require, steel and aluminium are in short supply and ages. The figures released for August by the Commonwealth Statistician show up this trend in regard to production. The Government knew all about it. It was warned of it by the Reserve Bank and by the Treasury. But the Treasurer did nothing about it in his Budget. Either the Government deliberately wants to deflate the private sector and sponsor the public sector In accordance with its socialist ideals or it does not understand. The tragedy is that both of these factors are true. The Government continues with rampant spending. If it had bothered to take note of reports, it would have known what it was in for. Only the other day, the Prime Minister's economic adviser, Dr Coombs, told .the National Press Club that the members of the community had to pay for the Government's budgetary measures. He said that they could pay either through taxes or through inflation. Dr Coombs suggested higher tax rates. Despite the fact that the Prime Minister last year assured the country that the rates of taxation need not be increased at any level to implement the Government's program and despite his assurances that taxes were already high enough, he has now refused to give the Parliament an assurance that tax rates will not be raised. We all know that the promise not to increase tax rates was broken in the Budget. This Government is a cynical government as The Prime Minister has been assisted by the Minister for Overseas Trade. He claims that spending by private coming by government. That is a completely inaccurate view. If a private company spends money it must get it out of shareholders' funds or borrowed funds. A dollar spent by a private company is a dollar less spent somewhere else. But if the government goes on spending and creates a deficit in the Budget to finance it, it is creating inflation. We are now paying the cost of such actions. There are a number of matters which should be dealt with. Time does not permit this because the Prime Minister has indicated that he wishes to leave the House by 12 noon and I wish to accommodate him in this regard as a matter of courtesy. However, some things really must be said because it is in the interests of the Australian people to do it. There is the claim that all our inflation is imported. Have honourable members heard that the failure of the revaluations of the Australian dollar to stem inflation makes it difficult to argue that imported inflation is the major cause of our problems in Australia. Dr Coombs' view is also supported by the facts. The argument that inflation is imported implies that the volume of money has been increase by the acquisition of foreign exchange and gold. But an examination of the latest Reserve Bank Statistical Bulletin shows the opposite to be fhe case. In the first 9 months of 1973 the volume of money increased by 13 per cent. Yet, in the same period, the value of gold and foreign exchange holdings of the Reserve Bank fell by $738m. The imported inflation hypothesis simply does not stand up as an adequate excuse for the Government's complete failure to deal with inflation. High rates of inflation overseas did not prevent the Liberal-Country Party Government from achieving a rate of inflation low",20,Whitlam Government
13,The Building Industry Is Facing Material Short,this rubbish and nonsense? But Dr Coombs,22,Whitlam Government
14,"Yes, The Same Dr Coombs","ha s pointed outenough to be the envy of almost every other industrial country. The Labor Party-the low interest Party-ha s forced the interest rate oa long term bonds from 6 per cent to 8i per cent in just 7 months. With its advisers predicting a higher-inflationary situation in 1974 unless urgent measures are taken, the Government has chosen to place all of the burden on the people of Australia and on private businesses through the monetary policy of interest rates. The probability is that the process which raised the bond rate to Si per cent, overdraft rates to 9i per cent and home loans by 1 per cent-if one can get them-wil l continue. It has not ended yet. Money will become even scarcer and dearer, adding to the costs and the personal burden of the people of Australia. The Government should be condemned for its economic policies. At a time when Australia is concerned with the problem of inflation it has brought down an expansionary Budget, it has supported excessive wage claims, it has supported claims for a 35-hour week and the Minister for Minerals and Energy is in the process of committing the Government to further enormous expenditures, without consulting the Cabinet and without any indication of any feasibility or cost-benefit studies having been made. The country cannot afford this type of economic management for much longer. I now come to the Labor Party's attempt at a dirty tricks campaign. The current campaign is born of electoral fear and has 2 elements which have been linked together-first , built a fear of the bogy of the multi-national corporation and then allege that money is pouring into the free enterprise parties' coffers. This campaign has all the subtlety of a Saturday night stoush at the Trades Hall, and the allegation of a Sim fund from foreign interests reflects those are the sorts of people who are running it. The mentality of the men who have been entrusted with the odious task of pursuing it, even if it is a puerile role for them. The allegation of a $lm fund is false. It was to be expected. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Labour have this magnificent obsession about multi-national corporations. The Minister for Immigration ( Mr Grassby) and Labor's Minister for electoral survival-the Minister joined in the conspiracy. It is a time honoured political stratagem for a government, when in trouble, to blame foreign interests for all its troubles. History is full of these idiotic appeals to nationalism. It is one of the basest political motives to whip up a xenophobia when the government itself is to blame for the economic situation, the confusion, the industrial chaos, the foreign affairs shambles, the defence backtracking and the administrative inability. It is as old as history itself to do that. The multitude of precedents does not make it any more valid; indeed, the multitude of precedents shows that a government which whips up this sort of thing fails and is thrown out of office. Under our democratic system, fortunately, it will be done peacefully. But there is no merit in the Government propagating these false claims in order to hide its own inadequacies. This invention and the new inventions which have yet to be trotted out todayI can guarantee that new inventions will be trotted out today-ar e all part of the same dirty tricks campaign. The dirty tricks will become bigger and bigger lies as the Labor Party's performance in government worsens, for it will have greater need to protect its flanks. Multi-national corporations do operate in this country and in every other country. Was it the multi-national corporations that put the Wilson Government out of office in Britain? absurdity and stupidity of the claim. Not only do honourable members opposite allege it in relation to us but also they allege it in relation to the Conservative Party and say that it was the multi-national corporations that put the decrepit Wilson Government out of office. Does this Government deny that multi-national corporations will continue to operate in Australia? If it denies that they will continue to operate, let it say so now. (Extension of time granted.) Multi-national corporations do operate in this country and will continue to operate in this country. If the Government denies that, let it say so now. If it does not deny it, as it will not, let it stop slandering the multi-national corporations in Australia. cheque. ernment, the multi-nationals and other foreign investors will not be continuously slandered.

Last year the Prime Minister was claiming that he was receiving great support from business. This year he cannot get even a bob. This year the only donations will be donations by the trade unions, and we know, that the trade unions put conditions on the Labor Party when they give donations to it. The allegation made by the Minister for Immigration was disgraceful. There is not a skerrick of truth in it. It does the Government no credit to continue to make these false allegations. All it does is make clear that the Government knows how much trouble it is in. Will the Government come into this House and make a statement about what it will do to tackle inflation? Not a bit of it. Ask questions of any of the Ministers and they avoid answering what they will do about inflation. Get a Dorothy Dix question about this dirty trick campaign and they are lyrical about it. They know the untruth of it. Any man on the Government side who insists on perpetuating this untruth, this falsehood, this base lie, deserves to be known as a liar. We would change the method of approach to foreign investment in this country. We recognise that foreign investment will help Australia to grow. We realise that it will bring greater standards of living to the Australian people. We will not slander it; we will welcome it. But what we will do is state the grounds and conditions upon which it can operate in Australia. That will be done in the interests of the Australian people. We will not conduct it on the basis of slander, we will not conduct it on the basis of refusing to state the rules. The tragedy is that it is not that the Ministers refuse to state the rules, they just do not know the rules. They do not' have the intellectual capacity to write them down. This Government is a complete nothing. It is a group of mediocrity which has failed the Australian people. No government in such a short time has polarised the community with so much confusion, uncertainty and doubt. No government in over 40 years has failed so miserably. The Australian people are fed up with this Government. The Australian people are afraid of where this Government is going to take them. The Australian people want the Government out. The ing.

23,Mr Whitlam,"The suspense was shatterconclaves and cabals. And on Wednesday nothing happened. Why? It did not happen because the Senate was on the air. But then there was Thursday. We were on the air last Thursday in the morning, the afternoon and at night. But the Queen was here, so it would have been unseemly to declare no confidence in Her Government. At any rate we come back yesterday but still nothing happened. In the meantime I read that there would be raised the general subject of foreign affairs and defence. I was right in the line of sight. 1 was going to be one of the principal victims. The Young Liberals were told that the whole field was to be added. Mr Clyde Cameron-Young Turks? They are not in any fight at the moment. They are not in the Middle East show. I appreciate the honourable gentleman's assistance. Nevertheless, since the subject of foreign affairs has been raised let me mention the patriotic contribution the right honourable gentleman is making to the affairs of this country. On Thursday night next I am to go to Japan and China as Prime Minister and as Foreign Minister. I will be accompanied by the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr. J. F. Cairns), the Treasurer ( Mr Crean), the Minister for Minerals and Energy( Mr Connor), and the Minister for Primary Industry (Senator Wriedt). I will then be asked whether all the things that the right honourable gentleman has said today, what various people who get a guernsey will say later today or what they have said over recent months is the view of the Australian Government, the view of the Australian people or would be the view of any alternative Australian government. I am going there leading the most prestigious and powerful team of Ministers ever to have left this country. We are leading to Japan the second ministerial team concerned with Japan-Australia relations. The first came from Japan to Canberra last year and it went away more confused about Australian policies than when it arrived. It could not get any indication from our predecessors what the attitude was to be about Japanese trade with Australia, Japanese investment in Australia or Japanese relations in general. There were things going back Mr GortonI rise to order. sey so I will let him take a point of order. Mr GortonI realise that the Prime Minister has great need to convince those on his side of the House, but would he occasionally speak to us? Leader of the Opposition also turned his back on the Speaker. The same thing is happening now as happened when he addressed the chamber. of the Opposition does the right honourable gentleman wish me to address? AmI to address the Country Party enclave or the Liberal Party in general, because last night we saw what a happy government they would form once again? There was a division last night in the House which showed that on a matter which has been discussed for years in the Australian community-in the business community and the producing community in particular-the Liberals and the Country Party still cannot agree. Can we now expect that when it comes to protection, assistance or favours-that is, indigenous favours, indigenous assistance, indigenous contributions-the Liberals and the Country Party still cannot agree? What a happy economic theme it would be if our predecessors were to be restored to office. It is even possible that my immediate predecessors as Prime Minister cannot agree. I hesitate to say that in some features of the Fairfax PressI see what one says about the other in the form of a frank interview and what the other says about the first in the form of an article the proceeds of which he contributes to charity, so we are told. I will not be diverted in addressing myself solely to the former Government. you know it. ation? Take a point of order. Let my 2 predecessors at least agree on taking a point of order. SinceI am going to Japan let me refer to the last remarks that the Leader of the Opposition made after a recent visit to Japan in a long interview published in the prestigious 'Australian Financial Review* on 13 July last. The article states: 'Japan is taking advantage of the timidity forced on it as a result of the history of the 1941-45 war,' Mr Snedden said yesterday. 'It is making a virtue out of telling those countries affected by that war that its Constitution won't let it spend more on defence.'

29,Mr Whitlam,"I s it a personal explantab for the region's peace and security', he said. 'They are making a virtue out of abstinence. The Japanese are economic animals. They are not anxious to engage in military expenditure'. Those were the words of the Leader of the Opposition, not mine. I may well be asked in Japan before this week is out if that represents the view of the Australian Government. 1 shall of course say emphatically and unequivocally that it does not. I shall be asked if it represents the views of any signincant part of the Australian electorate. I shall say, and I believe I shall be correct in saying, that it does return all those things will return including not. I shall be asked if it represents the views of. any future Australian government-the sort of government which might come into power if this motion were carried and, at the subsequent election, the government changed. I shall give an Australian answer and only hope that I am correct in speaking for the Liberal Party when I say as I shall say that no Australian government, even one led by a weak and susceptible man, would ever encourage Japan into courses of revived militarism. I shall then go to Peking. There, too, 1 shall have to waste valuable time apologising for the Leader of the Opposition, giving assurances that he does not represent the other half of the Australian people or the Liberal Party or, at least, its best and not indecent part. Perhaps the Australian Ambassador will not on this occasion exactly be sitting on the edge of his chair as the Leader of the Opposition described him when he had the happy task of accompanying him in his interviews in Peking earlier this year. The Chinese, 1 trust, will simply say to me about the Leader of the Opposition: 'Forget that unfortunate man, but we would rather not see him again'. This is the gentleman who talks about damaged relations with other countries. Let me deal briefly with these great matters. Had there been no change of government, our nation would have been the last to have been dragged -forced-ou t of Vietnam. These things are easily forgotten. It is easy for young Liberals to forget what is was like less than a year ago. A year ago we were still in Vietnam and had it not been for the change of government, this nation know it. there were still military supplies going to Vietnam. Would you send them back if ycu were in government again? Would you send military supplies or advisers to South East Asian countries? Make your attitude plain. Come clean with the Australian people. Had it not been for the change of government, this nation would still have been committed to that awful blunder of our civilisation of intervening in Vietnam. A year ago, men were being conscripted for Vietnam. The Leader of the Opposition includes in his motion something about the defence forces. Every young Australian should realise that if the Party the Leader of the Opposition leads should ever conscription. Nobody denies that it would return. order. The statement has been made that 'nobody denies'. I will deny it. What the honourable gentleman has said is a farrago of untruths. If it must be denied it will be denied. of order involved. If the right honourable gentleman has been misrepresented there will be ample opportunity later for him to explain his position. Liberals are worried about, what is the meaning of their complaints about defence? The Liberals always preached the prescription for conscription; let that be known to every Australian young man. After all, there was a Minister for fhe Army, .the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes), who in September 1964 denounced conscription as inappropriate in our situation. The following month the Government introduced it. The Liberal Party, the Opposition, rests upon the complete pretension that people forget. I rest, my Party rests, my Government rests upon a great faith in the memory and intelligence of the Australian people. People dp remember. People do know what the Liberals were like in government. The Australian people do not want the Liberals back-cer tainly not in their unredeemed, unforgotten, unforgiven, leaderless state, and certainly not with, what they have to offer as the leaders of this nation. Are we to return to the old days-it was not very long ago, a mere year ago-whe n this nation with its leadership was a standing joke? Is this nation to substitute that old joke for a new one, a weaker one? I do not believe the public would have a bar of it. I do not believe that the Liberal spokesman on foreign affairs, the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Peacock), will get a guernsey",25,Whitlam Government

He said he had no quibble with the recognition of North Vietnam. He said he welcomed the recognition of East Germany. able member for Kooyong, who is the Liberal spokesman on foreign affairs. He also said that the stress that I place in foreign relations today is on the whole change from the bi-polar approach of communist against anti-communist to the multi-polar approach of today. This, he said, is why it is so necessary to break down the habits of outmoded thinking. He went on to say. 'We would adopt exactly the same attitude on South Africa and Rhodesia'. He also said he would like to see the South East Asia Treaty Organisation revised and added: It is going to be revised'. All the signincant things that we have done but for which some elements in the Liberal Party have criticised us are in fact endorsed by the Liberal spokesman on foreign affairs.

I notice that included in the national Government is concerned and the grounds of complaint against this Government in the motion there is this allegation: its disregard for the proper role of the States. I am happy with the timing of this motion; of the great inland cities of Australia but also could there be a more dramatic, practical, because it is situated on Australia's greatest timely illustration of the co-operation which river system.

This was Would this have happened under any of my the first initiative taken in this regard by predecessors?

Does this show a lack of conis the man who has moved it and his motives, sultation or co-operation? Everybody talks It is the motion of a man who, a year ago, was about decentralisation or regional development but it took the change of government in this Parliament for something to be done about it. Yesterday while all the refinements were being made to the text of the no confidence motion, while the last script was being prepared, while the scenario was being perfected, my Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Uren) and his 6 State counterparts agreed in Melbourne on a communique which concludes in these terms: The Ministers also noted that comprehensive urban planning and development takes place over a substantial term and requires tbe certainty of continuing funds and effort. The Ministers welcomed Mr Uren's assurance that the Australian Government recognises this and is prepared to commit substantial nnancial assistance to fund continuing long-term programs. The State Ministers accepted that there will be Australian Government co-operation in urban planning and research and there was agreement that continuing consultation between the Australian Government and the States, particularly at officer level, would be most welcome, would contribute to a sharing, exchange and understanding of views and problems and would be of long-term mutual benefit. The timing of this -no confidence motion on that issue falls completely to the ground because there is a more positive, practical cooperation between the Australian Government local government as well. Not only is Albury-Wodonga significant because it is the next-the first for 60 yearsThe most interesting thing about this motion",26,Whitlam Government

36,Mr Whitlam,"Mr Peacock, the honourTreasurer of Australia. One year ago unemployment stood at 130,000. One year ago the seeds of the current inflation had been sown. Inflation referred not to the Prices Justification Tribunal, was actually running at the highest level Australia had known for 2 decades. One year ago the Australian economy was just recovering from the slowest rate of growth it had known since the wara disastrous 2 per cent or 3 per cent.„ One year ago business levels in the general community were sagging. One year ago, the Australian dollar was grossly undervalued. The then Treasurer-the present Leader of the Opposition-kne w it. He knew its dangers. But he allowed himself to be bludgeoned by Country Party pressure into allowing the danger to remain.

The honourable member had forgotten, of course, that he was not in the talks about the amount that BHP wanted in February last year and the then Prime MinisterI think lost part of the letter but he was very coy about tabling it. Let me cite to honourable gentlemen the increases which BHP has made in its average steel prices. In January 1970 the likely that the increase in the price of steel which flows through the whole community, A week ago the honourable gentleman proincrease the numbers. thought that even such a redoubtable numbers man as my immediate predecessor would have known that if you have fewer public servants that can only be achieved by sacking them or by recruiting none. By inference the Leader of the Opposition would create new unemployment amongst this year's school leavers by closing to them the avenues of employment that this Government opens to them in the Public Service. Every public servant, every parent and every school leaver now should realise the implications of the remedy of the Leader of the Opposition-it is unemployment. What are his motives? He wants to avert some of the pressure from his rivals to hide the lack of policies. What are the new Liberal policies? The Liberal Party has set up a think tank. It is so empty that there has not been a single leak from it. He wants to prevent debate on real issues. He wants to throw a bone to his foreign and business masters. Mr Speaker, I do not have the time to That is trueI did advocate a prices notificadevote to the influence that multi-national tion tribunal.

The Prime Minister sought to use some home to them; they would survive; they alliteration to say that I had gone from would go to the parliament; they would go to notification tribunal to justification tribunal. I the people. Where, alas, are those men now? have always opposed a justification tribunal. Mr Clyde Cameron-You mean Spiro Agnew? to identify people in other countries. But the real issues are what this Government has done on education, cities, health, consumer protection, social welfare and foreign investment, and it is this last subject which is the nub of the matter. It was only when this Government's policies on foreign ownership began to bite that we began to hear these cries of protest ate to call the Prices Justification Tribunal a against the Government's policies and performances. In 1972 the issue was whether Australia's resources were to fall into foreign hands. At any election from now on the issue is whether the Australian Government is itself to fall under foreign control. Nothing would guarantee that more certainly than a government led by the present Leader of the Opposition-and I refer not only to this pathetic performer who would nominally lead the Opposition but also to all these exhausted volcanoes, these old geysers opposite, the old guard, but not a single engine driver amongst them. Minister's time has expired. Opposition)I wish to make a personal explanation. honourable gentleman claim to have been misrepresented? been misrepresented constantly and deliberately. HoweverI will speak on only one of the misrepresentations because what I have to say will illustrate the nature of the whole speech made by the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam). The Prime Minister said that when I was Minister for Labour and National ServiceI advocated a prices notification tribunal. He said that I had referred to a prices exemption tribunal. I did refer to the Prices Justification Tribunal as being a prices exemption tribunal and I did it for this reason: Since7 August the Government has gazetted 340 separate notices exempting companies from section 18 of the Prices Justification Act. The companies mvolved are well in excess of that number. The goods excluded cover an extremely wide range. It is appropriprices exemption tribunal.

44,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Leade r of theand because of a number of other matters. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition has this morning devastated the Government with an annihilating list of issues on which it has completely fallen down in its duty to the Australian people. I listened to the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) replying, not as we might think a Prime Minister would reply, but replying with all the overtones of a demagogue. It is quite obvious that the pressure of work is getting too much for him. Never have I seen the Prime Minister make so many hysterical outbursts as he did this morning. I can fully understand his concern and his desperation when he sees divisions between his Party and between the trade unions; when he sees the ineptitude of his own Ministers in handling their portfolios; when he sees every single by-election either on a State level or a Federal level moving against the Labor Party; and when he reads the public opinion polls which show the Labor Party going down lower and lower. It is no wonder that he stands up and makes a speech such as the one he made this morning. All the Prime Minister really did was to make smart aleck remarks, as a Queen's Counsel does when he has not a substantial case to present before the court. Only in the latter moments of the Prime Minister's speech did we hear him refer to the big issues facing this nation, but they were treated in a most frivolous manner. One such issue is inflation which is reaching a serious state for the nation. of all kinds that there is an almost complete We heard little about our relationships with other countries, although the Prime Minister did make an imputationI thought it was a disgraceful imputation-agains t the American people in relation to the problems that confront them at the present time. Here was another instance of a Prime Minister being prepared to make smart remarks and forgetting the very serious consequences which those remarks, have in our relations with a very great nation with which we want to retain very close relations. No amount of shuffling of the old dog-eared pack of ministerial cards will hide the fact that the Government is falling apart. It is crumbling, and this is the reason why we heard such a high pressure speech by the Prime Minister this morning. This Government has earned the contempt and the distrust of the Australian people for its inept management Country Party met to consider what its of the nation's affairs and the general state of response should be to the tremendous feeling uncertainty, worry and fear that it has created. being expressed by country people across this The bright promise of the morning of 3 December of last year has faded. The rot which began to set in before the end of that month and which has accelerated throughout this year is now producing such a state of decay that this Parliament must express its concern. For the past 10 months we have seen the morning newspapers creating morning sickness, and now we seem to have given birth to a monstrous Government which is leading this nation to rack and ruin. We are all realistic enough to know that this motion will be defeated. We know that the Labor back benchers, despite their alarm at the disastrous activities of some of their Ministers, despite their horror at the scandals that have rocked this Parliament, despite their anger with some, of the Prime Minister's decisions which they have been forced to overturn, and despite their disgust with the Government's hopelessness in dealing with the savage inflation that is wracking this nation, will vote against this motion. Despite all those things, we know that not one member of the Labor Party will have sufficient moral courage to join in this censure motion against the Government which is doing a terrible job in the interests of this nation. Not one Laboi member will show the conviction to stand up and admit that the Caucus system has dumped in this nation's lap a collection of Ministers who have seriously damaged Australia's standing in the eyes of many nations, who have so antagonised, insulted and sabotaged industry breakdown in communications between industry and the Government, and who have alienated the goodwill which the Australian people were prepared to extend to a new and untried Government. The Ministry is presiding over the nation at a time when there is staggering inflation and the nation is suffering the crippling effects of strikes. What did the then Opposition say last year? It said that there would be fewer strikes under a Labor Government. What a joke that has turned out to be. It said: 'We will not be reducing expenditure on defence'. What a lie that has turned out to be. Last year Labor said: 'We will be bringing maturity to our foreign relations'. What a tragic reality has emerged. The week before last the Australian nation that something should be done about this disastrous Government. Country people feel that they are under constant and growing attack from this Government. They have been kicked and bashed with a savagery and a viciousness never before directed against any section of the Australian community. What they fear most and what the Government does not understand is that when the time comes, as it surely will, when conditions in the rural sector get tough again, the real impact of the Labor Government's anti-rural bias will begin to bite. These people have turned to their political voice-the Country Party-wit h a plea to do something, to do anything, to get rid of this Government before it does any more damage. From our contacts with other sectors of Labor Government and place Australia under the community-wit h the people trying to buy the control of nasty foreign multi-national land and build homes under the devastating corporations. How silly can they get? If this policies of this Government; with manuis the best they can do, it is no wonder this facturing industry which provides the Government is in such a mess. What a pair the economic backbone of the economy but which Government has chosen to lead this campaign is being bashed unmercifully by this anti-the Parliament's clown princes! Fancy the business Government; with the mining industry two least credible people, with records as iong whioh has seen the beginning of the process as your arm for wild, unsubstantiated, wrong of seizure and confiscation which every and stupid statements, leading a campaign like socialist government employs; with people in this. all walks of life who are being hurt every day by uncontrolled inflation fed by Labor's own reckless spending-ou r impression of thc reasons why this Government should be feelings of all these people is that 'it's time', thrown out of office. We could talk about the time to call a halt, time to opt for responsiutter contempt which the Prime Minister shows bility instead of ratbaggery, time to seek sanity towards the Parliament. We could talk about instead of socialist paranoia, time to get Austhe disgraceful situation in which we have a tralia back on the rails. This overwhelming Prime Minister who, through no fault of his wave of public bitterness and fear prompted own, cannot have his word accepted and my Party to tell the Australian people quite trusted-becaus e his statements and his clearly and unequivocally where we stand. We decisions are so often challenged and rejected believe that the Government deserves a and disowned by the Caucus which controls resounding censure and that the people should him. We could talk about the infamous ASIO be given an opportunity to express themselves affair. We could note the strained relations at an election. The anger against the Governwhich this Prime Minister has provoked with ment in country areas, and the abject failure our very good friends and allies, the United to speak for their constituents of those Labor States of America, Great Britain, Singapore and members who claim to do so, means that the Thailand. We could talk about his meddling Country Party would be very strongly supwith the exchange rate and with the interest ported. But it goes much deeper than that. We have on the whole economic life of the believe it will be bad for Australia if this country. We could talk at great length about Government is allowed to remain in office any the obsession of the Prime Minister to move longer. We believe that this is the view of vast towards central government and to bring to numbers of Australians, including many of an end federalism, or at least to make the those who last December thought they would State governments nothing more than pawns give Labor a chance. Labor has had its chance, in the hands of a socialist Prime Minister. We and now the people have 'had' Labor. As I could even quote actions and statements 16755/73-K-490 ] mentioned, every by-election, State and Federal, has demonstrated how concerned the people are with the present Government. If there is one thing that has become very clear in the last week or so, it is that the Government is scared stiff of an election. It is terrified out of its wits at the prospect of having to answer to the people for its actions after having so often and so shabbily failed to answer questions in this Parliament. The evidence of the Government's panic is the campaign of fear and hysteria being drummed up by the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Grassby) and the Minister for Services and Property( Mr Daly). They are naive enough to believe, apparently, that they can convince the Australian people of the existence of a gigantic and sinister plot to overthrow the Mr Speaker, we could talk all day about the rates. He treats these as trivial, of course not understanding the enormous impact that they displaying the ultimate objective of our wasteful. Industrial stoppages are at a record socialist Prime Minister to make Australia a level. Increasing costs are aggravating republic, to overturn our established British shortages of materials and goods. All of these parliamentary system although it must be things will be contributing to a worsening admitted that the Government is doing a inflation situation in the immediate future. pretty fair job of prostituting open and free debate in this Parliament by gagging and atdtude of the public, who have lost configuillotining procedures. But let me concentrate for a moment on the problem seriously. How can a government what I consider to be our most serious have any honesty of purpose when on the one immediate economic problema problem hand it is taking measures to control inflation, reaching disastrous proportions-inflation , and on the other hand is pumping up governincreasing costs and prices undermining the ment expenditure, bosting the size of the Public social welfare of ordinary Australians, families, Service and using it as a pace-setter for wage young and old; inflation with its crippling costs increases and better conditions, such as a 35bearing down on industry and services; hour week? How right the public is to show inflation undermining the morals of the people desperation when this Government moves into and leading to inevitable restlessness and the New South Wales power generation dispute industrial troubles. This country is suffering and supports the unions to help force a 35the worse inflation for over 20 years and the hour week by using blackmail tactics. situation is deteriorating. The Government quite obviously is incompetent and impotent in is now operating with full force. People are the face of this serious economic evil. From the last December quarter, the annual means to avoid paying future higher prices and inflation rate accelerated from 4.8 per cent to they are investing in speculative areas such as 8.2 per cent in the March quarter, to 13.2 per land and buildings, trying to hedge against cent in the June quarter and now to 14.4 per cost increases. Long term sound investment cent in the September quarter. We must reach a frightening figure well in excess of thisperhaps 18 per cent or 20 per cent in the December quarter. At the present rate we can take pride of place as the developed nation people when the boom bursts. For this, the with the highest rate of inflation. That is Government must stand condemned. But the something for this Government to be proud greatest long term consequence of Australia's of, is it? If anyone objects to the inflation rate number one evil-inflation-is the way it is being stated in these terms, let us take the reducing the competitiveness of our export figures for the percentage increase each quarter industries and of our domestic industries against on the same quarter in the previous year.

Next year we could see industry in a scissor-like situation with costs going up impossible situation for primary and mining Certainly governments can offset some of productivity. Yet everything this Government does seems to be directed towards reducing the incentive to produce and to lift productivity. Primary industry has been viciously attacked by this Government. At a time when the cry should be production, this Government is doing all it can to remove the incentives to production and productivity. At a time when there is an outcry against allegedly dear food, this Government is taking away incentives to grow more food, and thus help to keep prices down. The mining industry is being savaged by a marauding Minister tor Minerals and Energy, whose distorted view of what constitutes national interest is bringing severe damage to the industry. At a time when our critical shortage of energy resources is causing real concern, the Minister is acting in such a way as to frighten people away from investing in the search for new resources. We need to be doing all we can to find new deposits of gas and oil, yet the Minister is seizing the deposits we already have. Who is going to risk money in looking for further deposits and resources under this Government? able member's time has expired. (12.34)I wish to devote most of my time to talking about the first prong in this devastating attack that has been launched from the Opposition. The first prong is that the Government no longer possesses the confidence of the House because of its failure to exercise proper Mr SneddenI apologise for interrupting. I think you said 'this devastating attack on the Opposition'. I think you meant 'this devastating attack on the Government*. said 'the devastating attack from the Opposition'. I was quite clear in what I said, but lhe right honourable gentleman does not always see the joke. I begin by saying that we did not inherit a good economy despite what the former Government, the present Opposition, might say. I want to give one or two illustrations of that and then I want to go on to talk for the most part about the question of inflation, because I think it needs to be talked about. Yesterday I was given some figures which deal with the latestfiguresavailable for what is described as civilian employment in Australia, that is, total employment of males and females in all sorts of employment, public and private, manufacturing and service, and so on. These figures showed that between August 1972 and August 1973 the number of persons in civilian employment increased by 183,000. I asked my officers, as a matter of interest, to give me the increase in civilian employment from August 1971 to August 1972, and I got the answer that the increase for that period was 46,400 as against 183,000, an increase of 46,400 in an economy that ought to have been finding close to 200,000 new jobs. In the month of August-thi s August-alon e the increase was 19,500-in one month as against 46,400 in 12 months, the record of the previous Government. We on this side of the House at least believe that it is better to have full employment than unemployment. Another figure worthy of consideration is that for gross domestic product expressed in what are called constant prices. If one took the first half of the financial year ended June 1973, which was the period of the previous Government, and took the index for gross non-farm product, which was running at 2.9 per cent increase for that 6 months, one sees that at June 1973 it was running at 4.4 per cent. I am not going to multiply each of those by two to draw the sort of conclusions that are drawn in this House by taking the figures for the quarter or the month that best suit one's argument. I want now to talk about inflation, and 1 acknowledge, as should everybody in Australia, that inflation is a serious problem. Inflation is not a new problem. For those who want to continue to look at the consumer price index, the main difference in the rate of inflation in the last 2 quarters as against the 2 previous quarters-if you want that comparison-is made up by increases in food prices. AndI would say that the last people in Australia who should talk about staggering inflation aTe the members of the Country Party because they represent those who are the recipients of the increased income that comes from higher food prices. WhatI am objecting to is the cant and the humbug of those who want to look to the consumer price index and say to us: 'What are you going to do about it?' If the members of the Liberal and Counntry parties who reckon everybody else is so short on solutions will come up with a solution between themselves as to how they can stop the CPI from rising",29,Whitlam Government

49,Mr Creani Am Not Objecting To It.,"Mr Malcolm Fraser-You have said that you caunot stop it. you do certain things and take certain actions. I thought, until a few weeks ago, that the Leader of the Opposition had found a new word; he seemed to say it very quickly'prices-'n-incomes'. Now when it is suggested that separate powers should be given over prices in one area and incomes in another, he does not want to have anything to do with it. I have said before, and I will say again that I can understand there being laws for prices. I can understand, in some context, that there can be laws for incomes, but I am blowed if I know what laws about prices and incomes are. They are 2 sides of the social syndrome and the Opposition wants to look at only one of those sides. We on this side of the House say that the major part of incomes in Australia-that is, wages-is subject to some sort of regulation and justification, I wish that sometimes he would do his but no such arbitration, justification, notification, call it what you will, applies to prices. If ever there is to be what can be called a prices and incomes policy in Australia we will not get it until we show that we want to do something about prices. That is what we have sought to do. The Leader of the Opposition is a great one for asking: 'What are you going to do about inflation?'. Yet he pours cold water on every single thing that has been done. Revaluation did have some impact. As I said in answer to a question recently, coincident with revaluation was a rise in world prices. That, to some extent, camouflaged the effects of revaluation, but the circumstance would have been even more serious on prices had revaluations not taken place. margins on. tions I want to deal with as well. Much has been said about imported inflation. This is a term that can mean different things to different people. Inflation partly is imported. One of the reasons for high food prices, for instance, in Australia at present is the rising demand outside Australia. One does not sell inside Australia at a price different from the prices outside unless there is some method of subsidy or something of that kind. As I said the other day, America, in the face of there no longer being any banana republics left in the world, has to pay higher prices for its raw materials, including energy, and this in turn impacts upon the prices of goods and services that are purchased from America, from Japan and from other parts of the world. This situation is not unique to Australia, yet it is suggested that it has happened only because of what the Opposition describes as the mismanagement of the last two or three months. The Leader of the Opposition this morning carefully selected, as he always does, some figures from the Reserve Bank about the value of money. He said that according to the figures for the last 9 months for which figures were available the volume of money had increased by 13 per cent. He should have gone back a little further in search for figures because in the period July 1972 to December 1972 the volume of money rose by 17 per cent. That was in a 6-month period. At least there has been some abatement to the 13 per cent for the 9 months he mentioned. arithmetic completely. You can terrify people, I suppose, by harping too much on inflation in relation to the consumer price index. Perhaps as a truism it ought to be said that inflation never bankrupts a whole country. What inflation does is to work unevenly on certain sections of the community. Two of the areas at the moment in which the balance is shifting is between those who eat food and those who sell food. It can be argued that those who sell food have not been receiving the price they should have received in previous years. But if they receive the price they should receive, the last thing that honourable members opposite should complain about is that the consumer price index figure has gone up and that as a consequence other people are seeking increases in their income to maintain the sort of standards they previously had. If we could have obtained some serious contribution to this debate from the Opposition then perhaps the censure motion could have proved worthwhile. But as usual, it is a shabby attack based on selective statistics and represents an ignoring of the problem. Nobody needed to be a prophet to know roughly what would be the increase in the consumer price index figure that was released a few days ago. For the most part, it was based on prices as at 15 August 1973. The next consumer price indexfigureto be released will be based mainly on prices as they operate on 15 November 1973, which is not very far off. As I said",33,Whitlam Government

54,Mr Crean,"They are not reflected in the There are more people in employment in Austhe Australian year. The budget is a parliamentary performance. It simply sanctions what money can be spent and authorises from where to get it. It can correct distortions, but it can move only slowly. Three-quarters of what takes place in the economy takes place outside the framework of the Budget. What we have to have in Australia, because of the magnitude of the capital investment involved, are priorities and the only regulator in the finish hapless failure of the Prime Minister and the of what the priorities should be is government in the name of the people as a whole and not the predatory instincts of those who wield economic power. That is why the next 10 years are not going to be the same as the last 10 years. They would not have been the same if honourable members opposite had been in office. They would have had to grapple with these problems. The reason why honourable members opposite are no longer in office is largely that they did not grapple not know. The speech made by the Treasurer with them when they were emerging. I say to any honourable member opposite who talks, after the 10 months in office of the present Government, about the sorts of things he would have done in office that they are the sorts of things he could have done without any resistance whatever. Honourable members opposite did not even have the ally in another place that they have now. In my view a mockery will be made of democracy in Australia if it is not acknowledged that the place in which governments are made and unmade is the House of Representatives. Government is not a series of gallup polls taken every 3 weeks about some particular action; government is responsibility and responsibility requires time to work itself out. time has expired. ponsible approach of the Prime Minister( Mr Government, in a short period of 10 months, Whitlam) to this censure motion is a clear reflection of his total inability to command effective national leadership in this country. He spoke in this House not as a great Prime Minister concerned with the basic problems facing Australia but rather as a man devoured by his own vanity and arrogancea man whose vaudeville performance in this House is one of contempt for the Parliament and contempt for the people at large. His was the approach of a cheap demagogue, not of a national leader. This man sought to clown his way through the debate by using personal insult and cheap political diatribe. Whatever factors foreshadow the demise of this Government in the short period aheadand there are many of them-the Prime Minister's vanity, conceit and absolute preoccupation with his own sense of self-importance will undoubtedly be to the forefront. He clowns in this Parliament while, outside, significant groups of the Australian community are being hurt very badly indeed. They are hurt by the Government to provide solutions to the major problems facing Australia. He struts on the national stage like a popinjay, prepared to evade, to ignore and to avoid the real issues of concern. The only major difference between the speech made by the Prime Minister and that made by his Treasurer ( Mr Crean) was that it was obvious that the Prime Minister does not really care and that his Treasurer, his chief economic adviser, does must go down as a pathetic apology for the Governments total mismanagement of the nation, lacking one single initiative as to what this Government is prepared to do to solve these problems. If there is one fact which this Government is apparently prepared to ignore, it is that the Government has the responsibility, because it is the government, to provide solutions. It is clear that this Government has lost the confidence of the Australian electorate. That loss of confidence is demonstrable not simply in the form of national opinion polls, of which the Treasurer spoke, but also in the results of State and Federal by-elections in recent months and in the increasingly hostile comments of organised groups in the Australian community. No government which, by its own direct actions, causes such economic dislocation can legitimately expect popular support. This has created a massive erosion of confidence in the Australian economy; has allowed inflation to reach levels unprecedented in the past 20 years; has generated the highest level of interest rates for the past 100 years; has allowed industrial unrest and turmoil in the industrial jurisdiction to reach intolerable proportions; has dishonoured a series of major promises; has deserted disadvantaged groups in the Australian community; has destroyed the future development of the mineral and mining industries; has",35,Whitlam Government

The Australian economy is now threatened by super inflation of a magnitude which has not been equalled throughout 2 decades of government. The level of inflation calculated to the 12 months ended last September equals almost 11 per cent. An assessment based more closely on the indexed movements of the past 6 months, and taking account of the huge accelerative movement in the consumer price index, clearly demonstrates that the notional rate of inflation is now in excess of 14 per cent per annum. This assessment is made with the full knowledge that the effects of the recent Budget have yet to become apparent. In this Parliament or throughout this country there should be no doubting the seriousness of Australia's inflationary difficulties for which this Government stands indicted. However, it is a matter of absolute concern that the Government, at a time when inflation has assumed such tragic proportions, has not only failed to take corrective action but has sought to understate the seriousness of the problem. Even worse, it has deliberately contrived to claim that the major causes of inflation are beyond the control of domestic economic policies.

This is a government which has contrived to lay the blame for economic mismanagement everywhere except where it really lieswith the Government itself. No amount of pretence and evasion by the present Prime Minister can hide this simple fact. The Government .must accept the responsibility. It is clear that the Australian public is not prepared to tolerate anything less. If the Government continues to abrogate its responsibility it will be dealt a salutary lesson by the electorate at large. Yet, incomprehensibly the Prime Minister is not prepared to grapple with the problems before him. What the Australian people want from their Prime Minister is not simply purple prose and rhetoric, not personal abuse and diatribe, not a vaudeville performance in this Parliament, but a serious attempt to come to grips with the problems facing Australia, and this he has been unprepared to do.

59,Mr Lynch,"As I emphasised before the fixed income earners, pensioners and lowerincreased level of economic instability. Already economists have predicted medium term recessionary tendencies. These tendencies, which would make the economy vulnerable to downward external shocks, could arise from a falling demand in investment in capital goods industries since a transfer of resources to meet current consumption cannot practicably be made in such a way as to ensure the continued full employment of resources; a falling demand for consumption goods as in the face of declining real income, people exhaust their savings, and a transfer of all their foregone consumption cannot in practice be made to higher income groups; Community uncertainty which could further curtail real investment expenditure already depressed through Government policies. Whether Australia continues with the present rate of super inflation, coupled with excess aggregate demand, or whether current circumstances foreshadow a medium term recessionary period, urgent action can no longer be avoided. The response of the Treasurer ( Mr Crean) has been nothing less than pathetic. He said: 'We have to acknowledge that there is unlikely to be any substantial fall in prices. What we have got to do is to abate the rate at which inflation increases-and that certainly does not look likely to happen very quickly'. This ds a truism which is hardly an adequate strikes by his totally misleading statements that response from a Federal Treasurer.

The middle income earner, provided a direct impetus to the build-up of already seriously affected by rising interest inflationary psychology. rates, is to be further disadvantaged by increases in personal income tax. This foreshadowed policy is a logical result of a Government which obdurately refuses to accept that its own expenditure has placed an intolerable strain on domestic resources. The Government has shown clearly its incapacity to manage the Australian economy. It has failed to exercise proper demand control measures; its own spending has placed an intolerable strain on domestic resources; it has deliberately sought to repress the private sector and to expand non-productive segments of the public sector; it has caused a massive loss of confidence in the economy; and it has refused to take effective corrective economic measures in the face of runaway inflation. The Government's industrial relations policies have been totally counter-productive to the national interest. The promised era of industrial peace under Labor has turned out to be a myth. Instead of providing industrial peace, this Government has generated industrial confrontation. Wages lost through industrial disputes were a record $23.7m during thefirst6 months of this yeara full 80 per cent higher than for the same period in the previous year. Quite simply, the Government has failed to provide effective national leadership to curb industrial unrest. The Prime Minister has sought to blame the existing industrial legislation for the increase in The Government itself has been the prime cost pressures throughout the community. The Australia's natural resource industries, of course, have suffered a series of severe shocks at the hands of the Minister for Minerals and Energy( Mr Connor). His failure to articulate detailed policies and his ideological commitment to the principle of government exploration, production Australian oil and minerals industry have caused a massive loss of confidence. The honourable member for Casey might well dwell on the impact which that loss of confidence has had on the total Australian community. The Government apparently has planned to spend at least $5,000m of taxpayers' funds without any detailedfinancialanalysis. Export contracts and exploration and mining leases have been subject to the capricious veto of the Minister without proper public explanation. The forward investment plans of many exploration and mining companies have been either substantially curtailed or shelved. A significant downturn in investment will have serious long term implications for the real growth of the Australian economy. The great irony of this Minister's frenetic activity and personally hostile attitude to this industry has been the severe damage and losses caused to Australian owned companies and their Australian shareholders. It is quite clear that this Minister no longer has the confidence of the industry, the House or the Australian people and in the interests of this country's future development clearly he should resign. I turn now to the manner in which the Government has clearly abused Australia's federal system of government. State governments have been denied .an adequate level of funds with which effectively to carry out programs in their constitutional areas of responsibility. The Government has sought to interfere in an unprecedented way with the conduct of State administrations. This is a centralist government which plainly does not believe in a federal system and by its policies is intent on paving the way for a unitary system of government. This is not the responsible path of constitutional alteration but the irresponsible and dictatorial method of duress. In the field of defence the Government has deliberately dishonoured its pre-election commitment to maintain Australia's defence expenditure above 3.5 per cent of the gross national product. In fact, defence expenditure has been reduced to 2.9 per cent of the gross national product. The Labor Party's expenditure commitment was so consistently emphasised in the pre-election period that defence was not a major issue at that election. electorate was satisfied that a Labor government would adequately maintain our armed forces. Indeed, that now discredited election pamphlet 'It's Time' stated this: An Australian Labor Government would allocate not less than 3.5 per cent of Australia's national product for defence in each annual Budget. Of course, that promise has been totally dishonoured and the Opposition has on other occasions detailed the dramatic cutbacks in Service equipment, training and manpower. The severity of these cutbacks has caused a massive drop in the morale of the Services. The number of resignations and the low enlistment figures demonstrate the seriousness of the morale problem throughout the 3 Services. The Government has tried to buy loyalty and high morale by increasing Service pensions. This clearly has failed and it is quite clear from the number of leaks and direct information coming from senior officers in all of the 3 Services that morale is at a very seriously low ebb. I sayfinally, Mr Speaker, because this is a point that will not be lost on you, that this Government has treated the national Parliament with a degree of contempt not seen in recent parliamentary history in this country. This House has not been able to operate according to its prescribed constitutional and democratic functions as a forum of legislative review. The Australian Labor Party in fact has demonstrated the underlying authoritarianism of its ideology in the conduct of the Parliament. The Government has introduced 77 Bills into this House during the session and 66 of those have been passed. A total of 200 Bills has been foreshadowed for the session, as if this Government believes that the concept of volume of legislation in the House is one that will persuade people outside the House that this is a government that is legislating in a responsible fashion. But the Australian people will not be fooled by the anti-democratic procedures which have been adopted. I instance the number of guillotines which have been moved consistently in every major and significant debate in this House. It is pertinent to remind the House that prior to this Government, the last guillotine moved was as long ago as 4 May 1971. Not one guillotine was moved during the whole of",37,Whitlam Government

This is a government which the nation can no longer afford. member's time has expired. be one of the most remarkable debates that this Parliament has heard. The great criticism by the Opposition of the Government falls into a single category. It is a demand that the Government should reduce expenditure and spend more money. That is a most remarkable situation. The Opposition spokesmen so far have demanded that more should be spent on defence, that more money should be given to the States and that there should be a restoration of funds and benefits for the rural sector of the economy. In the very same breath, in a completely unashamed manner, they try to shrug off the illogical aspect of their argument and demand that Government expenditure be reduced. These are truly remarkable people. They are the descendents of those who gained government by promising to put value back into the pound and set Australia off on the highest rate of inflation which it has ever experienced. No previous government in Australia's history has been so prepared to attempt seriously to rebuild the new society that our citizens desire and need to improve the quality of life. The want of confidence motion is insincere and cynical, and it is sponsored by people who are desperate and politically opportunistic. Honourable members opposite are truly strangers in a strange land. They have been overwhelmed by the speed of progress and the pace of change, and they are unable to cope with everything that is occurring. I should say at this stage that honourable gentlemen opposite should realise that noise is no substitute for logic, and to carry on with idle chatter like emphasis on conciliation for the prevention of one would expect from a cage full of halftrained cockatoos will not impress the Australian electorate and will not get honourable members opposite back on this side of the House. They have to do much better than that. The carping criticism, the destructive criticism of the Government's actions without one single positive suggestion as to how current economic problems may be overcome is useless and will gain no support from the Australian people. But the masters of the Opposition are upset and concerned about the change in national emphasis. They had plans to continue the erosion and the ultimate elimination of Australian ownership and control of Australian industry. The plan was to reduce the Australian people to the position of being unprotected tenants in their own country. A great deal has been said about strikes and about the outbreak of industrial disputes, so called. I am the last to suggest that the present situation is satisfactory. I am one who believes that the ultimate objective of this Parliament and of any government which sits in it should be to eliminate the cause and need for industrial disputes. I for one am quite disgusted to hear the nonsense which is preached from the other side of the House, with the possible exception of the rare speech which emanates from one or two individuals and which is constructive in its suggestion. I include the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser) who made a speech during the second reading debate on the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill which I , for one, believed might herald a new era in this House and a new standard of debate on industrial relations. We have seen today a degeneration of those lofty principles down to the level of cheap political opportunism. What are the facts of the. present situation? The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) referred to 860,000 working days lost. The Government's Bill, which proposes to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and which is designed to give effect to the mandate of the Australian Constitution to prevent as well as settle industrial disputes, is still awaiting the approval of the other chamber. When the Bill passed through this House some months ago it was opposed and the Liberal-Country Party coalition succeeded in convincing the Senate to reject the Bill in its totality. It is no use honourable gentlemen opposite now disclaiming any responsibility. The measures contained in that Bill are designed to put the disputes. It is no use honourable members opposite trying to ridicule what the Minister for Labour( Mr Clyde Cameron) has said in respect of this matter. They know what he has said is the truth and that the responsibility is theirs. They are the guilty men. Let us look at the working days lost in Australia. In the year ended June 1971, 1,328,600 working days were lost through industrial disputes. In the year ended June 1972, 1,422,300 working days were lost-in",39,Whitlam Government
64,Mr Speaker,Order! The honourable,40,Whitlam Government
65,Mr Riordan (Phillip) (2.29),"This mustother words, an increase of less than 100,000 days in the whole year. Let me remind honourable gentlemen opposite that all production lost is a loss to the Australian community, particularly in this period when there is a shortage of goods and services. As a result of accidents in New South Wales alone, in the year ended June 1972, 1.9 million working days were lost. That is the figure for one State alone; figures on a nation-wide basis are not available to me. The number of days lost through industrial disputes pales into minor insignificance when compared with the number of days lost through the disastrous economic policies of the previous Government. For example, at June 1972, the seasonally adjusted figure for unemployment was 105,000. Many more people than that were actually out of work, but that was the seasonally adjusted figure. That figure means that 4.25 million working hours were being lost every week at that time. The Leader of the Opposition, who was then the Treasurer-the architect behind and the man responsible for that disaster-ha s tbe gall and the nerve to try to convince the Australian people that this Government is responsible for a loss in production of some 860,000 working days. He caused approximately as much loss of working days every week through his own direct and deliberate action. That is serious. The fact that in that period some 4.25 million working hours were lost every week is a direct cause of the shortages of goods and services that we are experiencing today. Let us face this fact: The position today is that we are short of goods and services because of the increased consumer demand which is existing, as well as certain other factors. What about this question of industrial relations? Has a really constructive and practical proposition been put forward by the Opposition? Certainly not. Do we in this Parliament understand that there is a real problem of communication in the work place? Let me take one simple example of this. In the course of the recent Ford dispute, the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commisicn made a judgment. At the end of that decision, for the first time since Federation and for thc first time since the end of the Second World War when our great immigration program commenced, the President directed and found it necessary to order formally that his decision be printed in several languages, because he thought it proper that everybody affected by that decision should be able to read it and understand it. How do we truly expect to improve communication and industrial relations if in some industries the majority of employees cannot even read the conditions under which they work? The previous Government did nothing at all in that regard, but members of the former Government Parties, now in Opposition, criticise the Australian Government-the best Australian Government since the Second World War-in this respect. They seek to blame the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) and this Government for the power strike in New South Wales. The Leader of the Opposition, driven in his desperate anxiety to head off the challenge to his leadership, even attempted to blame the Prime Minister for the garbage strike in Sydney over last weekend. We could do with a garbage strike in this House from time to time to try to cut out some of the garbage which comes across the centre table. The power dispute was a classic example of a government deliberately attempting to provoke an industrial dispute to subject the people of New South Wales to misery and suffering in order to gain some form of political advantage. During that strike the Prime Minister of Australia same forward with the only positive, concrete, sensible suggestion that was made in the whole dispute. And what did the Premier of New South Wales say? When he read the message and received the suggestion from the Prime Minister, fearful that this would settle the dispute, he told the Prime Minister: 'Go away and mind your own business. I do not want anybody settling the disputes that I am creating.' That was the sort of attitude he adopted. Now his little puppet here, the Leader of the Opposition, stands up and attempts to place some criticism on the Australian Government. This no confidence motion is conceived in hypocrisy. It is born in political opportunism. It deserves to be rejected by this House. I share the confidence of the Leader of the House( Mr Daly) that it will be rejected overwhelmingly by this Parliament. Let us look at the consumer price index. It shows an increase of 10.6 per cent. That is too high. The Government knows it is too high. The Government is determined to reduce as far as possible the rate of increase in prices. In fact the Government has taken action to reduce prices. But let us look at the facts. Do not let us just run away with statistics. There are some important facts to be looked at, and members of the Australian Country Party should be the first to look at them because when they stand in this Parliament and demand that action be taken to reduce the rate of increase they are demanding that their pets in this community should have their incomes reduced. Half the cost of living increase is attributable to food, and the great bulk of that is related to the rapid and substantial increase in the cost of meat and potatoes. Their hypocrisy is exposed every time we look at what they say. On the one hand they demand that there should be a free market situation. No matter how the market is controlled by private investors, they say there must be no government intervention. 'Do not touch the meat prices. Do not have a meat tax,' they say. The Government listened to them. 'Do not restrict the export of meat from Australia which is causing the great increases at the present time. Leave all that alone so that we can then come along and attack you for doing nothing.' That is their attitude. It is well for them to see and it is well for their electorate to understand what they are arguing for here today. When they say that the consumer price index rate of increase must be reduced they are advocating action to reduce the price of meat in this country and the price received by the producers. The only answer the Liberal and Country parties of this country have had for a quarter of a century is that when they achieved excess demand they say: 'Let us reduce the demand.' This Government takes exactly the opposite view. It says: 'Let us increase the supply.' And that is what we are going to do. If it means we have to put up with the carping, nonsensical criticism of the Opposition in the process we will do it. If the Opposition succeeds in misleading some of the Australian people and we suffer the consequences of that, we will accept that too. But we are not going to be diverted just because of their criticism from what is right and from the positive steps to reconstruct this country so that all of its citizens have equality of opportunity, so that all of its citizens have a better life style. The Opposition's system is to create a massive restrictions placed by this Government on forpool of unemployment. Honourable members opposite regarded it as a disaster if the number of unemployed fell below 100,000. If it fell below 100,000 they were running around trying to find how to get it back up to 100,000 again. What did the previous Government do in terms of its manpower policy? It said: 'What is that?' The previous Government did not have a manpower policy. Its only manpower policy was to create unemployment. Today home buyers are bearing the brunt of the situation which developed in the building trade. The result is chaos because the previous Government allowed a situation to develop in which there were no training facilities available for young men and young women who wished to enter the skilled trades in the building industry. Only a year ago we saw a situation where there was massive unemployment in this country. The former Government did nothing to retrain those unemployed workers-no t a thing. It did nothing to attempt to regulate the price of land. Unemployment was rife a year ago, and the then Prime Minister was almost on his political knees begging the Australian community: 'Please spend some money -anything , one cent, $1, $10. Please spend your money'. The Opposition today says that this Government does not have the confidence of the Australian people. The people have too much confidence. People are spending all their savings. They have absolute confidence in the future. The old idea of keeping your money because you do not know whether you will be out of a job next week is gone and people are now prepared to spend. That means that we have a great demanda demand which cannot be satisfied because of a number of factors, one of which is directly attributable to the lack of manpower policy of the Opposition. The present Minister for Labour, contrasted with the previous Minister for Labour, is the first man since the Second World War to undertake a manpower survey in this country. He has positive suggestions to make which I understand will be forthcoming in the near future. Confucius said: 'Study the past if you would divine the future'. In other words, have a look at the track form before you have a bet. That is what the Australian people will do. When they look at the track form of the Opposition and look at how it has gone in previous races they will see what the Opposition's attitude is. It opposed price regulation. It is opposed to legislation to regulate restrictive trade practices. It has opposed revaluation of the currency. It has opposed the eign capital investment. It has opposed tariff reductions. It has opposed the Australian Industry Development Corporation legislation, a substantial part of which is designed to encourage citizens to save their money and to invest it in Australian industry. Of course, the Opposition does not want the ordinary people in Australia to invest their money. It does not want the ordinary citizen to have a stake in the future of this country. It wants to keep it for its rich and powerful friends-the overseas monopolies, the international cartels and the multi-national corporations. It has opposed land price stabilisation. It says: 'Gut expenditure'. I suppose it means that we should reduce the money for education; that it is wrong for us to want to make a massive investment in the future so that there will be in Australia better trained people, people with better understanding, able to develop a better quality of life. Reduce pensions is the other possibility. We could put them back to where the former Government had them in the poverty class, trapped in the poverty trap. That is where they would be-caugh t in the poverty trap forever perhaps. It is interesting to note that although the consumer price index increased by 10.6 per cent, pension increases granted so far and projected and promised will mean an increase of 14 per cent in the pensions payable to the elderly citizens of Australia. We will not deny those who built this economy. We will not leave them in a state of misery as the former Government did in its cynical and callous way. The consumer price index is an indicator; it is not conclusive. It has been well established that as prices rise so consumer habits change. I am very sorry to sayI know it has no effect on some honourable members opposite-that because of increasing meat prices the consumption of beef in Australia is falling. It means that some are going without red meat. What a ludicrous situation we are in because of the attitude of the Opposition when it was in government for far too long. This motion is a desperate attempt to drag this Government down. It is all part of the plan. It started when this Government started to question the role of the multi-national corporations. The Australian people will not be fooled. They know who the agents of the international monopolies are in this place, and they will not be fooled by the smokescreen that is drawn out. Neither will we. As Cicero said, the good of the people is the chief law. That is what we will abide by. We will not abide by the greed and avarice represented by members opposite. We will not bow the knee to the god of the multi-national corporation and the international cartel. member's time has expired. Opposition today has taken the strongest action that an Opposition can take in a parliamentary democracy. It has moved that the Government no longer possesses the confidence of the House and the Opposition has spelt out the ways in which it believes it has mismanaged the nation. The Government has sought, of course, not to answer those charges but to try to draw a red herring across the trail by referring to what the Opposition is alleged to have done in the past and what is alleged it will do in the future. However it is the Government that is under attack for its sins of omission and commission. It is the Government which has lost the confidence and support of the public for its actions. Disaster follows disaster for the Government in successive byelections and successive gallup polls. No one believed on 2 December that the incoming Labor Government would fall apart at the seams so quickly. No one believed, not even I , that it would have been quite as inept and as bad as it has turned out to be. For this reason the Opposition has listed the major points on which the Government has failed. Any person who is not a dyed-in-the-wool Labor supporter would have to agree with these points. Let me refresh the minds of honourable members by restating them. The Opposition has moved that the Government no longer possesses the confidence of the House because of its mismanagement of the nation and, in particular, its failure to exercise proper economic management. No one would disagree with this. What a failure the Government has been. Inflation is more than 3 times higher than it was when the Government came into office a matter of only 9 or 10 months ago. Interest rates are at an all time high and yet the Government is meant to be a party of low interest. The Opposition, in its motion, mentions the Government's disastrous handling of the mining industry. I shall return to this matter later. It mentions also the Government's neglect of national security and defence. It has been recalled that the Labor Party has broken its promise to continue to spend 3.5 per cent of the gross national product on defence. We have had falling recruiting; there are fewer people in the Services; resignations have been received, particularly from senior officers who can ill be lost; projects have been cancelled, the DDL has been cancelled, the Cockburn Sound project has been cancelled, the Neptune rewhich the Minister for Defence( Mr Barnard)",40,Whitlam Government

Even such petty little things as the sacking of local bands has occurred. There is to be no cadet corps. Troops have been withdrawn from Singapore and morale in the Services is at an all time low. In its motion the Opposition also refers to the Government's failure to exercise influence in the management of industrial stability. We have heard already from my colleague, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lynch), who spoke earlier and who said that industrial unrest in this country has risen by 80 per cent in one year. The Government disregards the proper role of the States. The Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) this morning was trying very hard to justify the fact that he occasionally sees the Premiers but we know that the Government has ridden roughshod over many of the States on many occasions. The Government does not believe in State governments. It believes in a federal system with all power in the Federal Government. We have seen this attitude in the field of national development. The Government has overridden the States in education. It is bypassing the States by making loans to local government. It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister said how great conditions were between him and the State governments, especially when we hear of the Redcliffs affair, to which I shall refer later, but in respect of which the Labor Party leader of the Government in South Australia said that the Federal Minister for Minerals and Energy( Mr Connor) was inaccurate and misleading. The Opposition also criticises the Government for its management of the national Parliament-no t only its management but also the fact that it is misleading the national Parliament. I hope that before I sit down I will be able to show some of the areas in which the Government has deliberately misled the national Parliament. Let me start by quoting an answer by the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) to a question asked of him by my colleague the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bonnett) before the Minister went overseas. Incidentally, I believe that we are lucky to have the Minister with us for a few days as he is going overseas again. are, why did the Minister answer one of the The Minister said: When this Government came to power some of the development of the Burdekin River for the first things I called for were the progressive reports on the Federal evaluation of the Burdekin proposals. last 23 years?-by saying 'precisely nothing'? I got nothing. Any person would think that this meant that the Federal Government had done nothing in this area. Surely the Minister must have been aware that between 1966 and 1971 hydraulic model studies of the Burdekin River at Burdekin Falls were carried out by the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority and later the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation to determine a river rating curve for high flows. I know that he is also aware, because he lives in the area, that between August 1967 and April 1969 there was an investigation by the SMA of 2 sites on the Broken River, the tributary of thc Burdekin River. Those sites are located at Urannah and at the irrigation diversion site. Investigations for these sites were carried on to the stage of the completion of a preliminary design. The Minister also would know that between August 1969 and January 1972 there was a reconnaissance of 60 miles of the upper Burdekin River by the SMA and later the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation to narrow down available dam sites to 2, at Greenvale and Lake Lucy. He knows alsoI am certain he does, but I do not know why he has ignored it-that between April 1972 and December 1972 a preliminary investigation by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation was carried out of one dam site on the Haughton River, which flows into the sea south of Townsville in the vicinity of the Burdekin delta. The Minister also knows that between February 1973 and August 1973, as a result of a decision by the previous Government and the Queensland Government, a reconnaissance by the SMEC was undertaken of 60 miles of the central Burdekin River to narrow the available dam sites down to 2 or 3, located possibly at Hells Gates, Mount Fullstop and Mount Foxton and that this work is still in progress. The Minister also knows that as a result of a decision by the previous Government and the Queensland Government between February 1973 and October 1973 a preliminary investigation by the SMEC has been carried out of one dam site on the lower Burdekin. The work on this site will be carried to the stage of completion of the preliminary design. If those are the facts, and I am sure they two questions he asked himself-namely : What did the previous Government do about the That was a complete and deliberate attempt to mislead the House. Ministers of the Crown But here we see an incredible situation. I have have a duty to ensure the highest degree of been a member of this House for 24 years.

If there is to be that difference realise that any similarity between statements it will cost an extra $6m. Not a day goes past without some sort of do is get the Bureau of Mineral Resources problem. Look at the Redcliffs project. Here to write his statements for him and read them is a case where the State Government, after making certain that he does not change them. discussion with the Federal Government, was This is a case of intervention on the part of finalising a project in which 30 per cent Austhe Minister ostensibly to help to increase tralian equity was to be allowed.

Mr Dunstan himself said that Australian Parliament, who one cannot claim to be any firms did not have the necessary technology supporter of ours, that foreign control is and that this $300m project will be in jeopardy increasing. I refer to a statement by Mr Edward unless the Minister for Minerals and Energy St John, Chairman of the Association for agrees to it. For it to proceed the Minister has Retention of Australian Ownership. He told to agree to it because it is dependent on exports the Association's conference that the Minister and on capital imports, which he can block. for Minerals and Energy was partly to blame Australian Government voted in favour of that That this House express deep concern at the actions department, and urge the Government to take all possible steps to resolve the present threat to One wonders whether he can ever get a that the Minister makes and the true facts is completely coincidental. In fact what he should for this state of affairs, bis manner had been unduly abrasive, his intentions had not been made clear and that he had created unnecessary confusion and uncertainty. What has brought this about? Foreign control is increasing because of the actions of this his refusal the Minister stated: Government. First of all, the abolition of incentives to encourage investors was a cause. We believe in the small Australian industry and in encouraging people to get a stake in their country. This system has been abolished. There has been a freeze on the import of capital. So an Australian company cannot borrow money overseas and bring it in without having to freeze 25 per cent of it. The oil search subsidy has been abolished. Off-shore this was availale to Australians only and to the extent that there was Australian equity Australians got % share and the multi-nationals which we are alleged to support did not. The small Australian industry feels the effect of such actions first. How can such companies possiblyfloatnew shares? There is not enough time to go into all the depths of this Government's actions in the minerals and energy field. But I come to the uranium leases. In order to justify his refusal to renew leases or to grant tides to Australian companies-Queenslan d Mines and EZ-Peko -the Minister used 3 excuses. Firstly, he said that the areas were Aboriginal reserves and therefore he could not grant leases although he would like to. Secondly, he said that the price for the uranium was not high enough now and that we should wait until it gets higher, which surely will happen later according to him. Thirdly, we will only export enriched uranium which is more valuable. I state firstly that EZ-Peko's find at Ranger is not on a reserve so the Government could do anything it likes in renewing those leases. The Government likes to stress the fact that it is speedy in making decisions. Yet it has known for 10 months that these leases were expiring and has done absolutely nothing about them. There are very few Aborigines on these reserves. One of fhe deposits at Narbarlek is the richest known deposit in the world for quality and grade of its ore. Is the Government suggesting that these deposits on which millions of dollars of investors money has been spent should not be developed for the benefit of the nation? What is the reason for this delay. The Minister said that the price is not high enough. We lost the chance to participate in contracts, as everyone knows, worth some $600m which are just closing with the Japanese. We undoubtedly would have got a share in those contracts had it not been for the direction of the Minister to the company concerned to withdraw its offer. Now this opportunity has gone for ever. To justify Uranium contracts which were entered into prior to the recent elections had unsatisfactory prices, the best of which was US$7.25. This is completely untrue and the Minister knows it. He ought to be man enough Mr Clyde Cameron-I s that price per lb? for U308. The Minister knows because he has received the same telex from EZ-Peko as I have received, that the lowest of their contracts are equivalent to US$8.10 per lb and the highest is US$10.83. When I first became a Minister under Sir Robert Menzies, if a Minister made an incorrect statement he immediately came into the House and corrected it when he became aware of the mistake. But do honourable members think for a moment that we will see this Minister correcting this mistake? If he is man enough to say that he is wrong he should get up and say that he is wrong and we will give him leave to correct his mistake. But of course he will not. He will sit on his fat bottom and brazen it out. impertinent. Pettingell. with a veneer of sophistication and good manners. of the honourable member for Farrer is quite uncalled for.

What was the minerals policy of the former Government of which he is an outstanding example? It was one of neglect, benign neglect if you like, or benevolent neglect-on e of 'Come here and get it'. Eightynine per cent of the capital infrastructure that was needed to develop Australia was supplied by Australian people from their savings. The other 11 per cent came from overseas. But it was instantly directed-the y came homing in like homing pigeons-righ t to where the profits were, namely into minerals, into primary industry, into secondary industry and into commerce, with the complaisance, the neglect and the co-operation of the members of the former Government parties. They should be ashamed of themselves. In the place of that situation we have substituted benign supervision. For the first time in Australia's mineral history there is a government which is prepared to take the Australian viewpoint, If there is one thing that is outstanding in the record of this Government and its ideology, it is that we stand for Australia, we wave the Australianflagand we give allegiance to the Queen of Australia. We are proud of being Australians and we still stand in the light of the multi-nationals. They will never get their hands on any more of our resources. The Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) has said so. He said it at the Australian Mining. Industry Council dinner last February. All my efforts and the efforts of the Government have been directed to ensuring that the present devastating ownership will gradually be reduced. Reduce it we will. Our policies have been directed towards achieving that purpose. We have discharged truly national functions. We speak as Australians. We do not speak as synthetic imports with an allegiance overseas. We are Australiansfirstand foremost. It is a concept that the Liberals would never understand. Our major customer is Japan. For the first will do exactly the same and that it will be time we are dealing with the Japanese in a on the basis of willing sellers, willing buyers proper, business like way.

The tactics of divide currency in which contracts are written. I have had major companies come to me cringing because they were too stupid and the previous Government also was too stupid not to have their contracts written in Australian currency. This applies to some of the major companies. I certainly will not commit a breach of faith by disclosing their names, but they do exist. What have been the results of our activities? In the minds of members of the Opposition, we have committed an unpardonable crime. We have, been a commercial success. In the case of iron ore there has been a price increase just short of 17 per cent as an offset to world currency revaluation. This represents a little matter of $90m extra income for Australia in a year. companies got it. that from Tanabe, and the honourable member well knows it. In regard to coal, one company alone in Queensland, which has a long term contract, as a result of our activities will benefit to the tune of extra income amounting to $107m. We told it to try harder and to do better, and we made sure that it did. It is now receiving increased prices. In respect of the coal export trade as a whole, we are receiving at least another $100m a year in income because of our ability to inform the different colliery companies of the going price for coal overseas. No longer can overseas buyers come into Australia and play one company off against another. I am ashamed of some of the Australian companies for their stupidity. They could have obtained better prices by sticking together. For a change, we have imitated the imitators. The Japanese have worked through the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. In turn MITI has carefully controlled or co-ordinated the buying by Japan. I give MITI great credit for what it has done. I have told the Japanese that we",47,Whitlam Government

86,Mr Connori Got That All Right. I Got,"and conquer have gone out the door. We have thrown them out quite deliberately. As for the other alleged disasters, we have taken action to ensure that for the first time there will be a complete survey of Australia's resources of energy because for the future it is energy that counts in this world. We have energy in most respects. In the case of crude oil we are lacking, but there again we will do what the Opposition was not capable of doing or conceiving when in government. We will ensure that every form of liquid hydro-carbon is reconstituted into motor spirit or to other petroleum derivatives. We have provided for it in the Pipeline Authority Act and as for it being a pipe dream and as for what the honourable member for Farrer had the impertinence to say to the House just recently, let me remind him that on television the other night I produced the document signed by Sir William Pettingell, Mr Butters and myself in which it was recognised that we would be the constructing authority for the pipeline, that the pipes were ours and that we were going ahead with the job. The tenders close on 29 October. We will decide who the successful tenderer is to be and we will proceed to build the pipeline. We have had quite enough of Sir William Pettingell and his nonsense. We tried it the quiet way but from now on we will play it tough and hard, but, nevertheless, it will be fair because the Australian Gaslight Co. has its rights. We told them that we would stand in their shoes with respect to the transmission of natural gas from Gidgealpa. As for the peculiar alliance between the honourable member for Farrer and the South Australian Premier, let me repeat what I said in answer to a question from the honourable member for Barker fjDr Forbes) yesterday. The policy of our Party is that there should be at least a 51 per cent Australian ownership and, more than that, we will ensure that every gallon of motor spirit that can be extracted from the Gidgealpa natural gas will be extracted and used for Australia. when he was negotiating? will stay told. No longer will any State premier usurp the functions of a national government. No longer will any State government be hieing itself off overseas and negotiating contracts in respect of national assets. That will be done through the Australian national Government. It is being done and it will continue to be done. I refer now to uranium. I do not have much time left. I had hoped to make a full statement on uranium. However, what the honourable member for Farrer has said has been an absolute tissue of misrepresentation and I will refer to my prepared speech concerning uranium in refutation of the nonsense of the honourable member for Farrer. In a recent report in the 'Australian Financial Review' it was stated that I was considering a plan for uranium contracts to be fulfilled from the Mary Kathleen uranium mine, which has been closed for some years Mr FairbairnI did not say anything about that at all. for Farrer has had his say. This plant is deteriorating and, unless the mine is quickly reopened, it will be useless. The whole implication in the article, however, is that I conceived the proposal. The facts are that on 14 June 1973 and at their request, I saw Messrs Carnegie and Madigan, of Conzinc Riotinto Australia, who have substantial uranium interests. At this meeting, they put forward the possibility of rationalising the supply to meet existing uranium contracts. Mary Kathleen has current export contracts for 5,362 short tons. Their company-stated resources of uranium are 10,700 short tons. The former Government, in the period between 8 and 30 November last, approved of export contracts for an additional 4,300 short tons. It had also approved of an export contract on 24 August 1972 for 2,230 short tons. These contracts could all have been substantially met by the complete extraction of the Mary Kathleen reserves. In a subsequent letter addressed to me of 28 June, Mr Carnegie said: I hope that, when you decide on the appropriate national uranium sales policy, we will have an opportunity to suggest some practical rationalisation of the industry, designed to meet the objectives of both the Australian Government and the companies involved. We appreciate, of course, that you would not expect this to result in any overall increase in overseas ownership of Australia's mineral resources . . . On 17 August last, I saw, at their request, Mr Carnegie and Mr Espie, Chairman of Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd. In the light of the June discussion, I inquired whether there would be any scope for Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd to help out other firms with approved contracts. Mr Carnegie then referred to some discussions earlier in the year with",48,Whitlam Government

91,Mr Malcolm Fraser (Wannon) (3.31),"one of benign supervision. I think we need to look only at some of the words he used in not answering the Opposition's case made by the honourable member for Farrar( Mr The honourable member for Phillip( Mr Fairbairn) to see how benign his own administration might be. He made it quite plain that he has great pride in forcing Australian companies to cringe before him. They are not my words; they are his own words. The Minister apparently has pride in the fact that Australian companies, in his terms, have behaved with great stupidity, and he likes to relate that all around the world. Whether that fulfils his own political philosophy of benign supervision I do not know, but he shows it in a strange way. He has been offensive to Japan and in his recent speech he talked of imitating the imitators. He knows quite well that he was referring to Japan when he said that. He has said that he will honour contracts, but I will indicate in a few minutes 10 election promises which have been broken by the present Government. Is not an election promise a contract with the people of Australia? If a contract with the people of Australia is to be broken, a contract between this Government and a particular company will have even less worth. Even this morning the Minister indicated that he would table legal opinions concerning the validity of the Pipeline Authority Act. When does he intend to table those documents? The Minister has said that he will act regardless of legal opinion. I would like to know what precedent there is for not awaiting a High Court decision in these particular matters. He made it quite plain that he was trying to find ways and means of getting Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd to fulfil the uranium contracts of other companies. He said he would fulfil and honour the agreements with other companies, but at the same time he has made it plain that he is looking for ways in which Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd might be able to fulfil those contracts which would in fact be a denial of the agreement and a denial of the letter written by the Deputy Prime Minister( Mr Barnard) before Christmas last year. The Minister, full of contradiction, said that he places great reliance on the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. It is only a week or two ago that he said that so far as the Snowy Mountains Council is concerned he did not care a damn and that he would do what he wanted, irrespective of the decisions or recommendations of the Snowy Mountains Council. Of course, in relation to the Snowy Mountains Council matters the Minister had his marching orders from the power unions of New South Wales. Riordan) a little earlier in the debate said that he thought that there ought to be industrial debate without temper. I think in most of his speech he might have tried to follow that particular tenet, but not in all of it by any means. He indicated that the strikes and lost time would not have occurred throughout this year if the industrial legislation of the Minister for Labour( Mr Clyde Cameron) had been passed through this Parliament. What would that have done to the power disputes in New South Wales, to the mail dispute and to the radio technicians dispute which hamstrung Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, with domestic and international transport, for so long? In those circumstances the Government could have acted quickly. It has the powers under the Public Service Act. The Minister's legislation does not touch the Public Service Act but the Government waited for days and for weeks before finally acting. Rather, it was not the Government that acted; it was the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions who with one hat supports the Prime Minister but with the other opposes him vigorously and strongly. In this particular instance the honourable member for Phillip suggested that the New South Wales Premier should have accepted the Prime Minister's offer of a Conciliation and Arbitration Commission judge to help in the dispute. The honourable member for Phillip would know quite well that New South Wales could not accept that offer. The bench of the New South Wales Industrial Commission would probably have resigned if the offer had been accepted because it would have been a vote and a mark of complete no confidence in the New South Wales industrial jurisdiction. That view is held by significant parts of the trade union movement in New South Wales. honourable member love one to be named. He would be chasing them and dumping them in Sydney Harbour as fast as he could go. The Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) did not answer one point made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden). He needed to reassure his own supporters. He spoke only to his own supporters. He has been overruled in Caucus too often in the last two or three",50,Whitlam Government
92,Mr Riordan,Nam e one.,51,Whitlam Government
93,Mr Malcolm Fraser,"Would not themonths and the polls are beginning to show it. Only 39 per cent of the people of Queensland support this Government and the Australian Labor Party. The President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions was in the Parliament this morning, I think when the Prime Minister was speaking. I do not know in what sense he was sitting in the gallery. I do not know whether it was as President of the Australian Labor Party or as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. But we all know which hat this man believes to be the most important-that of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It is not surprising because he also would know and so would the Minister for Labour that the doctors and academics, the strength of the present Labor Party, do not understand and have no comprehension of the problems of the average Australian. If they had any comprehension of these problems they would do something effective to control inflation and something effective to protect the position of the average family person in Australia. So far they have done nothing at all. It will be interesting to find out what happens when the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions recognises publicly that a referendum on prices will include the power to control wages. Will that mean he will then oppose the referendum on prices as well as the referendum on incomes which he is presently committed to oppose? Recent legal decisions in South Australia make it quite inevitable that power to control prices will include power to control wages. The Prime Minister admitted that fact in his talk to the per cent rather than an 8 per cent increase as nation when introducing the referendum subjects. This Government is condemned for its lack of economic management. It revalued twice, before and after Christmas, without consultation with appropriate Ministers year, as a result of the Government's policies. and departments. In the winter the Government cut tariffs. It used the Budget merely as an instrument of social and political change strikes and because of the changes in wage and advocated economic responsibility. It decided to spend an extra $2,000m and despite promises to the contrary it increased personal income tax by nearly $1,100m in 1 year. The failure of the Budget as an instrument to control an even balance of the economy was recognised 3 weeks after the event with a further revaluation decision and another quite disgraceful decision which is making interest rates higher than they have been in 100 years of Australia's history. This has come from a low interest rate party. The farmers were to receive $500m at 3 per cent from the terrier from the Riverina. Not one cent was made available under about 10 per cent interest. That is the Government's attitude to low interest rates and to a pre-election promise of that kind. The present interest rate is the highest for 100 years. In the December quarter last year inflation was running at not much more than 1.1 per cent; at the second quarter of this year it was running at 3.3 per cent and at the third quarter at 3.6 per cent. In each of those quarters inflation, as a result of this Government's policies, was running at a greater rate than the average for the total period of Liberal-Country Party Government over 23 years. That, in itself, is a condemnation of the Government's policies. In total the revaluations resulted in a 25 per cent change in the value of the Australian dollar in relation to the United States dollar and sterling. The Government has shown that it is prepared to use tariff changes and revaluation as an instrument of short term economic policy. This leads to uncertainty, difficulty in planning and difficulty in providing continuity of employment in business. You will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this morning the Prime Minister indicated that Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, under the control methods of this Government, had had a 3 per cent increase and 5.5 per cent increase in its prices. He tried to compare those increases unfavourably with the 8 per cent increase that occurred in January 1972 when we were in power. But I rather think that 3 per cent and 5.5 per cent make an increase this year of 8.5 was the case when we were in power. If inflation continues at its present rate, the next Autumn increase no doubt will be 8.8 per cent, with a 16 per cent increase perhaps next But, despite that and because of steel profits being low, because of the time lost through rates, it is unlikely that there will be new investment in this industry or in many other industries. Because of the policies of the present Government business decisions are being cancelled and new investment is not taking place. Once the expansion of the Public Service ceases to hide that fact, increases in unemployment will be greater than we have seen in Australia for many years. The Commonwealth Public Service has been used as a pacesetter through the provision of 4 weeks annual leave, wage increases and the promise in relation to the 35-hour week. But, of course, we all remember the occasion when the Minister for Labour( Mr Clyde Cameron), who is now sitting at the table, told a slightly red faced Prime Minister that he could not have it both ways. That was a surprise to this Prime Minister because he is so used to trying to have it both ways. But the statement by the Minister for Labour was an honest one and I respect him for it. I hope that it might be the first sign of some sanity in Labor policies generally. I hope that the Minister for Labour will be able to stand up to the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party who is also the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, in introducing this kind of sanity into labour relations. It will be difficult to see who wins. But the contest will be interesting because they are both formidable people.

Two years ago he ment policy to Professor Karmel, on or about had a policy which, I think, some of us on this side of the House might almost have supported-a t least in part. Sanctions and penalties were to be even. A $20 a day fine was to be imposed on unionists. That policy lasted 36 hours. It was taken straight out of PartX of the Act which the Minister has sought to have repealed. My hope was that he would not have it repealed. Well, he will not repeal it because it is one of our amendments which he has decided is sensible and ought to be accepted. In autumn last, there was one-sided legislation involving the removal of penalties from one of the parties to industrial disputes but leaving penalties on the other party. I hold the view that the great majority of people in Australia believe that governments ought to behave even-handedly in these matters and that if penalties are to be available for application I come to the catalogue of broken promises wards the end of last year confirmed those views. The terms of reference for the Karmel the same date. Yesterday, the Prime Minister was quite unable to answer the question whether he had or had not written such a letter. His equivocation and evasion on that issue surely would indicate that there had been communication. That, at least, is what the public will believe until the Prime Minister is prepared to come clean and to table the letters, if there have been such letters. We know of the broken promise in relation to defence in that 2.9 per cent and not the promised 3.5 per cent of the gross national product has been allocated for defence purposes. Decisions made in this area have been decisions to defer, to cancel or to postpone certain defence requirements. By 1980, there will not be 3 escorts that the Navy can keep permanently at sea. Even now, troops cannot be moved by sea from Melbourne to Perth. We were promised no increase in taxation. But personal income tax has been increased by $l,100m. We were promised that inflation would be controlled. But inflation is running at nearly 15 per cent. We were promised low interest rates. But interest rates are the highest bers go back to their electorates there is a for 100 years. Rural industries were promised protection. They have had wonderful protection! They have been raped by this Government and by those people who, before the election, had done most to suggest that a Labor government would be concerned for the well-being of our rural communities. In autumn last, we were promised a double dissolution on legislation relating to industrial matters and also electoral matters. Where now are the confidence and the zeal? Where now are the hopes for the new society which Labor said it wanted to establish? There will not be any double dissolution on either of those issues because the Government knows quite well that the power and seats will come to our parties and to the Leader of the Opposition at the first chance that is available. The Government promised funds for local government. There are no funds for local government. The Government promised consultation and co-operation with our near neighbours. Prime Minister Harry Lee has shown that that promise is as broken and as abandoned as much else that this Government has done. The Prime Minister has shown contempt for the Parliament. Statements have been made outside the Parliament which in other days would always have been made in the Parliament. He has refused to make policy statements in the House and prefers to make such statements to the Press. It is quite unprecedented, on an occasion such as this when a major censure motion has been moved against fhe Government, for the Prime Minister to speak and then to leave the Parliament. The Prime Minister has abandoned the Parliament He has abandoned the Government. He has abandoned his supporters. doing there is more important than the fate of the Government. The censure motion on the Prime Minister and the Government is a matter of major importance. In the short time that I have been able to look at the matter and that the parliamentary library research service and other experts have been able to look at the matter, I can find no record of any other Prime Minister walking out on a censure motion the way this Prime Minister has walked out on this censure motion. There is disillusion and uncertainty in the general community. When Government memgreat deal of disillusion and uncertainty amongst them. Why was there not a double dissolution on the original industrial legislation or on the electoral legislation? There are fears for the future in the minds of many people. In the long term there are fears for the very jobs on which people depend because they know that investment is running down. There is fear in the motor industry because of the invitations to Nissan and Toyota. In Caucus there is distrust of Cabinet. Many decisions have been overturned. In Cabinet there is distrust of the Prime Minister. We all remember the decision that all 27 Ministers had to be in Cabinet at once. This will be a one term government.

I am surprised that he referred Government was in office it deliberately followed policies, which I have already mentioned, which led to the creation of unemployment that reached the staggering total of 130,000 men and women. He did not touch Even the Parliament's power to confer by the Constitution. The Parliament cannot just confer upon the Commission whatever powers Even in the case of interstate disputes the relation to which neither the Australian Government, the Australian Parliament nor the Commission has any constitutional power to settle or intervene. If these disputes occur in been endorsed by the persons affected by it. industries covered by State awards they can be settled by the State government, the State parliament or the State industrial tribunal if they wish to do so wherever the strikes occur. But neither the Australian Parliament, the Australian Government nor the Commission can take any constitutional action to intervene at the same time it prevents full-time union in disputes covered by State awards or agreements. It is complete dishonesty or ignorance on the part of people who try to saddle onto the Australian Government responsibility for disputes occurring in industries covered by State awards. Even in the industries covered by State awards, the State parliaments and State governments concerned, which have unlimited power to intervene if they wish to, never have moved and will not move to intervene. Sixty per cent of all employees in the work force are covered by State awards and cannot be touched by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Only 38 per cent of strikes occur in industries covered by Federal awards. The rest occur in industries that are the responsibility of State governments. Of the Senate without even bothering to debate any 38 per cent of strikes that occur under Federal one of its clauses. The same thing is happenawards, more than half are due to disputes over ing with the Government's second Bill. The union membership, demarcation disputes or matters concerning managerial policy. Disputes over union membership have declined rapidly since the Commission's decision to grant preference to unionists in the clerks' case, which is a feather in the cap of the honourable member for Phillip( Mr Riordan), because employers now know that it is better to accept preference to unionists than to have compulsory unionism forced upon them by job action. The honourable member for Wannon talked about pre-election promises as contracts that should not be broken. Yet his Party is now using its control of the Senate to prevent the Government from honouring its contract to reform the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Government has a clear mandate for the amendments its Bill seeks to section 5 of the Act to inject some common sense into labour relations by preventing victimisation of employees, which is another cause of endless disputes. It has a clear mandate to make the amendments proposed in its Bill that seek to encourage the settlement of industrial disputes by agreements in such a way as to ensure the observance of those agreements by the employees,affected, that is, by ensuring that no agreement can be registered unless it has What could be fairer that that? The Government has a clear mandate to amend the Act to give full-time union ofncials easier right of entry than is now possible. The Opposition should not talk about wildcat strikes and the trouble that is caused by shop committees if ofncials from having ready access to jobs during any part of the day. The Government has a clear mandate to establish an efficient arbitration inspectorate. All of these things are contained in the Bill now before the Senate, and all of them have been opposed or will be opposed by the Opposition parties. The Government cannot achieve its aims for a healthier climate in labour relations while the Senate withholds approval of the vital ingredients to the Government's program for industrial peace. No government could have acted with greater alacrity than has the Whitlam Government. I introduced a Bill containing 74 clauses within 6 sitting weeks of the new Government facing its first Parliament. That Bill was rejected by the Senate is threatening to so emasculate the Bill as to render it useless as a means of bringing greater sanity to the labour scene. The situation will get worse. Industrial relations will get worse unless our Bill is passed. They cannot, of course, get better while the defects and shortcomings of the existing Act persist. The Government has no power to act in labour relations. The Parliament cannot act of its own accord directly in labour relations, and it is unfair to expect the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to do its job if we are to deny it the new powers which the Government's Bill proposes. I turn now to the question of industrial agreements. The Government believes that industrial agreements must be encouraged and must be observed and honoured. 1 have said that time and time again and I will keep on saying it. The principle is enshrined in the policy of the Australian Labor Party. The Government's Bill does this. It makes an important contribution towards the observance of industrial agreementsemployees.",54,Whitlam Government
97,Mr Sinclair,B y employees?,56,Whitlam Government
98,Mr Clyde Cameron,"Yes, by employees and employers-by requiring the Commission to satisfy itself that such agreements are understood and have been endorsed by the employees affected by an agreement. You will never get the rank and file of any union to honour a sweetheart agreement that sells them short. The short term advantage of such an agreement to an employer is always offset and always will be offset by the long term disadvantages that follow when his employees strike in repudiation of an agreement that sold them short. It is far better to ensure that any agreement made is understood and endorsed by those employees affected. The people who negotiate the agreements are not the ones who work under them. What they know about them and understand and accept is not the issue. The important question is whether the people who work under an agreement understand the agreement and whether they are prepared to honour it. My experience as a union official-as secretary of a union and as a court advocate:-ha s always been that you can win if you can say to the rank and file: This is not my agreement I am asking you to honour until the 2 year or 3 year period, whatever the duration of the agreement might be, expires. I am asking you to honour your own agreement, an agreement which I put to you a year ago which you all voted to support. That is what I am asking you to honour'. When you can say that to a group of men you can win. You can win them always. You cannot win them when you say: T know you were not consulted. I know that this agreement was made behind closed doors without your being brought into it at all. I know that it sold you short but I am going to force you to carry it out'. They will tell you to go to hell and you cannot blame them for it either. You have to put agreements to the membership for their approval or you might as well not have an agreement. The days of sweetheart agreements have gone. Why on earth the Opposition should have been so short sighted as to have rejected these most sensible of all amendments is completely beyond me. As I say, what we have to do is satisfy the membership that the agreements made on their behalf, signed on their behalf and registered on their behalf are agreements to which they themselves are parties, and this can be done only by giving in the amendment which the Bill seeks to introduce. matter. I am telling the honourable member that as a union official of long experience my experience has always shown me what happens if you can go to a factory site and talk to a meeting of men and say: 'Comrades, I am not asking you to honour my agreement, something that I made behind closed doors; I am asking you to honour your own agreement'. When you talk like that and when you can truthfully say that to a group of men, that is what gives a union official his power to implement and honour an agreement. But you take the power away from him the moment you allow agreements to be registered that have not been ratified by the rank and file. The Government's Bill recognises this well-known fact of industrial life and seeks to ensure that no agreement can be given the force of an award unless and until it has been ratified by those who are expected to sell their labour at the price fixed and under the conditions agreed upon by that agreement. Another thing that must be understood in labour relations is that a lot of wage demands relate to the fact that in 1953 the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission abolished automatic cost of living adjustments to wage rates. Compensation for rising prices now has to wait until the Commission's annual wage case, with the result that unions find it impossible to hold back the pressure of wage increases, and demands for adjustments take the form of claims for payment of over award wages as well as the annual review that is called the national wage case. Because unions have to make claims that will anticipate 12 months' price increases in advance the net result of this sitaution is that it creates much unrest that could be obviated by a return to wage indexation of some form that will take care of price increases as they occur. What is happening in industry today is that we are trying to hold the lid on a boiler of steam that gets higher and higher in pressure with each increase in prices that occurs until in the end, long before the national wage case comes around, the thing blows up and then demands are made and arc enforced upon employers in the form of over award wages when what the employees ought",56,Whitlam Government

The Australian Government therefore will support the Australian Council of Trade Unions in any move that it makes for the introduction of wage indexation along lines that will, in the Government's view, relieve the existing pressures for wage rises to compensate for price increases. The precise manner by which the wage indexation should be applied is a matter, of course, for the Commission to determine, but the Government will act upon its mandate to intervene in the proceedings of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to support wage indexation. The guaranteed maintenance of real wages isolates and removes a source of grievance which otherwise may lead to damaging industrial confrontations and inflationary wage claims. Indexation facilitates long term agreealone. The protection against inflation that ments which should reduce the incidence of large' scale industrial conflict. Indexation enables periodic collective bargaining to concentrate on longer term issues of wage structure, increases in real wages and wages share of national product. The introduction of quarterly adjustment could enable a trade union to concern itself with increasing real wages and thereby creating a climate suitable to encourage productivity bargaining within industry if the parties to it want that kind of bargaining. As compensation for price increases is bound to be a factor in wage negotiations, it appears better if compensation is made regularly and moderately rather than abruptly. Wage indexation would not mean that no other steps need be taken against inflation; in fact there may still be need for further strong, possibly unpleasant, measures against inflation. Consideration would, of course, need to be given to the form and mechanism of wage adjustment. More specifically, on the question of the manner in which adjustment might take place, one approach would be adjustment corresponding to the whole of the quarterly price rise, as occurred prior to the 1952^53 decision of the Commission. While this seeks to provide for perfect adjustment, it can be markedly influenced by seasonal factors and there may, indeed, be a case for seeking to minimise this seasonal influence. Another approach, which has found favour in some overseas countries, is to adjust wages only by certain minimum amounts. In other words, wage adjustment would apply only when there is a rise, or an accumulated rise, at least, say, a given or an X amount adjustment in the weekly wage. This is not unlike the approach taken in adjusting social service pensions. Personally I do not favour the method I have just mentioned, but it is one which can be thought about. Consideration would need also to be given to the extent of the application of adjustment to wages. It is surely beyond dispute that at least the minimum wage must be protected. The reasons for this, surely, are self-evident. However, given the basic economic argument, namely, that the introduction of wage indexation should be a force against inflation because it would remove one major argument used in wage claims, the concept of indexation could hardly be restricted to the minimum wage indexation offers would need to Order! The Minister's time has expired. barometer of a government's popularity is always a little hard to assess. One reads the public opinion polls and sees that the degree to which the popularity of the present Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) and the Labor Party is declining. One looks at the stock exchange and sees the appalling consequence of the interventionist attitude of this Government on the private sector in the erosion of the value of the savings that are represented by stock on that exchange-the savings of the little man in this community. But the best gauge is some of the comments that are being made by people around the community. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) has perhaps been a trifle modest in the range of disabilities that he has itemised in the motion which I support this afternoon and which refers to the want of confidence that the community has in the Government. The community as a whole is not only disappointed by this Government's handling of the nation in the specifics to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred but also is disappointed in respect of the whole range of ministerial responsibilities.

He has told us only that if only we would accept his amendments all would be well. It is the Minister for Labour as much as anyone who must take responsibility for the increasing number of industrial disputes, for the considerable increase in man days lost and for the consequential shortage of goods which is accelerating the inflationary forces of this country. I have no time to speak about the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr to see whether the guilty men who sit on the Uren) and his intervention in State affairs and how he has claimed that he does not believe that expressways should be proceeded with or how he has arbitrarily identified individual growth centres and denied the States the opportunity to participate in furthering reasonable developments for all centres outside the major capitals. There is no time to go through the interventions of the Minister for Minerals and Energy( Mr Connor). My colleague the honourable member, for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn) this afternoon has told us something of his concern. If each one of these Ministers, as irresponsible as they are, continues to guide this country we unfortunately face an extremely bleak future. I conclude with a parody on the 23rd Psalm which a constituent of mine forwarded to me. It reads: Whitlam is my shepherd, I shall not work, He maketh me to lie down on park benches. He leadeth me beside the still factories, He restoreth my faith In the Liberals and the Country Party. He guideth me in the paths of unemployment.

I quote to him some words from Edmund Burke's 'Observations on "" The Present State of the Nation **' published in 1796. They are: It is a general popular error to Imagine the loudest complainers for the public to be the most anxious for its welfare. Does that not apply to those opposite today?

Adequate time has been given for debate on all important measures, except when delaying obstructionist tactics were engaged in by members of the Opposition Parties, particularly the Australian Country Party. There have been no sittings after midnight. The guillotine and the gag have been applied only in most extreme circumstances due to obstructionist tactics by the Opposition going beyond what could be called reasonable conduct in the Parliament. To summarise, because of the lag in effective legislation due to the previous Government's incompetence, a record number of Bills has been introduced. In addition, there has been no suspension of grievance day or general business during the Budget session. Under the previous Government they were never called on at any stage during the Budget session. There have been longer sitting hours certainly, and more sitting days because of the legislative program. Within this scope the Government has allowed adequate debate and used to a minimum the Standing Orders to stop debate. Despite earlier obstructionist efforts by Opposition members they have not been denied their right as private members to move the suspension of Standing Orders, as we were prevented from doing under the previous Government and which every honourable member sitting opposite voted for. The Parliament has been conducted democratically and in accordance with the highest traditions of this august House.

I think the Deputy Liberal Party Whip moved it 160 of those times. the year. Bills introduced total 197 and there The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr have been 30 hours debate on the adjournLynch) said today that the guillotine was ment, as compared with 26 hours last year. applied only once in 1971 by the previous Private members' Bills and motions, that were Government. But the Liberals did not muck not considered by the previous Government, about when they moved it. They put 17 Bills totalled 11 in 1972 and there were 18 debated through in 19 hours under the one guillotine. and notfinalisedwhen the Parliament was disThese are the democrats. Look at the Bills they solved and the former Government disput through, and particularly the Australian appeared into limbo. What a rotten and Country Party members, these defenders of the contemptible record for people who condemn rural man. The Loan (Farmers Debt Adjustthis Government. ment) Bill 1971 for all stages was allowed 5 minutes5 minutes those fighters for the Prime Minister, the right honourable member cockies gave it. The Seamen's Compensation for Higgins( Mr Gorton) did. On 25 November Bill was also allowed 5 minutes. The Anglo1969 the right honourable member called the Australian Telescope Agreement Bill was also Parliament to meet for one day. Just prior to 16755/73-R-[91 ] allowed 5 minutes. The previous Government telescoped that one right enough. The Air Accidents Bill and the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Bill were allowed one hour. Looking through the list of the Bills guillotined one sees that 17 Bills were put through in 19 hours. That was the real degradation of the Parliament under those who sit opposite. So do not let them talk to me about the guillotine. I should like to have incorporated in Hansard for all to see for all time the damning record of those who sit opposite in respect of the conduct of this Parliament. leave granted? granted. has always got to run away from its crimes. When they are put on the record everybody knows about them. Grievance day has been called on on every occasion except once when the Opposition did not want to debate it and stopped private members from doing so. General business has been considered on every occasion. There have been no sittings after midnight. Let us compare that with what happened under those who sit opposite. In 1967 we sat till 5.7 a.m.; in 1968 we sat on till 2.42 a.m. on one occasion; to 2.39 a.m. in 1969; to 4.42 a.m. in 1970; to 6.22 a.m. in 1971; and to 1.43 a.m. in 1972. As I said before in this Parliament, under the previous Government we went home only when the pimps, the prostitutes and the police were on the streets. That is the The number of sittings so far this year total 58, and we will create a record by the end of Let us have a look now at what the former",62,Cameron Yes By Effect To The Very Sensible Provision Contained

115,Mr Daly,"Of course not. The Oppositionthat, on 26 September the Parliament had gone into recess. After it met on 25 November 1969 for one day it went into recess until 3 March 1970. When the Parliament met again the Govemor-General's Speech lasted 59 seconds and the 21-gun salute took 3 minutes to go off. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Fox) moved the adoption of the Address-in-Reply in 2 minutes. Then the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Corbett), in one of his most brilliant speeches, seconded the motion in 20 seconds. Six gags were moved in the debates that day. On that day we did everything that one could remember in Parliament. The Parliament assembled; the Address-in-Reply debate took place; the members were sworn in; the Speaker was elected; the Deputy Speaker was elected; the Ministry and ministerial changes were announced; the Whips were elected; there were condolence motions; the committee to prepare fhe Address-in-Reply-that Government knew when its speakers spoke for only 2i minutes that they were not too bright-wa s elected; the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply was moved and seconded; and then, like bats out of hell, Government supporters ran out to the Governor General and at 5.45 p.m. gave him the 2±-minute Address. Then we had papers presented, committees appointed and petitions presented, and a censure motion which was moved by the then Leader of the Opposition was disposed of in just about 60 minutes flat. We got home early on that occasion after the adjournment debate finished at 12.57 a.m. For the next 3 or 4 months the democrats who now sit opposite disappeared into the wilderness and did not bother bringing the Parliament together in that time. What humbug it is to hear honourable members opposite growl about the way this Parliament is being run. I would like to mention that a former Prime Minister, the right honourable member for HigginsI tell this to honourable members opposite who misused the Parliament-is reported in Hansard of 25 November 1969, when speaking about the moving of the gag, as having said on that memorable day: If itThat is the then Oppositionis going to seek hour long debates on the motion that the House should adjourn to a time to be fixed and other hour long debates on the motion that leave of absence should be given during those adjournments, then clearly it is not really advancing the cause of parliamentary government in those debates at all. . . . The alternative to what he has suggested is a wrong thing to do would be to have unlimited time for debate on whether the House should adjourn and whether leave should be given during the period that the House has agreed it should adjourn. In other words, the right honourable member for Higgins indicated in that speech that if honourable members frustrate the will of the duly elected government they must expect to have their efforts curtailed by the use of, as it is popularly called in this place, the gag. So today I do not want to hear snide complaints being made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about his inability to control those who sit on the opposite side of .the House. How can we make arrangements for debate with honourable members opposite? The members of the Country Party are talking to the Liberals only by the use of braille. In other words, there is no means of communication known to man which they use-onl y the secret signals that they give. Whatever the Liberals want is not wanted by those who sit in the Country Party corner of the House. Last night we saw in this Parliament the glorious unity of those who seek to achieve office again in this nation. The members of the Liberal Party rambled over to this side of the House, making a total of 86 on this side, while the members of. the Country Party sat in their corner of the House. How can we make arrangements? As soon as we make an. arrangment it is broken by one party or the other because of the disunity that exists. Having said so much, I place on record without any apology the attitude of this Government towards parliamentary democracy and the efforts we have made to ensure that the people opposite get the right to speak, as they should. Let us have a look at the exMinisters on the other side of the House. Let us run through a few of those who on this occasion seek to take office in this country. I have not a very high opinion of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) as a politician. He seeks to lead this country. Senator Gair, one of his colleagues in days gone by, has views in regard to him. Senator Gair is on record as saying: ' Mr Snedden could not make an impression on a soft cushion'. Where do you go with that one? Senator Gair is not on his own in that respect. Right down the line honourable members will see that pattern continuing. I have with me newspaper cuttings to which I will refer later. Look at the new Ministry that will be formed if the Opposition gains office again. The right honourable member for Lowe( Mr economy again as time goes on. Then, the McMahon), a former Prime Minister, when he plucked up enough courage, kicked the right honourable member for Higgins out of his Cabinet. But now the Leader of the Opposition has the right honourable member for Higgins sitting on the front bench. The only good thing about it is that the Leader of the Opposition does not seem to take any advice from him. But the question is: Will the right honourable gentleman be in the Cabinet if the Oppositionhappens to win office again? Where is the Opposition's joint executive? The Country Party has its executive in its corner and the Liberal Party has its own executive. It is impossible for them to agree on everything. No matter whether it is fish and chips or primary industry, when somebody makes a statement 2 views have to be expressed from that side of the Parliament. The Country Party goes one way and the Liberals go another. Let me refer to an article in the 'Age' on Monday, 22 October. It is a report of an interview given to a Melbourne student newspaper by the right honourable member for Higgins. It quotes him as saying: The future must lie with the Chipps. If it Ues with members can go right down the line and see the Greenwoods there won't be any future. Senator Greenwood was one of the Liberal's Opposition have given the present Leader of senior Ministers. In that interview the right the Opposition the imprimatur of support. honourable member for Higgins was not too They have said that they will support him complementary to the right honourable memagain if they have an election, provided he ber for Lowe, another former Prime Minister. does not lose by too many votes. Are they He was asked: dreamt about politics? The right honourable member for Higgins is reported to have said: I don't think I can remember dreaming about honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr politics, and I don't think I've ever had as much Bury), who, in complaining about the Will they not make a hillbilly Ministry? Will like a ruddy sieve'. The people about whom it not be good when they sit down in the I am speaking will be members of the new Cabinet room and talk over old times? They Ministry that is about to be formed! I am might occasionally pick up a copy of the reminded about another comment in regard to 'Age' and read these things. Will that not be the Leader of the Opposition. I quote another lovely? In that interview he was asked: Do you think McMahon will make a comeback? is on record as saying that the Leader of The right honourable member for Higgins not go 2 rounds with a revolving door'. Who replied: Have you ever heard people walking around the Opposition who complained about 'a mangy streets lately saying ' I wish McMahon was back as deal' and 'who was churching the old whore Leader of the Liberal Party'. He's got a nuisance value still, he rings people up all day long. I think now'? Can one blame Senator Gair for makhe's a completely spent force myself. But they both will be in the one Ministry, happily chopping along, wrecking the colm Fraser) and the honourable member for record as saying that they would never serve in the same Ministry as the right honourable member for Higgins. But those 2 honourable gentlemen are both on the front bench again. The right honourable member for Higgins returned the compliment by saying, as reported in the 'Daily Telegraph' of 28 May 1973, that if the honourable member for Wannon ever became leader 'it would be a disaster'. Cannot honourable members imagine the happy gathering in the new Cabinet if the Opposition gains office again? It will be glorious as the members sit around and have their first scotch and soda together. I imagine that, far from being a Ministry, it will be more like Alexander's Ragtime Band. The question to be asked is: 'What kind of a government would it be and who would be in it?' The honourable member for Wannon is on record as saying that the former Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Higgins, is 'unfit to hold office'. Honourable this continuing pattern. But members of the not the kind of supporters a leader would exhilarate a leader. I now come to the former Treasurer, the McMahon Cabinet, said: ""The Cabinet leaks of the famous Gair statements. Senator Gair the Liberal Party is 'a lightweight who could would not say that about the Leader of the ing that comment?

119,Farrer ( Mr Fairbairn),"2 ex-Ministers-ar e onalbeit. Then we have to bring in the members of the Country Party because they make a few statements. I reckon one would put the Country Party Ministers in the same category as 'Dad's Army', I will refer now to an article in the 'Australian' of Friday, 3 August 1973, entitled 'Anthony's ""thickhead"" jibe at Libs'. The article states: The Liberal-Country Party split in Victoria is leaving the way open for Labor to rush into a double dissolution, the Federal leader of the Country Party, Mr Anthony, warned last night. Speaking in Melbourne after a special meeting of the Victoria Country Party State central council, Mr Anthony bitterly attacked the Liberal Party State executive as 'thickheads.' I reckon I am a bit with him for once. Then he gave real vent to his feelings, as reported in the 'Daily Telegraph' of 3 August in an article headed 'Snap poll: ALP would romp in*. He is the Leader of the honourable gentleman who just resumed his seat. The report states: Labor would 'romp in' if a snap election were called now and if the rift between the Country and Speaker, just about this time last year Liberal Parties continued, Mr Doug Anthony warned yesterday. 'Why some of those thickheads don't realise this I don't know', he said. When one thinks about it, one realises that they are a couple of the most sensible statements he has made for a long time. One can go right through all the statements. Honourable members opposite complained about our Cabinet changes. On4 August there was a newspaper report headed 'Snedden remakes Liberal Cabinet'. The members of that Liberal Cabinet were elected only about 3 months before that date. What kind of a leader would he be? The headline in the Melbourne 'Age' of Tuesday, 13 February states: 'Party's divided: Snedden'. Another headline states: 'A house divided'. Another headline from the Melbourne 'Sun' of Tuesday, 13 February, states: 'Libs ""plagued"" by split . . .'. This was the Leader of the Opposition talking. Heavens above! I refer to the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) of Baron Muenchausen fame. He writes for a journal. I do not want to offend him but I am one of his few readers, because he puts me in a good mood. He writes some sense, sometimes, like the articles in the 'Courier-Mail' of 21 July this year which was headed: Killen blasts CP. 'humbug' Joint Senate Ticket Plan My word, there are some Liberals waking up. We find that the most bitter attack of all was made by a former member of Parliament, Mr St John, who said: 'Lies defeated the Liberals'. I have just given honourable members in the time at my disposal a quick run down of these newspaper articles. Let us have a look at another newspaper article. It is headed: 'Liberals set for take-off-where? ' I could continue reading these articles. Another article is headed: Liberals' chief calls for younger men as MPs Many are too old for jobs, says Southey As I see the slumbering shadow Minister on the front bench, I do not wonder at these articles. I do not have time to run through the volumes of notes that I have. But I ask the public to take their pick-the brilliant men who sit on this side, backed up by the men behind them with a policy for the Australian people or the discarded guilty men who sit on that side in their rightful place in this Parliament. Motion (by Mr Nicholls) proposed: That the question be now put. Order! The question is: That the question be now put. All those of that opinion say 'aye* to the contrary 'no' a point of order.

The 'Examiner' newsAct 1956-1972, I have pleasure in presenting the seventeenth annual report of the Corporation for the year ended 30 June 1973, together with financial statements and the AnditorGeneral's report on those statements. Dr 3. F. CAIRNS (Lalor-Minister for Overseas Trade)-Fo r the information of honourable members, I present a Tariff Board report on expandable polystyrene beads and coated paperboard for use in the manufacture of disposable hot drink cups-by-law , dated 19 July 1973. OF THE WORLD BANK AND THE Ministerial Statement -by leave I have recently returned from Nairobi where I attended the twenty-eighth annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as the Governor of those institutions for Australia. Of the 126 countries represented at Nairobi, over 100 were developing countries. They had a particular interest, of course, in the discussions on the work of the World Bank group. The President of the World Bank, Mr tralia's efforts to be helpful in these matters. McNamara, was able to report that the financial institutions for which he is responsible had achieved the goal which he had set in 1968 of doubling the Bank group's operations in the course of the ensuing 5 years. In the 5 years to March 1968 financial commitments totalled $US5.8 billion. In the 5 years to March 1973, financial commitments totalled SUS13.4 billion. In real terms, the increase been reappointed President of the Bank for a further 5 years and over this period he plans tc expand the group'sfinancialcommitments by another 40 per cent in real terms. This would bring new commitments over the 197478 period to $US22 billiona truly prodigiousfigure.Whether or not such afigurewill be achieved remains to be seen. The number of donor countries in the Bank group is few and the support of some of the larger donors is uncertain. The World Bank, however, is clearly destined to continue to dominate the international scene in terms of financial flows from multilateral institutions to developing countries. What the World Bank will be paying particular attention to over the period ahead, however, is not so much the quantity of its disbursements, as the quality. There is now a belated recognition that one cannot measure progress solely by the rate of growth of gross national product. It has been estimated that 40 per cent of the population of the developing countries of the world is living in absolute poverty. It is important that the benefits of financialflowsto developing countries shouid reach that lower 40 per cent of the income earning population. Henceforth the Bank will be identifying the concentrations of poverty in developing countries and directing investments in such a way as to bring some direct relief to the poorest people. In particular, there will be more emphasis on improving the productivity of small scale farmers. All this is to the good. However, there are critical problems ahead for the developing world. Three of these problems were highlighted in Nairobi. They are: 1. The growing burden of external debt 2. The impediments to the development of export earnings 3. The inadequacy of development assistance. It was a matter of some satisfaction to me that I was able in Nairobi to point to AusI was able to say, for instance, that virtually the whole of Australia's official aid has been given on a grant basis and that we are not therefore adding to the debt burden of the developing countries. I was able to remind other governors of the steps we were taking to facilitate imports from developing countries. I referred to improvements made to the preferential scheme involving periodic cuts in duties on imports from developing countries. I also pointed out that these cuts were superimposed on the recent 25 per cent cut in general tariff rates on imports from all countries. Finally, on the matter of official aid, I was in a position to say that, notwithstanding what was happening in some other donor countries, there was no slackening in Australia's official aid effort and we remained in the top three or four in the world aid tables. That Australia has a favourable record in understanding the problems of developing countries and taking action to assist them must be a matter for satisfaction to the whole House.",68,Export Payments Insurance Corporation

143,Was 100 Per Cent. Mr Mcnamara Has Recently,"I recognise that the Government which preceded us laid a good foundation for Australia's aid efforts. The present Government has built upon that basis and moved further along the road. Whatever is done to assist developing countries, however, the fact remains that tlie vital contribution has to be made by the developing countries themselves. In this respect, if there is one firm impression I could bring back from Nairobi, it is that the people of Africa have all the qualities necessary to make a success of their future development. They deserve support. I turn now to what was the major subject of discussion at Nairobi-the issue of international monetary reform. Honourable members will recall that I made a statement to the House on this subject on 12 April 1973. At that time. I gave honourable members some of the background to the establishment of the Committee of Twenty, of which Australia is a member, and I outlined some of the main issues as they then stood. At the subsequent meeting of the Committee of Twenty held in Washington on 30-31 July, the general atmosphere was favourable and some progress was made. In contrast, however, the most recent Committee of Twenty meeting held in Nairobi on 23 September did not advance matters a great deal further. The Committee of Twenty was able to refer to Governors a 'First Outline of Reform*. After this speech I propose to table the full text of it. However that outline is clearly not a complete blue-print for a reformed monetary system. There are many major issues yet to be resolved. Of course it would be wrong to be too disappointed at this apparent lack of progress in the September discussions on reform. For one thing, I have never been over-impressed with the notion that some re-writing of the rules of the International Monetary Fund would suddenly solve all our international financial problems. Assuming that the rules are good rules, the question still remains whether countries when they are under pressure will abide by the rules. Recent history is not too comforting on that point. The essential thing, as I see it, is to establish the fact that observance of certain codes of behaviour in the international financial field are in the interests of all. Cooperation, not coercion, should be the basis of the monetary system of the future. If the will is not there, the rules will not help a great deal. Another thing to bear in mind is that financial crises, dramatic as they are, and important as they are, are not the whole story. Dr Witteveen, for instance, the new Managing Director, was able to record a strong economic recovery in the main industrial countries of the world after a 2-year period of economic slowdown. Notwithstanding recurrent financial crises, world production and world trade have been growing strongly over the past 12 or 18 months. The output of industrial countries was more than 7 per cent higher in real terms in the first half of 1973 than in the second half of 1972, and world trade was no less than 12 per cent higher in real terms in the first half of 1973 than it had been a year earlier. Developing countries have benefited from this increase in world economic activity, along with developed countries. Nevertheless, internationalfinancialproblems are important in their own right and have implications for other areas of economic policy. For instance, the continued growth of international liquidity has had consequences for domestic liquidity in member countries and for the battle against inflation-a n issue which concerns all of us. It is desirable therefore that we should press ahead with the program of monetary reform as fast as possible. It is for this reason that the Committee of Twenty, in referring the First Outline of Monetary Reform to Governors, placed a time limit of 31 July 1974 for the settlement of remaining issues on monetary reform. Whether such a time limit will prove to be realistic only time will tell. What are these outstanding issues? The basic issue is how to achieve a greater degree of equilibrium in the balance of payments between industrial countries. If there is one single reason why the monetary system has failed it is because individual countries, confronted with persistent surpluses or deficits, have not taken early and sufficient action to correct those surpluses and deficits. This is a simple point, and yet it is fundamental, and quite critical, to the reform discussion. Australia has stressed the importance of individual action to correct balance of payments disequilibria. It has been able to do so in the knowledge that the present Government's policy is impeccable in this respect. The exchange rate actions and the tariff actions which this Government has taken have been noted and commended throughout the world. However, the United States and the Europeans tend to look to new rules to bring about this quicker adjustment. The monetary reform discussions to date have, to some extent, been a debate between the United States on the one hand and Europe on the other as to what rules would best achieve this result. The United States, for its part, places emphasis on what it calls 'objective indicators'. The United States believes that the present system is one-sided in that there will always be pressure on deficit countries to devalue because they run out of reserves. As they see it there is no equivalent pressure on surplus countries to revalue. The United States system of objective indicators would essentially involve establishing a normal range within which each country's reservefigureswould be permitted to move. If reserves rose above or fell below those limits, the country concerned would be required to take action to restore reserves to afigurewithin the permitted range. The Europeans, for their part, would place more emphasis in monetary reform on restoring the principle of convertibility or, as it is sometimes called, asset settlement. They see the monetary crises of recent years as having their origins in the failure of a large persistent deficit country-the United States-to take action to correct that deficit. The United States has been able to continuefinancingthis deficit because other countries-eithe r willingly or because they could not acquire a more preferred asset-hav e held more and more United States dollars in their reserves. Unlike most other deficit countries, the United States has not run out of reserves. The Europeans would put an end to this by reducing the role of reserve currencies in the monetary system. They would replace reserve currencies with special drawing rights as the major asset of the future. They would impose upon the United States an obligation to convert other countries' holdings of dollars into special drawing rights whenever the United States ran into deficit. It has been agreed that objective indicators should have a role to play in the future system. But it has also been agreed that considerations other than reserve movements would need to be taken into account in determining whether or not a country should take action to correct balance of payments surpluses or deficits. What all this amounts to is that a good deal of the automaticity has been taken out of the original United States proposals for objective indicators. Australia welcomes that development, which has been in accordance with our own view of the matter throughout. What has not been agreed is whether pressures should be put upon countries if they do not take balance of payments action which reserve indicators suggest they should have taken. There has been less of a convergence of views on the issue of assets settlement. It has been agreed in principle that the role of reserve currencies should be reduced and that the SDR, as appropriately modified, should become the primary reserve asset of the future. It has been agreed in principle that countries maintaining par values should settle in reserve assets those official balances of their currencies which other countries present to them. But it has not been agreed whether this process should be mandatory so far as the countries holding the balances are concerned or whether it should be voluntary. Australia, for its part, has indicated its willingness to consider participation in any agreed system but has expressed a strong preference for the principle of voluntarism. In other words, if Australia earns United States dollars it should be up to Australia to decide whether it wishes to convert those dollars into SDR or whether it wishes to continue to hold the dollars. We have taken the same attitude in respect of both existing holdings of reserve currencies and new receipts of reserve currencies. This is all consistent with our overriding view that we wish to see a maximum of flexibility and co-operation in the system and a minimum of compulsion and coercion. A second basic issue of major importance is the volume and quality of the SDR. If the SDR is to be the primary reserve asset of the future then it must be a strong and not a weak asset. This means that it must not be in over-supply. It must be as attractive as, if not more attractive than, any alternative reserve asset in terms of its ability to maintain its value and in terms of the interest rate it yields. Countries tend to take positions on this issue depending on what role they see themselves playing in the period ahead. If they see themselves as prospective debtors they tend to favour a 'soft' SDR. If they see themselves as prospective creditors they tend to favour a 'hard' SDR. This matter is still under discussion. But it is my firm view that if the SDR is not fully accepted and firmly held, the reformed monetary system will fail. I have been speaking in terms of differences of view on basic issues between some of the major industrial countries or groups of industrial countries. There is one particular issue which has been raised by the developing countries. They believe that monetary reform should operate to increase the flow of resources in their direction. To this end they have suggested there should be a direct link between the issue of SDR and aid to developing countries. The problem some developed countries -and , I might add, some developing countries also-se e in this proposal is that the SDR has to be accepted by the world as a whole as a reserve asset of the first quality. There are legitimate fears that such a link may introduce other than monetary considerations into the question of the volume of issue of SDR and the valuation and rate of interest of SDR. Australia has an open mind on this matter. We are anxious that the operational aspects of the link should be examined thoroughly, along with monetary reform proper, in order to ascertain whether some form of link can be devised which can safely be accepted from the point of view of monetary reform. It has occurred to us that it may be better to establish the SDR as the centre of the monetary system, and when the SDR is working effectively, to consider then whether or not there should be a link. In the end this may well be the most productive approach for all concerned. Monetary reform is a complex matter and has many aspects. I have touched on only a few of the main issues here. However, should honourable members wish to pursue these issues further I present to them the first outline of reform which has been referred to governors of the International Monetary Fund by the Committee of Twenty and which contains a more complete account of the state of discussion at this point of time. I also present to the House a revised version of the glossary of terms which I previously provided to honourable members on the occasion of an earlier statement to the House on these matters. I present the following paper: Twenty-eighth Annual Meeting of the World Bank Conference and were intended to apply over and the International Monetary Fund-Ministeria l the 5 years to 1974-75.

I seek the concurrence of the Treasurer in providing information on those questions before his statement comes on for debate so that the information provided can be taken into account. Debate (on motion by Mr Lynch) adjourned. Second reading Debate resumed from 23 August (vide page 338), on motion by Mir Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time. the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation.

Separate questions may, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of both Bills to be discussed in this debate. it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the 2 measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed. Grants Bill seeks to replace the States Grants Act 1971-72.

At the Premiers Conference the New South could not have been foreseen at the time their Wales Government foreshadowed a Budget Budgets were brought down. This statement deficit of almost $100m.

Firstly, the Budget difficulties reported likely deficits of a similar magnitude. and the heavy deficits facing the States in 1973Notwithstanding this position, the Common74 arose very largely from factors outside their wealth was not prepared to offer any improvecontrol. The pressures on State Budgets flow ment in the existing arrangements beyond a from wage and salary awards handed down by S25m additional grant to be distributed independent tribunals and from the effects of amongst the States. This forced the States into Commonwealth monetary policy. The rate of a position where they had no alternative but interest on Commonwealth bonds was already to announce an immediate increase in payroll at a record level at the time the State Budgets tax of 1 per cent. In his second reading speech the Treasurer now caused bond yields to rise to an all time ( Mr Crean) speaks of 'agreement' between the peak. The other issue relates to the problem Australian and the State governments on the of coping with continuing cost increases during specialfinancialassistance of $25m for 1973the year. There is no doubt that there will be tion toward meeting the substantial deficits facing the States this year as a result of heavy The Australian Government was budgeting The Treasurer also referred to the Prime event of the States having 'undue difficulties' because of factors beyond their control which were being prepared and the Government has increasing wage and other costs in 1973-74 after the State Budgets have been introduced. What, therefore, is to be the Australian Government's attitude on what are 'undue difficulties'? The States already have battled hard in framing their Budgets for 1973-74 to cope with cost pressures to date within the limited revenuefieldsopen to them. They cannot cope from their own resources with the effects of rapidly rising wage and cost levels of uncontrolled inflation after their Budgets have been passed by their Parliaments. Clearly the Commonwealth chose to assert unwarranted constrictions. If, in fact, the basis of the Governgeneral revenue purposes. Secondly, it has ment's policy approach to the States had been based on a desire for overall restraint in spendthe States and seeks to dictate the terms and ing by all governments in Australia it may have had some justification. However, quite contrary to any concept of general restraint, the Federal Treasurer brought down a Budget which increased Federal spending by 18.9 per cent. Minister for Tourism and Recreation wants to deny that point let him provide the facts. I am waiting for an answer. He shakes his head. This was an unprecedented increase in the level of public spending and more than twice the increase determined for the States. The Federal Budget provided absolute evidence of this Government's centralist trend. It is generally accepted that the most efficient and expedient means of destroying Australia's federal system of government is the exercise offinancialdomination by the Commonwealth. As indicated by the Treasurer in his second reading speech, the Prime Minister, in his opening speech at the Premiers Conference, stated as his Government's policy that where the national government undertakes new or additional commitments which relieve the States or their authorities of the need to allocate funds for expenditures at present being carried by them, there should be adjustments in thefinancialarrangements between the two levels of government to take account of the shift of new financial responsibilities. In practice this policy means that the Commonwealth Government will use its dominant fiscal powers to replace general purpose allocations with specific purpose payments, thus further eroding thefinancialautonomy of the States and further restricting their capacity to determine their own priorities in the composition of their expenditures. The States already are tied to maintaining a specific proportion of their expenditures on education and if, at the same time, their general purpose allocations are to be reduced in this manner they willfinishup in a position where they will have practically no freedom of movement at all in meeting their other expenditure responsibilities. We can discern 3 main trends in the Australian Government's attitude to financial arrangements with the States. Firstly, the Australian Government has held back from the States a reasonable and equitable share of the growth in income tax receipts for 1973-74 for offered a substantial increase in tied grants to conditions under which such grants are to be spent. For 1973-74 general revenue assistance grants to the States are estimated to increase by SI53m while specific purpose grants already approved, or on offer to the States, will increase by no less than $720m. In addition to directing resources to the States to carry out its Canberra-determined policy, the Australian Government states its policy that where its decisions relieve the States of the need to allocate funds to a particular area of activity for which the State has had responsibility there will be appropriate adjustments to the financial arrangements between the two levels of government. In the case of tertiary education this policy meant that the tax reimbursement grants to the States would be reduced from the beginning of the 1974 academic year by the amount of expenditure of which the States had been relieved. As a result of the Government's assumption of full responsibility for financing tertiary education from 1 January 1974, this Bill seeks to deduct from thefinancialassistance grants the estimated amounts of recurrent expenditure previously undertaken by the States. The reductions from the revenue grants for 1973-74, totalling $111.8m, represent estimates of the half-year savings to the States. The amounts for 1974-75, totalling $229.7m, represent the estimated full-year savings. In view of this it was a matter of deep concern to consider the dishonest presentation of the Government's expenditure on education in the recent Federal Budget. claim an increase in expenditure of 92 per",72,States Grants Bill 1973

I put it to the Minister that the real figure is 60 per cent simply because of the $111.8m reduction in this Bill and the $32.8m reduction in the States Grants (Capital Assistance) Bill. Thus the increase resulting from this manoeuvre is exactly nil. It is quite improper to take $145m of tertiary education money from the States and then claim it as a figure for additional Commonwealth expenditure. is becoming a little upset by the exposure of in Australia, as a result of judicial interthese facts, I simply say to him: Please tell pretation and Government policy, is far the truth in the presentation of Budget figures. removed today from that contemplated by the cent increase? 60 per cent increase. satisfied. fied, but there is a credibility gap of some 30 the Commonwealth and the unlimited use per cent.

In these circumstances the announced policy means that the States will be left progressively with their own limited fields of taxation and charges lo cope with the growth and development of other State activities. The trends which are evident have far reaching implications for the federal system of government. The Opposition Parties believe strongly in the retention of Australia's federal system of Government. We do so because this system is most conducive to the progress and well-being of Australia and most conducive to the democratic protection of the freedom Constitution.

They challenge the spirit of the constitutional division of powers and call into question the efficacy of a framework which serves merely to limit the tendencies which have been developed and which demonstrably cannot check them. But the flagrant determination of the present Labor Government to exploit the weaknesses in our constitutional framework in order to maximise the dominance of the central government clearly calls for a reappraisal of Commonwealth-State nnancial arrangements. That reappraisal must be sought on a co-operative basis. It is to be hoped that the Constitutional Convention will provide a satisfactory response to the existing difficulties. I do not wish to pre-empt the conclusions of that Convention or to comment in detail on the substance of the matters now being considered by the working parties. However, it must be made clear that the Liberal Party of Australia is committed to a viable federal system. Therefore any formula which sought to make adjustments significantly towards a unitary system of government would be unacceptable. Equally, we believe that the Commonwealtb Government must have that degree of economic authority which is necessary to facilitate the effective management of the economy as a whole. Consequently, any constitutional alteration which sought to diminish the efficacy of the Commonwealth's economic management would also be unacceptable. The Liberal Party does not accept that there should be any interference with the Commonwealth's income tax collecting authority. On the other hand there is merit in a further examination of revenue sharing systems. In this regard the sharing of income tax revenues in fixed proportions between the Commonwealth and the States would have real advantages. We also consider that there is merit in seeking limitations in the application of section which has developed in Australia is one of 96 of the Constitution to restrict the nature of the conditions which the Commonwealth can impose on grants made under this section. The present Government has substantially abused the powers under section 96 by endeavouring to impose such terms and conditions as are entirely unwarranted and designed to impose detailed controls over State administrations. In conclusion, the provision of the Bills before the House demonstrate, without qualification, the need to reappraise existing Commonwealth-State financial arrangements. The funds provided by this legislation are totally inadequate and, as the rate of inflation continues to worsen and the administrative costs of State governments continue to rise, their inadequacy will become a matter of very serious concern. We have considerable reservations about this legislation but, because of the financial assistance it will provide to the States, the Opposition parties do not oppose it. tion provides an opportunity for me to express my apprehension over the direction in which the federal system offinanceis heading. I do not claim that the present position is entirely due to the Labor Government, although the progress towards centralism has quickened markedly under its administration. WhatI think must be of grave concern is the direction in which we are headed and, more immediately, the undesirable features of the present federalfinancialarrangements. Before World War II, payments by the Commonwealth to the States were mainly of a marginal nature confined to specific aspects. Since then there has been a marked increase in the kind and scope of Commonwealth assistance to the States in relation to independent State revenue raising capabilities. Erosion of State financial independence and authority has been gradual but inexorable. It has been the product of a combination of financial circumstances and economic growth. In this respect the centralist attitude of the Labor Government is a more extreme extension of a long term trend that has developed to a point where re-assessment is essential. The facts are clear. Over the 22 years from 1948-49 to 1969-70 the net indebtedness of State and local authorities increased by nearly $ 12,000m while that of the Commonwealth authorities decreased by over $6,000m. The financial and constitutional position imbalance between the Commonwealth and the States in the allocation of revenue and responsibility. The revenue collected by the States during the 1960s totalled just under one-fifth of that collected by the Commonwealth whereas expenditure by the States amounted to four-fifths of the size of the Commonwealth expenditure. While the Commonwealth has become financially dominant there has been no corresponding transfer of functional activities. The States have retained their constitutional responsibility for important services such as education, hospitals and roads and the",75,States Grants Bill 1973
157,Mr Lucock (Lyne) (5.58),"This legislacontrol of leading public utilities such as railways and electricity. The previous Government, of which I was a supporter, was conscious of the deteriorating position, and initiated remedial action to remove some of the more burdensome aspects of State government nnancial burdens. At the 1970 Premiers' Conference the Commonwealth agreed to provide an interest free grant of $200m in 1970-71 to be used for non-income earning works-for example, schools. This sum was to increase in future years at the same rate as total works and housing programs. The Commonwealth also undertook to assume the interest and sinking fund burden of an additional $200m of State aid over the 5 years. Thus, by 1974-75 the Commonwealth would have assumed responsibility for existing State aid totalling $ 1,000m. The importance of the interest-free capital grant was that previously these funds had been provided by the Commonwealth in the form of loans and interest had been charged on them. It is important to understand that position in 1970 to bring into context the Bills that we are now debating. The Loan Council program for State governments represents the major source of funds available to the States for capital works. They had always been general purpose programs, although from 1945-46 to 1971, as a matter of procedure, the Loan Council agreed to the allocation of an equivalent part of the total program to the Australian government as an approved borrowing program. When this arrangement expired in 1970-71 specific revenue grants were introduced in lieu of that arrangement. At the Premiers' Conference this year advances for housing were made outside the Loan Council arrangements. In addition the Commonwealth Government is to take over full responsibility for financing tertiary education from 1 January 1974. As a result the Loan Council program is $115m lower in 1973-74 than last year. Therefore, this year we have seen the Commonwealth taking over the tertiary education area, and taking the housing program outside the Loan Council area as a separate program with many strings attached. It can of course be argued persuasively that the States agreed to these arrangements, but this is not the point. The point is that the States have been.financiallyweakened to the extent that they are in no position to refuse money from the Commonwealth and in no position to raise it alternatively for themselves. We are seeing the ultimate culmination of a long process which has been gradually and greatly accelerated under the Labor Government. More specifically, one less publicised feature of the 1973-74 Federal financial arrangements is the increased emphasis in Commonwealth assistance to the States of specific purpose allocations and the decreased emphasis on general revenue assistance. A few facts may illustrate this point. The document 'Payments to or for the States 1973-74* attached to the Budget papers shows that general revenue payments to the States in 1973-74 by the Commonwealth will increase by only 9 per cent while specific purpose revenue payments and specific purpose capital payments will increase by nearly 50 per cent and 100 per cent respectively in one year. Loan Council borrowing programs are down 20 per cent. I believe that these are disturbing facts, not from a narrow political point of view but from the broad viewpoint of the health of our political system. I believe in a Federal system of government. It is my view that the division of power and responsibility is a means both of preserving the liberties of the individual and of providing a better quality of government for people. Government should be responsive to the people and the extent of that responsiveness is to a large extent dependent upon the closeness of government to the people it administers. It is a duty of State and local governments to interpret the community's demand for services in the areas for which they are responsible and to determine the extent to which their taxpayers are willing to meet the cost of continued expansion. Under existing arrangements however, State and local authorities are unable to discharge this responsibility because of limitations of their power to raise taxes or borrow for capital works. At present no government is discharging the vital role of governmentarbitrating between the taxpayer and those who call for more expenditure on government services. Both Commonwealth and States can disclaim responsibility for the level of State and local services. The practical effect is that many services are inadequately provided. The difficulty is that while the States can make an evaluation that more should be spent on State and local services, they do so without the restraint of having to raise the taxation to finance any increase; but while the Commonwealth may make an evaluation that taxation is high enough already it does so without any direct responsibility for the level of State and local services. I believe that the Commonwealth government should retain overall control of the direction and nature of economic growth. However, the presentfinancialrelations are deficient in that the States' constitutional powers and electoral responsibilities are not matched by financial independence and authority. Both the loss of independence and dissipation of responsibility could be lessened if either the States passed over some of their powers or alternatively gained a new measure of independence. The third alternative is for the States to continue to some of our past errors and looked forward have extensive powers but for the exercise of those powers to be determined in detail by the Commonwealth through itsfinancialleverage. The Labor Government is using the financial power of the Commonwealth to impose conditions on State government decisions and is therefore guilty of undermining the entire concept of Federal government. If it wishes to centralise power in Canberra, it should openly press for the constitutional amendments that are necessary to accomplish its purpose. Such a policy would, I believe, be unacceptable to the Australian people for the very good reason that in a country as geographically extensive as Australia, the Federal system is the best. Indeed, current experience is that Federal systems overseas are tending towards a greater dispersal of authority. I believe that what must happen is that the States must be given the financial sinews with which to exercise their constitutional responsibility. I oppose very strongly the centralist attitudes which pose such a fundamental danger to the Australian community. I believe that the more consideration we give to this matter and the greater our understanding of it is, the more we will realise the dangers of centralised control. I say that irrespective of what political party may happen to be in control of the treasury bench in Australia. Because of Australia's geographical situation, because of the problems that confront us, and because of the difficulties that we have in development and progress, I believe that the best system is the federal system. It is a system which has been proved in the past, although admittedly with some difficulties and some problems. But, despite those .difficulties and problems, I think the federal system is a far better system than the centralised form of control which would centralise things in Canberra to the detriment of the progress and development of Australia. Sitting suspended from 6.12 to 3 p.m. do not intend to take up the time of the House for long in regard to this measure but there are a couple of propositions which I think should be put. I am not sure that they will be altogether pleasing to either side of the House. I think that the Liberal Party might perhaps be considering some of the basic financial propositions which underlie budget control. It seems to me that it is time we acknowledged to some kind of new policy because, after all, I am sure that when we get back into power, which will not be long, it will be necessary for us to have a different kind of financial policy in some, though not all, respects. The legislation that is before the House relates to capital advances and in order to put this into perspective I should like to say something about the Federal Budget and the capital advance content of the Federal Budget. I believe this is quite crucial because it embodies an error which has been intensified by the present Government but which was I think inherent in thefinancialpolicies which have been developed over the years. It was said in this House earlier that when the Government spent, it was different from private capital spending because if the Government created a deficit it would be adding to the inflationaryfiresin that it would be adding to the amount of money in circulation. This is an obvious truism. But what is not realised is that if the Government raises a loan it reduces the money in circulation in exactly the same way as if it imposes and collects a tax. In relation to the amount of money in circulation, the raising of a loan is equally efficacious to the collection of a tax in reducing the total quantum of money supply. Therefore, if the Federal Government raises a loan it reduces the money supply in exactly the same way as if it collects a tax. What has happened over past years has been that Federal governments have been paying for capital works out of taxation. They have been collecting taxation and using that money to pay for capital works, very largely through advances to the States. This has meant that in order to maintain financial equilibrium, the Federal governments have either to raise loans, which they have not done, or to impose extra taxation. I put it as a major proposition that the incidence of taxation in Australia very largely has been determined by the failure",76,States Grants Bill 1973
158,Mr Wentwojatlhi (Mackellar) (8.0),"Iof governments to raise adequate loans to cover the capital works program. The extent of this is not always realised but it is easy to make afirstapproximation of this from the figures which are published in the Budget papers. I think that the amount of revenue which has been used for capital works can be reasonably ascertained in the following way: Firstly, we add together the capital works in the Federal Budget as shown in the Budget; secondly, we add to that the grants to the States for specified capital purposes as shown in the Budget papers; and, thirdly, we add the net capital advances to States and other bodies as shown in the Budget papers, all coming from Federal revenue. We take from that I think we should-the Budget deficit as shown in the Budget papers. This will give us the amount of taxation which is allocated to capital purposes. It is an approximation because the result probably understates the position due firstly to the excess provision of sinking fund and, secondly, to the lack of allowance for capital appreciation of Commonwealth assets.

Using the officialfiguresas I have pointed out, I have compiled from the Budget papers a table showing the development of this practice in the last 20 years and particularly the very big advance which was made in the amount of the allocation for capital works in the last year, as shown in the Budget papers. It is not usually realised that the net amount allocated in the Budget papers of this year for capital works is $2,062ma very big proportion of our income tax. In other words, if we reverted to the normal principles of finance which we should be following we could reduce income tax very significantly or, alternatively, we could reduce excise or one of the other taxes, if and only if we could raise this additional amount by loan and thus reduce taxation without adding to the net monetary supply.

WhatI am finances of the State treasuries have been saying is that there has been an accumulating tough and tight, an inadequate amount of error. If only we could make the loan market money has been available for the development reasonable we could reduce taxation without of the public transport system. This is part of causing inflation.

Surely in all common excise and some of the other things which sense we should be using our existing assets in bear most hardly upon the cost of living. The public transport, particularly rail transport, sum of $2,000m is involved. In my belief the Government made a way of additional expenditure. We will be great error this year because when it wanted to saving hundreds of millions of dollars if we reduce liquidity in the banking system, instead make proper use of our public transport assets. of raising loans, as it should have done, and For this purpose it is only reasonable financial reducing taxation, it chose to gofiddlingwith prudence to reduce to marginal cost the charges we have. Let me turn to the questions which arise in these 2 Bills by which we are making advances to the States.

162,Mr Wfjwwortjrl,"That is right; the ourable member for Lyne( Mr Lucock) whowhich are made to users of the railways and those public transport systems where extra use does not involve much in the way of extra cost. If we could do this the sum total of the national income would be very much augmented. In place of this, what has happened? Because the Commonwealth Treasury rides the States with too tight a rein, a State like New South Wales-and I daresay every other State, but I speak of New South Wales because I know it and I do not know the other States, although I would imagine their problems are exactly the same-put s up its fares and freights. In consequence traffic is diverted to other means of transport, the usage of the railways falls, the railways losses accumulate and then in the name of what we call financial prudence-it is actually nnancial extravagance -fare s and freights rise again at the behest of the Commonwealth Treasury. And so the vicious circle goes on. One sees it in its clearest form in metropolitan transport where the system of public transport languishes through under-use all the time because, as the number of pasengers carried by train or bus tends to decline as a proportion of total movement in order to make good the losses fares are raised, fewer people use the transport systems and, naturally, more people divert to private transport. Once again, not only are greater losses incurred on the public transport but, what is even more important, these losses are built permanently, or quasi-permanently, into the system because the pattern of residence in relation to employment, the commuter problem of people travelling to work, gets distorted from what it should be because people do not use public transport sufficiently and public transport, because it is not used sufficiently, does not become available. Mr Speaker, I have trespassed on your patience and on the patience of the House to raise some of these very fundamental issues. I will come back to the point that I am making that we on this side of the Parliament believe in the States. We believe, that the States in a federal system should have a proper function. In the pastI have to confess our sins perhaps a little-w e on this side of the House have paid lip service to that proposition. I believe that for the future this Party will pay to that proposition not lip service but a true adherence. In so doing we on this side of the House will differentiate ourselves from the Australian Labor Party Government on the other side of the House which really, in the final analysis, is devoted to the cause of centralism and wants to use the Treasury as a means of destroying the States. We, with all our professions-le t us confess it-hav e allowed this to happen in the past. I am sure that we on this side of the House will not let it continue for the future. An anti-inflationary policy includes something sensible along these lines, in contradistinction to the comparative madness which has infected the Federal Treasury for so long. before the House are very important to the States. We know that, over the years, the States have always been short of funds. This is nothing new. Lots of people are. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) has made certain suggestions in relation to the types of funds that should be used. IfI understood him correctly, he said that more loan moneys and less grant moneys should be used. I cannot go all the way with him in that proposition. One of the major problems in financing has been that the States and local government authorities have had great difficulty in servicing loans. Had the honourable member for Mackellar made his suggestion in 1927-probabl y he was not here at that time-and had a more business like management of loan moneys commenced at that time, the States would not be faced with the problems which they have today. All the loan moneys borrowed over the years by the Commonwealth have been made available to the States. The Commonwealth for its part has used the revenue about which the honourable member for Mackellar has spoken for works within its works system. Also, as he said, some of the grants from taxation revenue have been made available to the States for the purpose of making up loan deficiencies. The main point is that over the years that this loan program has been in progress the States have run themselves into tremendous troubles. One of the principal problems is that, in the early years of the operation of this scheme, the States amortised each loan over the total period in which the loan was repayable to the Commonwealth, that is, 53 years. In thefirstfew years of the loan program, the transport system, for instance, which the honourable member for Mackellar mentioned was a very cheap system indeed. But as the loan program progressed, with the States adopting this amortisation program, costs got out of hand. This is the basis of the problem today. These costs are completely out of hand.",80,Capital Items Paid For Out Of Federal Taxation

They authorities on the whole are falling further must be assisted to meet the backlog in the behind than the States are in servicing loans. servicing of those loans. The need to revise I do hope that, if local authorities are given policies for the future is mentioned in the a seat at the Loan Council, some method Treasurer's second reading speech. The other point that I wish to make in relation to local government authorities throughout Australia is that the position of to that section of these Bills which relates to these authorities is even worse. Local governeducation. The agreement between the States ments do not have the opportunity to borrow and the Commonwealth, as I understand it, is through the Loan Council in the same way that the Commonwealth will take over tertiary as the States do. State Treasuries have thc education responsibilities from the States. This opportunity to borrow cheaper money, as I is reflected in the legislation by a reduction in call it, through the Loan Council. This is revenue grants to the States for 1973-74 money collected by the Commonwealth and totalling $111.8m, representing the estimated made available by it to the States. Local savings to the States for the half year from authorities in Australia have only borrowing the time when the Commonwealth assumes local authorities in Australia will have access at the Loan Council table-that is true-bu t they will still be obliged to borrow dearer What is required is action to alleviate the different from that operating at present will be found to provide them with money. I direct the attention of honourable members this responsibility. The reduction for the financial year 1974-75 totals $229.7m and represents the estimated savings foi that full year to the States from the Commonwealth's action. It is obvious that, following agreement apparently reached between the Commonwealth and the States, those sums are to be deducted from the total amount made available from the Commonwealth to the States, as a result of the Commonwealth assuming responsibility in this field. Therefore, those amounts will appear in the education program of the Commonwealth and no longer will appear in the State programs. A Bill has been passed through this House relating to regional authorities. It is the intention of the Government to make certain moneys available to regional authorities. I hope that in the near future the Government will explain precisely what will happen in that field. The Government's intentions in relation to forming these regions have not been stated clearly. We do not know what amounts of money will be made available and on what terms and conditions they will be made available. I believe that, having legislation before the Parliament, the Government should .make its position clear. It is obvious that the local authorities throughout Australia have to draw up their own budgets in the same way as the States and the Commonwealth have to do. So they are anxious to know precisely what this Government has in mind. The Leader of the House( Mr Daly) has indicated that he wants to move on to the next order of the day. I agreed to take only about 10 minutes of the time of the House. I repeat that these Bills are important to the States. The States have their rightful place in the government of this country. I hope that they will be allowed to continue to function in that field in the future in the same way as they are functioning now. I hope also that we can improve their situation in relation to their financing by a more equitable arrangement regarding the servicing of various loans which have been made available. The previous Government made a move in that direction by picking up $1,000m. The present Government has indicated that it can see the problem.

Ministerial Statement Debate resumed from 15 October (vide page 2067), on motion by Mr Daly: That the House take note of the paper. activities of which the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr. J. F. Cairns) gives an account in this statement arose in connection with the Minister's visit to Tokyo for the initial meeting in connection with the next round of negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I am bound to say that the Minister's account contains much of dogma and prejudice-tempered , as one would expect of the Minister, with a little idealism-and of unreal expectations. For example, it expresses the idea of this country moving into products and processes out of which the Japanese have moved-wha t products and processes are these? The statement contains much wishful thinking-for example, that there can be effective or beneficial entry",81,Capital Items Paid For Out Of Federal Taxation
164,Mr Edwards (Berowra) (8.35),"Th eby the Japanese into motor car manufacture here. The statement includes also contradiction and some self-congratulation. At the outset I should say-thi s also is a disappointment-that there is very little in the statement about the great matters whichor a beginning to which were to be the focus of the Tokyo meeting. I refer to negotiations to reduce non-tariff barriers and agricultural protectionism as well as industrial tariffs as barriers to the growth of international trade, and the future systems of safeguards and adjustment assistance in the event of real progress towards a reduction of barriers. In the statement the Minister speaks in a way typical of this Government, as if his side of the House has a monopoly of concern for the potentially adverse social consequences of change and adjustment with a freer flow of international trade. I refer to the need for employees to find and train for new jobs, and for firms to turn to new avenues of production and investment. This matter was well canvassed in the discussions and preliminary papers preceding the meeting in Tokyo. So concern for these matters is hardly the monopoly of the Minister, although a casual listener to his statement might have gathered that impression. As a matter of passing interest, the lapanese have had an adjustment assistance law in being since 1971. The Minister made no reference at all to the problem of the so called link between the reduction of barriers to international trade, tariffs and non-tariffs, and an effectively functioning and adaptive pattern of relatively stable exchange rates-in short, an adequate international monetary system. The reduction of barriers to international trade and the development of an adequate international monetary system go hand in hand in promoting an expanding, balanced and equitable flow of world trade-on e that is mutually benencial to developing and developed countries alike. This problem of the 'link' has been widely acknowledged in the world's financial Press as being perhaps the most tricky issue facing the Tokyo conference. But there was no reference to that in the Minister's statement. Perhaps it would have been appropriate for the Treasurer ( Mr Crean) to have joined with the Minister in making a joint statement, or do they belong to different wings of the Government party? At all events the Treasurer made such a statement before the suspension of the sitting for dinner. Rather than focussing on the great if frustratingly difficult issues of trying to find constructive ways to make the world trade and nnancial system work better, the Minister early in his statement adopts the typically 'Anti'-prejudice, if I may call it that, that the developing economies have gained little from past trade and aid programs. He says that they have not achieved much and that we need to look more realistically at the major issues-wit h the presumption that this is not being done. The Minister takes a swipe at the developed economies of the world when he refers to 'the usually non-competing enterprise system which characterises the developed countries and which operates to the disadvantage of the economically weak economies and less well-organised and more highly competitive enterprises of the developing world'. To say that the enterprise systems of the developed economies are usually noncompeting is just plain factually incorrect. I am set to wondering just how close the Minister has ever got to the problems of making sales of manufactured products in the shifting conditions of modern trade and variable exchange rates. He ought to talk to some of the developed European countries about the difficulties of competing effectively with a new undervalued United States dollar. I hope that the Minister for Minerals and Energy( Mr Connor) takes some note of that in the light of some of his earlier statements. The sort of stance that is taken at this point in the paper-of the disadvantageous impact of the developed economies on the developingis no doubt influenced by hoary arguments, such as the extent to which the prices of manufactured goods are held to have increased much more favourably relatively to the prices of primary commodities which figure so heavily in the trade of the developing countries. This particular bit of folk lore in fact is not proven, even over the long stretch prior to the rises in commodity prices that we have witnessed in recent years. Be that as it may; what I stress is that in the very process of competition between the developed, the advanced countries, the development of secondary industry in the developing countries is assisted. The fact is that increasingly firms from the industrialised developed countries have shifted into the developing economies, and this has helped the expansion of the developing-that is the poorer-economies ' trade in manufactures. It is this indeed which has been a major factor in making enterprises in the developing economies more competitive in international markets and has fuelled the increased rate of growth of their exports of manufactures. And as I stressed in a recent speech in this House, the thrust of the overall expansion of world trade is the growth of trade in manufactures as between the advanced industrial countries of the world, as well as between them and the developing economies. If, even so, progress in development is too the potential cancerous incubus that was proslow for the Minister's liking as well as for posed by the Bills before this House last week. my own, what we have to recognise is that I am led to make that reference to the AIDC one of the present facts of life is that the because the Minister himself referred to it in quantum of trade in manufactured goods by his statement, in connection with overseas the developing economies is quite small. Howinvestment in this country. I can only say that ever, it is also a fact that those economies I am gratified by the drift of the Minister's have been growing more rapidly than those statement just prior to that reference where of the developed countries and the socialist he welcomed overseas investment as a vehicle countries when it comes to manufactured of new technology and know-how in this goods.

Realistically of the rich countries of the world we contrithis situation will remain for the rest of the bute-and I would hope on an increasing decade. But it is wrong to imply that the scale-to the growth of living standards, paroperations of the developed countries screw ticularly in the developing world.

WhatI would like to put as strongly as posto be Government policy that we would welsible is that we also should increasingly be come investment by Australian firms in that part of the process I have described-that is, area. I cannot quote the statement precisely, participating in the development of secondary but that was the effect of it. However brief, industry in the developing countries. In his we have there a statement relating to the statement the Minister makes a passing requirements as the Government sees them for reference to discussions with Nissan and Australian foreign investment-somethin g Toyota and to the fact that the Government which, as I have said, I should like to see welcomes them to engage in the manufacture more of. of motor vehicles in Australia. I note that there was no reference to the key problem in this industry of too many separate motor statement in relation to his' visit to North vehicle plants in this country, and to the Korea. The possibilities referred to there are problems of achieving economies of scale and the exchange of Australian mineral products efficiency which would be exacerbated by the for North Korean manufactures. There are simple addition of Nissan and Toyota to the then possible difficulties for our own manulist.

It is the sort of problem that some trade within the East Asian region, we have foreseen in relation to our trade with involving Australia exporting components and Japan.

In general terms, what I am trying to say is that what the Government should be seeking to foster as part and parcel of promoting world trade and development is our own overseas investment; investment by Australia in foreign countries, particularly in the south and east Asian regions. To assist in and foster the activities of Australian enterprises in this process is, I suggest, a proper role for the Australian Industry Development Corporationeven an expanded AIDC-bu t not, I believe, I am greatly in favour of the fostering of words when discussing his visit to South Korea-'the Republic of Korea. He declares it I had proposed to refer to the Minister's Minister. To return to the main theme, the Tokyo meeting was the beginning of a round of negotiations which is to be the successor of the earlier and very successful Dillon and Kennedy rounds. I wish the Minister a successful participation in what I hope will be a successful round of negotiations. If they succeed, the end result will most likely be a never-ending round of negotiations designed to combat barriers to trade between nations, with permanent machinery to deal with specific problems. If they should fail, there is a strong chance that the world would break up into rival protectionist groupings to the detriment of the whole world and not least of the developdevelopment. The Minister for Overseas Trade ing world which is close to the interests of both the Minister and myself. Mr O'KEEFE (Paterson) (8.50)I desire to take part in this discussion on the statement which has been made by the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr. J. F. Cairns). I note with great interest his journeys in Japan, Korea and China and the discussions that he has had with the leaders of those countries. Japan, of course, is one of our most important customers. I have had compiled for me our latest tradefigureswith Japan. For the year ended 30 June last Australian exports to Japan were worth $1,933,946,000. This figure represents a tremendous increase over the previous years. We purchased in return from Japan $738,633,000 worth of goods. So there is an imbalance in our trade with Japan, and I have no doubt that the Minister discussed this point with tbe Japanese. It would be a mistake to believe that the guidelines. I am sure he will have an attentive Minister's statement represents the established audience. Will he reiterate to the Japanese views of the Australian Government. It could the attitude of the Minister for Overseas Trade be even more of a mistake to assume that the that direct Japanese equity investment is perMinister for Overseas Trade was able on his missible in our minerals and energy industries? trip overseas to speak with authority about Will he assure the Japanese in his incomparthe Australian Government's policy. As a result ably soothing manner that we recognise the it is difficult to distinguish in this statement importance of the unimpeded supply of raw between official thinking and the personal inmaterials? I do not think so. clination of the Minister. This uncertainty is understandable and well founded.

He admitted that the Government market for motor vehicles in Australia is would wish to see a high level of Australian limited. There is competition between domestic ownership, especially in uranium, oil, gas and coal. His message was one of qualified assurance and reassurance. Unfortunately there seems to be very poor liaison between the Minister for Overseas Trade and his less communicative colleague, the Minister for Minerals and Energy( Mr Connor). The Minister for Minerals and Energy will be visiting Japan in the very near future and he has said that all overseas investment in minerals and energy enterprises must be channelled through the Australian Industry Development Corporation. He sees no need for Japanese participation in the Pilbara development or the Redcliffs said in his statement: I see this concern for assurances with respect to the supply of raw materials as a legitimate concern on the part of the Japanese and one in which this Government is prepared to co-operate fully in helping to meet. Once again there seems to be a breakdown in Cabinet communications. The Minister for Minerals and Energy is refusing the export of natural gas from the North West Shelf. We all know that. The Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) defends action which prevents the securing of long term contracts for uranium exports from the Northern Territory to Japan. We thus have a very peculiar position of a Minister for Overseas Trade preaching goodwill and reassurance in Tokyo while his Cabinet colleagues back at home undermine his efforts. The Japanese are now in for an instructive lesson in open government. Labor style. The Minister for Minerals and Energy intends to embark on a lecture tour of Japan to explain his policy While in Japan the Minister for Overseas manufacturers in this country and importers those of the Chinese Communist Government of cars from overseas.

This has been the pattern of their operation over many years. In carrying the argument a little further, it follows Australian trade policy. To compound the confrom what the Minister implied that those fusion the Minister for Overseas Trade said governments that have similar philosophies to on 6 September this year that the Government The Minister for Overseas Trade may be of concluding a massive industrial agreement. Overseas Trade to establish the facts. Perhaps one of the most controversial aspects of his I referred earlier to the confused state of might set up an overseas trading organisation to buy Australian products and sell them overseas. Exactly what does this mean? The confusion is understandable when it has been previously thought that one of the key roles of the AIDC was the channelling of the flow of exports to developing countries. Exactly where does the shadowy Minerals and Energy Authority fit in with the concept of the Minister for Overseas Trade of the Australian Government influencing the flow of exports to see that the poorer countries are treated fairly? What a confused perception of Australian trade policy must exist overseas as Government leaders and officials attempt to untangle the tangled web of Government policy statements and Ministerial pronouncements. I would, however, wish to assure the Parliament that the Minister for Overseas Trade, although not consulted about the latest revaluation of the dollar, is well able to speak with full authority on Government policy regarding multi-national corporations. He made considerable mention of these organisations in his statement and I feel that his speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Sydney recently must be taken as the definitive Government statement on this matter. On this occasion he said to assembled businessmen on this matter: This is too short a period for us to be able to tell an incredibly high tariff barrier against the you what we want. We will be able to show in 12-18 months what we want you to do. He concluded on this reassuring note: Australia has been too predictable in the past; this is not the case now. I think that excerpt from his speech is a fitting this country? These are tangible demonstracomment on Government policy towards multitions of the credibility of the 2 statements in national corporations in particular and on trade the Minister's report. and investment in general.

F. Cairns). He made a point of the idea that products and processes were moving from Japan to Australia. He criticised the Minister's statement on the ground that there was no demonstration of such a movement. Obviously he has not heard of the processes which are taking place in regard to the longest commodity trade relationship which we have with Japan, and that commodity is wool. The Japanese top makers are now moving in a very material way into this country. In fact, they have invested money in a top making mill at Orange. We can expect to see similar things happen with minerals in the various intermediate stages of processing in that industry as our relationship in this area develops. Again the honourable member for Berowra criticised the statement in the Minister's report of his overseas trip about the enterprise systems of the developed world being noncompetitive. Has the honourable member for Berowra forgotten, for example, that the European Economic Community has erected products of our farmlands here? Has he forgotten that the United States has had a tariff on wool for some time which discriminates against this very important export product of This statement by the Minister is, in many",83,Minister For Overseas Trade Trade Discussions

166,Mr Morrison (St George,"Minister forPapua New Guinea. These assets will become the property of the Papua New Guinea Government. The level and nature of the aid is evidence that the Government recognises the special place of Papua New Guinea in its policies. Many people in Papua New Guinea had been wrongly led to believe that self-government and independence would mean that Australia would be getting out and leaving Papua New Guinea in the lurch. The Government has demonstrated by its policies and practice that this is clearly not so. The normal grant aid to Papua New Guinea in 1973-74 will be $127m compared with $119,500,000 in 1972-73. This aid will assist the Papua New Guinea Government to finance important development projects as well as to complement vital services such as education, public health, and law and order. In addition, $51m has been provided for projects, in the main non-recurring, which are essential to the smooth handover and transfer of powers to Papua New Guinea. A total of $17m will be available to assist in the establishment of a Papua New Guinea Central Bank and a government commercial bank. Other special aid items include $1,650,000 for the construction of a new runway and associated work at Port Moresby airport; $lm for the cultural development program; and $5m for direct expenditure by Australian departments in Papua New Guinea. A large item in our aid to Papua New Guinea is for emoluments of the Australians who were appointed to the Papua New Guinea Public Service by the Australian Government and whose services will be required after self government and independence until Papua New Guineans are ready to take their places. The maximum number of Australians in the Public Service reached about 8,000 although from now on the number will decrease as the localisation program gets under way. At this stage when Papua New Guinea is in practice self-governing and only awaits amendment to the Papua New Guinea Act to become formally self-governing, it is interesting to recall the origin of Australia's policy for the development of Papua New Guinea. Nearly 28 years ago a former Minister for External Territories, Mr Eddie Ward, when introducing the Papua New Guinea Provisional Administration Bill, said: This Government is not satisfied that sufficient interest had been taken in the Territories prior to the ernment will live up to this assurance can bc Japanese invasion, or that adequate funds had been provided for their development and the advancement of the native inhabitants. The Government regards it as its bounden duty to further to the utmost the advancement of the people and considers that that can be achieved only by providing facilities for better health, better education and for a greater participation by the people in the wealth of their country and eventually in its government. Australian economic aid to Papua New Guinea for the past 10 years was provided largely as backing for development based on the concepts of a World Bank Mission of 1963. These concepts emphasised economic growth as a means of meeting the social needs and raising the levels of living of the people. One of the Mission's basic principles was that expenditure and manpower should be concentrated in areas and on activities where the prospective return was highest and this meant that the benefits of development did not reach quite a large number of Papua New Guineans. The Papua New Guinea Government is now rightly concerned about this and the present inequalities between rural and urban populations, between expatriates and Papua New Guineans, between Papua New Guineans and between districts within the country. It is preparing its own plan for development and has decided that there will be a change of emphasis. The new plan-the basic plan-is to improve the lives of all Papua New Guineans, not merely lo increase the gross national product. I support this aim which is consistent with views that we put forward in the Estimates debate on this subject in 1972. I repeat what I said then: I think it is about time we measured our achievements in terms of people and welfare and not money and statistics. The Australian Government is happy to support this basic purpose of the Papua New Guinea Government with an assurance of continuing economic aid. Our aid program for Papua New Guinea will be developed in cooperation and consultation with the Papua New Guinea Government. It will be worked out in the context of that Government's improvement program. It has always been Australia's aim that Papua New Guinea should, as soon as possible, achieve a much greater degree offinancialand economic viability than it now has, but the Australian Government has given the Papua New Guinea Government an assurance that, it is prepared to continue providing substantial aid not only up to independence but also beyond. The evidence that the Australian Govseen in the estimates which we are considering tonight. The degree of economic stability that Papua New Guinea has achieved is such that it was able to overcome the acute problems of thc past 12 months caused by the laying off of workers on completion of the construction phase of the Bougainville copper project, the very low world prices for rural products and the effect of the rearrangement of exchange rates of its trading partners and exports competitors. There were also difficulties resulting from hesitancy on the part of consumers and investors. By the second half of 1972-73 the economy had shown that jt could withstand these shocks without undue disruption and it could do this relying upon itself without any special outside assistance. With the improvement that occurred in world market conditions for coffee, cocoa and copra and the indications of restored investor confidence economic growth should resume its course. It cannot be denied that Papua New Guinea who is associated with these estimates. I refer to will still face difficult problems as do all other the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) who'vacates countries.

I not make the address that I had planned to do not want to spend a great deal of time on make. I want to take up one matter raised by what that gentleman said in a debate this the Minister for External Territories ( Mr morning about attitudes that I hold on foreign Morrison) and to compliment him on one poraffairs, but in a deliberate endeavour to mistion of his speech in which he said it is timeto use his words I think-that we should quote he used quotations for convenience and measure the effectiveness of aid as it relates in other erroneous manners, and in his conto people and their welfare and not merely by cluding remarks alleged that I was in favour statistics. Of course, that was said in this House of most of the areas in which he has been last year and it is being said increasingly operating as Minister for Foreign Affairs, around the world today. I would refer those leaving aside my criticism of the fracturing so charged within the Department of Foreign of relations with the United States, the United Affairs to take note of what is being said in Kingdom, Singapore, Thailand and numerous the international community on the question other areas of the world. He said that all of of assisting those in poverty throughout the the significant things the Government has done world. The basic problem of poverty and growth, as has been said by other people in the developing world, can frankly be stated very simply: The growth is not equitably reaching the poor and the poor are not significantly contributing to growth. It is time that those nations contributing to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development recognised that they must cease judging the effectiveness of aid programs on the basis of the percentage of the gross national product. The GNP was devised only to be a measure of the distribution of goods and services produced by an economy, and it does not relate to the sorts of needs of which I have just spoken. Perhaps one of the finest addresses in a continuing series that he makes was made on this very issue along these lines by the President of the World Bank Group, Robert McNamara, only last month.

167,Mr Peacock (Kooyong) (9.21),"The the position of Prime Minister, will workbut for which some elements in the Liberal Party had criticised the Government are, in fact, endorsed by the Liberal spokesman on foreign affairs. That is not true. I have referred to some of those areas in which I have been trenchantly critical of the Government, and the one for which he takes more credit than anything else-ChinaI would like to refer to very briefly now. Of course, as he said, I accept the fact of recognition of the People's Republic of China, and my Leader has said it and properly so. But we have been critical of the method whereby this Government recognised the People's Republic of China. Methods and style may not be important to some but in the area of diplomacy they are an innate part of foreign relations. Britain is in fact the only Western power which pledged to remove its officials from Taiwan; yet Taiwan had no consulates in the United Kingdom and therefore was not placed in the difficult position in which we placed her earlier this year. Other Western powers were not as discourteous or as undiplomatic and their diplomacy will pay dividends. They have not consciously made enemies in Asia. For example, the images of West Germany, Canada and Austria are therefore satisfactory. Cutting all ties with Taiwan was, to me, illogical. This Government has recognised 2 Vietnams, 2 Koreas, 2 Germanys and one China and has given no explanation for doing so other than it had to be done. Others maintained the link with Taiwan but this Government chose not to do so. Furthermore, Australian policy is out of step with nearly all South East Asian countries, a factor that is important to this side of the House even if it is not important to the Government. Three states-Burma, Laos and North Vietnamrecognise Peking. Four states-Thailand, Khmer, South Vietnam and the Philippinesrecognise Taiwan. Three others-Singapore , Malaysia and Indonesia-hav e Taiwan trade or consular office links. Enough said about the aspect of China.

How has this Government conducted its affairs in relation to Aboriginal welfare? Last week we saw demonstrations outside this Parliament which revealed just how much of this Government's policies are mere rhetoric but, as a consequence of that rhetoric, divisive; its policies have fractured relations around the world and have led to divisiveness within this country. The picture is one of muddled idealism, rhetoric and fractured relations. In regard to the most fundamental area mentioned by the Prime Minister before the election, we have seen the sacking of a Minister, namely the previous Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Order! I would remind the honourable member -that the estimates for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs have already been discussed. Mr Deputy Chairman, the Prime Minister has indicated to you that more than any other foreign aid program, Aboriginal affairs will be the thing upon which the people of Australia will judge whether foreign relations are effective or not. He went to the people on that basis. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN-You can work that particular part into the debate on these estimates. The DEPUTY CHAIRMANI will listen very attentively. One Minister was sacked. The permitted misuse and wastage of funds within that Department all flow over to the judgment which we were asked to cast on this Government's performance in foreign relations, and last week all members of this Parliament were greeted with screaming and frankly dissatisfied Aborigines.

These countries require The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Martin) -Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired. to the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs, I address myself in particular to the question of foreign aid. This is an area of Government activity which is of increasing importance. It is, indeed, appropriate that that should be the case. The need of the developing countries for aid and assistance from the developed countries is certainly no less today than it was a decade ago. Indeed, it could be said to be greater. Yet real per capita aid to these developing countries is declining rather than increasing. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in the area of official-that is, government-ai d by developed countries in the last decade the level of real per capita aid to the developing countries has fallen by 10 per cent. One specific example of that which has direct relevance to the current state of international affairs concerns aid to Palestinian refugees, of whom there are about one million living in United Nations refugee camps. They are currently subsidised at the rate of 5c a day, which is half of what the aid was in 1964 in money terms, with no allowance for any decrease in the purchasing power in the intervening period. At the same time as aid to developing countries is declining on a real per capita basis the gap between the haves and the have nots remain enormous and is in fact becoming much more extreme. The enormity of the gap is shown, by the fact that at the end of the United Nations first development decade-that of the 1960s-ther e were more than 50 countries with a gross national product per capita of less than US$200. Those countries contain 60 per cent of the world's population. On the other hand there were 26 countries with a gross national product per capita above US$1,000, but they contained only 25 per cent of the world's population. Australia's gross national product per capita at US$2,300 was the sixth highest in the world. The growing disparity between rich and poor is shown by the fact that throughout the first development decade the total world gross national product increased by the almost incomprehensible sum of US$1,100,000m. Of that enormous sum 80 per cent went to countries in which the per capita gross national product is already above US$1,000, that is, it went to 25 per cent of the world's population. Only a mere 6 per cent of that increase in the world's gross national product went to the countries in which the per capita gross national product was US$200 or less, that is, to 60 per cent of the world's population. Thus the countries with the richest 25 per cent of the world's population received 80 per cent of the increase whilst the poorest countries with 60 per cent of the world's population received only 6 per cent of the world's increased income. Deplorably, the situation will not be any different in the second development decade, that of the 1970s. The World Bank estimates that in the second development decade those 26 countries will again take 80 per cent of the total increase in the world's income. These figures provide irrefutable evidence of the need for a much greater effort to be made by the developed countries to assist the rest of the world if this trend to growing inequality is to be arrested in any way. But unfortunately it is highly unlikely that much of an effort will be made. The developed countries of the world have shown a marked reluctance to provide even that level of assistance which is necessary to achieve the very limited objectives of the second development decade. The international development strategy of the United Nations set a target for developed countries which provided for each such country's official aid to reach 0.7 per cent of its gross national product by 1975. This was considered to be essential if the growth rate",92,Minister For Overseas Trade Trade Discussions
172,Mr Willis (Gellibrand) (9.31),"In speakingobjective of 6 per cent per annum for developing countries was to be reached in the second development decade. However, the 16 countries which form the Development Assistance Committee of the OECDa Committee which is comprised of nearly all of the world's lem but, because of the tremendous size of its most developed countries-ha d reached an average level of official aid of only 0.34 per cent of their gross national product by the year 1972, that is to say, they were at only half the level which was being aimed for in 1975. I am pleased to say that Australia's figure was 0.61 per cent, afigurewhich was exceeded by only 3 other countries. Even more disturbing in relation to the general position is that by 1975, it has been estimated by the OECD, only 5 countries will have achieved the UN objective for all developed countries. They are Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Portugal. Denmark hopes to reach this figure shortly afterwards, as does New Zealand, which recently joined the OECD and announced its intention to raise its official development assistance to 0.7 per cent by the financial year 1975-76. I regret that unless present indications change Australia will not reach this objective until 1979 or 1980. On 24 May this year the Prime Minister distant future.

Although this means that we would achieve the objective by the end of the second development decade it still does not fully comply with the United Nations objective, which sets 1975 as the target year for this level of assistance. To my mind it is the excellent action it has taken in establishing of great importance that Australia becomes a task force early this year to review our one of the countries which will achieve the official foreign aid program.

The United States does have a balance of payments probgross national product, there is no hope of the United Nations target being anywhere near achieved unless the United States is prepared to arrange its affairs so that it does provide 0.7 per cent of its gross national product as official development assistance. The critical importance of the United States in this respect is shown by the OECD's comment that the average of 0.34 per cent for Development Assistance Committee countries in 1972 is unlikely to improve over the next few years, despite increased percentages by a number of countries. This, the 'OECD Observer' of August 1973 states, is largely owing to the lower disbursements that can be forecast for the United States'. I strongly urge the Government at least to adhere to the United Nations target and then to use its influence on other developed countries, particularly the United States, to make some effort to reach the 0.7 per cent in the not too There are a couple of other matters to which I would have liked to refer, but, in view of the time available to me, I must content myself with referring to only one of those items. I would like to congratulate the Government on efficiently utilised, particularly as 93 per cent of our aid is bilateral aid and therefore is not intends the agency to have a research and economic team, part of whose role will be to check that aid programs are working and that money and time has not been wasted. With the coming of self-government in Papua New Guinea and our continuing commitment to maintain substantial aid to that country, it is essential that our aid programs are rationally determined and efficiently administered. I agree with the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr appeared recently in the 'Financial Review*. Peacock) in his opening remarks when he said that the total amount of aid as a proportion of gross national product is not the sole determinant of a country's criterion for emcient use of its aid. It should also be supervised and administered in such a way that the aid is seen to be going to the best advantage of the recipient countries. briefly to the honourable member for GeUibrand( Mr Willis) regarding foreign aid. Of course, what he says in the main is perfectly true. But in my view-and I think that if he considers the matter further he will recognise this-the main contribution which the rest of the world can make to this problem is to liberate the trade of developing countries. As far as Australia is concerned, much has been done just lately. But what these countries face, above all is a denial of their exports to the markets of highly developed countries. We and others have opened our gates to some extent, but always with the proviso that we limit the total imports and we reserve our right to change the arrangements should this be embarrassing to any of our industries. Of course the wage rates in these developing countries are low. Thus, they appear, quite falsely overall, as dangerous competitors to many existing industries. I will not pursue this matter because the debate on this matter has been closed for the night. But what these countries need even more than specific nnancial contributions is the ability to earn their own living and to increase their income by exporting to other countries those things in which they have a relative advantage. That is the root of the matter. I rose chiefly to address my remarks to the at the time. But since then, there has been a serious declension which has taken place, as firm and economically sensible government. It mentioned by the honourable member for managed to conquer very largely the acute Kooyong( Mr Peacock) in our relations with problem of inflation in Indonesia at that time.

One that time, and still is-apparentl y it has been has to remember that these people are naturally forgotten since by him-that our most imporhighly sensitive to and very rightly scared of 16755/73-R -[92 ] tant relationship if we take all the countries of the world is that with our nearest neighbour Indonesia. Indonesia is a large country, rich in resources, and with a tremendous potential if it can enjoy stable, reliable, regular government for a sumcient number of years ahead. Our relations with Indonesia have deteriorated. Reference was made by an honourable member during question time to the article which That article said in substance what bas been going around the traps for some time-that the position of Australians in Indonesia has gone back and that we are no longer regarded in the same basic warm manner as we were a few years ago. We have received notable service in Indonesia from the Department of Foreign Affairs, including a number of quite outstanding ambassadors. They include men like Mick Shann and Mclntyre, who is temporarily the president of the United Nations Security Council. Over the years they have built up a tremendous personal relationship. The predecessors to this Government, of course, played an immense part at the time of the liberation of Indonesia just after World War II. But these relations, as the honourable member for Kooyong pointed out, depend very much on style. In this respect, headed by the Prime Minister, we have slipped back. This is largely because of the style of the Prime Minister. In everything, including diplomatic relations to which it is quite unsuited he likes drama, the big splash, the sensational reports, working up excitement and things of that character. This is in very ill accord with the current rulers of Indonesia. Unfortunately, their position does not seem to be understood clearly by members of the present Government and, even less, by some of their associates and friends. One has to remember that the present regime in Indonesia arose originally in sharp response to a communist coup. Many of the present rulers narrowly escaped having their throats cut on the night of the uprising. So their rise to power was based on a very fortunate escape",93,Minister For Overseas Trade Trade Discussions
173,Mr Bury (Wentworth) (9.42),"I will replycommunism. One may sit broadly on these matters. But with this tremendous movement which nearly took over Indonesia, the Indonesian authorities are very sensitive to relations with the People's Republic of China and with the rest of the communist world. They see, as other people see, that the current changes in China have brought about a much more civilised type of government, if we may call it that, which is anxious to converse and have relations on a broadening basis with the rest of the world. At the same time, that government, or its agencies, continue to stir up propaganda and which leave lasting smarting wounds in the above all to encourage revisionist regimes in the rest of the world. So the Indonesians do not quite understand our sudden love for the neo-communist international world. This makes them suspicious. Naturally, on that basis relations cannot proceed on the same basis of confidence which we have now built up over some years. The other things in which the Prime Minister indulged are also registering on the other countries of South East Asia. The Prime Minister's remarks about Thailand and his attitude towards the South East Asia Treaty Organisation sow doubts in the minds of all the people of this area. government in Thailand. member does not claim credit for the change of government in another country, does he? remarks which the Prime Minister has made, his influence is not likely to wax in Thailand or in any other country of this area. But the fact is that the attitudes of other countries towards us have, of course, been changed quickly. The government has changed and so has our posture. The Prime Minister has laid great stress on cultivating new relationships with African countries which in themselves, subtracting some of the notions that go with some of them, would be, per se, good things. But, in the United Nauons he has changed our posture and run along with the uncommitted countries, and he has been to the kinds of conferences in the world which are basically hostile to our way of life. No doubt those countries and the people at those conferences are pleased with him. Probably they are delighted. On the other hand, this has been done at the expense of our old solid friendships with other countries in South East Asia, particularly with Indonesia. In relation to Singapore and Malaysia, we have withdrawn our troops and so forth, thus leaving the feeling that we are unreliable people. When occasionally Lee Kuan Yew has pointed this out or our Press has pointed out the exchanges between the Prime Minister and Lee Kuan Yew, it has not interested the rest of the world very much. The Prime Minister says lightly and flippantly things minds of our friends in Malaysia and Singapore. When the Prime Minister engages in verbal thrust and tumble with Lee Kuan Yew, he comes out without many feathers left. When he is in this House, he turns his back on us and looks around to the cheering minions behind him-h e is like the Himalayas amongst the sand dunes in that outfit opposite -and it is very impressive. But the fact that as our Foreign Minister he is doing the same kind of thing when he goes around the world leaves a very bad impression with our friends in Asia.

They are splendid. I am glad of the activities of Amnesty and other organisations in ensuring that as few people as possible will be behind prison bars anywhere in the world.

181,Mr Hurford,"It was laid out by the samewill be familiar with that propaganda or, if they have not heard it, will understand it readily. The old Anglo-Saxon smoothies of the northern hemisphere have been too fond of whispering in the ears of New Zealanders just how uncouth and brash we are and how we should be left alone. This has left its mark on those strong Anglophiles of that other part of Australasia. I am getting away from my point. The point is that Australia-New Zealand relations have to be worked at-no t neglected as they have been until recently. The fact is that to date far too much emphasis has been put on trade. Here, we in Australia have nothing of which to be ashamed. In March of this year when the New Zealand Minister for Tradeand Industry, Mr Freer, and the Australian Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr. J. F. Cairns) reviewed the progress of the New ZealandAustralia Free Trade Agreement at a meeting in Wellington they reached agreement on retaining tariff preference by each country to the other. The need for this review arose out of the dismantling of the British preferential tariff system by both countries. The main basis of the Agreement was that Australia would preserve for New Zealand a margin of preference of 15 per cent in the Australian tariff while New Zealand accorded Australia a similar reciprocal benefit but only to the extent accommodation abroad and has put real presof a 10 per cent preference. This arrangement is one that should give a boost to New Zealand's trade with Australia. The trade relationships in themselves are not enough. The long and short of it are that there are over 2,000 items on the customs schedules which permit New Zealand goods to come into Australia free. In all, there are over 2,600 items on which a rate of 10 per cent or less applies to New Zealand goods and only about 540 which incur a rate of more than 10 per cent. I repeat that this trade relationship in itself is not enough. The It has been somewhat short of real progress. There was a real opportunity at the talks at Wairakei in September between businessmen and government officials from both couhtries. That opportunity was grabbed by the New Zealanders who have opened their borders to a marked extent, as long as Australian traders have been given the time to take advantage of these opportunities. But more than that is needed. I was delighted to learn from New Zealand's Prime Minister, Mr Kirk, while I was in New Zealand, that he is reviving his ideas of a few years ago of Australian and New Zealand parliamentarians and perhaps other parliamentarians, Ministers and backbenchers, getting together regularly. Bolder political decisions for our mutual benefit will certainly have to be made when we learn more about each other. The Prime Minister's idea was that the Nordic Council in Europe should be used as a model. One necessary addition is that we ought to commission now a joint economic study by our Public Service and economic research institutes as a background paper for this meeting of parliamentarians. They will then be able to make the important decisions for a significant leap forward in cooperation in our region, to our mutual benefit. Australia-New Zealand relations need a big leap forward. This will come only from political decisions of courage. Such political decisions will be made if we know each other better. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. wish to make a few comments on the estimates of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of External Territories. For the past 10 years there has been a marked expansion in our overseas posts. This has meant an increasing demand on the availability of sures on the Department of Foreign Affairs for personnel. The Department's estimates cover significant increases in the expenditure for both purposes and reflect the size of the demand. At a time when our overseas reserves are high, I believe that there is a necessity for us to acquire more satisfactory premises for those who are stationed outside Australia. I am appreciative of the measure of inflation in other countries as well as ours and the degree to which it is difficult to acquire adequate and suitable land. Yet one must be conscious of the fact that Australia's permanent interests abroad will best be served by having suitable accommodation and facilities in which to house those who serve this country outside its territorial limits. It seems to me that a number of disabilities apply to personnel in the Department of Foreign Affairs. I have often felt that the parallel service provided by the Department of Overseas Trade, as it is now designated, provide for greater flexibility of employment and for greater opportunity of studying and keeping up to date with the trends in Australia. I see some validity in a thorough",97,Minister For Overseas Trade Trade Discussions

183,Mr Sinclair (New England) (10.2),"Iexamination of the basis on which members of the Department of Foreign Affairs, particularly at the senior level, are employed. I believe that there is quite considerable merit in looking at the contractual basis on which our trade commissioners are employed. I believe that a number of persons could be employed advantageously to Australia in a similar way. I believe that if they were so employed we might be able to improve the general terms and conditions of some of those employees who are perhaps disadvantaged under the present structure of employment, as it is designated by the Public Service Board. I think it should be said that there often seems to be a need for a re-examination of the functions and the roles of those who are employed in some posts. I know that in an examination of departmental estimates it is impossible to identify and to examine adequately or fairly individual posts. As one who has been involved in a number of missions overseas on behalf of past governments, I believe that there is a necessity for us to ensure that the range of services provided and the personnel employed are matched by the tasks with which they are charged. I believe that in some posts there is a complete understaffing in some areas in which the posts could advantageously be augmented. In other areas I believe that posts are overstaffed, perthere are 3 areas which I believe we need to haps because of the necessity to employ local staff or those who are Australian based. In the employment of personnel in the Department of Foreign AffairsI believe that we need to get away from the present system which is tied exclusively to the Public Service Board and which, I suspect, places undue restraint on a department which has to exercise an increasingly important role in serving this country in future. Obviously there is insufficient time to deal with all the items in the estimates. However, I wish to refer briefly to some. I believe that the expenditure of $100,000 prior to the engaging of legal counsel and the obtaining of scientific evidence to submit to the International Court of Justice in an effort to halt the French nuclear tests in the Pacific was excessive when compared with the results achieved. I believe that the survey undertaken by the Australian Academy of Science was unjustifiably avoided. It certainly does not appear to have been taken into account by the Attorney-General (Senator Murphy) at the time he presented the Australian case at The Hague. I see the $100,000 as being excessive to the requirements of that submission. I welcome the increase which is to be provided for drug abuse control. I see this as an area in which international co-operation is absolutely essential. I believe it is unfortunate that we have not done more in that area in the past. I believe that in the aid field generally there are a number of items which need to be discussed. Firstly, I have long felt that we have in general provided a range of aid which has perhaps not always been used as advantageously as it might have been and that the terms and conditions on which it was provided may not have been justified. I suspect that we need some basis by which our foreign aid program can be assessed, in terms of the economic worth of the aid, in terms of the benefits to society-the benefits to Australia-and perhaps alternative ways in which money can be spent. I believe that, in the past, in a number of areas the aid, although certainly provided at the request of the recipient country, has been provided without any valid basis of determining whether the ultimate benefit to the community has matched the amount allocated in the Budget. While I will not now mention the individual schemes which are set out in the estimates, look at in particular. Firstly, I do not believe that our armed Services have been used or apparently will be used to the degree that they might to supplement our aid program. I understand that the Canadians, for example, use their Transport Command to ferry various items of aid to some recipient countries. I think that perhaps the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force could well be used for this purpose. I believe that in the Australian Army, particularly in some of the professional corps, such as the Army Engineers, the skills which are available for development projects of a civilian character in overseas countriesI am referring specifically to civilian aid-coul d be used at times when there is not a high defence risk in Australia. I suggest that there is merit in applying that reservoir of technological skill, professional ability and manpower in an area which could supplement our aid program. The second area of assistance relates to the Colombo Plan. I believe that it is perhaps time now for us to re-assess the direction of Colombo Plan aid. I know some of the difficulties that have ensued for students who have been educated in Australia under the Colombo Plan. I believe that in many ways this plan has been highly successful. But one, of course, cannot be unconscious of the dispute that arose between the Prime Minister of Singapore and Australia's Prime Minister( Mr education and communication. It is my intenWhitlam) at the last meeting of Commonwealth Heads of State held in Ottawa. I believe in general that times have changed to such a degree that we need to consider to a greater degree the measures of financial aid for educational programs in the countries of receipt of aid rather than in Australia. I think that there is a need for us to maintain an educational program in Australia but I believe that there is a need for us to ascertain overseas whether we could augment the character of our educational training and perhaps do more than we have done in the past. In the field of aid I believe that we could do far more by way of agricultural aid than we have done. Where agricultural aid has been provided, in many instances we have found that the nature of the Australian knowledge, skill and experience has been far more suitable in South East Asia in particular, but also in other areas of Asia, Africa and South America, than European skills which, of course, are not based on a climate similar to our own and where the nature of farming and pastoral conditions are so different. I have not referred to the Department of issues. This was the highest court of appeal in External Territories. The one item to which the world and perhaps the only regrettable I did want to refer briefly is the retirement feature of the whole incident was that the benefits to be paid to expatriate officers. These French failed to abide by the decision of the benefits have been increases very significantly Court and proceeded with the tests. Criticism this year.

It would be my hope that as a Government we shall reach the target set by 1975, which was the year suggested by the United Nations, and not by 1979 as is the present plan. I propose to refer briefly to the statement made by the Deputy Leader of the Country Party, the honourable member for New England( Mr Sinclair), in which he expressed concern in respect of the expenditure of $100,000 on the legal case put to the International Court of Justice in an attempt to stop the French nuclear tests in the Pacific.

The title of his Department is to be abolished and the bulk of his advisers will, I presume, become officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Minister will be operating under the Minister for Foreign Affairs and looking after the special relationships between the Australian Government and the Government of Papua New Guinea. Looking ahead to the next decade, I believe a number of things should be said to the MinisterI feel confident that he would not disagree with these things; I am not suggesting that he does disagree-in the hope that he will encourage the Government in Port Moresby to do all that it possibly can as speedily as possible to approach that wonderful light on the hill of economic viability.

However, from Australia's point of view there can be no doubt about the fact tralian underwriting for future economic development in the Territory are absolutely vital. I should like to repeat what I have said before. I do not wish to see the people of the Territory in the position where they have to waste money on military equipment. I believe Australians should have the courage, at least in relation to Papua New Guinea, to face the future and say: 'We will stand with you and by some formal contract we will undertake to look after your defence, internally and externally, over the next 15 years'. I know people are frightened, in this international world, to be as direct as that. I point out that I regard the manifestation of this fear as a little more servile than that type of independence which was being referred to by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Holt( Mr making a few theoretical points on the very ted maturity more than independence.

188,Mr Kerin (Macarthur) (10.33),"I intendIn short, I believe that our foreign affairs can now be run more by professionals and that some political moves will be more often postures for diplomats to use in their slow, constant task for negotiation, compromise and pursuit of international harmony. But I do not underrate the purely political moves. The slowness of foreign affairs is demonstrated by the way in which slogans attach to a world condition. If the condition changes quickly there is a long time before the change is perceived by the general community. Of more importance is that a certain stance by a major power or powers dictates events far beyond the time of the policy's currency but this also can be exploited beneficially. The latest slogan attaching to world conditions is that we have changed from a world strategic situation of bipolarity to one of multiand Indonesia played thefieldwithout the hope polarity. The accepted version of this is that the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics alone no longer dictate the pattern of events, and that China, the European Economic Community and Japan are now significant in the ordering of world affairs. I am not sure that Japan yet fits into the league of America, Russia and China. At the same time. I am of the opinion that forces other than military strength will be of more significance in the future. I do not believe that we have true multipolarity. We are certainly in a period of greatflux.I think it can be said that this politicalfluxdisplays on its diplomatic surface 3 interacting trends at present. Firstly, there is a breaking down of cold war coalitions; secondly, the rise of non-security issues to the top of diplomatic agendas, and thirdly, a diversification of friendships and adversary relations. These surface movements are evidence of very significant economic and social forces which, if successfully exploited by statesmen and diplomats, may change the ingredients of power itself in the future. Both the United States and the Soviet Union are not as concerned today if smaller countries formerly in their orbit in the 1950s and 1960s move to non-alignment, neutrality or even to other coalitions mainly because military technology has limited the need for forward bases, not only for strategic deterrents but also for combat and reconnaisance. The impact of technology on strategy is of fundamental importance, as I see it. Although Eastern Europe is retained by Russia as a wall, this is more for ideological and political reasons than for military reasons. Smaller nations have been allowed to pursue more pragmatic independent lines in economic negotiations, and freer play has been given to conflicts in this area. When previously protection against a military threat was the main concern, coalitions of nations held and the subordination of special economic, political and cultural interests to the requirements of common defence was readily accepted. Although these requirements have not passed they are and have been breaking up for a considerable time, and I even see this process extending to the Warsaw Pact countries in the future. The disintegration of global bipolarity has allowed greater interchange between countries formerly in the common defence bloc as before the superpower was always heavily involved. Previously non-aligned countries such as India of the long-run success that they now have. Thus more and more divergencies in world view or differences in social systems are insufficient to bar cordial relations among countries. If these tendencies continue to mature along the lines stated, an international system whose characteristics are grossly different not only from the bipolar world but also from previous balance of power relations could emerge in the 1980s. It is possible, but always recognising the possibility of unpredictable contingencies at the same time, that the nature of international power itself will change. If power is defined as the capacity of a country to influence other countries to accede to its objectives, then in a system characterised by multiple and cross-cutting coalitions formed around a variety of issues, mainly economic, the political currency of international power will be promissory notes on the lines of a wheeling and dealing operation-'We will support you on this issue if you support us on that'. The power maximising country would be the one that could most successfully negotiate a situation where its pledges always would be honoured and valued. But such a system would allow poorer countries to have increased bargaining strength in terms of tbeir own ability to form coalitions. Although hitherto power has been in the form of promises to apply or withhold military capabilities-thi s still would be paramount in vital security issues-thi s will have little utility compared with other forms of power, even a negative effect, in bargaining over non-security issues. The threat of the use of military power may debase one's bargaining currency. Although America and Russia still will be best placed to be the most powerful, due to their control of resources, it will be constructive co-operation with smaller countries that will win them more votes in global and regional forums. The European Economic Community could well emerge as an equally powerful unit due to its techno-economic capability, cultural ties, geography and diplomatic skills. For example, the EEC can form a better bridge with the Eastern European countries and is well placed to develop its former colonies in Africa. Japan will remain behind the bigger three as it is resource dependent but the gaining of military capability will not help it. In fact, Japan is maximising power in future terms as I see them by skilled resource diplomacy. Japan has not the advantages of the European Economic Community in terms of historic community ties. To escalate a dispute over economic matters would surely alienate a larger number of her suppliers. China also will have to rely on skilful diplomacy rather than an exchange of material assets. It may be able to champion third world countries and be their nuclear leader, but the limits of this will be the degree to which the other 4 great power blocs provide assistance to them. China can be expected to try to drive wedges between East Europe and the USSR for world communist leadership. But China will never be a large enough market or source of products to exceed most other regional groupings which will arise. I do not think that we will have a five sided balance of power, because the usable kinds of power are not commensurate. China and Russia pose the only serious military threat to world stability at present. In nonmilitary terms, the USSR and the Comecon countries are more in need of commerce than vice versa. Yet socialist countries may be able to manouvre more quickly in many commercial matters. There will be an enormous need to settle questions of access to space, ocean environments and ecological standards. So rather than multi-polarity which implies in this debate, so I will introduce my topic hegemony, I believe we shall see a full blown with a few words now. I agree that we must system of multiple interdependence where look always to Australia's interests first in power is exercised largely in the form of conregard to foreign policy. But there are certain structive exchanges of valued resources. The matters in respect of which Australia's interthreat to this proposition, of course, is still the ests are inextricably bound up with the interflashpoints present in the world's trouble spots, ests of all mankind. I am afraid that we overfor instance, the United States of America in look the fact that, when we are speaking of South East Asia, the USSR in Czechoslovakia power in the world now, foreign policy comes and the Middle East-al l of which are well down still to nuclear policy and to the possesknown to us. Great responsibility rests on the sion of the weapons which dictate the power United States and the USSR to exercise self restraint in their future demands, otherwise Japan, India, Brazil and other countries will go nuclear. The wealthiest countries will have to refrain from establishing competitive spheres of economic dominance in the countries that they will influence. Leading economic countries will have to allow more interdependence to develop amongst lesser countries. The world's rich will have to do a little more about the world's poor and new sets of international laws on environment and conservation issues will be needed. All that I have said sounds rather idealistic. But the stark alternatives and conditions to which I referred earlier give some reason for hope. If we cannot break away from the anachronistic habits of the past 300 years of international politics all we face is more bloody wars with the final conflict merely forestalled for 20 years. It should be obvious from what I have said that Australia has a place in the world community where it can act constructively without assigning itself a role which becomesfixed.We are now exercising our diplomatic skills in attempting to form new coalitions. We are aware of the resource diplomacy game iand our mutual interdependence with Japan. We are trying to extend more aid to developing countries. We are taking a lot more notice of the use and benefits of the United Nations. We are now in a better position to influence the United States of America, as a sympathetic and constructively critical friend. We simply do not want the United States to kill people in our region for the sake of our own too easily developed sense of reactionary ethno-centricity. It is for those reasons that I am so hopeful for the continuing success of our foreign affairs, our policy initiatives and Australia's future in a hopefully more peaceful world. Not much time will be available for me this evening to develop what I would like to say",103,Nafta Relationship Has Been In The Doldrums

When this debate is resumed I shall draw attention to what has been said by Sir Philip Baxter in this regard, when he pointed out that at the present moment there is a great deal of being 15 minutes to 11 o'clock and in accordance with the order of the House of 1 March, I shall report progress. Progress reported. Tibet-Opening of the Sydney Opera House question: That the House do now adjourn. wish to take this opportunity to make a constructive suggestion to the Prime Minister( Mr this House would be a good way of establishWhitlam) who, I understand, is to go abroad shortly to represent Australia in various countries and particularly in Communist China. As he says that he is a friend of all oppressed people, I suggest to him that he ask his good and trusted friend, the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, to arrange for a deputation from this Parliament to visit Tibet. Mr Speaker, as you know, a great many stories are current about what has happened in Tibet. Some people say that there has been genocide on a grand scale, if 'grand' be the right word. Some people say that the Chinese communists have obliterated the Tibetan culture. There is some evidence for that in the fact that the Dalai Lama has had to flee his country and take refuge overseas. The stories we hear are shocking beyond belief, but we cannot verify them because nobody is allowed to go to Tibet. I suggest that, if the Chinese communists want to clear their name, if they want to put an end to these stories if they be untrue, they and not just against the things which they have a very simple remedy. They should allow a deputation of members from both sides of this House to visit Tibet, with the necessary interpreters, and to see for themselves what has been happening there. If a communist country, or indeed any other country, holds incommunicado for many years a large section of the territory which it claims-as far as Tibet is concerned there is some reason to think that the claim is not a justified claim but in point of fact is a claim of aggression-that country leaves itself open to all sorts of suspicious if it refuses to allow objective observers to visit and to report atfirsthand. The Prime Minister considers the Chairman of the People's Republic of China his friend. He has spoken of him in the highest and warmest terms. If this friendship is really as deep as the Prime Minister has suggested and if the distinguished chairman of the People's Republic of China has nothing to hide, it will be a simple matter for the Prime Minister to ask him whether he would allow a deputation of members from this Houst to visit Tibet and, with the proper facilities for seeing affairs there, to observe for themselves what the conditions are. If it be true, as some people in China say, that the stories relating to Tibet are utterly unfounded, it would be good for everybody, including the People's Republic of China, for the truth to be reported. A visit by a deputation comprising members from both sides of ing the truth. I know that many of the members of this House who are associated with Left wing movements and have participated in communist led agitation have professed that they are in favour of all sorts of freedoms, that they are against all sorts of oppression and that they do not believe in genocide and murder. I am all with them on this. nationals like you. get no protection from the Chair when these kinds of remarks are made? I can understand how certain of the Left wing members of the Labor Party, who themselves have been associated with communist demonstrations, may feel a little tender on a matter like this. But if they are honest, if they really believe, as they say, that they are against all genocide profess to abhor in other countries which are not communist, they will come behind the suggestion that I have made and they, in their Caucus, will be asking the Prime Minister to allow a deputation to Tibet to take place. If the communists have nothing to hide they will welcome a deputation from a body as objective and as well thought of as this House.

In New South Wales there are only two rabbit breeding establishments which supply rabbits for research purposes and, it is understood that no new licences are to be issued as there is strong pressure in all States to discourage further development of the industry.

Experience years ago, when a commission was paid, showed that some licences were taken out primarily to obtain a discount on postage. In addition, some outlets acted to the detriment of Post Office operations.",109,Answers To Questions Upon Notice
