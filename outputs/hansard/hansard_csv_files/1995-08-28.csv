0,"Monday, 28 August 1995 Tory, Because It Takes Time To Grow Forests. It Seems That Some People In This Government, In The Carr Labor Government In New South Took The Chair At 12.30 P.m., And Read Prayers. Have A Clue That It Takes Time To Grow Trees. If You Start Harvesting Regrowth Forests Which They Could Be Harvested For Another 10 Years, That This House Expresses Concern Over The Future Of Australian Forest Families, Particularly In Having Said That, The Thrust Of This Motion New South Wales, Because Of The Uncertainty Relates To Forest Families, The Families Of Facing The Forest Industry. Timber Workers. I Want To Make A Fairly Detailed Statement Of Comments By A Bloke Mr Speaker, That Uncertainty Is Monumental. Called Bill Gilbert From The Bostabrick Mill, The Families Of Forest And Timber Workers Are Out From Dorrigo In My Electorate. The At Great Risk. The Reason They Are At Risk Is Problem, As He And All The Other Forestry Because Of The Policies Of The Present Federal Workers See It, Is Total Uncertainty For Forest Government. I Say With Respect To My Friend Families, With Absolutely No Resource Security. The Member For Eden","Monaro( Mr Snow) that I will make mention of that plantation report. with the exception of one or two enlightened You can put in all the plantations under the people in that government they are going out sun but unless there is resource security, of their way to destroy the forest industry and unless there is a guarantee of harvesting those they are being aided by the Carr government plantations, it is a wasted effort.
