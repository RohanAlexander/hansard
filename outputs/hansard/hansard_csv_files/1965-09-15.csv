Petition received. for the Interior a question. Is he aware of a report that a Japanese consular oflicial said in Sydney yesterday that many Japanese still think of Australia mainly as a land of sheep and kangaroos? If so, can the Minister say what steps the News and Information Bureau is taking to correct this unfortunate situation, particularly in view of the growing importance of relations between Japan and Australia? been brought to my notice. I should like to inform the honourable member that it was only this year that the News and Information Bureau established an office in Tokyo for the dissemination of information about Australia. One of the difficulties we have at this post is the problem of translating our information into idiomatic Japanese and of presenting speech on film. In Japan, there is a tremendous potential for the dissemination of information, but the language presents us with a very great problem. In that country there are something like 470 television stations, for instance, and it is a big job for any organisation to disseminate information on such a vast scale. However, we have plans for increasing the size of the office and getting the information out. directed to the Treasurer, relates to the introduction of decimal currency and suggestions that during the conversion period retention in circulation of the humble halfpenny, which would have no decimal equivalent, would tend to complicate our monetary transactions. I ask whether there are reasons, such as commodity pricing or other factors, why the halfpenny should not be withdrawn from circulation prior to C Day. been considered, and it is felt that the halfpenny should not be withdrawn from circulation before C Day. It will still have a use over the transition period, which is likely to last for about two years from C Day. It is true that there will be no precise equivalent of the halfpenny in our decimal currency. But neither will there be an exact equivalent of the penny or the threepenny piece. The withdrawal of the halfpenny from circulation would have the effect of forcing on shopkeepers, until the end of the transition period, a pricing policy that we consider it is not necessary to introduce. The customer should be able to obtain such benefit as will endure from the continuance in use of the halfpenny in pricing over that period. If the customer is in any doubt about the amount to be tendered, he or she can tender above the amount in some round sum and the storekeeper will oblige with the exact change in either decimal currency or the equivalent in the £ s. d. system. I know that in some minds there is a belief that there could be added confusion with the halfpenny in circulation, but I think we have a sufficiently intelligent Australian community to cope with this and the other problems that will arise when the new system is introduced. Minister: In his unceasing watch and ward to combat Communist subversion is he keeping a sufficiently eagle eye on the ministerial front bench?

What progress has been made towards the establishment of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation since the passage of the relevant Bill towards the end of the last sessional period? When is the Corporation likely to open its doors for business? assented to the Corporation was established and the Board, appointed. It has met now on a number of occasions. Recruitment of senior and, to some extent, junior staff has already begun. The Corporation has estabUshed offices in Sydney and Melbourne and it is in the course of negotiating for office space in Adelaide, Perth. Brisbane and Hobart. Senior staff have engaged in a series of discussions with lenders and other people whose activities and co-operation will be part and parcel of the whole scheme. At present it is hoped that the Corporation will open its doors for business about the end of November. ARMY INSTALLATION AT the Army a question. It is known that with whole cost of the project. the establishment of the proposed Army battle group in Townsville the City Council there will need additional funds for the provision of sewerage and water facilities for me whether, on the introduction of decimal the Army installations at Cluden and tbe (currency, the sales tax percentages will housing project. As the Council had not remain the same and whether such sales anticipated that development would protax should be taken to the next highest or ceed in these areas for some time, adequate to the nearest cent? provision had not been made for funds to cover the extensive work necessary. There is some concern that the costs of these installaing to sound in any way ominous about the tions may have to be borne by ratepayers matter, I point out that a government must in the Townsville area. I ask the Minister: Is the Commonwealth to assist in meeting the costs of these sewerage and water facilities and, if so, what proportion of the costs will it agree to contribute? In what way will these funds be provided? Is it proposed that all or some of thefinancewill be provided to the Council from funds allocated for the provision of the Army facilities, or will separate funds be made available to the Council to cover the cost of this work? Also member's question is far too long. I ask him to complete it. tice for the Commonwealth Government to make a cash allocation for the provision of sewerage and water for installations in an area where those things are under the control of a local government authority. The usual practice in these cases is for the facilities to be provided by the local authority out of loan funds made available to it and under the allocation control of a State Government. In the case referred to by the honourable member I understand that the Townsville Council has made an application to the State Government for funds and that provision has been made for the major share of the funds required for sewerage and water undertakings during the current financial year. I might add that if the Townsville Council decides to extend the sewerage works and main out to the university area adjacent to the proposed barracks area, because this will effect a saving for the Commonwealth, which will not have to establish a collector main in the barracks area, the Commonwealth will make a contribution to the Council to the extent of that saving.",14,Communist Propaganda

The present rates of sales tax-2 i per cent., 12i per cent, and 25 per cent -len d themselves quite conveniently to continuance in a decimal currency system. As to the treatment of fractions of a cent, the same practice will apply as currently applies to fractions of a penny. MrI . R. FRASER -My question to the Treasurer relates to a special allowance paid either as an attraction wage or as a bonus to employees in various categories1 understand up to the level of foremanat the Royal Australian Mint. Can the right honourable gentleman say what action has been taken or is contemplated on a request by technical officers employed in the Mint that this special allowance be paid also to them?

22,Mr Freeth,"Unfortunatel y there is aBANK. Mr O'CONNOR -I s the Treasurer conversant with the latest annual report of the Commonwealth Development Bank? Is he aware that the report shows that about £36 million was advanced to the rural sector and £12 million to the industrial sector? Is this ratio of 3 to 1 in favour of the rural sector due to more applications for such assistance being received from the rural sector or is it due to policy? If it is due to the latter, will the Treasurer consider increasing the capital of the Bank to enable it to meet more demands for industrial development? get a detailed explanation for the honourable member. Frankly, I did not appreciate that the ratio favoured rural lending as much as he has suggested. I knew there was preferment to rural borrowers in the Bank's lending policy. As the Bank has adequate funds available for lending purposes at present it would, seem that it has not had the same volume of inquiries from industrial borrowers.

Is he serious when he claims, as he did in the House a few days ago, that he places great reliance on the opinion of inhabitants of remote areas of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea that the Territory will not be ready for independence for very many years? If he is, does he intend to seek advice from the same quarter on which of the recommendations in the report of the International Bank for the economic development of the Territory and in the report of the Committee on Higher Education in the Territory should be implemented? opinions have to be considered with many other factors.

That is in the interests of the tenderers themselves. A great deal of cost and expense is involved in tendering for a major work. If, in the Department's view, a contractor is not of sufficient substance or is unlikely to be able to carry out the work, very often it is better for the Department to discuss the matter with the contractor before he goes to the expense of preparing a tender which would not be likely to be accepted.

BANK ORDER SYSTEM. recall that on 9th November last year, I asked him a question in connection with the collection of subscriptions by organisations on the well known bank order system? I asked whether banks would automatically make the change to decimal currency. The Treasurer prefaced his reply by saying: ""Generally speaking"". Four months afterwards, on 23rd March 1965, I tried to get something clearer from him, and the Treasurer replied in this wayI deliberately used the words ""generally speaking"" because it is not quite clear that the banks will automatically make this change. As six months have now elapsed, I ask the Treasurer whether he can clarify the position. another chapter to the serial, I can now say that the legislation which I shall be introducing later today-and an understanding has been reached with the trading banks -provide s that there will be virtually an automatic changeover in respect of bank orders except in the cases of those orders wbich include multiple payments and where that multiplicity of payments could produce a variation of the order of 2 cents.

The then Minister for External Affairs said that he had communicated his ideas to the High Commissioner for Pakistan, but nothing was said then or has been said since as to how Pakistan regarded that intimation. SoI think the House would like to know in this terrible conflict in which we do not want to be involved anyhow: Did Pakistan agree with the Australian contention that Australia would not be obliged to go to war in defence of Pakistan if Pakistan was attacked by any other Commonwealth nation or by any other nation? there was on record no explicit statement by Pakistan as to that country's interpretation of the South East Asia Collective Defence Treaty or any section of the Treaty. But the way in which Australia would interpret the Treaty was clearly understood by Pakistan in the negotiations leading to the drafting of the Treaty; it was clearly understood by Pakistan at the time of the signing of the Treaty and it has been clearly understood by Pakistan ever since the Treaty has been in operation. In fact, Pakistan has not invoked the Treaty in any request for Australian aid either in the past or in the present. Report of Public Works Committee.

It would be quite improper for the Government to indicate the place of a project in the construction programme before the Public Works Committee had reported on the proposed work. This would be a gross usurpation of the authority of the Parliament. In reply to fhe remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr which will be completely surplus Calwell), I point out that there is a statutory rule that building proposals and other works projects estimated to cost more than a certain sum must be referred to the Public Works Committee unless exemption is approved by the Parliament or, in the case of defence works, unless exemption is given by Order in Council. So the project in question must be reported on by the Public Works Committee.

65,Mr Reynolds (Barton) [3.26],"Iponents of the wool reserve prices plan have dwelt on two themes. One is ""Have Gunn Will Travel"", to which I would add "" to perdition "", and the other is the maintenance of silence when attempts are made to get information. Sir William Gunn showed a lack of dignity in his attack on the members of this House and it is regrettable that the Opposition should bring this matter forward because what the backbenchers of the Liberal Party did was most democratic and greatly to their credit. Had it not been for the 10 backbenchers of the Liberal Party the wool growers would not have had the opportunity to study the cases for and against the plan. Surely all honourable members will agree that what the backbenchers on this side of the House did was democratic. Why Sir William Gunn should attack them. I cannot understand, unless it be that he did not want the wool growers to know that there was a case against the plan as proposed. wards. Sir William has been most undigniobject to be auctioned, whether it be a cow fied in regard to this whole matter. When or a bale of wool, if the reserve price is challenged he rebuked people. The specnot obtained the auctioneer will not knock tacle of a man of his status and in receipt the article down. But under the proposal of his salary going around like a starting for this wool reserve prices plan the man price bettor and offering to lay wagers and with the mythical millions can attend an take the odds is not agreeable to anyone auction sale and, if the reserve price is in this House. It is unfortunate that the proposed plan ticular lot, can bid 52d. against the prehas not been set out in the Bill before the vious bid of 51d. and have the lot knocked House.

If that is a reserve price this would have been done and the memplan, I will go and jump into Lake Burley bers of this Parliament would have been Griffin. It is not a reserve price; it is a able to discuss the matter much more intelrestricted acquisition price. We have not ligently and with much more information heard any honourable member in this place, at their disposal. It is unfortunate that we and I have listened particularly to members have not been given this information, but of the Australian Country Party, say that we are told now that the proposed plan, brokerage and commission will have to be together with the cases for and against it, paid on the acquisition of wool. I ask the will be circulated to growers when the ballot honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) papers are sent out. The Bill before the to take note of that point. There is no doubt House refers simply to the referendum, and that the scheme will provide a bonanza for the plan on which the wool growers will be the wool selling brokers. It is no wonder asked to vote is incidental thereto although that 17 of them have agreed to the reserve it is the major concern of all of us here. As to the provisions for enrolment, 1 do not object to people with 300 sheep or producing 10 bales of wool having a vote provided that wool growing brings in the major commissions. portion of their income. But if wool growing is incidental to some other kind of farming then I believe that a farmer engaged in that kind of activity should not have a vote. I believe it is also unfair to give a vote to somebody who just happened to come into the game and buy 300 sheep at the appropriate time. There is another anomaly concerning partnerships. If two persons having equal shares in a partnership produce between them 19 bales of wool they will be precluded from voting. This is definitely wrong. If two people own a property and produce between them 19 bales of wool they should at least have one vote. This anomaly is to be deplored. Of course the Opposition supports this plan. It tends towards nationalisation and socialisation and any form of control of persons or property will always be supported by the Opposition. The plan is not, as stated in the Bill, a wool reserve prices plan but a restricted acquisition plan. I see Country Party members smiling. If any of them know anything about auction sales they will be aware 52d. and has not been obtained for a parprice plan.

On this transaction brokerage or commission will have to be paid and there will be handling charges. Then thc wool will be put into store and there will be more charges. Then, when the authority believes that the time is opportune, it will bring the wool out of storage and put it up for auction again. At a second auction the authority still may not be able to sell wool which could not be sold on the first occasion. It may be wool of a type that the manufacturers do not want at that particular time. It is possible that, although it may not be inferior wool, it will at that time be unmarketable wool. But it will be brought out again, and again it may have to be acquired. This is not a reserve price plan. the attitude of overseas buyers, and we If the wool has to be acquired again, the brokers will get their commission.

Another speaker who did well in a restrained manner was the honourable member for Riverina( Mr one way. If there is to be a reserve price Armstrong). In his desire to play fair he requested that we who do not agree with the scheme refrain from expressing our view. Although a wool grower may do a very good job in producing fine wool, in many cases he would know little about the marketing of his product. It is for that reason that honourable members who are able to advise the wool growers should do so. without fear of Sir William Gunn or anyone else.

But according to most honourable members who have spoken the only person to be considered is the wool grower. As I pointed out earlier, this is not a reserve price plan. We should envisage the attitude of the buyer who, after bidding perhaps 51d. per lb.,findsthat the wool is knocked down at 52d. per lb. to the wool authority. What do honourable members think the buyer's reaction would be? Anyone who has had experience of buying and selling at auction would know that if that happened to them as individuals they would never again engage in or attend a sale conducted by that auctioneer. I have had such an experience when buying cattle. On one occasion I was the last bidder but I found later that the auctioneer had sold the cattle privately to someone else. I never did business with that man again. This will be cannot blame them for having that attitude. If they come to Australia and bid legitimately at an auction, but are frustrated by the buyer from the authority, they will not be very pleased. Under the proposed plan a wool grower who sends in wool that does not fetch the reserve price will be paid at the reserve price, less brokerage, commission and handling charges. But when the wool i's brought out by the authority and sold at a profit, the wool grower will not benefit. In amount of capital will be subscribed to make the scheme function. For a scheme such as this to be successful it cannot operate all below which wool cannot be sold, then in all fairness there should be a reserve ceiling price. We cannot have it just to suit ourselves. The scheme is not a business proposition and, although I hate to use the phrase, it is "" cockeyed and stupid "".

70,Mr Irwin,"They may get three.In the time left lo me 1 shall examine the Minister's speech. It appears to me, from what I can learn about the selling of wool, that forward buying and futures dealing will be difficult. If the money that is being supplied were used advantageously by the authority in forward buying and futures dealing then it would be of immense benefit and advantage to the wool growers. I am certain that we have in Australia people who could match their brains in this department with any of the forward buyers or futures dealing people from overseas. I stress that we have not the plan before us, nor bas it been tabled, and this is why I want now to refer to some of the facts brought out by the Minister. He saidThe principal objective of rhe reserve price scheme additional financial backing of up to £50 million. is to reduce extreme downwardfluctuationsin the price of wool and so protect growers against exceptionally low returns. By setting a limit to price fall, the scheme engenders greater confidence among wool users and assists in creating a more stable and stronger demand for wool. Tn essence, a reserve price scheme involves fixing a minimum level, also called "" floor"" or "" reserve "", below which prices at auction are not allowed to fall. This is achieved by establishing an authority which purchases any wool for which commercial bids in the auction fail to reach the reserve price. Such wool is held by the authority and resold under more favorable conditions. I want to know why the wool has to be purchased and resold and all this formality engaged in. Why cannot a reserve price be placed on it and if the reserve is not reached the purchaser be informed of the reserve price. In all probability, in nine cases out of ten, he would accept the reserve price. Regarding financial arrangements, the Minister saidIn addition to their contribution towards the capital of the scheme, growers will pay a small levy to build up a contingency fund. This fund will be used in meeting the operating costs of the scheme to the extent that these costs cannot be met from profits made on the resale of bought-in wool and from rental income of wool stores at present under the control of the Wool Board. Under normal circumstances, the rate of levy paid to build up a contingency fund should not be high and the initial levy should not be more than i per cent. The rate would be reviewed annually in the light of actual experience and the stage could be reached where in some years no levy would be required because of the contingency fund being at a sufficient level. This is the point I want to stressThe levies paid by wool growers for the capital of the scheme and for the contingency fund would be collected as part of a combined levy not exceeding 3 per cent, of the gross proceeds of wool sold. This combined levy would cover not only the growers' contributions for the capital and the operating costs of the scheme, but also their commitments for promotion and tbeir current contribution for research. The3 per cent, will not possibly finance tbe scheme. I understand that previously 7 per cent, was the suggested figure. The Minister also saidAfter reaching the level of £30 million by accumulated wool grower contributions, interest earnings and net profits, the capital fund would be revolved. However, only the amounts actually contributed by wool growers by way of levy would be repaid to them under the revolving arrangement. By way of explanation, I make tbe point that interest or profits from other sources would not be repaid to the growers. Apart from the growers' capital fund of £30. million, the scheme would have ready access to The Executive of the Wool Industry Conference is at present negotiating with trading banks regarding the possibility of these banks providing some or all of this additional backing. If it proves impossible to arrange this finance on terms acceptable to both the banks and the Wool Industry Conference, the Government will be prepared to make the funds necessary available from its own sources. I do not think we can count on the trading banks letting £50 million lie idle while '.his scheme is getting under way. It would be both improvident and foolish for them to do so; the £50 million could be far better used until the scheme is well under way. The Minister then saidThe Wool Industry Conference suggested that the scheme should have access to a total financial backing of £80 million. However, the Government considers that the scheme should have available to it unquestionable financial backing and accordingly has guaranteed the provision of finance in excess of £80 million for the buying in of wool if this should ever be required. So we can see that the Government is prepared to throw in an unspecified yet big amount for this scheme. I wholeheartedly agree that it is necessary to have some scheme to bring about the stabilisation and rationalisation of the wool industry, but surely there must be a better scheme than the one suggested. member have in mind?

72,Mr Irwin,"I have something in mind.better classing and better presentation. Italy could not come here during the last season and purchase our wool because of its balance of payments position. With all the millions of pounds that will be provided for this scheme, would it not be better to give some financial assistance to Italy by selling our wool to her on terms? This would be a better use for the money than defeating our prospective buyers at auction. Would it not be better to offer some inducement to overseas buyers who are short of ready money? After all, balance of payments difficulties mostly appear for only a transitory period. They pass after a while. If we were to offer some financial assistance to buyers who were suffering from such difficulties, we would help to bring stability to the indusIndustry Act of 1962. The Wool Marketing try and would be engaging in better promotion and marketing arrangements. I cannot agree with all the points made by the honourable member for Mitchell( Mr with a practical knowledge of the industry, Irwin), at least I must say that, despite his criticism, he did try to make some constructive suggestions. Whether these suggestions are practical is another matter. The purpose of the legislation is merely to report of the Wool Marketing Committee. provide for a referendum to be held amongst The honourable member for Parkes( Mr wool growers to ascertain whether they Hughes) has been active in seeking informawant a wool reserve prices plan.

They came back to the Government at a later date and asked for an inquiry into t'he industry. As a result, the Philp Committee was set up. This Committee made a valued study of the industry and recommended that an Australian wool commission be set up. It was constrained to mention at that time that the industry lacked a voice. Finally, The Australian Wool growers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat' Producers Federation formed the Australian Wool Industry Conference, from the members of which came the statutory body known as the Australian Wool Board. The Board set up a Wool Marketing Committee under the provisions of section 25 (1) of the Wool Committee investigated the possibility of a change in the marketing system and, after study, reported to the Board. The Board then presented proposals to the Australian Wool Industry Conference and the Conference, made up of wool growers accepted this report by 45 votes to 5.

73,Mr Nixon (Gippsland) [3.56],"WhilstI am not happy about one feature of the Australian Wool Industry Conference and that is that a great many wool growers are not represented on that body. I have said this before in the House. It is my belief that the Australian Primary Producers Union should be represented. The Union has made its own study of the wool reserve prices plan within the free auction system and has come out in support of the plan. The Union has been kept out of the Conference for reasons that have been said to be somewhat frivolous, but I believe that the Union deserves a voice on the Conference. This is particularly so when we see members of the constituent bodies of the Conference deserting their representatives when the wool reserve prices plan is being considered. The Philp Committee made many findings about the reserve prices plan, and these have been used as a basis for opposition to the plan. I would therefore like to take a look at tbe report of the Philp Committee. The Australian Wool Board has said quite freely, openly and often that fluctuations in price are bad for the industry, both for growers and users. The Philp Committee dealt with fluctuations. At page 23 of its report, it saidThe merchant and topmaker see in price fluctuations the opportunity to make additional profits through skilful buying and selling. It also made a comment that is important because it deals with the manufacturers. The Committee saidKnitters and weavers prefer stable prices for the obtained in the last two seasons rather than yarns which they use. Dealing with wool growers, the Committee said. . . . stabilization of prices would be an advantage to the woolgrowing industry and is a worthwhile objective. At page 24, the Committee referred to manufacturing companies and saidThe larger vertically integrated organisations in the reserve price organisation. thewool textile industry generally prefer wool price stability. They are primarily concerned with the management of their capital and labour and changes in the valuations of their inventories can be embarrassing. It is quite interesting to note that in paradevelopment of Australia. The Philp Comgraph 108 the Committee reported that the mittee, in its report, expressed the feeling West German weavers were concerned that the auction system was the best and about price instability and asked that a most efficient means of disposing of a large study be made of price stability. In this paragraph, the Committee also said. . . . the National Hosiery Manufacturers' Association in the United Kingdom favours price stability. Two of the largest hosiery manufacturers in the United Kingdom stated to the Committee that price instability was a deterrent to their use of wool . . . . Even at that time, price fluctuation was causing worry. At page 24, under the heading "" Summary and Conclusions"", the Committee saidWool price fluctuations must be regarded as a disadvantage to the use of wool in competition with the more stable-priced synthetics. The Philp Committee submitted its report in 1962. At page 7 it listed fluctuations in wool prices from 1951-52 to 1961-62. These fluctuations are as followsPer rent. Season. Annual Change. 1952-53 .'. + 13.0 1953-54 . 0.4 1954-55 . -13. 0 1955-56 . -13. 3 1956-57 .. +29.6 1957-58 . -21. 6 1958-59 . -22. 2 1959-60 .. + 19.0 1960-61 . 9.9 The House can see that there has been a great deal of fluctuation in the price of wool. The Philp Committee, at page 25 of its report, said-thi s is very relevant to the argument about fluctuations-that in June 1961 the International Wool Textile Organisation decided that it would "" prefer to suffer such a range offluctuationsas has face the uncertainty arising from the accumulation of stocks in the hands of a marketing authority"". It is interesting to note the price fluctuations in the two seasons that were mentioned. In 1959-60 the price was 57.78d. and in 1960-61 it was 52.06d. The handling of a range of 5d. ought to be well within the competence of I have a great respect for the auction system. I also have a great respect for the wool firms and stock firms.

75,Mr Nixon,"That is paragraph 107. estimate the value of the wool firms in theparcel of wool. It also recognised that seasonal factors mitigate against an even flow of wool. The Committee said that the auction system permits merchants to buy at low prices to hold wool until the demand strengthens and then to make a sale. Merchants also have the ability to hedge their purchases through the futures market. The Philp Committee said, at page 25 of its report, that the merchants, by their very operations, tend to create price fluctuations. The Philp Committee went on to deal with firm offering, forward selling and private treaties. It was worried about each of those matters and their effect on the price of wool. Finally, the Committee decided that there was no need to change the marketing system. The Committee was also worried about the operation of pies. At page 34 of its report, it saidThe Committee has formed the opinion that, pure assumptions. The first item in it while the effect of pies and lot splitting in reducing readsprices is not great, they do have a depressing influence on the market.' So, the Philp Committee was quite alarmed after about all the various forces that are at work tion of a large wool stockpile. in the wool industry and their effect on the wool market. Finally, it decided against alteration of the present marketing system. That decision was made after anxious consideration. It is quite obvious that the Committee gave anxious thought to whether or not it should recommend some change, and finally came down on the should-not side. Farmers and graziers throughout the electorate have been asking this question: Why should there be a change now? This question has been dealt with quite effectively by the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Mackinnon) and the honourable member for Wannon( Mr industry. First, I suppose that we all are Malcolm Fraser). They pointed out that the lifting of patent rights has freed the sales of artificial fibres. Artificialfibresare not controlled now. They are in easy supply. Therefore, price fluctuations affect more and more the sale of wool to manufacturers who are able to buy artificial fibres at stable prices and at regular intervals. The reason why there has been vertical integration in the manufacturing industry is that manufacturers who use wool have found that they have had to integrate in order to get rid of the middle men-the dealers and merchants-and so lower their costs. I wish to evaluate some of the questions that arise in the minds of growers. I suggest to growers that they should have the following points in mind when they are considering whether they should vote for or against this scheme. The Australian Wool Board has said that it recognises that there are risks involved in the scheme. As soon as it said that, there was great criticism of it for making that admission. I think there would have been more criticism of the Board by the growers if it had not recognised that risks were involved. At least we know that the Board is aware of the risks and can take precautions against them. Yesterday we saw the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Hughes) present a petition in the House. I point out with great respect to the growers who signed that petition that, in my opinion, the so-called facts in it are If an error were made infixingthe level of the reserve price, or if through an unforeseen event it had been fixed, the reserve price was too high, the probable result would be an accumulaHaving made that assumption"" if an error were made ""-the petition goes on to sayThe existence of such a stockpile would necessarily limit the freeflowof wool to world markets. A limitation on the free flow of wool would cause the demand for wool to be further 'diverted to synthetic fibres. No one challenges that, if the assumption proved to be correct, the consequences referred to in the petition might follow. WhatI challenge is the assumption that the Wool Marketing Authority will be so far out in fixing the reserve price as to enable those consequences to follow. Let us look at the position of the wool optimistic that wool will retain its position among the world'sfibres.If it does retain its position, that must lessen the fear that the people who signed this petition have in their minds about the possibility of fixing an incorrect price. After all, about 3,000 types of wool are sold from the wool industry. Let us not forget that already, in respect of many of those 3,000 types, reserve prices are fixed by the owner or the wool brokers. I know from personal experience that, in respect of much of this wool, the reserve price isfixedcloser to the actual price than it would be under a conservative reserve price scheme. It is obvious that within the industry itself, and particularly in the wool firms, there are plenty of experienced valuers who could assist in fixing the reserve price. Fixing the reserve price may involve a risk, but there will be a greater risk to the whole of the Australian economy if wool loses its value. If that happened the whole economy would be in danger. Finally the petition statesFunds which should be and would be better is spending a lot of money should also conused for research and promotion would be applied sider what the opponents of the scheme are to financing the proposed scheme. Are the growers who signed the petition thousands and thousands of pounds. I think suggesting that if this scheme is defeated that the validity of the arguments used in they would like to see another £4 million these advertisements is very much open to spent on research and promotion? I ask this question. I believe that the opposition to this question: Has there not been a fair bit of scheme is coming from some merchants and criticism already about the spending of speculators who know that if a reserve price money on promotion? One of the major fears that some wool growers bave-thi s fear has been added to outside the House and it was referred to honourable member for Parkes. more directly, by inference, last night-is the fear of acquisition. This possibility has been denied time and time again. Mr A. R. Beggs, a Victorian member of the Austration has been spearheaded by three of the lian Wool Board, when speaking at Yarram wool brokers. I think that the honourable in my electorate, said, as reported in the member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) and the "" Yarram News ""Opponents of the reserve price plan have claimed with the vested interests opposing the that the plan would lead to an acquisition scheme and to Government control of the wool industry. scheme. Wool growers should study the These issues have been raised by a minority excellent speech of the honourable member of bitter opponents of the plan who are trying for .Wannon and also the speech of the tb discredit the integrity of the Australian Wool honourable member for Lalor. I believe that Board for their own purposes. The Board is confident that thinking growers will growers considerably in forming their treat such claims with the contempt they deserve. Mr Beggs comes from a very well known Moore( Mr Maisey) also made an excellent family in Victoria and is a highly respected contribution to the debate and wool growers member of the community. The possibility should study his speech too. of acquisition has been denied also by the Chairman of the Australian Wool Board. He has said again and again that this scheme mittee had to consider anxiously any cannot lead to acquisition and that there recommendation for a change in the present will be no further changes to the scheme system, the Australian Wool Board had no without reference to the industry. I suggest to wool growers that when they quite obvious that the Philp Committee, are trying to make up their minds whether when anxiously considering this matter, was they will vote yes or no for this scheme not sure that it was making the right that they should have a look at where the decision, but the Wool Board, having in opposition to the scheme is coming from. mind the changed circumstances of the It is quite obvious, from the money being present time-and we are living in changing spent on a campaign to create confusion, times-cam e to its decision without diffithat the opposition campaign is not being culty.

77,Mr Nixon,"Neve r mind whom it isManager of the Australian Mercantile Land and Finance Co. Ltd., Mr George Le Couteur, who has been critical of the Board -for coming to a quick conclusion, also can be criticised for coming to a quick conclusion and putting up an alternative plan. It seems that in Canberra one night he propounded a scheme which he said was an alternative to that proposed by the Wool Board. He propounded that scheme after having considerably less time to formulate a plan than the Australian Wool Industry Conference and the Australian Wool Board had. I feel like asking Mr Le Couteur why, over the years he has been in the industry, he bas not proposed something constructive in the past. I should also like to know what has happened to the plan that he produced that night. I think that the wool growers of Australia, when making up their minds about the reserve price plan, should look at the plan propounded by Mr Le Couteur. Let us have a look at it. First, he proposed by individual members of that organisation that there should be a system of partial price equalisation. Secondly, he said that there should be a plan for immediate implementation of emergency price support. Who is being radical now? In my view it is Mr Le Couteur in proposing such a radical plan. He does not support his plan with any facts or figures, nor does he say how it is to be financed or how much it is going to cost. I appeal to members of this Parliament, and to people outside, to stop the vilification that has been going on about certain members of the Australian Wool Board, and I also certainly ask all members of the Parliament and interested people outside to amazed that such heat should be developed stop creating confusion and try to do somein debating the proposal embodied in this thing constructive. wants a monopoly of vilification, does he? is merely one to allow those engaged in body; I have spoken the plain truth.

Australia has about one sixth been in the wool industry most of their of the total sheep population of the world. lives. They are practical men who understand the problems of the industry. They are not fly by night people who have no attitude of hostility to this proposal of some particular interest in whether the scheme is good or bad. They haye done a lot of study of the Philp Committee report and other reports on their own initiative. Let us help the wool growers make a proper judgment on this matter. Let us make sure they get the right information to help them to come to a proper decision. The honourable member for Parkes accused me of engaging in some vilifying. Let me remind him that last night he gave tacit support himself to this campaign when he implied that the veracity of the Chairman of the Australian Wool Board was open to question. I gave chapter and verse for it. and verse in reply. The honourable member for Parkes quoted a letter from the International Wool Textile Organisation. The fact of the matter is that there was no vote because individual members of the organisation do not vote. But, countries do vote, and countries did vote. Despite what the honourable member for Parkes said the organisation did pass a resolution supporting a reserve price plan. Let the honourable member for Parkes deny that. I repeat in conclusion that I think it is important that all emotion should be taken out of this issue and that there should be no vilification by people on either side.

82,Mr Coutts (Griffith) [4.23],"I ammembers of the Government parties, particularly those belonging to the Liberal branch of the coalition. I would say that these honourable members are not very-concerned about the outcome of tbe Bill in the House. They are not prepared to vote against it. Whilst they damn it with faint praise on the one hand, they kick it with all their might on the other. They think that by working up a campaign of vilification in this House they will create confusion in the minds of those who will be called upon to vote and thereby bring about the defeat of the referendum proposal for which this Bill is making provision. There has been a lot of propaganda issued through the Press, particularly the country Press, and much of it has got on to a personal basis. I am alarmed at the attitude taken by some of the members of the Government. In past years, I have read in the Tory Press of efforts being made to undermine the Australian economy or to bankrupt our basic industries, and invariably the Press has come up with the finding that all these things have been inspired by Communist gold. In view of the sudden upsurge of hostility to stabilising the prices paid for truth that wool is fighting a battle with our principal exportable commodity, one might be pardoned for saying: "" I see Communist gold being thrust in to aid this campaign "". Of course, those who are ever ready to espouse a smear campaign in this House are those who are carrying on the campaign against the wool industry on this occasion. I am sure that some of those who have expressed such hostility to the proposition we are considering are not aware of this industry's real importance to Australia. Let me refer briefly to Australia's sheep population. ThefiguresI propose to quote are the latest available, those for 1963, but I am afraid that the numbers will have been reduced considerably by now because of the disastrous drought that Australia has experienced in recent months. In 1963 the total sheep population of Australia was 158,622,000. By far the greatest wool producing State in Australia is New South Wales, which has a sheep population of 70 million. Victoria comes next. The number of sheep grazing on properties in that State is 27,400,000. Victoria is followed closely by Queensland, which has a sheep population of 22,800,000. The other States follow. As so many people depend upon F.10615/65 -R -[34 ] this industry for their livelihood, and as wool is our principal export commodity. I feel that anything that can be done to stabilise the industry, or to lift it out of the doldrums into which it appears to have fallen, is something to which this House should give very serious consideration. Let me compare the amount of money that this industry earned for Australia in the last financial year with what it earned in the previous year. For the benefit of those few honourable members who are now in the House, I emphasise that there has been a terrific drop in Australia's income from wool. For the year ended in June 1964, the amount that Australia received for exports of greasy wool was £429,746,000. By 1965, that sum had dropped to £360,770,000. The income from the sale of washed and scoured wool dropped from £50,694,000 to £42,302,000a drop of something like £8 million-ove r the same period. It is not merely by a coincidence that this state of affairs has come about. Wool is a commodity for which there is a demand throughout the world. It is an unfortunate synthetics at the present time, but wool has good warmth giving qualities. As the great majority of the wealthy people of the world live in the colder climates, there is a demand for good quality warmth producing material, and it is considered that wool is at no disadvantage in its competition with synthetics as a warmth producing material. But, over the years, synthetics have gone from strength to strength because of their popularity with the consuming public. It is also a fact, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon), that thefluctuationsin the prices paid for wool have caused great concern to the industry and also to the manufacturers of woollen materials, wbo would much prefer a degree of stability in the prices which they are asked to pay. Over recent years, we have seen a steady decline in the price that Australia-thi s means the grazier-ha s been receiving for wool. It is time that something was done to arrest that decline. I feel that the proposition that we are debating now suggests that the Government is at last prepared to make a move in this direction. Some years ago, a commission was appointed by the Labour Government of New South Wales. Unfortunately, that Government is out of office at the moment. That commission was presided over by Mr Justice Cook and its purpose was to inquire into the alleged existence of buyers' rings or pies, as they are called, which controlled purchases of wool, thus forcing down the prices paid at auction. Notwithstanding that there was an outcry from many of the Pitt Street graziers and many of the Liberal politicians of New South Wales, who denied hotly the necessity for the appointment of this commission on the ground that no such organisations existed. The commission found that at that time there were buying rings in existence. It found that buyers from certain countries who were desirous of purchasing large quantities of wool came together at meetings and decided what quantities each would buy. One buyer would then attend the auction and bid on behalf of all buyers in the ring. In this way the whole purpose of the auction system was defeated because the bidding at what should have been an auction was merely a gesture. There was no competition, and when there is no competition it cannot be said that an auction is taking place. The existence of pies was proved, and I am sure that the operation of these pies has been largely responsible for the fall in the price of wool which bas been going on over such a long period. It is a fact that the price of wool is still members for Parkes( Mr Hughes), Bradfalling. This just cannot be allowed to continue. It is easy to say that the position will adjust itself, but it has been deteriorating for too long now and the country cannot continue to put up with this, especially in view of the fact that due to the upsurge in the volume of imports coming into the country and the decline in the prices we are receiving for our primary exports there is a huge deficit in our balance of payments. Because of the great drop in wool prices, our balance of payments position is deteriorating even further. Now, I feel that this matter has not been handled very well by the Ministers in this Government. It really hurts me to say this, but I do not think the Minister for Primary Industry comes out with flying colours for the way in which he has handled this matter. I would say that his motives have been very high ones and that he deserves credit for them. He believes he is doing something which, to his mind, will assist the industry. While I say that he has not behaved in the manner that I think he should have, I sympathise with him because of the back stabbing that is taking place behind him in the Government benches. For that reason, the Minister deserves some degree of sympathy. The Chairman of the Australian Wool Board, who has been touring the country advocating the adoption of the scheme which the Government is to submit to growers by way of a referendum, finds that while he is endeavouring to win a preselection ballot for a seat in this Parliament, the plan that he is advocating is being described by a member of the Government as cockeyed and stupid. Well, I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will agree with me when I say that it is a rather shocking state of affairs far this country if a man who is advocating a scheme which is cockeyed and stupid is trying to enter this Parliament with the prospect, it is said, of being made a member of the Ministry almost immediately he arrives. I feel that ""the accusation levelled by the member who made the charge that the scheme was cockeyed and stupid reflects very badly on him. Several members of this Parliament have been lashed savagely by Sir William Gunn for the attitude that they are taking in this matter. Sir William refers to the honourable field ( Mr Turner), Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), Moreton( Mr Killen) and Bowman (Dr. Gibbs). He sets them up as fools and describes them that way. Sir William has said that they have not set out to understand the problems of the wool industry. When a man of Sir William Gunn's experience and knowledge of the industry describes these honourable members as fools it is really a severe charge. I find that in yesterday's issue of the "" Courier-Mail ""--thi s is, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, Brisbane's leading daily newspaper-ther e is a letter signed by Wylie Gibbs, better known to us as the honourable member for Bowman. I quote from part of the letter' My serious concern was that the actual plan, which is mentioned in the Bill, and therefore upon which I must vote, has never been made public. In fact, I doubt if it is even fully formulated as yet. This is a very serious accusation to make. Of course, it must be laid at the feet of the Minister for Primary Industry. Recently in this Chamber, late at night, I saw an excellent demonstration of temper on the part of the honourable member for Bradfield-possibl y justifiable temper if sucb a state of affairs exists. He expressed indignation, and with a great display of physical strength, he tore up a copy of daily "" Hansard"" because the Minister had refused to make available this plan. The letter written by Wylie Gibbs continuesDuring my speech, I might add, I mentioned tiiat Sir William had made conflicting statements. Sir William has a propensity for this, and for getting his facts wrong. He also is given to extravagant statements when anyone dares to express a contrary view to his own. I wish he'd get on with an objective statement ment members here, all of whom loudly of his case and stop engaging in personalities. If these accusations are true it is a sorry state of affairs for the primary producer that this man who has a propensity for making conflicting statements, getting his facts wrong and making exaggerated statements, is the chief spokesman for the scheme that the Government is to submit to wool growers by way of referendum if this Bill is passed by the House. I only know Sir William Gunn to look at. I have to stand aside, when he walks down the aircraft, because of his bulk. This is why I said earlier that I felt that the whole matter has been handled very badly. I feel that there is no danger of the plan being defeated in this House because, as the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) has stated quite clearly-and I am most enthusiastically behind him-w e will be voting for a plan to give some assistance to the primary producers of Australia. I believe that the Bill will not be defeated in this place. But from the confused issues which are being thrown into thefightand from the charges which are being madeI will refer to another one a little laterI feel that the propaganda being engaged in could bring about the defeat of this proposal. I hope that this state of affairs will not come about, ""but I fear very much for the outcome. The Minister was challenged on several involved in this issue. The Griffith electorate occasions to produce the plan and the is a port area, and I have in that division correspondence between the Australian Wool many men who are involved in the proBoard and the Australian Wool Industry cessing and export of wool almost as directly Conference. He has refused to do so. I as the people in other parts of Queensland know that one newspaper described the situation in the words ""Adermann adamant"". The Minister has refused to make this information available. If you have a case, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is no need to hide it. If it is for the good of the people, the Minister should take them into his confidence. By doing so, the Minister will win more friends. What Government members are doing is to create a good deal of doubt in the minds of those who will vote in this referendum. There is no possibility of harmony among Government members. no possibility of harmony among Governproclaim that they represent the wool growers. Yesterday, the honourable member for Parkes, which is in the heart of Sydney, presented a petition from 7,000 wool growers which expressed hostility to the whole proposal. I must make one comment regarding the Country Party's stand on this issue. This is in relation to the system of voting. I remember sitting up into the small hours of the morning only a little whole ago while the House debated the Commonwealth Electoral Bill 1965. The Minister for the Interior( Mr Anthony), on behalf of the Government, was very much in favour of votes for sheep and not for men. For the present occasion, however, the Government has changed the voting system and we are to have a vote for men and not for sheep. Members of the Liberal Party, and some sections of the Press in Sydney, are strongly in favour of creating a system of voting whereby a man will have a number of votes according to the number of sheep he has. I commend the Country Party for its change of attitude. It is a great conversion which, I hope, will spread to other fields. I believe that I must take part in this debate, because, as I said earlier, we all are involved in this matter, for it is of great national importance. Everybody is",31,Reference Of Works To Public The Leader Of The Opposition That It Has Works Committee

84,Mr Coutts,"I am saying that there issuch as the Maranoa and Kennedy electorates. I have in my electorate large numbers of storemen who are engaged in dumping and preparing wool for sale, waterside workers who load it and railway men who transport it. All are very keenly interested in the economics of the industry, and it is in their interests that the industry be placed on an economic basis. I wish now to quote from a letter published in today's issue of the "" Daily Telegraph"". I must say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I do not do this with any enthusiasm at all. This letter was sent to a group of Merriwa graziers. As some honourable members know, Merriwa is in New South Wales. The letter, which was dated 21st August, was written by the Minister for Supply( Mr Fairhall). It will bear reading, for it is in these termsFrom the tone of your letter to me of August 21, which I understand . very well, I have little chance of making a satisfactory reply. Let me begin by saying that I distrust the reserve price plan as much as you do and sincerely hope it will be thrown out. To that you are entitled to reply that I have done precious little to achieve that end in fixing the franchise and majority for the referendum. The question of weighted voting power is always a vexed one and a decision on it necessarily arbitrary. Then, in the business of politics where precedents carry enormous weight, the pass was sold in the 1951 referendum where five bales earned any producer an equal vote. I am not going to say that was right and I would certainly have preferred more equitably weighted voting. The conditions of the referendum had Government majority approval and, as a member of the Government, I am obliged to go along with it, inevitably accepting the criticism of dissenting conducers in the discharge of his responsibi'ities. stituents. The alternative is that I should resign and this is not a resigning issue. I would hope to see the referendum fail, but if it should pass and the scheme come into operation, I would believe that the Government retains adequate andflexiblecontrol of the situation by virtue of the establishment, from time to time, of the floor price. However, thank you for your letter and for the telegram jointly signed by a number of Merriwa graziers. You may rest assured I will attract the attention from the Cabinet-the first eleven. The of my Cabinet colleagues to it. That letter was written by the Minister for Supply, who is the member for Paterson. a copy of the letter sent to him by the graziers? honourable member has not a copy of it? not. IfI had, I would have read it, too, being noted for my fair dealing. I am surprised at that letter's being written by the Minister for Supply. I placed him on a very high pedestal as a member of the Liberal Party of Australia in this Parliament. I did not think that he would be guilty of doing a thing such as this. We in the Australian Labour Party have a sense of loyalty to one another in the Party. If a decision is made in the party room, we do not go out on the highways and byways and, in effect, say: "" I am bound to support this because a majority voted for it, but I do not support it"". We on this side of the Parliament do not do that sort of thing, and I hoped that the members of all parties in this Parliament would not do such a thing. I am very disappointed that the Minister for Supply has got out from under, as it were, and attempted to thrust the blame on to bis colleagues. He is not prepared to accept responsibility for the Government's action. Again, I say, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the Minister for Primary Industry that I am disappointed at what has happened. I sympathise with him in what he has to face from some of those who sit immediately behind him and who are prepared to stab him in the back while he tries to do the best he can for the primary proLet me now read the comments on the letter written by the Minister for Supply which were thrown in for good measure by the ""Daily Telegraph"". The newspaper statedIt is understood from Cabinet Ministers, that even the Prime Minister has misgivings about the reserve price scheme.

I agree with him also that the Bill will should be put forward and that it should be passed. I think it will be passed unanibe put forward officially in the only proper mously by this Parliament, because it is a way, and that is as a schedule to the Bill Bill to provide for a referendum. It is of now before us. I will come back to that in no use for honourable members opposite to a moment. The wool growers are being twit the Government parties on an alleged asked to sign something which is a thousand lack of harmony in this matter. The Gotimes more important than any hire purvernment, as such, neither supports nor chase contract and they are not being opposes the scheme. But individual members allowed to read the fine print.

What of us are expert in referendum systems, happens, for example, if the reserve price methods of voting and ways in which a referendum should be put, and we all have had experience of the kind of political manoeuvre that we have seen adopted in an endeavour to have one side of the case put and the other side suppressed. Our wool growers are not made the dupes of control of their formal organisations.

91,Mr Wentworth,"He is being askedis fixed, under political pressure, at an unreal level? Do you remember, Mr Speaker, what happened in regard to Brazilian coffee when a scheme such as the one before us was in existence in Brazil? The growers demanded that the price be kept high. The price was kept high and stocks accumulated until finally the market collapsed in complete confusion and the coffee had to be burnt. We do not want that kind of thing to happen with wool because of unwise political pressure being generated. I am not trying to put Australian wool growers in the same category of unwisdom as the Brazilian coffee growers; I am simply saying that this could happen and that we do not want it to happen here. It may be, indeed, that the plan will not reduce but will increase fluctuations. If the plan is ever operated, that is to say if at any time stocks are bought in and stocks accumulate, manufacturers will know about it, and no manufacturer will buy wool when he has a mountain of stocks hanging over him. Manufacturers will all be frightened of a market collapse or of fluctuations and they will turn to synthetics. This could happen. It is a very real possibility-no t an inevitability but a very real danger that is inherent in the scheme. In the present situation synthetics are mounting a critical battle against wool and it is perhaps a little dangerous to couTt a situation such as I have described. We do not want to introduce unnecessary perils into a situation which already has a certain interest weakness. Now let me turn to the answer which the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) gave me yesterday in this House. If the banks are to find £50 million-wa s that the figure?-for this scheme there will be a certain contraction of the amount of money available for the overdrafts of all other producers. There limits might be reduced. Would not the money be better spent-if it is available at this concessional rate of interest, and of 1951 when the same associations,, or apparently' it is-in helping some of the other men on the land with low interest overdrafts? Is this reserved price proposal the best way to absorb our limited available funds? . There are alternative schemes but they bave never really received proper consideration by the public. The honourable member for Mitchell( Mr Irwin) was constructive today in suggesting that perhaps some small part of these funds should be used to finance overseas buyers when they experience balance of payments difficulties. We do this kind of thing in respect of wheat. We give our Communist enemies tens of millions of pounds worth of credit for the purchase of Australian wheat; why can we not give our friends and allies, if necessary, a few million pounds worth of credit from time to time for the purchase of Australian wool and the sustaining of the price of Australian wool? Would not this be a much better way of using, the money and would it pot be much more helpful for the growers? These are all considerations that we should think about. Speaking as somebody with not a great deal of experience in wool growing but with some experience in wool marketing and as someone who believes the scheme is likely to go wrong, I find myself, on balance, opposed to the scheme. I do not want to say that it has no merit, but it has dangers which far outweigh any merit that it may have. I would not put up my own view on this if I were not backed by very responsible authorities such as the former Chairman of the Australian Wool Board, Mr T. G. Carter, who is leading the opposition to the scheme, Mr R. J. Hawkes, a former member of the Wool Board and Mr W. J. R. Wilson, a former President of the Graziers Association of Victoria. These are not people one can write off as being of no consequence. Associations representing people producing more than half the Australian wool clip are opposed to this scheme. It is said that the official organisation has supported it by a large vote, and this is true, but are the opinions of those office bearers^those who voted for it-necessaril y representative of the opinions of wool growers? I ask honourable members to cast their minds back to August very nearly the same-the organised representatives of wool growers-supporte d a referendum proposal on almost a similar issue, just as these representatives are doing now. That referendum proposal was beaten by the wool growers by 63,740 votes to 16,310, a majority of more than three to one. Those who supported the proposal at that time said they represented the opinions of the wool growers. How wrong they were then. How wrong they may well be today. That referendum proposal was carried only in Western Australia, and then only by a small majority. It was overwhelmingly beaten in every other State. If the representatives misjudged the situation then, asked the wool growers to support them and then were found to be wrong, why should they not be wrong today? The advocates of this plan have not been entirely honest. I regret to say that Sir William Gunn himself appears to have two barrels pointing in different directions. He referred, for example, to the New Zealand scheme at one period as something admirable and at another period as something which is no good at all. He has rather tended to misquote, as the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Hughes) showed us last night, the references that the wool trade has made to this scheme. Let me tell the House of something about which it has not yet been told. I find in a report in the ""Coonabarabran Times"" of 8th July this year lhat Sir William Gunn, in a speech advocating the scheme, said that the scheme would "" eliminate private buying"". Looking at the Perth"" West Australian "" of 10th August 1965 and checking it with the Western Australian ""Farmers Weekly"" of 19th August 1965, I find that when Sir Willfam got over to Western Australia, where private buying is quite important, he said that he wants to support private buying and that nothing will be done to interfere with it. way betting man I am told. We have had in this debate the technique of partial quotation used by the advocates of this scheme. The Philp report has been mentioned, but the conclusions of the Philp Committee have not been stressed. There has been some suppression of the truth. As to the ""Yes"" and "" No "" casesboth sides of the questionI am glad to see the the Government has acceded to our pressure. In spite of the protests, and in the teeth of the protests from members of the Australian Country Party, it has been decided that both sides of the case are to be presented. Does that break their heart? Is this not fair? Is it not reasonable? Why was this provision not put in the Bill in the first place? Perhaps the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann) will be able to tell us. Then we had the suppression of the marketing report, and finally the supplementary Jenkins report was suppressed. Honourable members will recall that Mr Jenkins was seconded from the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. He submitted his first report to the Wool Board in May 1964. The Board did not want to release the report, but under pressure released it in December 1964. Subsequently, Mr Jenkins put in a supplementary report about marketing, but what is in it I do not know because the Wool Board refuses to release it. When the Secretary of the Graziers Association of New South Wales wrote to the Wool Board for a copy of the report he was told that it was confidential and that it could not be seen, or that he could see it under the seal of secrecy if he did not refer to it publicly. The first letter from the Graziers Association was sent on 5th August last, and when the secretary checked on the telephone he was given this reply: ""This supplementary report is secret. It cannot be made public "". Why? This suppression is going on far too much. As I have said, it is Government policy to have this referendum, and rightly so, but it is not Government policy to advocate, as a government, either a vote for ""Yes"" or a vote for "" No "" . Some individual members may be committed on either side, but it seems to me that some individual members are inclined to try for a "" Yes"" vote at any cost. Indeed, it seems to me almost that the Bill before us, insofar as it relates to the technical provisions of the referendum, has been drawn with the specific objective of getting a ""Yes"" vote by preventing the "" No"" case being fairly presented. I think that the comment which I heard from a senator that the sheep drew the Bill was not quite fair because I consider that the Bill was drawn with deliberate intent. Let me say that I hope that when the Bill is before the Committee some necessary amendments to the Bill will be carried. I shall now try to outline some of these amendments, some of which I hope to move myself. First, the Bill does not have the scheme attached to it. In the definition of ""the Plan"" the Bill states-and I read from itmeans the plan for maintaining reserve prices . . . formulated in consultation between the",36,Reference Of Works To Public The Leader Of The Opposition That It Has Works Committee

Then in the egregious clause 4 we seeFor the purposes of this Act, the Minister shall deliver to the Chief Electoral Officer a document . . . containing a statement of the Plan. . . and that statement shall . . . be taken to be a full and correct statement of the Plan. This is silly. If the document can be drawn, why can it not be put in as a second schedule to the Act? Let us be honest and fair about this. What is the Minister concealing? I agree with the honourable member for Griffith that there should be no concealment. The Minister was perfectly right when he said that wool growers may not understand all the details of the plan. That is all right, but let the plan go in with the fine print as the First Schedule to the Act and let the summary of the plan, which the Minister wants to be sent out to wool growers Officer, be put in as the Second Schedule so that we will know what goes out. It is an indignity to this House for members to be asked to vote that the Minister can have the right to make some statement in the future and to send it out as his version of the plan. I do not blame the Minister for this. We know of his great personal associations with Sir William Gunn. We know what Sir William Gunn is trying to do inside the Country Party. I am not blaming the Minister, but I do say that he should not allow his personal and political associations to divert him from his duty in this matter. honourable member got near to the truth. else.

A second reading speech binds nobody. does bind. The statement should be in the Bill. If the statement has been prepared, there is not the slightest reason why it should not go in as the Second Schedule. I want to refer now to something which is undoubtedly an error in the Bill. The definition of "" wool grower "" is wrong and I do not think it is as the Minister intended. If honourable members look at the definition of "" wool grower "" in clause 3 they will see that it reads"" wool-grower"" means a person who owns sheep that are kept wholly or partly for the purpose of the production of shorn wool. If honourable members will then look at clause 9 they will see that a voter includes somebody who owns not less than 300 sheep. As the Bill is drawn, anybody could buy 300 sheep-h e would not have to hold them for more than a few days-and he would become entitled to a vote. This is perfectly silly. by the Chief Electoral expensive. expensive because the sheep could be bought and then sold. A person would not have to keep them on his property. That is not required by the definition. It may be said that no wool grower would do this. I do not think that any wool grower would do this, but this provision in the Bill gives a vote to anybody who has IS quid because starving sheep can be bought at a starving sheep price in parts of Australia. All one has to do is have a piece of paper to show that he owns the sheep for a few hours and able to do this and I do not believe that this was intended. In fact, I know that it "" wool-grower"" means a person who owns sheep that are kept wholly or partly for the purpose of the production of shorn wool.

103,Mr Wentworth,"I read the definifor that purpose. In that definition the gate is left open for all sorts of malpractice. I hope the Minister will make the necessary technical amendments to this Bill. If honourable members look at clause 12 they will see a very peculiar position in regard to partnerships. If a partnership of two produces 19 bales of wool, neither partner can vote. This anomaly can be quite easily cured by putting in a little clause to provide that members of the partnership may opt to vote unanimously either "" Yes"" or "" No "". I hope that the Minister will consent to this amendment. It is quite easy to cure this defect and there is no reason wby it should not be cured. I refer next to the date of the referendum. There are stories currentI do not know whether they are true or not-that the Government intends to rush this through before the other case can be put and try to close the referendum sometime about the end of October. I find this hard to believe, but the rumours are current. If this is done it will be a travesty of all natural justice because the wool growers have a right to hear the "" No "" case which is to be prepared. They have a right to discuss this after they get the case. Why should they be hurried and rushed into making a decision? A few weeks will make no difference. Let them have time. Let the Bill be drawn so as to prescribe a date, which shall not be before a date that the Minister can name provided it is a reasonable date. Some time in December perhaps would be a reasonable date. The wool growers should have a few weeks to look at this proposal. Why this insane desire to rush them into a decision before they know the real facts? What about the rolls? There may be a precedent for this, but if there is it is a wrong principle. The rolls are not to close before the taking of the vote; they are to remain flexible during the whole of the taking of the vote. There is no provision in the BillI understand that the Minister may be making one-for the exhibition of rolls. People will not know whether they are on the roll and they will not know other people are improperly on the roll. There is no provision for secrecy of the ballot. Perhaps it will be contained in the regulations, and perhaps the Minister will tell us about -Order! I suggest that the honourable memthat. I am not concerned with the controversy that has been stirred up concerning the small man and the big man. I am not very impressed by it one way or the other, because I do not believe there is any difference in interest between the small man and the big man. They are both interested in sustaining high wool prices and I do not see that there is any cleavage between them. I am not really frightened in any way that the small man will carry a "" Yes"" vote, because I think that the small man, although not always so well informed on these matters as his more experienced neighbour, is a responsible man. His livelihood is just as much at stake as that of the big man. I ara not frightened of the small man's vote; rather do I welcome it. because I believe there is much practical common sense among small wool growers. We should not say, as some people have said, that the small man in this respect will be different from the big man. They both have the same interests. Indeed, the small man may be even more concerned than the big man, because the small man's whole livelihood may be involved whereas the big man may have other interests to fall back on. for example, with his big interests in cattle and tobacco. Has he still interests in rice since the Humpty Doo fiasco? I cannot remember. He has big interests in tobacco, cattle and other things. It will not affect him very much if this scheme turns out disastrously. He has another room -anothe r refuge-to fly to, but the small man may not be in the same comfortable position. I do not very much appreciate Sir William Gunn's going around pretending to be the friend of the small man. One gets a little tired of this synthetic hayseed. He is not a small man; he is a big man. When he comes forward as the champion of the small man against the big man, when there is really no difference or cleavage of interest between the two in this matter, one suspects the worse. He has other interests. He is trying to make the wool bale his stepping stone to political power.

I do not think that this Bill is really designed for the wool growers; rather have we seen some jockeying for positions inside the formal organisation of the Country Party. As politicians we cannot always frown on this. We know that jockeying for position inside a party must go on, but I do not see why this should be the cause of sacrificing the interests of the Australian wool industry. As we well know, mC3t ot the members of the Country Party arc not in the wool growing industry. The main wealth of the country may be in wool growing but the numbers lie with sugar, dried fruits, tobacco and things of that character, sold at auction."" so it is not really the wool growers who are deciding Country Party policy, even though the Country Party may be keeping a solid front and a stiff upper lip in regard to this. I support entirely the principle of a referendum. At the Committee stage I shall be moving-and I hope I shall have some support for them some reasonable amendments directed only at making the referendum a little fairer and in ensuring that wool growers are able to cast proper, free and informed votes. For my own part, I think that although the scheme has some very well-intentioned supporters-and I can see their viewpoint-o n balance it is a scheme where tbe dangers outweigh the advantages. I think it is being prosecuted by some of its sponsors not entirely for disvides for the maintenance of reserve prices interested motives. I can only say to the wool growers: ""Do not go down Gunn's Gully; you might get done over down there"". confess that I share the view of the honorprices for Australian wool sold at auctionable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) I ask honourable members to note the next that he knows very little about the wool wordsindustry. The fact that I have been engaged that has been formulated in consultation between in the industry since the end of the First the Australian Wool Industry Conference and the World War is beside the point. It has, of Government of the Commonwealth; course, enabled me to maintain a family and keep a wife alive, as well as myself, despite the vagaries of such an occupation. In those years I have learned a few things about the life of those engaged in the wool industry, but only as a small farmera small grazier. I have found that the wool growers know what they want, but they do not know how to get it. They have tried in many ways to improve their position. They look for lower costs. They look for higher prices. They look for stability and profitability. Now they have come to this Government with a proposition that they believe is going to help them in their search for a better life. It is up to this Government to do what it can to give them that better life. We are discussing-althoug h one might not believe it from the last speech we heard""A Bill for an Act to provide for a referendum for the purpose of ascertaining whether the wool growers of Australia approve a certain plan for maintaining reserve prices for Australian wool I have read the preamble to the Bill in detail because it gives the key to the whole discussion that has taken place. We are not strictly debating the plan at all. We are debating a bill that provides for the holding of a referendum. We are debating a bill for an act to discover whether the wool growers of Australia approve a certain plan. We are debating a bill for an act which will refer to maintaining reserve prices for Australian wool sold at auction. I mention these detailed points because many careless references have been made over the past few months to this plan as a completely new plan. We have been told that it is entirely new and that we have not had a plan like it before. It is not new. This is a referendum to enable the wool growers to approve or disapprove of a plan that prowithin the present auction system. The interpretation clause of the Bill should give the key to the debate.

The honourable member for Mackellar suggested that the Country Party was sponsoring this plan. If he had taken the care to read the Bill he would have seen that this plan has been formulated in consultation between the Australian Wool Industry Conference and the Government of the Commonwealth. Country Party plan, a Liberal Party plan, a Labour Party plan or a Government plan. It is a plan agreed upon between the industry and the Government. upon. between the industry and the Government. If the honourable member denies that it has been agreed upon, he does not know what he is talking about. The plan has been formulated in consultation between the Conference and the Government. Does the honourable member for Mackellar say that the statement published in the Bill is not correct? If he wants to say this, he is welthey are voting ""Yes"" for a specific plan come to do so. in the Bill. That is all I said. correct, nobody in the House would agree with him. I emphasise that this plan follows a policy that has been in force for some years. The policy gives the wool growing industry and other primary industries an opportunity to decide what they want and then to come to the Government and say: "" We ask you to support us in a scheme that we believe will assist our industry and assist the problems of the industry. We know that Australia."" The records of "" Hansard"" show that this policy has been repeated time and time again. It has always been the policy of the Australian Country Party and the policy of the Government to provide for the orderly marketing of primary products, using the system of orderly marketing decided upon by those engaged in the industry. This is the principle embodied in the policy of the Australian Country Party and it is the principle that has been adopted by the Government in its approach to primary industries. We believe that the Government has a right to protect the interests of the electorate and of the taxpayers. These interests are protected by giving the people concerned the opportunity to take part in the deliberations. As I have said, the Bill deals primarily with the holding of a referendum and not with the plan that has been formulated. I want to say a few words about that point now. The holding of a referendum is the prime issue to be debated here, but other points are associated with this issue. I have in mind such matters as the form of the referendum, whether it will be a compulsory referendum, whether it will be by postal vote and so on. Another consideration is the qualification of voters, and this has exercised the minds of many honourable members and has caused a lot of trouble. Then there is the question of approvalwhether the plan will be approved by a simple majority or in some other way. Associated with all this is the plan itself. After all, those who have the right to vote should know what they are voting about. Therefore, the plan will be put forward, not necessarily for discussion at this stage but for the benefit of voters so that when they record their votes they will know that or ""No"" against that plan. Provision is made so that when a voter casts his vote he will know what he is voting about, because a copy of the plan will be included with his ballot paper. Before we go into detail on these matters, I want to refer to the history of the wool industry. This has been mentioned by other honourable members. The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) yesterday spoke of efforts some years ago to free the industry from the problems associated with it. Other honourable members have also referred to in 1950 and 1951 prices were high and the industry was thriving. Then prices started to fall and costs increased, and the industry fell on bad days. In 1962, the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann) introduced the Wool Industry Bill. Incidentally, this Bill was opposed by my friend the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie), who was interjecting a little while ago. He asked the Parliament to support an amendment that had been moved by his party. However, I am pleased to say that the Bill survived and is now law.

116,. Mr Failes,"If he says the Bill is notIndustry Bill adopted recommendations made by the Wool Marketing Committee of Inquiry, which is known as the Philp Committee. The Commitee recommended that some alterations be made in the structure of the Australian Wool Bureau, as it was in those days, and its associated bodies, of wool growers at a referendum. A referthe Wool Research Committee and the Australian Wool Testing Authority. It recommended that the functions of these bodies be taken over by the Australian Wool Board, which was a new organisation, and that research into marketing be continued. The Wool Industry Bill, in giving effect to the recommendations of the Committee, established the system as we know it today. Another recommendation of the Philp Committee was adopted and this resulted in the establishment of the Australian Wool Industry Conference. The Conference had an effect that was rather remarkable for the wool industry. It brought together into one organisation a.number of groups that were not associated at that time and it reduced the number of individual organiations in the industry to two. They were the Australian Wool growers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation. I quite agree with my friend, the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon), that another organisation, the Australian Primary Producers Union, should be given an opportunity to join the Conference and I hope that as time goes on the Union will join the Conference so that, as I have said before, all wool growing organisations will be represented in this Conference of 50 members. tralian Wool Board is a statutory organisathat it is for politicians to try to tell the tion.

This, in many respects, is the key to much of the argument that has taken place up to the present. By the way, the the referendum. First, there is the form industry decides the constitution and comof the referendum. There has been no position of the Australian Wool Industry quibble at all about its being held in the Conference. Therefore, the Conference is well capable of speaking for the industry. The stated policy of the Federal wool grower organisations is that no fundamental change should be made in the present system of wool marketing without the approval endum has now been asked for by the Wool Industry Conference. A bill has been formulated by the Conference and the Government to provide for a referendum. Certain criticisms of this Bill have been made in the face of the fact that the wool grower organisations have asked for this referendum and have agreed on quite a number of the matters that have been discussed during this debate. I wish to deal very briefly with some of those matters. The Bill has been debated very fully, but I believe that we should review some of the matters that have been raised over the last month or so. for the plan or against it? tion I will say exactly what previous speakers have said. I am not advocating a vote in favour of the plan or against it. As the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Armstrong) said, our great concern should be not whether or not this referendum will be carried, but that the great wool industry is not split in halves. It has been threatened with being split because of the impassioned and bitter objections that have been raised by various people. This industry and the organisation that has been built up by the Minister for Primary Industry are too valuable to be destroyed in that way. This plan is the industry's conception. is square and above board. In my mind there is no doubt that the referendum will be square and above board. Let me deal with matters connected with",42,Reference Of Works To Public The Leader Of The Opposition That It Has Works Committee

119,Mr Holten,I s the honourable member,43,Reference Of Works To Public The Leader Of The Opposition That It Has Works Committee
120,Mr Failes,"In reply to that interjecform that is laid down in this Bill. I have not heard any objection at all to that form. Secondly, there are the conditions, such as whether the referendum should be compulsory and whether it should be held by postal ballot. I have not heard any complaints at all on that score. Some people have said that they cannot see why it should be compulsory. The Minister said in his second reading speech that he believed it should be compulsory because it is such a vital matter that everybody concerned with it should vote on it. I subscribe to that view. The qualifications of voters is a matter of boards have been established in respect on which there is quite a diversity of of other industries. A number of plans have opinion. Some people ask these questions: been brought before this House. A little Why should the grower with 10 bales be while ago the honourable member for Maraentitled to a vote? Why should not the mininoa ( Mr Brimblecombe) reminded me that mum be 20 bales or 30 bales? Some people the heat that has been generated in this have contended that a grower should have debate is remarkable. We did not have anyone vote for every so many bales; say, every thing like the same heat generated or the 10 bales or every 300 bales. On that basis same concern shown in debates on hens and growers would have a varying number of egg boards or in debates on bees and honey votes. I wish to make one or two points that boards. There has not been the same conhave a decided bearing on this matter. cern when stabilisation plans have been There is no qualification for a member of introduced in respect of the wheat industry a wool grower organisation, except that about which my friend, the honourable memof being a grower within the true meaning ber for Mallee( Mr Turnbull), knows so of the word.

The qualifications of voters were also not been considered in respect of other questioned with reference to 19 bale partnerindustries. Why should this industry be the ships. How many 19 bale partnerships will one to attract all this trouble to it? be affected by this plan? I venture to suggest that there will be only a handful. If the qualification were altered to 15 bales people would talk about 29 bale partnerships. If whether the majority required should be a it were altered to 20 bales, people would talk simple majority, a 60-40 majority or some about 39 bale partnerships. If the qualificaother majority. The Australian Wool Industion were altered to conform with the views try Conference has asked for a simple of those people, more anomalies would be majority, just as it has asked for a ten bale created. So, why argue the point about it? qualification and that a grower with ten Let us get this straight in our minds: In with 200 bales should have one vote. The dealing with a problem as tremendous as industry has asked for these things and the a referendum on a plan for this enormous Government has agreed to them. I believe industry, there will be anomalies. We just that the results should be determined by a have to put up with them. We have to simple majority. I confess that I had some compromise. We have to have a system doubts about this matter at first. But now under which the industry says to the GovernI find that the constitution of the Australian ment: ""This is what we believe should be Wool Industry Conference can be altered in your bill;"" and if the Government says: ""We do not agree with that"", somebody has to compromise sooner or later so that the industry and the Government can say: "" All right, we agree on that"". If we turn around at this stage and alter the whole plan, we will only start all over again. Some times I begin to wonder whether that has not been the objective of some people in this instance. An attempt has been made to confuse the issue so much that we will not quite know where we stand. I also draw attention to what has happened in other industries. Quite a number should have one vote for every 100 acres that he has under wheat. These matters have Another question that has been raised is bales should have one vote and a grower by a simple majority. If it is good enough for the Conference to alter its constitution by a simple majority, I believe that it is good enough for this referendum to be carried by a simple majority. One could continue to talk about this matter for a long time without getting anywhere at all. There are always great -problems affecting this industry. The industry believes that some of those problems can be solved by the adoption of this plan. During the short period of this debate quite a number of varied matters have been raised. There has been considerable debate on the plan itself. As I said earlier, I do not wish to take any part in that part of the debate. I believe that it is up to the industry itself to make a decision on the plan. The function .of the Government is to give the industry what it asks for. The Government has promised to do that. It has promised that if the -industry decides in favour of this plan it will introduce legislation to implement the plan. The industry has asked for a referendum in this instance and I believe that it is the funcsition's primary consideration is that there tion of the Government to agree to that request. The stated policy of the wool growers' organisations is that no fundamental change should be made in the present system of wool marketing without the approval of wool growers at a referendum. If the wool growers come to the Minister and say that they want a referendum to decide whether this plan should be approved then I think it is up to us to approve of their application for a referendum and grant their request without quibbling so much about the details. The proposal originated in the industry as a result of the action of the Minister for Primary Industry in formulating the Australian Wool Board and making it possible for the Australian Wool Industry Conference to be formed. This is the first time in my recollection, going back a long way, that the wool industry of Australia has been able to speak with one voice. It is a wonderful achievement of which the Minister may be proud. If this were a plan it would go down in history as the Adermann Plan. But it is not. It will simply go down in history as the Australian Wool Industry Conference, but it will not be forgotten that it was the Minister's creation. I deplore that associations in the Australian Wool Industry Conference are so vocal, not only in publicity but through their representatives, in criticising suggestions put forward by their own industry organisation, the Australian Wool Industry Conference. If it is good enough for the Conference to speak for them, it is good enough for them to stand by the Conference. I make no apology for that statement. The plan has been approved by the executive of the industry and by the Government. It has been approved by the Conference. Details of the referendum have been formulated by the industry and the Government and it is for this Parliament to pass this legislation. Let us get on with the job. The Opposition supports this Bill, which confers upon wool growers the opportunity to vote for a reserve price plan for the sale of Australia's wool clip. The Labour Party considers that an affirmative vote by the growers will be in the best interests of the industry and of the nation. The defeat of the referendum proposal will mean the continuance of the present system. The Opposhould be a just price for our wool clip and that the producers should be protected against the operations of those who manipulate the market. As far as the Opposition is concerned the issues are clearcut. It will be a vote for either a reserve price plan or for the continuance of the present system with all its difiiculties, all its problems, all its hazards and all the frightening consequences it has had for the man on the land-the wool grower-ove r the years. The Opposition is not giving blanket approval to any cognate bill that may be submitted subsequently to the Parliament. The attitude of members of the Opposition is that the growers should be entitled to determine this matter and we believe also that a reserve price plan for orderly marketing is in the best interests of the growers and the nation. Orderly marketing has been accepted in regard to wheat, dried fruits, dairy products and a number of other primary products. We believe that it is in the best interests of the man on the land, and the nation, that a fair and just price should be obtained for the nation's clip. I say quite clearly that I believe that the fullest information should always be given to the Parliament and to those engaged in the industry. I was pleased to hear from the",43,Reference Of Works To Public The Leader Of The Opposition That It Has Works Committee
121,Mr Luchetti (Macquarie) [5.47],"Minister for Primary Industry( Mr even balance between what we sell and Adermann) that additional information will be going out to growers to enable them to decide this question that is of such importance to them and to the country. They will be armed with information that will be most valuable to them. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) referred to the desirability of having annexed to the Bill a copy of the proposal. That would be a very fine thing and few of us would disagree with such a procedure. However, I wonder at times, when opposition is raised against proposals such as this there have been no complaints and no by certain members on the Government side -mos t of whom represent metropolitan electorates-wh y they have such faith in their Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies), and the Government at election time, when policy speeches are made. There are no annexures then. There is nothing to show how what is promised is going tb be underwritten. There is only the bald promise of something which members on the Government side go on to the hustings and uphold as the correct course for the nation and something which should be accepted by the people. If honourable members opposite can do that at election time without demur and without question, why do they question this proposal now? Is the government that is bringing in the proposal any different from the one which made the promises at election time? Do different people comprise the Government on this occasion? Is it not the same Prime Minister, the same Deputy Prime Minister and the same Minister for Primary Industry who are making these promises now? Yet, despite all the additional information, the people who represent city seats do not seem prepared to accept the statements of their leaders. These honourable members are opposed to the referendum. They raise all Sorts of doubts and difficulties. They want to know how these things are going to be financed. In these difficult days the country is adopt a national attitude towards these faced with a balance of payments problem. matters. Last year we were £375 million down, and had it not been for the inflow of capital from overseas we would, as a Parliament, Pollard), in a refreshingly interesting and be trying to find every way we could to valuable contribution, dealt with the gain an additional pound to help balance industry in a detailed manner. He dealt our accounts or at least provide a more with the problems of the past, he gave the what we buy. Yet Government supporters who oppose this proposal seem to disregard this fact. I regret that we have these doubting Thomases who notwithstanding all the information we have been given, are not prepared to accept the proposal. As the honourable member for Lawson( Mr Failes) quite rightly said, when important pieces of legislation have been disoussed and debated in this Parliamentbills dealing with orderly marketing for wheat, meat, dried fruits and all the restargument, but now honourable members representing seats in the capital cities of Australia bring forward such a flood of pressurised opposition as we have not had in recent times. The petition that was brought to this Parliament was not brought by a Country Party member, a Labour Party member or even a Liberal member for a country seat. It is a member from a metropolitan constituency who has brought his prize of a lot of names into the Parliament-the voice of Phillip Street presenting a petition on behalf of the wool growers of this country. something not particularly wholesome about it. Let us leave it at that. I would be much happier if such a petition were presented by an honourable member on the Government side who represents a country electorate. He would be speaking for people whom he knows and represents, and would be doing a job for the men on the land with whom he rubbed shoulders and whom he meets at agricultural shows and other functions in country districts. This is the attitude that we take. I leave the matter now, but I shall deal with some aspects of it later. This pressure campaign is a campaign of a type that I regret vary much, and I hope that the Parliament will The honourable member for Lalor( Mr",45,Reference Of Works To Public The Leader Of The Opposition That It Has Works Committee

His summary left no doubt as to who are the friends of the man on the land and who support his case in this Parliament.

Leave granted; debate adjourned. Sitting suspended from 5.57 to 8 p.m. Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr Harold Holt, and read a first time. Second Reading. Treasurer) [8.0] I move That the Bill be now read a second time. lt is nearly two years since I introduced the Currency Bill 1963 into the House in October 1963. Since then the authorities concerned appear to have made excellent progress in their preparations for a smooth changeover to a decimal currency system in Australia on 14th February next. The two principal co-ordinating bodies-the Decimal Currency Board and the Commonwealth Treasury-hav e had long and detailed discussions with the large numbers of interested Commonwealth and State Government departments and instrumentalities, with the Australian banks, with the new monetary unit. It settled the denomiprincipal distributors and users of monetary machines and, in fact, with each of the major organisations and institutional groups which are concerned with the paying, receiving and recording of amounts of money. The new Currency Bill which I am now presenting results to a large degree from these discussions. It will establish a set of guiding rules which should reduce to a minimum any inconvenience which the community in general might suffer as a result of the changeover. The new Bill, together with the Decimal Currency Board Bill, which I shall be introducing shortly, will incorporate most of the provisions of the Currency Act 1963. It will settle the changeover date as 14th February 1966. lt will provide for the period of up to two years after that date during which it will be permissible to conduct transactions in either the new or the old currencies. This period of flexibility will be necessary until all £ s. d. monetary operation or replaced by new decimal machines. I may add that the substance of the Bill and much of its detail have been discussed with such bodies as the Australian Inter-Bank Decimal Currency Committee, The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Manufactures, the Australian Council of Retailers, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the National Employers Policy Committee, the Life Offices Association of Australia, the Australian Associated Stock Exchanges, the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers, the Australian Society of Accountants, the Institutes of Chartered Accountants and of Cost Accountants, and the Chartered Institute of Secretaries. All are now in general agreement that the approach proposed is satisfactory from their points of view. There have also been conferences with the State Parliamentary Draftsmen, who will be concerned with the complementary task of preparing legislation to cover matters which are the concern of State Governments -for example, references to £ s. d. amounts in State legislation including stamp duties, rates and taxes, and so on. The Currency Act 1963 provided for the introduction of a decimal currency system into Australia on a date to be proclaimed. It established the dollar as the name of the nations and composition of the new decimal coins. Finally, it gave statutory effect to the appointment of the Decimal Currency Board, which is charged with supervising the main aspects of the changeover arrangements. PartV of the Currency Act, which was mainly concerned with the responsibilities of the Decimal Currency Board, came into effect as soon as the Act received Royal Assent in October 1963. This was to enable the Board to proceed with the complex arrangements leading up to the changeover",46,Reference Of Works To Public The Leader Of The Opposition That It Has Works Committee
125,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"date, including negotiations with the companies which will be converting some hundreds of thousands of £ s. d. machines to decimal operation during a period of up to two years following C Day. Part II-IV and VI of the Act were to come into effect on the proclaimed date, since agreed as 14th February 1966. These parts would repeal the Coinage Act 1909-1947 and would make decimal coins legal tender on and after that date. It was realised at the time-and I made this clear in my second reading speech-that further legislation would be needed later to cover the two-year "" transition "" period after C Day. Some thought was given at the time to the possibility of including the "" transitional"" provisions in the original Currency Act, but it was considered safer to defer this exercise until more was known about the problems likely to be encountered. This has proved to have been the wisest course, and discussions which the Treasury, the Decimal Currency Board and the Parliamentary Draftsman have had with numbers of interested parties over the past two years have indicated not only the best form which the transitional provisions should take, but also shown that several new provisions are desirable additional to those already in the Currency Act itself. While experience has shown that a few of the original provisions of the Currency Act could with advantage be further clarified, there would be no need in normal circumstances to have more than an amending Act in order to provide clarification where desirable, to introduce new provisions the need for which was not realised in 1963, and to provide for the transition period. However, so many parties are closely affected, and there is therefore such a wide and active interest in the precise terms of the decimal currency legislation, that the public could be decidedly inconvenienced if it were necessary to refer to two separate pieces of legislation-the original Currency Act and an amending Act. It is therefore proposed that the Currency Act 1963 be repealed except for those sections dealing with the functions of the Decimal Currency Board, which must obviously have continuing effect from 1963. The Act would then be renamed the Decimal Currency Board Act. I shall shortly be introducing a Decimal Currency Board Bill to give effect to this. No changes are proposed from the original provisions relating to the Board, and the Bill therefore does not call for any special comment. The other provisions of the Currency Act 1963, which were not due to come into force until C Day, will be incorporated in the new Currency Bill, which will then cover currency, coinage, and associated matters only, firstly during the transition period and later on a permanent basis after the transition period is completed. There will indeed be an advantage in excluding Decimal Currency Board matters from an Act which will have continuing effect long after the Board has ceased to function. In general terms, Part II (Currency) of the Currency Act 1963 established the new monetary unit and provided that, after a date to be proclaimed, all cheques, contracts and monetary transactions would be in terms of decmial currency. All references to amounts of money expressed in £ s. d. prior to C Day in Commonwealth acts, ordinances, instruments, etc., and in contracts, cheques, etc. would be construed as references to exactly equivalent amounts in decimal currency. Honourable members will be aware that all coins of sixpence-o r five cents-and above, and all notes, will have exactly equal counterparts in both the new and the old currencies. All£ s. d. amounts actually owing at C Day will be converted into decimal currency to the nearest cent in accordance with a table set out in the Act wherever odd pence amounts are involved. All percentages expressed in money terms-for example, £5 per cent, per annum-wil l be construed as equivalent percentages expressed in dollars and cents-that is, $5 per cent., not $10 per cent. As a result of these blanket provisions, very few Commonwealth, acts, ordinances, etc., require specific amendment immediately, although they will clearly have to be brought up to date as opportunities arise. Most private contracts will continue in force without any revisions being necessary. Part II of the Currency Act 1963 will continue as Part II of the Currency Bill with the changeover date now confirmed as 14th February 1966. There will be a number of minor drafting changes in the interests of clarification, together with a new provision that wills and other testamentary documents will not be invalidated if written in £s. d. after C Day. There will also be a provision that certain amounts payable periodically in accordance witb pre C Day contracts, such as life insurance premiums and hire purchase instalments, will be payable to the nearest cent, as in the table already included in the Currency Act. The exact conversion basis will apply after C Day to references to amounts in £ s. d. in other contracts entered into before C Day. No changes are proposed to Part III (Coinage) of the Currency Act, which establishes the composition of the new coins and provides for their dimensions and designs to be prescribed. No changes are proposed either, to Part IV (Legal Tender) except to the extent that this is modified during the transition period by the new PartV (Transitional Provisions). Until a date to be proclaimed-probabl y about two years after C Day-it will be permissible to execute contracts and all other forms of monetary transactions, except cheques, other bills of exchange and promissory notes, in terms of £ s. d. The purpose of this is to enable businessesparticularly those which have not had their monetary machines changed over to decimal operation-to continue to work in £s. d. during the transitional period if they so desire. One of the main features of the changeover will be the complete conversion of all bank operations from £ s. d. to decimals in the four days prior to C Day. It will therefore be necessary for all cheques to be written in dollars and cents after C Day. The same will apply to other bills of exchange and to promissory notes. I turn now to cash transactions. Part IV (Legal Tender) of the present Currency Act made the new bronze 1-cent and 2-cent coins legal tender for the payment of amounts up to 20 cents, and the new cupronickel 5, 10 and 20-cent coins and silver 50-cent coins legal tender up to five dollars. C Day as their exact decimal currency The new Bill will provide that mixed lots of £ s. d. and decimal coins will similarly be legal tender for amounts with these values, whether expressed in £ s. d. or decimals, during the transition period-as well as being legal tender for decimal amounts, only, after the end of the transition period. The main limitation is that it will be legally ing wage calculations. The Decimal permissible to tender £ s. d. coins only in multiples of 6d. in payment of decimal amounts, and to tender decimal coins only in multiples of five cents in payment of £ s. d. amounts. A shopkeeper who sells an article at 7s. 4d. will therefore be able to insist, if he so wishes, on receiving precisely 7s. 4d. rather than the nearest decimal amount of 73 cents, or 7s. 3.6d., and one selling an article at 72 cents will be able to insist on that amount rather than 7s. 2d., or 71f cents, the nearest £ s. d. amount. Undoubtedly there will be a few misunderstandings and petty arguments in this area, but none of them should be any more difficult of solution than the problem we often face at present when writing a cheque for a grocer's bill which ends in a halfpenny. Some of us disregard the halfpenny and a probably lesser number of us round up to the next penny But our relationships with our grocers and other shopkeepers seem to have survived reasonably well over the years, and I see no reason why they should not continue to do so after decimal currency is introduced. There is indeed no problem of this nature which cannot be solved by the customer tendering a higher amount in either currencya multiple of either 6d. or five cents-and taking the exact change, just as most transactions are settled now in retail stores, supermarkets, etc. For example, the shopkeeper selling an article for 7s. 4d. would give 2s. 8d. change for a dollar note or a 10s. note, and the one selling an article at 72 cents would give 8 cents change for 80 cents made up from four 2s. pieces, or four 20 cent coins, or a mixture of both coins. The conversion of wage and salary payments is a matter of some concern. Industrial awards which are laws of a State will be outside the ambit of the Commonwealth's legislation but, by virtue of clause 10 (3.) of the new Bill, references to £ s. d. amounts in all other awards and wage contracts will be automatically construed after equivalents. In many cases this will involve fractions of a cent. The Australian Council of Trade Unions and the National Employers Policy Committee have been conferring on the conversion of these amounts and have agreed on an approach aimed at minimisine complications in makCurrency Board, too, has examined this matter and found that for practical purposes wage calculations would in most circumstances not need to be taken beyond two decimal places of a cent. There will be no question of rounding unit wage rates, such as hourly rates, to the nearest cent and then multiplying. Just as with wage calculations made at present under £ s. d. awards and contracts, all calculations will be carried through to the final amount with as much precision as necessary and it is this amount which will, if necessary, be rounded to a whole cent. Except for payments by cheque, it will be permissible for employers to continue making their wage calculations and payments in £ s. d. during the transition period. For that purpose it may be necessary to convert decimal currency amounts into their £ s. d. equivalents for a time when existing awards are re-issued in decimal currency or new awards are made in the new currency. This should be no more difficult than the reverse process. There are two new provisions relating to banking which are worthy of comment. The first of these will provide that, notwithstandterms of dollars and cents if payment is ing section 98 (3.) of the Bills of Exchange Act, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, 10th to 12th February 1966, will be ""non-business "" days for banks. This is to enable banks to close for general banking business during the four days preceding C Day while their machines and banking records are being converted. The second provision relates to post-dated cheques, which are used extensively in hire purchase and similar agreements. There will be numbers of such cheques in existence after C Day still expressed in £ s. d. These will be validated provided they are certified by a banker to have been drawn before C Day. It will be desirable to ensure that cheques do not unnecessarily become stale by virtue of this procedure. After the end of the transition period, all transactions will need to be conducted in dollars and cents. Any references to amounts of £ s. d. in contracts, instruments, etc., entered into or made during the transition period, under the terms of clause 18(1.), will then be automatically converted into dollars and cents on an exact basis under the terms of clause 10. All payments after the end of the transition period will have to be in terms of dollars and cents, and clause 19 provides for any amounts of £ s. d. to be converted for this purpose on a nearest cent basis. It may help if I summarise the arrangements in the various stages of the conversion operation. BeforeC Day no decimal coins or notes will be legal tender and no document written in terms of dollars and cents will have any legal basis unless it is dated 14th February 1966 or later. AtC Day all £ s. d. amounts then actually owing will be converted into decimal currency on the nearest cent basis. References to £ s. d. amounts contained in laws, contracts, etc., with continuing force will be converted to decimals on an exact basis. Decimal currency will become the official currency on C Day, and decimal notes and coins will become legal tender from that time. FromC Day onwards, all cheques and other bills of exchange, and all promissory notes, must be executed in dollars and cents. During the transition period, contracts and other monetary transactions may be arranged in terms of either £ s. d. or dollars and cents. The amounts owing under such contracts and transactions must be settled in made by cheque. If payment is made by cash, and the amount owing is a multiple of sixpence or five cents, either £ s. d. or decimal notes and coins may be used, as these will be completely interchangeable for such amounts-the 5, 10 and 20-cent coins will, in fact, not only have exactly the same value as the existing sixpence, shilling and florin, but they will have exactly the same weight and will be virtually indistinguishable in diameter and colour. If odd pennies or cents are involved in cash payments due during the transition period, it will only be legally possible to settle these with the appropriate coins, that is threepences, pennies and halfpennies in payment of amounts less than sixpence and 1-cent and 2-cent coins in payment of decimal amounts less than 5 cents. After the end of the transition period all references to £ s. d. in contracts with continuing effect will be converted into decimals on an exact basis. Payments of amounts owing in terms of £ s. d. will however be made on a nearest-cent basis. After the end of the transition period, no contract or other document written in £ s. d. will have legal effect and threepences, pennies and halfpennies will be legal tender only in multiples of sixpence-as will have been the case during the transition period for banking transactions and for cash payments of decimal amounts. All£ s. d. notes and coins from sixpence upwards will continue to be legal tender on the same basis as decimal notes and coins. One minor change which has been made in the new BDI is the deletion of the previous sections 34 and 35 of the Currency Act 1963. These dealt with the use of the Trust Fund for the purchase of metal for coinage and the inclusion of unissued coin in the Treasurer's statements and accounts. It has been considered that these provisions would more conveniently be included in the Audit Act 1901-1964. An appropriate revision to that Act will be introduced later. I have already mentioned that most references to £ s. d. amounts in existing Commonwealth legislation can be construed after C Day as references to dollars and cents by virtue of the blanket provisions of the Currency Act, i.e., that all such references to £ s. d. amounts are in general to be converted on an exact basis, except that percentages expressed in money terms are to be construed as equivalent percentages in decimal currency. There are, however, a number of laws in which money references need to be specifically amended. A simple example is a reference to a return being submitted to the nearest pound; future returns in decimals will obviously need to be to the nearest dollar, rather than the nearest two dollars. There are several cases where references to odd amounts of pence need to be separately replaced by references to new decimal currency amounts rather than by their exact equivalent-for example, postal charges. About 30 acts will require minor revision in this way. Appropriate legislation will be introduced later in the session after a complete examination has been made of each and every reference to amounts of money in every act of Parliament. There are also a number of acts which will need specific amendment in due course to adjust rates and tariffs which are now expressed in £ s. d. amounts which do not convert easily into decimals. Separate legislation covering these matters will also be introduced later in the session. The Currency Bill has no application to the new decimal notes. I shall shortly be introducing a new Reserve Bank Bill to authorise the issue of demical notes on and after C Day. Honourable members would probably appreciate a brief run-down on progress made to date on the change-over arrangements. After its establishment in mid-1963 the Decimal Currency Board concentrated in the first place on the arrangements for converting £ s. d. cash registers, adding machines and accounting machines to decimal operation and, after settling most of the procedures for these and other monetary machines requiring conversion, has now reached a position where a public education programme over the period immediately preceding C Day-14t h February 1966-is one of its principal concerns. The machine conversion programme involves the free conversion-o r replacement-a t Government expense of more than 360,000 machines and the payment of cash compensation to owners of more than 120,000 machines. Owners will be able to apply this cash compensation either towards the conversion costs of existing £ s. d. machines or towards the cost of new decimal machines. Thus, the owners of nearly 500,000 machines will be receiving Government assistance in one form or another. The cost to last year's Budget was approximately £2 million-largel y expenses associated with pre-conversion preparations -and a further £15 million could be involved this year. We are hopeful that the cost to the Budget in the next two years combined will be kept below £10 million. These totals are considerably below the original estimate we made of the likely cost of the operation. The great bulk of the costs to the Government will be for the conversion of 240,000 cash registers, adding machines and accounting machines. As an indication of tbe variety of the other machines involved, free conversion or cash compensation will be available to owners of 100,000 petrol pumps, 80,000 price computing scales, and lesser numbers of franking machines, deposit recording machines, punched card tabulators and electronic computers, cheque writers, parking meters, ticket-issuing machines, price-computing fabric measuring machines, self service petrol pumps, coin counting machines and coin tube machines. Machines which will not be eligible for Government assistance include most coin vending machines, poker machines, gas meters, electricity meters and totalisators. The usual grounds for the exclusion of these machines have been the low unit cost for what in most cases is a comparatively simple conversion operation, or the impossibility of controlling and administering suitable compensation arrangements, remembering that the expenditure of public money would be involved. As the banks will be changing over completely to decimal operation by C Day, they have been given priority in the machine conversion arrangements. Conversion of bank machines has already commenced and the way now seems clear for the banks to operate in £ s. d. up to Wednesday, 9th February 1966, and, after closing down for normal business on Thursday, 10th February and Friday, l l t h February, to re-open in full decimal operation on Monday, 14th February. The most time-consuming part of the Decimal Currency Board's operations has been the negotiations with machine companies on conversion costs. Machine conversion costs to be met by the Government have largely been determined by the Board following detailed negotiations with the machine companies on the appropriate rates for cost elements such as direct labour and overhead, on prices for the machine parts needed, and on conversion times for each type of machine-estimate d by actual conversion studies using approved engineering techniques. When total costs for each group of machines have been ascertained, the cost will be spread over the number of machines to be converted, and payment will be made to the companies for each machine converted on the basis of a unit conversion rate. Because of the extent of the preparations required for machine conversion-leasin g and equipping of premises, training of staff, ordering machine parts and ""loan"" machines from overseas, and so on-and because of the limited capital resources of some of the converting companies, the Board is assisting them with temporary finance. These advances will be recouped by deductions from payments to be made later for conversion work. It is planned to replace certain machines with new decimal models, instead of converting them. This applies mainly to the less expensive models, and only where the cost of replacement does not exceed the estimated cost of conversion. The Board has so far approved the replacement of some 60,000 £ s. d. machines which would otherwise have been eligible for free conversion. The Board has authorised machine companies to order agreed quantities of "" loan "" cash registers, adding machines and accounting machines. These will be provided free to machine owners while their eligible £ s. d. machines are being converted at Government expense. Cash registers, adding machines and accounting machines will be converted on a regional zone basis, supervised by the Decimal Currency Board. The Board's plans for determining the zone programme are well advanced and should be published in the near future. Conversion of the machines will commence in each State simultaneously, and probably in three areas of each State at the same time-city , suburban and country. Detailed maps will be drawn up so that each machine owner will get a reasonable idea when his machines are likely to be picked up for conversion or replacement. Machines other than cash registers, adding machines and accounting machines will be converted separately from the zoning arrangements. Cash compensation payable to owners of cash registers, adding machines and accounting machines will be a proportion of the cost of converting a younger machine, the proportion payable diminishing as tbe age of the machine increases. Negotiations on conversion costs for this purpose have been completed with most companies and compensation rates for some 40,000 machines have already been published. Other rates will be published as soon as the conversion costs are settled with the companies concerned. It is planned to commence paying this cash compensation before the end of 1965. All details of Government decisions on free conversion and cash compensation, on decimal coins and notes, and on the changeover generally have been published and made available through the Decimal Currency Board's mailing list, through Commonwealth Treasury offices in each State and through banks, as well as through a large network of voluntary speakers set up by the Decimal Currency Board. The supply of material produced especially for schools commenced at the beginning of 1965. In all, it is planned to distribute 15,600,000 letters to school children, 160,000 manuals to their teachers and 120,000 posters to all schools throughout the country. A booklet designed to assist smaller businesses was recently distributed to approximately 50,000 businessmen who responded to newspaper advertisements placed by the Board. The Board's programme to inform the general public of the changeover arrangements involves a steady stream of information via newspapers, television, radio and other media which will culminate in a large scale publicity effort during January and February 1966. The concentration of effort during this latter period has been decided on the advice of an expert advisory committee. Every household in the country will receive at the time a special brochure describing the new arrangements, together with a conversion card suitable for shopping purposes. The results of a nation wide survey designed to measure the awareness of the general public and small businesses have been analysed, and the Board's forthcoming intensified education programme is being framed in the light of the information gained. Most Commonwealth departments will no counterparts in the new system, will change over to decimal operation on C have been almost completely replaced by Day in all transactions with the public and 1-cent and 2-cent coins by late 1967 or in all accounting arrangements with the early 1968.

Most State authorities will also be continuing use for them both in shopping changing over completely at C Day.

Six months after it was opened last February by His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh, the new Royal Australian Mint had struck its 100 millionth coin. ByC Day approximately 550 million decimal coins should be available, or nearly twice as many as the banks have requested by the changeover date. About 450 million of these coins will be 1-cent and 2-cent bronze coins produced in Canberra, Melbourne and Perth. In addition, there will be 30 million each of the 5, 10 and 20-cent cupro-nickel coins, produced in London, and 10-20 million of the silver 50-cent coin, to be minted in Canberra. Distribution of these coins to the banks will commence before Christmas, and the banks will commence distributing them to major bulk users of coins during the week before C Day. The testing time will come in the weeks following C Day, when the extent of the general public's demand for each of the new coins will first become evident. However, the three mints will be able to produce another 500 million or more coins in the following twelve months and this is expected to be adequate in the circumstances.

It might have seemed more appropriate to have paid some tribute there to the work of the Decimal Currency Board, but as this will be the key narrative to be read by those interested in the legislacontinuing effect to the provisions relating tion, I feel that this is the place where I should make a grateful acknowledgment of the splendid, devoted and most able work carried out by the Board and its officers under the chairmanship of Mr Walter Scott. Having said that I must, because of my great admiration for what they have done, add a tribute to the work of the Treasury officers who have been allocated to this great responsibility. We are, in the outline that 1 have given tonight to the House, taking a share as members of this Parliament in what is in a very real sense an historical change not merely in the currency but in the economic organisation of this country. I am quite certain that just as it has been many hundreds of years since such a change was made previously it will be a long time, if my experience of the work involved is any guide, before another government will essay this task in the future. So here we are debating a currency which will endure, T am convinced, for very many yearsperhaps centuries-to come. Because of that, I feel that the House may share something of my own gratification that we have reached this stage successfully. I heard only today that a dear lady, not getting it quite right, had described it as the ""dismal currency "". 1 hope it will not prove to be a dismal currency for this country, but a currency which will facilitate commercial transactions, which will prove a matter of convenience to the general public and which will facilitate the education of younger members of our own community. In that spirit I commend the BiU to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) BILL 1965. Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr Harold Second Reading. Treasurer) [8.42] I move That the Bill be now read a second time. As I have already explained in my second reading speech on the Currency Bill 1965, the purpose of this Bill, which I commend to honourable members, is merely to give to the Decimal Currency Board in the Currency Act 1963. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr Harold Holt, and read a first time. Second Reading. Treasurer) [8.44] 1 move That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill, which is complementary to the Currency Bill, is to amend the provisions of the Reserve Bank Act relating to the note issue to authorise the issue of decimal currency notes on and after 14th February 1966, the date of the changeover to a decimal currency system in Australia. Under the present Act the Reserve Bank of Australia is authorised to issue, through its Note Issue Department, Australian notes in denominations of 5s., 10s., £1, £5 and £10 or any multiple of £10. By clause 4 of the Bill, the provision specifying the denominations in which notes may be issued will be repealed and replaced from C-day by a new provision authorising the issue of Australian notes in any of the denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 or $50 or in such other denominations as the Treasurer determines. As I announced in August 1964 it is proposed initially to issue decimal currency notes in denominations of $1, $2, $10 and $20, the exact equivalents of the denominations of notes at present on issue. However,",47,Currency Bill 1965
126,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,,54,Reserve Bank Bill 1965
127,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"as I have indicated, the relevant new provision will leave scope for the issue of notes ments. The Government therefore invited in additional denominations. In particular, consideration will be given to the issue of a $5 note should that become desirable. It is possible that there will be a continuing need to issue notes in existing denominations during the transition period. Accordingly clause 7 of the Bill provides for the necessary authority for their continued issue from C Day until a date to be fixed by proclamation. The present Act provides that Australian notes are a legal tender throughout Australia. This provision will continue to apply to notes in existing denominations issued prior to C Day and, by virtue of a proposed amendment in the Bill to the definition of ""Australian note"", will apply to the new decimal currency notes. The Bill also provides that notes in existing denominations issued during the transition period will be legal tender. Printing of the new design decimal notes commenced earlier this year and the production schedule of the Reserve Bank's Note Printing Branch provides for adequate supplies of all denominations to be available to meet requirements from C Day. For security reasons, full details of the new notes, including official reproductions, will not be issued until shortly before C Day. Unless notes of existing denominations are specially requested, banks will confine issues from C Day to the new decimal notes, and it is expected that the majority of the notes at present in circulation will be replaced by the new decimal notes in a relatively short period. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. Ministerial Statement. Territories) -by leave I wish to inform the House that the Government has now reached a decision on proposals submitted for the development of the main bauxite deposits at Gove in the Northern Territory. In June 1964 proposals before development of grounds that no met the Government's major policy requireinterested companies to submit new or revised proposals and stipulated that they should be lodged by 1st December 1964. The closing date was subsequently extended to 15th March 1965. The policy objectives then stated by the Government included an immediate firm commitment for an alumina plant in the Northern Territory of not less than 300,000 tons conditional only on the ore body proving to meet certain requirements with regard to quantity and quality of ore; provision for Australian equity participation in the project; a clear demonstration of availability of adequate market outlets and ability to organise and finance the project; a willingness by applicants to establish an aluminium smelter in the Territory when this could be done on a demonstrably economic basis; and a preparedness to respect the rights of the Aborigines in the area. The Government recognised the very real advantages in having one or more major and experienced Australian organisations sharing in the development rather than leaving it entirely to overseas interests. In the event two Australian groups of companies submitted proposals. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd. submitted a proposal in association with Reynolds Metals Company of the United States of America and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Ltd. as the major Australian company in Nabalco Pty. Ltd., comprising several Australian companies, submitted a proposal in association with Swiss Aluminium Ltd. Each of these proposals involved firm commitments for the development of the bauxite deposits which were considerably more comprehensive than those contained in any of the earlier rejected proposals. After careful deliberation the Government decided that the proposal by Nabalco Pty. Ltd. should be preferred and is discussing with the company the detailed arrangements to give effect to their proposal. Swiss Aluminium Ltd. is the oldest and ranks amongst the largest integrated aluminium companies in the world. The company has undertaken to conthe Government rejected struct at Gove by 1971 an alumina plant it at that time for the with an annual capacity of not less than these deposits on the 500,000 tons. The completed alumina plant, one proposal sufficiently plus associated mining, wharf and township",54,Reserve Bank Bill 1965
128,Mr Barnes (Mcpherson,"Minister forfacilities, is expected to cost nearly £50 million. It will provide direct employment for about 800 people and support a population of about 3,000. It will yield export income at an estimated rate in excess of £10 million per annum. Nabalco will also examine and report on the economic feasibility of aluminium smelting in the Northern Territory, and will build a smelter if an adequate supply of continuous low cost electricity is available. The Australian companies which together with the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd. at present hold a 50 per cent, interest in Nabalco Pty.

The Mutual Life and Citizen's Assurance Co. Ltd. Peko-Wallsend Investments Ltd.

Under the existing statutory provisions the royalty would be about Is. per ton of bauxite mined and would be paid into a trust fund for the general benefit of the Aborigines in the Territory. The company has undertaken to respect the rights of Aborigines in the Gove area and will provide them with suitable employment opportunities. The main bauxite deposits referred to above are also known as the central lease or former Special Mineral Lease No. 1. The perimeter leases, Nos. 2, 3 and 4, are held by Gove Mining and Industrial Corporation Ltd., a subsidiary of the Pechiney Co. of France, who have been unable to meet the conditions in these leases. This company has been granted a short additional period to submit to the Government an alternative development proposal. The Gove project is an historical event for the Northern Territory. It assures establishment in the Northern Territory of an important and major industrial complex. It will introduce into Australia and the Northern Territory a large overseas company of world standing and offers to a strong group of Australian business enterprises an important stake in northern development.

The Australian Labour Party is pledged to a policy to protect the workers and the producers in Australia. For that reason, we support this Bill which gives the growers an opportunity to adopt an enlightened plan be acknowledged that many people in the industry are uncertain about what they should do at the coming referendum. Some believe that they are now paying a sufficient amount for promotion and research in the wool industry and are reluctant to pay the additional 1 per cent, that they would be required to pay for the wool reserve prices plan. There are big men in the industry whose financial ties to commerce are stronger than their ties to the wool earning capacity of their industry. It must always be remembered that the little men are the ones who are hurt when wool prices fall. Obviously, the correct course is being followed in referring this question to the wool growers so that, by their votes at the referendum, they may determine whether to adopt the reserve prices plan or to continue with the present system. Many self-appointed experts today presume to speak for the industry. Some of them are nominees of vested interests who seek to intimidate the Government and",55,Northern Territory Gov E Bauxite Deposits
129,Mr Luchetti (Macquarie) [8.55j,"honourable members of this House. An incessant publicity campaign throughout Australia has been directing attention to alleged weaknesses, raising doubts, causing confusion and generally creating uncertainty. This opposition has undoubtedly caused uncertainty in many places and it is to be hoped that, with the distribution of information, both in favour of the plan and against it, wool growers will be able to make up their minds calmly, coolly and dispassionately on a matter of very great concern to this country. The subject we are considering at this time is the holding of a referendum. It is not the reserve prices plan, but the referendum. We are considering whether there should be a referendum, whether the growers should have an opportunity to vote upon this matter and whether they should be given the opportunity to determine which scheme they want.

They have not said how they would eliminate the nefarious operator who exploits the growers and cheats the nation with his pies and arrangements. In the main, the people who oppose the reserve price plan also oppose restrictive trade practices legislation. They have been opposed to every progressive action in respect of the wool industry. One can look back over the years and see that they were opposed to the scouring of wool, the carbonising of wool and the spinning of wool; they did not want appraisal centres in country areas; and they opposed the retention of Goulburn as a wool selling centre. It was left to the Labour Governthe honourable member for Eden-Monaro won its reward and Goulburn was retained out our heritage in wool for the mess of There is a need for legislation to protect That the Reserve Price shalt not be moved not be moved down in subsequent years. Whilst it may be possible to increase a Reserve Price without immediate consequences in times of good demand and rising prices, the possibility of a reduction in times of slack demand would shatter the confidence of wool users in the stability of this scheme and so defeat its own end. That statement is an important and authoritative one. It is the view of people who use the fibre. Responsible people in Australia are putting forward similar points of view. There is the view of the growers. Then there are men, such as Sir John honourable members opposite want to perCrawford, who advocate a reserve price petuate in this country. Surely the time has plan. There is also the unanimous viewcome to get rid of this nefarious practice point of the members of the United which robs the growers and the nation and Farmers and Wool growers Association, deprives Australia of an income to which supporting a reserve price plan and realisit is entitled.

Of course, it does not exist. prices on the future of wool as a textile fibre is expressed in the annual report of the British Wool Marketing Board. All of these people pay attention to the urgent need to deal with this matter not only in the interests of the growers but in the interests of the industry itself. Everyone who has given any thought at all to this matter must realise that, whereas the synthetic fibre has a constant price and the people who use it can look ahead for months or years with certainty as to price, that cannot be done in regard to wool. When we look at the wool industry we see a constant fall, in the price of wool in recent times. This staggering and disturbing situation has been brought about by the operation of pies. As we all know, the inquiry conducted by Mr Justice. Cook proved .beyond any shadow of doubt the operation of pies. Wool growers must judge whether they should consider what was revealed by that inquiry. The Wool Marketing Committee of Inquiry, under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Philp, could only invite evidence, whereas the Cook inquiry was a judicial hearing with powers to summon witnesses and to compel evidence Mr Justice Cook said in his report. . . pies are a negation of the free auction system. One witness, Mr Monier, who is an executive of a leading wool buying firm, was examined in the witness box during the Cook inquiry. He said that, if any buying firm found that it was being regularly subjected to competition from other buyers for particular types of wool, it sought to join with those competitors in a pie. He said clearly that the sole purpose of doing that was to obtain wool more cheaply. That is the sort of system that some Cook inquiry indicated that many pies confree auction? Where is this system of comThe. consequence of all of this is that the price of wool has been falling constantly to the detriment of the growers and of the nation. Last year the price of wool fell by ls. per lb. on the previous year's price. That cost Australia £72 million; in other words, it reduced our national income by that amount. In the previous year income from wool represented 35 per cent, of our national income. Last year income from wool represented 31 per cent, of our national income. I shall quote some very interesting figures from "" Wool Facts"", which is compiled by the Australian Wool growers and Graziers Council. The average price per lb. of greasy wool, as provided by the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers, fell from 59.64d. in 1964-65 to 51.36d. in 1965-66. The wool price index, based on a figure of 100 in 1946-47, fell from 229.6 in 1964-65 to 208.2 in 1965-66. The figures for the quantity of wool sold and the amount realised show that our income from wool is diminishing. The quantity and value of wool exported in the month of July, as shown in Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics figures, moved from 124 million lb. valued at £33 million in 1964-65 to 138 million lb. valued at £31 million, or £2 million less, in 1965-66. Those figures are indicative of the whole of the unhappy will help to develop the wool selling picture in regard to the fall in wool prices. organisation.

130,Mr Turner (Bradfield) [9.16],"Per honourable member for Mackellar ( Mrmember for Mackellar, there should be a fair and square choice so far as the growers are concerned. That is a matter that this House must determine. It must see to it that the measure will ensure that there is a fair and square choice for the wool growers. Nobody here suggests that the matter should not be determined by the wool growers, but we must ensure that these conditions do obtain. Secondly, I suggest that not only the wool man one vote and one vote one value. I industry but also this Parliament should be concerned to see that the public purse is properly safeguarded, because the taxpayer is to be called upon to provide very substantial sums of money for the plan. I suppose that any sensible person would conclude that this should not be a matter of .the wool growers filling in a blank cheque. This is a matter for the Parliament, as the guardian of the taxpayers-includin g even the constituents of Bradfield. This is a proper and legitimate matter for the concern of every member of this Parliament. The wool industry is a great industry, perhaps the greatest industry in this country. mittee of Inquiry, which comprised Sir Its export earnings amount to something of the order of £400 million pounds a year. Therefore, it is legitimate for all responsia sizeable volume. In fact, it runs into someble people in this communityI hope that members of this Parliament are among them-to look to the welfare of the industry. However, so far as this aspect of the matter is concerned, I do not think that we here should claim to be wiser than the -growers themselves, whose own interests are likely to coincide with the interests of the community. Therefore, I will not address myself to the third point but I will indeed address myself to the other two pointsthat the referendum should be fair and square and that the public purse should be safeguarded. There should be a fair choice. It is said that the Australian Wool Industry Conference is representative of the industry and that the franchise that is proposed for those who are to take part in this referendum emerges from the deliberations and decisions of the Australian Wool Industry Conference. I do not want to canvass this, although some honourable members have done so, but I am indeed delighted to find that the members of the Country Party have at hst come to the conclusion that the view they took of the redistribution proposals was wrong. On that occasion they took the viewI did not agree with them and I expressed my disagreement-that a person who happened to live in a country area should have a more valuable vote than one who lived in a city. Now they are being democratic. They say that, irrespective of whether a man produces 10 bales or 100 bales of wool, he is entitled to one vote. They now agree with the principle of one am delighted with this change of heart because I have no doubt that, with the consistency that I would expect of them, they will now alter their view on the question of redistribution. If they do not, I shall certainly direct attention to their lack of consistency. I have no objection to what is proposed now but I did have a very strong objection to what they did in connection in the other matter. As to the informed nature of the choice, I have in one hand the report of what has been briefly called the Philp Committee. It is the report of the Wool Marketing ComRoslyn Philp, as Chairman, and two other distinguished gentlemen. The report is quite thing like 186 pages. That Committee went at some length into the question of the marketing of wool by the means at present proposed and advanced a reasoned case. Honourable members, if they wish, may do as the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) did and dismiss the report by saying that it was prepared by conservative minded gentlemen. But those of us who pay some regard to a reasoned case coming from impartial people will attach some weight to this report. In. my other hand I have the report and recommendations of the Australian Wool Board. That is a rather slim volume, running into 23 pages, and that part of it which deals with a marketing scheme of the kind that is now proposed runs into precisely one and a half pages. It is not what one would call a reasoned report, but the wool growers are now supposed to make up their minds on the basis of one and a half pages in that report. Of course, under the relevant legislation the Australian Wool Board was required to seek the advice and opinion of a special committee, consisting partly of members of itself and partly of other people. I am not an expert on the wool industry, but I did notice one or two distinguished names amongst the members of that committee. For instance, I noticed that Sir John Crawford was one of the members. many sheep he has, but he has plenty of brains. I noticed also the name of my distinguished constituent, David Campbell, who happens to live in Bradfield. I do not know whether that would put him out of court. I do not know the other gentlemen, but I imagine that they were people of some consequence. We have sought to get a copy of the report of that committee. We presume that it is a reasoned report. This is a very important matter to the wool industry and to the whole economy of Australia, but this report has never been produced, nor has any good reason been advancedI do not want to go through the rather foolish reasons that have been advanced-as to why it should not have been produced. Are the wool growers, then, being given a fair opportunity to form a proper judgment? They have been denied the opportunity of seeing the report of that committee. There have been suggestions in some quarters that the report differs only in three words-wha t those three words are nobody knows-fro m the one and a half pages in the report of the Australian Wool Board. I do not know what the three words are, but I can imagine that they could make a substantial difference. For example, three of the Ten Commandments say ""Thou shalt not kill"", ""Thou shalt not steal"" and "" Thou shalt not commit adultery"". You have only to leave out three words and the sense is substantially altered. I am still dealing with the opportunity ralian Wool Board. Further, I understand that the wool growers have to form a proper that there was a suggestion that the Wool judgment on this matter. I submit it iz the Board had no mandate to use its funds for responsibility of this Parliament to see that this purpose. Many wool growers who are they are given an opportunity to do this. A opposed to this scheme subscribed their high pressure campaignI think that would funds for the promotion of wool but they be a fair description-ha s been conducted found that these funds were being used by the Australian Wool Board and . by a for the promotion of a case with which gentleman who is alleged in some sections they disagreed. But the Attorney-General, of the Press to have referred to my friend I understand, refused his fiat, as the lawyers the honourable member for Parkes( Mr would call it. 1 think this is a Latin Hughes), my friend the honourable member expression, fiat justitia, which means that for Mackellar and. even myself as being he writes "" let justice be done "" and then fools. This, of course, I cannot there is permission. understand. I find it very difficult to believe, although sometimes I have been able to withhold unqualified admiration of the mental capacity of the gentleman who is alleged to have made that statement. I am still speaking about the opportunity that wool growers have had of being fully informed, or rather the opportunity that has been denied them. I have in my hand here a cutting of a letter addressed to the Melbourne "" Age"" on Tuesday 7th September 1965. The letter says thisWhen the draft of the Wool Board's wool marketing report was issued last May, the introduction contained the following passage:"" The board has no desire to withhold any information it has on wool marketing from wool growers, and it would be a considerable help to the board if industry leaders and organisations will ask for all the information which thcy need to help the growers make an informed vote "". The writer goes onI took note of this appeal for help, and on June 2, 1965, addressed a letter to the chairman of the board seeking additional informationon certain mattersTo date I have received none of the informution I have sought. The writer continuedI note the above passage has been dropped from the revised report, dated July, 1965, which the board is now distributing to wool growers . . . The letter was signed by Cecil H. Lander who described himself as President of the Graziers Association of Riverina. So, the Board no longer wishes to provide information that growers might wish to have. This suggests a high pressure campaign.

Let us have a look at long term trends. HereI wish to speak about something that as member for Bradfield I may be presumed to know. I am talking about the wool industry but about things I know. I know, for example, that wool is being used less today than it was in days gone by. I know this from personal experience. My wife is able to shrink a pair of woollen socks to the size of a baby's bootees in three simple washes. I have not used woollen socks for years. I hope Sir William will suppose that I know this intimate detail myself even though I am a member for a city electorate. Again, I have sometimes tried to wash a woollen garment, and 1 can shrink it as well as my wife can. Some people suffer from the tickling effect of wool. I know that wool is not the only thing that tickles. But this is a trouble that some people have when they wear wool. AgainI can never keep creases in my trousers. IfI go out on a wet day, the creases disappear and the trousers have to be sent to the dry cleaner. WheneverI go to the cupboard at the end of the season to take my suit out I wonder whether the moths have corrupted it. Wool therefore is not the wonderful thing that many people think. It is for this and other reasonssteady prices and so forth-that more and more synthetics are being used. I hope Sir William will even suppose that I have some elementary knowledge of economics-ver y elementary; it relates to simple matters of supply and demand. If wool were a monopoly, it may be that we could demand something like our own price or a price that would give us the maximum profit. It is true to say that the supply of wool cannot be regulated as readily as the supply of many manufactured products can be regulated, for the fact is that wool has not a monopoly, because it is in competition with synthetics. The same sort of thing happened with coal. For years after the war, the people of New South.Wales were held to ransom by the coal miners, particularly those of Newcastle, because the miners were able to regulate the supply of coal, since they had a monopoly. But since fuel oil F.10615/65 -R -[35 ] has disappeared and the supply and the price I come to the conclusion, therefore, that there are very great dangers that if this scheme escalates"" evolves "", I think, is the word that Sir William Gunn has used-int o a radical scheme, the taxpayers may well be called on to provide large sums to finance it. This is the kind of thing that happens in political communities. If this happens, there may well be very substantial losses as a result. This is a serious matter for the community as a whole. But let it not be thought that this can happen easily. There is, of course, one kind of auction with which, I think, some of my friends agree-the auctioning of votes. If it is thought that millions can be got out of the taxpayers, then the auction is on. But wool is not like wheat, butter and sugar. We consume a considerable proportion of our wheatunless we send it to our friends in Red China, of course-ou r dairy products and our sugar in this country. We can impose special home consumption prices to provide funds out of which producers can be paid subsidies. But we use only a relatively small proportion of our wool on the home market. Even if I were compelled to wear woollen socks, and if all of us were compelled to wear woollen socks and other woollen clothing so as to boost our consumption of wool as far as we could in this country, the proportion of our output consumed here would be small, and taxes, so to speak, of the kind that can be imposed by special home consumption prices on other commodities could not be imposed in respect of wool. There would come a time when the taxpayer, if he had to provide subsidies out of Consolidated Revenue, might find that he was breaking down under the burden. So let it not be thought that if a radical scheme should prove to involve losses the taxpayers can be called on to bear them. This simply cannot happen. I suppose that if wool-the product of the last great primary industry-become s the subject of a subsidy, one might say, slightly paraphrasing the words of Gilbert: ""When everybody subsidises somebody, then nobody subsidises anybody "". We are now waiting for the report of the Committee of Economic Inquiry, commonly known as the Vernon Committee, Sir. I hope that that Committee will have something to say about continually rising costs in Australia and their effect on our exports. I hoped that the Government, before introducing a measure that could alter the very nature of our greatest industry, would wait till it had produced the Vernon Committee's report in this Parliament. But it has not thought fit to do so. These are great considerations that are important to all of us as members of the Parliament: The wool growers should have a fair opportunity. They should hear all sides of the case. And they should vote accordingly. I believe that their best interests are the best interests of this country, and there need be no clash in this. But I make no apology whatever, though I am the representative of Bradfield, for saying a few words on this matter. Deputy Speaker, I have much pleasure in have obtained, except at certain times. I supporting this Bill, which provides for a believe that this is because of the methods referendum of wool growers to determine adopted in the marketing of wool. whether they accept a reserve price plan. Without doubt, the wool industry is the greatest industry that Australia has seen up about the various systems of marketing to this point in our history. I believe that primary products. The return received it will remain so for a considerable time. depends largely on the system adopted. We This industry has not been without its probknow that various marketing systems are lems since it was established in Australia associated with a variety of commodities. many years ago. Indeed, it has had many The choosing of the right method of marups and downs. The fluctuations that have keting is an important exercise.

They have been reflected in our of evidence in various parts of the world general economy and in the very nature of to show that wrong methods of marketing Australia as a nation, and there has been are reflected not only in the economy of much detriment to the grazing industry as the country concerned but also in the situaa whole. Prices havefluctuatedwidely from tion of the individual producers, whether time to time and on many occasions we the commodity concerned be a grain, a food have seen extremely low wool prices, both or a fibre. It is important to bear in mind before and since World War II . In these that any marketing system that we adopt circumstances, there has been a tendency should not adversely affect the individual to mine out to some extent in order to keep producer. This can and will happen if the going. This is said not only by me. It has wrong system is chosen. been said by many people in the past. I bring it to the attention of the House tonight because I believe that we have no right to schemes have been built up by the producers sell commodities such as wool overseas at prices which are not adequate and which do not give the grower a reasonable return Here, I wish to make the important point and thereby enable him to operate in a business like manner. The honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) has given to me and probably to other honourable members the impression that he believes that wool is not the great commodity that we think it is. Let me assure him that wool is selling today in more places throughout the world and in bigger quantities than ever before. There is a tremendous demand for wool. Let us not underestimate the value of this remarkable fibre, not only to Australia but also to the rest of the world. I consider that this situation will continue, Sir. I do not believe that there has been at any time a falling off in the demand for wool. At the end of the last war, there was a tremendous stockpile of wool, not only in Australia but throughout the world. Today, in general terms, no such stockpile is available. Our wool is going almost straight from the sheep's back to the final user. This situation speaks for itself. There has been a great demand over the years for this fibre, but this demand Here, I should like to say something Australia has accepted certain marketing proposals over the years. These marketing themselves through their organisationsthat these schemes have not been brought",63,Referendum Bill 1965
135,Mr Hallett (Canning) [9.44],"Mr has not been reflected in the prices that weabout as a result of political pressure or pressure from governments or outside bodies. And pressure should not be allowed to innuence any decision on the proposed reserve price plan for wool. The Government looks to the organisations of wool producers for advice on this matter. It has said that it does this, and it does do it. The Australian Wool Industry Conference was established in 1962 and was accepted by the Government and subsequently recognised in legislation. Through this organisation the line goes right back to the individual grower. We know that many wool growers throughout Australia do not belong to the organisations represented in the Wool Industry Conference, but there is nothing in this wide world to compel them to do so. This Wool Industry Conference, or the organisations which make it up, composed finally of individual wool growers, is an important factor in determining any marketing programme that might be brought before this House. The wool growers themselves, in other words, have told the Government that they consider that it is time that this country introduced a different system of marketing for the disposal of the Australian wool clip, and it is on this that the whole legislation is based. The Government itself has not said that a new system should be introduced, it has simply supported the views of the wool producers. While we continue to listen to the growers and maintain a system of orderly organisations, placing the responsibility on the practical people who understand primary industries, we will not in any way damage primary industries nor will we damage the economy of Australia. In this connection I ask honourable memviews on the kind of system that should be bers to cast their minds back a number introduced we may finally wreck the of years to the time when we had a similar growers' organisations. This would represent proposal in respect of wheat marketing. a complete tragedy, and the onus would be Some honourable members and many people entirely on the Government to rectify outside this Parliament have said that there a position that would then amount to is no similarity between wheat and wool, utter chaos. There have been similar results but I maintain there is a similarity in the in other parts of the world and this Governmatter of organised marketing. It is the ment does not wish to be placed in such an system we adopt that is important. We have invidious position. I am convinced that those heard of various systems that have been who express opposition to the plan and to adopted in many parts of the world. We the Wool Industry Conference should conhave been told of huge surpluses having sider this point very closely. Do they believe been built up. But if we look closely at that they can set themselves up as being those marketing systems we find that they above the industry itself? are entirely different from the systems in Australia. We were told years ago when we introduced an orderly marketing system for wheat that there would be tremendous stockpiles. People said that the system would not work. At that time there were vast quantities of wheat in Australia and it did appear to the outsider that the new system would not work, but this has proved to be completely wrong. Although the last season was almost a record wheat season for Australia, we have sold the entire wheat crop, and I think that Australia at present is somewhat short of wheat, and certainly has not a surplus. This position has been brought about by the introduction of a certain marketing system. That is the point I wish to stress because it is important in relation to wool. Many people have been saying that the proposed plan is a bad one. The bullets are being fired at the Wool Industry Conference and at the representatives of the Australian wool growers. Let me say that there are some jolly fine men in these organisations, men who have spent a tremendous amount of time for the good of the industry and the good of Australia. These men should receive consideration and backing because they know the real crux of the trouble in the wool industry. If they do not know it marketing through growers' nobody else does. In some cases these men have spent a lifetime in studying the problems of the wool industry, l f we continue to look to the growers in Australia to devise a marketing plan we will not make a mistake. But if, as some people suggest we should, we do the reverse, do not look to the growers and do not accept their This proposal, as I have said, is in the national interest. We cannot afford fo allow wool to come onto the market regardless of the demand at a particular time. Much has been said about the free auction system which operates at the moment and which will continue to operate for a considerable time if this plan is tossed out by thc growers at' the forthcoming referendum. As to the free auction system I merely ask: Freedom for whom? Has the wool grower any freedom, any choice aS to what he may do with his wool? What freedom has he? He can put a reserve price on his wool if he likes, but people who know the industry as I do, having been in it all my life, realise of orderly marketing at a price. Many other that such a move is almost fatal. No wool grower in Australia would argue that point. The only thing the grower can do is put a reserve price on his wool, but he has no protection whatsoever. The only freedom in the system, as 1 see it, is for the handful of buyers who can pay for the product whatever they feel it is worth to them at the time. There is no other freedom at all. You have a hundred thousand or so individuals in Australia trying to sell a commodity, and what chance have they against world competition? Is this good enough in today's circumstances? Have we not an obligation in the national interest to sell our grain or our fibre, in whatever market it is sold, in some sort of orderly fashion, to suit not only the producer but also the end user, the manufacturer at the other end? This we have not been doing. There has been a lot of talk about stockpiling. Raw material industries, or other industries for that matter, never seem to have serious worries about stockpiling. As a matter of fact if one cares to analyse the situation one finds that most industries cannot operate without some reserves. This applies in practically every field. In considering the desirability or otherwise of orderly marketing it is well to look at the position in various industries. Oil is a raw material. Would the oil companies last five minutes if they had no orderly system for selling tbeir product? There are fixed prices in the oil industry. There is, if you like, competition between different oil companies, but the industry as a whole has a system of marketing to combat the effects of fluctuations in demands throughout Australia. The consumers know that they can get a drum of oil when they want it. This is a system of orderly selling at a price. The steel industry would not last five minutes if it had an auction system for selling its product on world markets or the Australian market. Experience has shown us that fluctuations in price would be fatal to the wheat industry if Australian growers were not protected by an orderly marketing system. Tremendous quantities of superphosphate are used throughout Australia. Here we have a raw material which is fed onto the market from time to time, not in regular quantities throughout the year but according to seasonal requirements. In respect of that commodity there is a system commodities are in a similar position. I could refer to the timber industry the cement industry and many others. Any of those industries that function on a business like basis have some system of orderly marketing that is reasonably sound. One of the most important aspects of this proposal is that the growers themselves should make the final decision, and this, of course, is what the Bill is about. A considerable amount of propaganda of various types has come from various sources, one of which was Pitt Street. One piece of propaganda is headed: ""Don't let the Wool Board treat us like sheep"". I do not know whether that is a reference to Pitt Street or to us. However, the wool growers of Australia have been through many adverse conditions and I feel that when the day comes to make a decision on this scheme they will not consider that they have been treated like sheep. I believe that wool growers throughout Australia-ther e are almost 100,000 of them-wil l sit down and think about the plan. Many men will remember what happened in 1951, and many will remember what has happened since then because they have been through some rather difficult times since 1951. The wool growers realise that they are producing a fibre which is of great value, which is required in many parts of the world and which has a great future. Through research and promotion, and with assistance from the Government, the industry can improve the situation for wool. The industry has already been doing so. As I have mentioned previously, there is a great and ever increasing demand for wool. In discussions and negotiations with end users overseas, when I have asked for their opinion of the present situation in Australia chaos, which is the only word that can be in relation to the marketing of this great product they have said that they cannot function as businessmen while they are buying a raw material which fluctuates in price to the extent that wool does. They know, as we know, that they must budget for a raw material and must be able to budget for a year ahead in order to be able to run a business properly. But when they are buying wool from Australia they cannot do this, for a number of reasons. They cannot place an order in Australia for large quantities of wool because at the moment it becomes available it simply goes to the market and is this point of time? We have had some exsold. But what price it will fetch is anybody's guess. There is no relation between the price of the finished article and the price paid for the raw product. This is another important point. If the price of wool falls by 20 per cent, we do not see a corresponding fall of 20 per cent, in the price of suits. The price of the wool in a suit or in any other article made from wool is very small when compared with the price of that commodity. Because of price fluctuations the manufacturer does not know where he stands. As I have already pointed out, so far as I know wool is the only commodity among the raw materials which fluctuates in price from day to day and week to week. The competitor of wool, as honourable members know, is synthetics. There is room for wool and for synthetics. We must accept that there is room for all these protion of some of the other machinery which ducts. The competition from synthetics does not worry me to any great extent. Although we must bear in mind the importance of synthetics, I feel that wool will have a place with us for many years. If honourable members look at graphs and other information which is available they will see that synthetics do not fluctuate in price from week to week. Their price is quite stable and has been stable for some considerable time. As a result, the manufacof wool that these stores have been mainturer who uses synthetics has an advantage because he can budget from year to year. He knows exactly what he will have to pay for his raw material. This is an important point in relation to this Bill. But the main point is that the growers have proposed this scheme. They have requested the Government to assist them by introducing this legislation so as to bring some order out of used to describe the present marketing system in the wool industry. In recent years the average wool grower in Australia has faced difficult times because of the prices he has received for his product. The very big growers have not been affected to nearly the same extent. When looking at this reserve price scheme I ask honourable members to consider what was wrong with the reserve price system in the period under the Joint Organisation. What difficulties would prevent the reintroduction of that system at perience of this system. Many statements have been made to suggest that we do not know enough about the plan that is proposed, but this plan has been with us for many years so those in the wool industry have had an opportunity to study it. There may have been some alterations to the plan and there will be further alterations. No plan is perfect when it is first introduced. But the principle and the system of orderly marketing using a reserve price plan have been with us. They were with us in 1951 when a referendum was held. We knew the general principles of the scheme. Of course, there are financial aspects which have been mentioned and which I agree are extremely important, but if the wool industry of Australia is not a good guarantee for security, I would like to know what is. I have not heard during the debate menwill be necessary to bring the wool scheme to a satisfactory conclusion if it is introduced by the growers. To mention one matter, I point out that wool stores will be required. We have had them since the last war. It has not been easy at times to hang on to these stores. They have been quite profitable to the wool industry and they have been of great use to Australia as a whole. But it is one aspect of the marketing tained and kept in good order and condition throughout Australia and are there ready for use if required. I say to the House and to the wool growers: Let us not be frightened at the prospect of a little surplus of wool being held in Australia. I believe that a surplus will do more good than harm. This has been proved in practically every other organised industry within Australia. I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill. be grateful if you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would give me your indulgence and the House would give me its indulgence for a moment or two to say a word about the late Sir Roslyn Philp because his name has been used very much during the course of this debate. I am sure that it would not be out of place or untoward if some reference was made to this very distinguished Australian. Sir Roslyn Philp was a person of remarkable intellectual refinement. He had great personal charm, and he served his State of Queensland and Australia in a number of ways. It was no ordeal for a junior and inexperienced member of the Bar to appear before him because he was the very essence of understanding. He knew the sense of timidity that beset a person in Bill should have been drafted with precision an environment for the first time. But, by the same token, woe betide any counsel who appeared before him with any evidence of slipshod homework or with any idea of taking a rise out of the Court. It fell to my great fortune to know Sir Roslyn Philp very well. I saw him in the closing weeks of his life. He was a person who showed tremendous courage. I have never seen such courage displayed by any one man. He knew he was dying and he accepted that, not with any regret at all but with that sort of grace that literally shames one that a person can be so resigned in mind and body. Now he is gone and he stands in the history of this country as a person who was a remarkable and a very devoted servant of it. It is not for me to spell out his life's work, but the For my part, I admit that the omnipresence collection of words "" Honour above all ""it was not his personal motto-migh t account for his life's attainment. This country is certainly much poorer for his passing, and I have no doubt that another world has been very much enriched by his presence. Turning to the Bill, may I say that it is regarded as a sort of venerated sheep. a measure for which I have remarkably little Indeed, what may be today's venerated sheep enthusiasm? I hope in saying that that no person on either side of the House will draw the conclusion that I am opposed to any proposition being put to a collection of presumably regards himself as part of the people and asking them for their adjudication. I should hope that my old friend the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr ments about people. Adermann)-and if he will pardon me for saying so, I have probably known him a little longer than the majority of persons in this place, and it will probably strike a homely note if I say, without telling tales out of school, that we first met in the back bar of Butler's pub in Surat-wil l not be upset by my saying that I have little enthusiasm for this Bill. My lack of enthusiasm is not for the aspect of putting the question before the wool growers of Australia and asking them to say whether they are for it or against it; my reluctance springs from the fact that the Bill is a most extraordinary conglomeration of quaint principles and stark shortcomings. The Bill deals with what I submit is Australia's most important industry. I think it would be a tolerable display of presumption for me to say that that being the case the being uppermost in the mind of every person involved. Unhappily, I find in so many respects such a quality of impreciseness that I wonder very deeply about the ultimate consequences of this lack of capacity to draw a line between A and B. May I interrupt myself and punctuate my remarks by making a reference or two here and there to that august body the Australian Wool Board? The Board was set up by a statute of this Parliament. That may seem nothing very earth shattering, but I think it deserves to be stated that it was set up by a statute of this Parliament, and that in a very real sense the proposals that find themselves residing in this Bill find, in turn, their fountain of origin in the Australian Wool Board. of the Chairman of the Wool Board would lead one to the possible conclusion that a familiar biblical precept is now to be changed and henceforth will be: "" God and the Wool Board temper the wind to the shorn lamb."" Nevertheless, I am reluctant to concede that the Wool Board should be could turn out to be tomorrow's cold chump chop.

The Chairman of the Wool Board makes all sorts of extravagant statements and then hands are raised. honourable member? is bleating over there. He always bleats, and I wonder why. Haworth) -Order! The honourable member will address the Chair and take no notice of interjections. rupt myself to say to the honourable member him up-that if I were drafting sheep and he came down the race I would unhesitatingly let him through-wit h the wethers. I was dealing with the Chairman of the Australian Wool Board who has taken it upon himself to say some rather extravagant things about various members of this Parliament. I do not think there can reasonably be any complaint from him or from any of his colleagues if his extravagance is called into check. Having said that, I bring myself to say that in recent times the Australian Wool Board has been engaging in activities which, in my respectful submission, are completely outside its powers. It has employed public relations officers for the purpose of encouraging people to support one attitude with respect to the reserve price plan. In the normal course of events one could have no complaint about this, but I remind the House that we are dealing with a statutory boarda board set up by a statute of this Parliament. This is a board that has resorted to advertising to bill its principal speaker. It is a board that has, I am informed, employed a psychologist, and even a sociologist for the purpose of encouraging people to support one particular attitude. In the normal course of events there could be no cause for complaint about this at all, but this is a statutory board and I hope that honourable members will be seized of the importance of recognising the nature of a statutory board. The Australian Wool Board is using wool reasons and should not be left in any doubt. growers' funds and it so happens that many wool growers have views that are in complete opposition to those of the Chairman of the Board and of various members of the Board. It is their entitlement to be in opposition. I venture the view that it is more than passing strange to see one's money being spent by a board on purposes for which that board was not set up. I invite the House to look at section 24 of the Wool Industry Act to try to find a comfortable resting place for the various activities in which the Australian Wool Board has engaged. This, in my view, is a matter of substance and of plain principle. No board can exercise powers that it has not got. If a board is set up by a statute of Parliament it is bound to the powers given to it, and to none other. It cannot pretend to exercise any powers not explicitly given to it. Mr Allan Fraser -Should not the Minister curb it then? will allow me, I will deal precisely with that point. This is good law. I should have thought that was not doubted. It was certainly laid down in the celebrated case of Ashbury Railway Carriage& Iron Co. v. Riche reported in 1875 Law Reports, 7 House of Lords at page 653. It may be unimportant to some people-somethin g to produce sniggers-bu t nevertheless it underlines an important principle: No statutory corporation or board can pretend to use any powers not given to it. The good sense of this in a matter of politics should not be doubted. If this Parliament, by statute, sets up a board and the board goes off on an infinite variety of errands which it thinks should be carried out, we come to the question of how the board can be restrained when it so behaves. Some of the wool growers in this instance wanted to challenge the validity of the expenditure of funds, and the only way they could do so was to secure the Attorney-General's fiat. He refused to give it. In my view, he was completely wrong. My understanding of the law is that, if counsel makes out a prima facie case for the fiat to be given by the Attorney-General, he should give it. I invite my honourable and learned friend to state a reasoned case to this Parliament for refusing to give it. I go a little further. There may be very sound reasons for refusing to give it, but this Parliament should be acquainted with those",69,Referendum Bill 1965

I hope that my friend the Minister for Primary Industry will not be affronted if I remind him of what was laid down by the Privy Council as the duty of the Crown and of the Executive with respect to obeying the law when there is doubt. I ask the House to remember that my basic submission is that in this case there was clear doubt. I will read what Sir George Farnell had to say in the case of Eastern Trust Co. against McKenzie, reported in [1915] Appeal Cases. He saidIt is the duty of the Crown and of every branch of the Executive to abide by the law. If there is any difficulty in ascertaining it, the Courts are that is no place for a person to turn to in open to the Crown to sue, and it is the duty of the Executive in cases of doubt to ascertain the law, in order to obey it, not to disregard it. In this case, the Board has not been restrained, Presumably, there is no limit to the sort of activity in which the Board will engage. It has not been reined in by the Executive or by the Courts, and I submit with great respect that that is wrong. For my part, temptation is always there and I thought it would be a little Unfair if the Australian Wool Board escaped completely unscathed. So, with apologies to Rogers and Hammerstein and with a statement that possibly at a later hour this day I shall give a more robust rendition, this is my sanction upon the BoardAustralia's big wool guy Is riding rather too high As he flies 'cross Australia in the sun.

I now return to the Bill. honourable member's usual speech. think we will get on with the Bill. the honourable member for Scullin has some noogoora burr in his pants or whether he is senile. I come to what seems to me to be one of the major defects in the Bill, and that is that no plan is attached to it. My friend the Minister for Primary Industry said this afternoon by way of courteous and gentle interjection when one of my colleagues was speaking: "" Ah, but I explained the plan in my second reading speech."" With very great respect to hir . order to find the plan. One should not be obliged to go on a tour of exploration through "" Hansard"" to find the meaning of the plan. I know that there are some people whose minds are so completely and so utterly blocked that they refuse to concede the validity of this point, but one is entitled to turn to an act of Parliament in order to find the full meaning of that act and should not have to go to the second reading speech. I ask my friend the Minister for Primary Industry, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to face up to the problems that confront a person who tries to understand the significance of legislation by looking at second reading speeches. He, of course, usually explains his legislation plainly, clearly and to the point. However, on this occasion, I submit that, even in his own speech, there are areas of considerable doubt as to the full implications of the plan. I submit that the plan should be attached to the Bill. I go further. I say that it is not attached to the Bill at this point of time because there is no complete plan. This, I submit, is proved by the fact that, as of now, considerable negotiations and discussions are still going on concerning the source of the finance that is needed for the plan. This may to some comfortable minds be mere detail, but I venture to say that in the mind of a person sitting in this House it is reasonable to ask for the plan. But still it is not there. I would say it would probably be easier to find a solitary sheep in 20,000 acres of mulga country than it is to find the reserve prices plan.

147,Mr Killen,"I do not know whetherwool marketing authorised by the Australian Wool Industry Conference."" I describe that plan as a collection of slogans -politica l slogans and some of them pretty poor at that. To describe that as a plan is a complete caricature of the truth. I hope we will not be pressed to accept this document, a copy of which, I point out to the House, was not available from the Brisbane office of the Australian Wool Board as of Friday of last week. It is nonsense to suggest that this should be accepted as a plan. But presumably the Government, the Establishment, has determined that it is the plan. I hesitate to contemplate the possible repercussions that could flow from this attitude. It sets an incredibly dangerous precedent to ask this Parliament to approve of something without giving the full details to the Parliament. That is where I stand, and whether people agree or disagree with me I will not budge from that stand. I have come across too many gilgai holes to be disturbed by a person such as the Chairman of the Australian Wool Board, who has lived in a lucerne paddock all his life, and I will not be silenced on this issue. I say to the House that this is a very dangerous precedent indeed. I turn to what in my view is the second major defect in the Bill. This is the voting qualification, and it is to be found in clause any other available information . . . 6. As all honourable members know, the qualification for a vote is 10 bales or 300 sheep. I wonder how many people who are enthusiastic for this sort of voting qualifientitled to presume that everything is done cation would reveal the same measure of enthusiasm if every shareholder in a public company in which they had invested money, whether such shareholder held one share or 1,000 shares, had the same voting power. As another Shepherd discovered only last week, when it comes to a poll you depend on votes. It is a very quaint principle, in my view, to introduce into legislation a provision that all persons, whether they produce 10 bales or 500 bales, will have just one vote. this surely needs no pressing upon the said: "" I presume that your client is House. My friend, the honourable member familiar with the maxim, omnia praesumunfor Lalor( Mr Pollard) says: "" Nonsense "". tur rite et solemmiter esse acta "". Counsel We will agree to disagree on this. 1 have looked at him and said: "" Familiar with it, given my views. I think it is completely Your Honour? I would like you to know wrong to say to a person who may have 300 sheep: ""You have the same voting strength as has the Haddon Rig stud"". Surely the absurdity of that is clear. Now let me say something about the qualification of 300 sheep. The arrangement of the provisions of the Bill in relation to this qualification is curious. First of all, a person is entitled to vote if he owns 300 sheep. Such a person gets on to the roll of wool growers under clause 8 of the Bill. When does he have to own the 300 sheep? From clause 14, which deals with offences, you can draw the inferenceI submit that it is a reasonable inference-that he must own the 300 sheep on polling day. But I put this to the Minister: What happens if, 21 days before polling day a person owns the required number of sheep and gets on to the roll, and between that time and polling day one sheep happens to die or he happens to kill one gummy old ewe for meat for his dog? I point out to the Minister that there is no provision in the Bill in relation to that sort of contingency. 1 say with very great respect to the Minister that it offends me to think that he is down on such a limit. I point out another absurdity. It may be said to be trivial. I ask him this question: Who counts the sheep? Clause8 (1.) readsThe Secretary to the Department of Primary Industry shall, on the basis of information obtained by him from wool-brokers and wool-dealers and The Secretary has to accept implicitly the word of a person who says that he has 300 sheep. The Minister may say that he is regularly and properly. That may be so in the great majority of cases. But I believe that he puts a little too much trust in everything being done regularly and properly. Misdemeanours are committed at times. I recall that years ago, out on the outer Barcoo, there was a case of sheep stealing. The trial judge was given to quoting Latin maxims which did not seem to have much relevance and, what is more to the point, which very few people seemed to understand. He turned to counsel appearing for",71,Referendum Bill 1965
148,Mr Pollard,Nonsense.,72,Referendum Bill 1965
149,Mr Killen,"The sheer absurdity of the person accused of sheep stealing and that out here on the outer Barcoo they can talk of nothing else."" The Minister is presuming that everything will be done regularly and properly, but I ask him to look a little further into this matter. The third defect is the requirement of compulsory voting. The Minister is determined on a clean muster. He does not want to go round again. He wants to get in every vote the first time. However, one very curious provision of this Bill is that the Crown, in right of the Commonwealth, has a vote. I ask the Minister this question: How will the Crown vote? It is all very fine for the honourable gentleman to say that the Government will hot take sides on this matter. But the definitions clause of the Bill states. . . shall be deemed to be a person ordinarily resident in the Australian Capital Territory. It so happens that the Crown owns, sheep. The Crown owns "" Gilruth Plains "", "" Chiswick"" and other large sheep stations. How Minister's statement seems to me to be a rather blissful expression of the view taken by the gentleman who, referring to Cabinet government, said: "" Gentlemen, we either hang together or hang separately "". In this instance, it is not merely a case of members of the Cabinet voting together. Who would have suspected up to this moment that members of the Cabinet also shear together? t hope that before this debate concludes the Minister will be able to tell the House precisely how the Crown will vote on this issue. I refer now to the reserve price plan itself. This is my last comment on this matter. The Wool Marketing Committee of Inquiry, under the chairmanship of Mr representatives of wool growers speaking in Justice Philp, reported, I thought purposefully, against the adoption of a reserve price plan for wool marketing. But the Australian Wool Board takes only four paragraphs to refute the report of the Philp Committee on such a plan. I describe that as a piece of gross impertinence on the part of the Australian Wool Board. The Board's report is not based on any reasoned explanation of why it is not prepared to adopt the report of the Philp Committee. As my friend, the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Hughes), has pointed out, the chairman of the Australian Wool Board is now prepared to seize desperately upon part of a resolution. He is prepared to resort to all sorts of hearsay in order to prop up his case. I believe that the activities of the Wool-Board during this present controversy reflect no credit at all on the men who sit on the Board and, in particular, on the man who presides over the Board. There have been serious deficiencies in the conduct of the Board during this controversy. I hope that the wool growers of Australia, when they are considering the implications of this scheme, will certainly look to the pros and the cons of it but also will take into account the people who have campaigned for the scheme and the manner in which they have campaigned for it. the Crown in right of the Commonwealth Deputy Speaker speaking in reply? interesting two days of discussion of this all-important Wool Reserve Prices Plan will the Crown vote? The Referendum Bill. The Leader of the Opposition, by interjection, has asked me whether I will speak in reply. It is customary for members on the Government side of the chamber to reply to members of the Opposition. On the rare occasions on which a membsr of the Government parties follows another member of the Government parties, he invariably agrees with his colleague. Let me commence my remarks by saying that I agree with the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) on only one point; that is, that this is a very important piece of legislation. We have heard from all sorts of speakers. We have heard the legal interpretation. We have heard from the economists. We have heard from the banking fraternity. We have even heard this important debate. Only a few minutes ago we heard a speaker representing a washerwoman, and we have just heard a poet. AH of them claim to know as much about this matter as do the 50 members of the Australian Wool Industry Conference. Like other members of the party that I represent, I have always believed-in fact this has always been our policy-that we should not interfere with the rights and freedoms of the individual. In other words, if an individual or an organisation wishes to do something, provided it does not interfere with the rest of the community that",72,Referendum Bill 1965

152,Mr King,"We have had a veryindividual or organisation should be at liberty to do it. I believe that this issue is a typical example of that. If the wool growers wish to introduce a scheme or, for that matter, to throw out a scheme, they are at liberty to do so. It is not for us, as legislators, to tell them what is good for them. Rather is it for them, not for us, to decide what they want. We have a responsibility to raise issues or point out problems involved in their requests, but we certainly should not dictate to them. After all, that is the difference between dictatorelectorates-simila r advertisements are apship and democracy. As a wool grower and a representative of wool growers, I have certain personal views on wool growing and certainly on wool marketing. I say that I represent a wool growing electorate because the part of Victoria that I represent has at least onesixth, if not one-fifth, of the total sheep population of that State. I speak in this House from time to time on wool matters as a representative of a large wool growing area. Unfortunately, many speakers have taken part in the debate on this Bill who represent few or even no wool growers whatsoever. Of course, they could represent wool consumers, wool brokers, wool manufacturers and possibly even people who maybe interested only in wool futures. I do not mind these people contributing to the debate provided they do not dictate to the growers about what is good for them. The subject of a reserve price plan has referendum should be held on this scheme until been in the air for quite some time, conthe full facts are available and understood. trary to assertion of some people that the The advertisement contains this statementscheme is being forced on the growers in a hurry. It is certainly not a quick decision. tell us. It is some years since the plan was first suggested in Australia. During the last few months particularly I have attended many meetings of wool growers. I have listened with great interest to many cases put both for and against the scheme. I have never got up on the stump, as it were, to encourage or even discourage growers on how they should vote on this issue, but I have answered questions to the best of my ability. I think, however, that I have reached the stage once reached by the honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Jack) when he said that he could remain silent no longer. I am very disturbed to see and hear some of the propaganda that is. being circulated. To my mind it is most unfair, and its accuracy is doubtful. I refer chiefly to advertisements that are appearing in a number of newspapers. I think that my colleague, the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon) mentioned the matter this afternoon. An advertisement appeared in the "" Warracknabeal Herald"" on Friday, 20th August 1965. It takes up five-sixths of a page of the newspaper. From my observation of the newspapers in my electorate-and 1 have no doubt the same thing is occurring in other pearing in a number of newspapers. This advertisement is headed "" Don't Let the Wool Board Treat Us Like Sheep"" and readsThe Australian Wool Board is splashing money around right and left to try to stampede wool growers into voting "" Yes"" in the coming referendum on the Reserve Price Scheme. It is xising the wool growers' own money in its reckless attempt to brainwash them with vague, contradictory and misleading propaganda. It wants to push the marketing scheme through quickly before growers can learn all the facts. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) this afternoon. I felt that he spoke with some great knowledge for one who is supposed not to know anything about the plan. This advertisement went onGive yourself and Australia a fair go. Wire or write to your Federal M.P -now ! It is vitally important to every wool grower . . . and every Australian . . . that no These are the facts the Wool Board does not I do not know from where these people are getting their facts if they have not been told them and if the growers have not been told them. 1 want to analyse some of the statements in the advertisement. Firstly, where is the Wool Board splashing the money around? I thought the complaint of the people who are fighting the plan was that they did not know enough about it, as is said towards the end of the advertisement. They talk of the money that is being splashed around. The Board makes no pretence about where the money is coming from. Certainly some of it is wool growers' money. Some comes from the Board's investments, and naturally quite a lot of it comes from growers who are prepared to support the plan. If honourable menibers look at some of the newspapers they will find actual lists of donations from growers. These advertisements are appearing in many newspapers, and booklets have also been printed. I have come across three, but heaven only knows how many more there are. I should like to know where the money is coming from to pay for these publications. One hears all sorts of reports. votes to five, to support a referendum of One report is that one particlar publication cost somewhere in the vicinity of £5,000. I do not know, but 1 should like to know how much of the cost of these articles, booklets and advertisements is paid for out of wool growers' money. I think honourable members will find that a very high percentage of the money is not wool growers' money at all. Many of these advertisements appeal to growers to write to their members of Parliawould be in favour-a t least 15 graziers ment. To date I have received two letters of protest, two verbal protests and have found literally dozens of people wanting to know who is running and paying for the campaign of opposition to the plan. It has been said, too, that growers would be contributing about 10 per cent, of the cost of the anti campaign and that the rest of the growers' organisations-tb e Australian Wool money is coming from vested interests. When I say vested interests 1 refer to interests other than wool growing interests which could include those engaged in the manufacture of man made fibres. I think it was my colleague, the honourable member for Gippsland, who referred to the establishment of the Australian Wool Industry Conference. The Australian Wool Industry Conference was constituted in October 1962. It comprises 25 members from the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and 25 from the Australian Wool growers and Graziers Council plus an independent chairman. At the time that the legislation was being debated I did not hear many honourable members oppose the principle on which the Conference was established. Some honourable members certainly wanted to have included on the Conference representation of the Australian Primary Producers Union, hut, in the main, honourable members wanted the Australian Wool Industry Conference to be the spokesman for the industry. Today, strange as it may seem, the situation is different. Some people now say that the Australian Wool Industry Conference is not the spokesman of the industry. Why? The reason is that they do not believe that the Conference's actions serve the purposes that they as individuals desire to be served. In other words, these people have adopted the principle: "" If you don't do what I want you to do, you can't do anything at all"". Recently the Conference agreed, by 45 growers. A section of the Conference, from what I am led to believe-grazier s chieflywas very vocal in saying that it did not agree that the referendum should go on. What has changed the minds of those comprising that section? Can we perhaps analyse the numbers? If only five members voted against the proposal surely there must have been at least 20, or-if you assume that the five stud breeders on the Conference who would have supported it. That is 15 out of 20. That is a pretty fair majority. Somewhere along the line there appears to have been a division in the ranks of the Australian Wool growers and Graziers Council. Over the years there have always been problems arising amongst the three wool and Meat Producers Federation, the Australian Wool growers and Graziers CouncU and the Australian Primary Producers Union. When the Conference was first formed-and two of the three organisations agreed to participate-w e all thought that we had the beginning of a situation where one organisation would speak with one voice for the wool industry. That situation now appears to have broken down. It also appears that some members of thc Conference are not prepared to accept the recommendations pf the Wool Board and the Australian Wool Industry Conference in support of a referendum on the issue of marketing. In mv opinion, these people are doing the industry a great disservice. Although they are members of the Conference, they are not working for the decisions of the Conference; they are working against its decisions. I challenge them to make their position perfectly clear to the wool growers. I am not making any personal attack on any individual, but I believe that the growers are entitled to know why some of their representatives are not prepared fo support the decisions of the Conference. As members, they either accept or oppose the decisions of the Conference. If they oppose the decisions, the question arises: Have they a right to continue as menibers of the Conference or should they get out? After all, there are many who are prepared to take their places. As to additional membership of the Conference, I , like a number of other members of the Australian Country Party, believe that the Conference should give sympathetic consideration to admitting the Australian Primary Producers Union to membership. In my opinion, that organisation has co-operated in every way, and it certainly represents a very large number of wool growers. As to the actual scheme that the Australian Wool Board is placing before the growers, the question is not whether the scheme is perfect or otherwise. The question is the adoption of the principle of controlled, guided or even regulated marketing. The Bill before us does not deal with the plan, as some of its critics would have us believe that it does; schemes that are in operation in New it is designed to give authority to the GoZealand and South Africa. I think the New vernment to hold a referendum of wool Zealand plan was introduced in 1952. Either growers in order to obtain their views on last month or the month before, the the plan that the Government will be distriElectoral College there, which is really the buting with the ballot papers. Speaking of marketing, I am naturally South African scheme was introduced in reminded of wheat stabilisation. No doubt the year 1957-58 and, to the best of my some will argue that the wheat stabilisation knowledge, there is no evidence of displan cannot be compared with the plan agreement with it by the growers of that now under consideration. I agree that it cancountry. not, but I say that if the wheat growers were asked today whether they preferred the present wheat stabilisation plan to the two issues appear to be worrying members old system of selling through merchants, 99 of this House as well as the growers. The per cent., if not 100 per cent., of them first relates to the year in which a grower would say that they were in favour of the has to have wool or sheep and the second present plan, although when the original relates to the amount of wool a grower vote was taken there was a very different must produce or the number of sheep he story. When that vote was taken, I think in must own. The confusion in relation to the 1947 or 1948, those favouring the proposal year arises from the fact that, as was stated represented nothing like 100 per cent, of reading speech, the year 1963-64 was the growers. In Victoria, which some honourable memof preparing the rolls, but the following year bers describe as a very radical State, 11,275 will be the one taken as the basis for voted for the stabilisation scheme and 3,495 qualification. If a grower produced 10 voted against it. In that State, 76 per cent, bales in 1964-65, he will qualify, but if he of the growers were in favour of the proproduced 10 bales in 1963-64 and less than posal. In Western Australia, 3,957 voted for that in 1964-65, he will not qualify. The the scheme and 2,427 voted against it. There provision for granting a vote to the pro61.9 per cent, of the growers were in favour. ducer of 10 bales of wool is very contenIn New South Wales, the voting was 8,951 tious. At the last referendum, which was .for the scheme and 6,260 against it, so 58.5 per cent, of the growers favoured it. In South Australia, the figures were 5,729 in favour of the scheme and 4,090 against it, so 58.3 per cent, of the growers supported the scheme. The total number of votes recorded for the scheme throughout Australia was 29,912 and the total number cast against it was 16,371, so 63.7 per cent, of the growers of Australia supported the scheme. Results have proved that on that occasion the growers of Victoria were right in their opinion. It would appear that Victoria is taking the lead in connection with this referendum on the wool reserve prices plan. We shall see whether Victoria is right again. I might point out that New South Wales, in which the percentage favouring the wheat stabilisation plan was fairly low, is the State from which is coming some of the strongest opposition to the plan now proposed. Some mention has been made of the equivalent of the Australian Wool Industry Conference here, voted unanimously in favour of a continuation of the plan. The On the question of eligibility to vote, quite clearly by the Minister in his second selected, for convenience, for the purpose taken in 1951, eligibility to vote was based on a production of five bales, and on that occasion the larger growers wanted to restrict the vote to those with a minimum of 20 bales. The 10-bale requirement in this instance can, therefore, be said to be a compromise. The proposal in relation to partnerships and companies is perfectly straightforward, to my mind, although I feel that to class as ineligible a partnership of three which produces 29 bales or a partnership of two which produces 19 bales is a little unrealistic. Nevertheless, each of the growers, provided they have equal shares, would be producing less than 10 bales. On the other hand, if the partnership produced 30 or 20 bales, as the case may be, each partner would be the producer of 10 bales and therefore would be entitled to a vote. I come now to the classification of rural holdings and refer to Bulletin No. 7 issued by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics. It relates to the year 1959-60. tion. I believe, Sir, that if a person reads It is very difficult to know exactly how many wool growers will not have a vote because of the classification. If we look at this Bulfully appreciate what is meant in this Bill. letin we will find that there were something like 31,235 holdings with fewer than 300 sheep. The total number of holdings in Australia was 118,587. If we deduct the number of holdings with fewer than 300 sheep, we arrive at a figure of 87,352. I think the honourable member for Moore( Mr conditions, he was temporarily without the Maisey) referred to similarfigures.These are figures for holdings, not wool growers. It has been estimated that between 90,000 and 100,000 wool growers will be eligible to vote, and we can assume that approximately 30,000 wool growers will not have the privilege of casting a vote. However, this is a recommendation of the Australian Wool Industry Conference, as are all the others that appear to be contentious. If this House, in its wisdom, decided to amend the Bill, as has been suggested by the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), it might not be accepted by the Australian Wool Industry Conference. With that thought in mind, I certainly support the Minister in this particular matter. I wish to refer now to a letter sent to me by Mr Macarthur Onslow, dated 23rd August 1965, in which he sets out a report by Mr Ashton who, prior to that date, had visited certain rural areas. I have not sufficient time to go right through the letter, so I will deal with a few relevant portions of it. Mr Ashton said in his report that there was already evidence that a large proportion of wool growers, as well as city business and professional groups and major newspapers, were gravely concerned over legislation introduced by the Minister for Primary Industry. I think that is worth looking at. . . "" city business and professional groups and major newspapers were gravely concerned . . ."". Personally I do not see why the city business and professional groups should be terribly concerned about the wool growers making a wrong decision. After all, it is their own product that is involved and, naturally, they should be entitled to voice their opinion as to what they would like done with their particular product. Criticising the legislation, Mr Ashton said that it was particularly vague in relation to the basic question of the voting qualificathe Bill and the Minister's second reading speech with any intelligence at all he can However, declaring that there were "" glaring inconsistencies "" in the voting qualification, Mr Ashton pointed out that a bona fide wool grower who had been growing wool for 40 years or more could be refused a vote because, owing to prolonged drought minimum 300 sheep or was not producing ten bales of wool a year. As I said earlier, the qualification would be based on the year 1964-65. To my knowledge, the preceding year was a pretty good one. I can hardly imagine that many people would be affected by the drought unless they were in the central part of Australia. Paragraph 4 of Mr Ashton's letter readsThe 300 sheep qualification also meant that anyone could buy a small flock of sheep and resell them without shearing them but, in the meantime, claim a vote on the wool marketing issue. If anyone is prepared to buy 300 sheep with a view to getting a vote, I think he is entitled to a vote. One Government member -it might have been the honourable member for Mackellar-sai d today that it would be possible for a person to purchase a flock of 300 sheep for £15. Well, 1 should say that by the time the honourable member went and looked at those sheep, he would not get them for £15. Mr these other advisers. Of course, the Minister Ashton said it was quite improper that bona fide wool growers could be excluded on a technicality while people who, by chance, happened to fall at a particular moment within the definition in the legislation, but who had no real interest in wool growing, could be allowed to vote. I think that argument answers itself. Jn paragraph 6 of this letter, it is statedThe introduction of the provision that the possession of 300 sheep would qualify a person to vote made complete nonsense of the 10 bales qualification previously agreed to by the Australian Wool Industry Conference. This was because, in many cases, 300 sheep might not produce more than five bales of wool. Mr Ashton comes from New South Wales. I am a Victorian. If Mr Ashton likes to come down to the western part of Victoria and tell the growers there that 300 of their sheep would produce only five bales of wool, I think he would insult those growers for all time, and they would not be interested from that point of time in what he had to say. The average clip per sheep is about 10 lb. Certainly, a sheep which gave a clip of 5 lb. would be an inferior type. Mr Ashton pointed out that the Minister will be. I support this legislation. I wish to for Primary Industry, in his speech intromake sure that the people who are interested ducing the referendum legislation, referred know where I stand in relation to this issue. to the fact that the Government had agreed I want to make it perfectly clear that I am to the voting qualification recommended by not going to sit on the fence.

To whom would honourable will certainly be a "" Yes"" vote. members expect the Minister to go if it was not the A.W.I.C.? might finish up by going along to some of had to go to the A.W.I.C. for his information. This is the organisation that we recognise and which is the mouthpiece of the wool industry. May I now say a few words about the request by the retention committee that the actual vote be delayed. The committee says, first, delay the referendum until all the facts are known and, secondly, oppose the spending of the wool growers' money. If the growers wish to be informed on this issue and on all the facts that they are claiming they should know, surely to goodness somebody must spend some money to notify them of the facts. This, to my mind, is one of the simple little exercises in which these people engage in order to confuse the growers. Anyone knows that the creation of suspicion is the easiest way to kill anything, particularly a referendum. That is exactly what the retention committee is trying to do. AlthoughI would like to see this issue settled as quickly as possible, I believe that the longer we talk about it and argue about it-particularl y after listening to some of the speakers in this House over the last two days-befor e the actual vote is taken, the bigger the majority for a "" Yes"" vote Debate (on motion by Mr Allan Fraser) adjourned.

156,Mr Fairbairn,"The Minister for CivilFreight Charges. (Question No. 1221.) Mr Mortimer asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, upon notice1. Is the Government concerned at the imposition of steep increases in freight charges on Australian exports? 2. Has the Government any control over freights charged for the carriage of our exports or impons? 3. Can the economy, or individual industries, for were claims (a) accepted and (b) rejected by the example, the wool and wheat producing industries, afford the continuing increase in freight charges? 4. Would a relatively small number of refrigerafor which claims were accepted was met by (a) ted and general cargo vessels suitable for overseas transport, Commonwealth owned and controlled, and operated in competition with, and not chartered out to, foreign control, place the Government in a position more readily able to assess a proper freight rate? 5. Would ownership of such vessels give Australia a voice when the Conference and other shipping lines meet to discuss further freight increases? honourable member's questions are as follows1. Yes. 2. No; the Government, however, works closely with Australian exporters and shipping companies on all matters affecting the carriage of Australia's overseas trade. 3. Bulk items, such as wheat and sugar, are shipped mainly on charter terms, and rates are determined on individual shipments in accordance with the world wide demand for the type ot vessels required. Non-bulk items such as wool, refrigerated cargo, and canned or packaged goods, are shipped predominantly in liner vessels which maintain regular schedules in particular trades. Australian exports face severe competition in overseas markets and any cost which adversely affects the competitive position of such ' products ' must affect the Australian economy. 4. In Australia's principal export trade, to the United Kingdom-Continent, the major Australian export industries negotiate freight contracts under long standing arrangements with the shipping companies involved. In such negotiations the total costs and revenue position of those shipping companies are disclosed and an agreed formula is applied to determine the freight level. Thus there is a mutually accepted basis for the assessment ot freights and the introduction of some Commonwealth owned vessels would not add to this. 5. As indicated above, Australian producerexporter groups in the United Kingdom-Continent trade negotiate on all matters affecting freights in that trade. In the case of other trades the recently formed Australian General Cargo Shippers Committee will represent Australian interests in future discussions on any matters relating to freights and services.
