Healy, the Communist general secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, is associated with the Commonwealth equipment handling pool which controlled the distribution of heavy equipment during the war, including machinery and cranes, and, if so, in what capacity? For how long has he been associated with the pool ? Healy received while acting in that capacity, and what are the functions of that body! Is he identical with the Mr tinue to act as a member of the equipHealy whom the Prime Minister stated had received £1,171 9s. 9d. as a member of the Stevedoring Industry Commission? Is it intended that Mr Healy shall continue to be associated with the Commonwealth equipment handling pool although his membership of the Stevedoring Industry Commission was terminated because he refused to undertake not to incite members of the federation to flout the commission's orders ? on certain advisory committees as thc representative of the Waterside Workers Federation, but I cannot bo positive whether or not he has had any association with the equipment handling pool mentioned by the honorahle member. I do not know precisely what connection he may have with that body. It is correct, however, as stated by the honourable member, that Mr Healy received more than £1,000 iir fees as the representative of Ms organiation on the Stevedoring Industry Commission. The 'honourable member also asked a number of other questions know whether the right honourable gentleman intends that Mr Healy shall conment handling pool. written reply for the honourable member that will cover the various points raised, including the question that he has just asked by interjection.",7,Stevedoring Industry Act 1949 Act No 39 Of 1949

Repatriation received representations from the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia concerning the rate of pension payable to temporarily total mental patients who are committed to institutions by repatriation boards? If so, has he examined the league's request that three months after committal to institutions payment of the full pension rate shall be automatic? Returned Sailors, Soldiers and. Airmen's . Imperial League of Australia made repicsentations to me on thc subject of the pension rate payable to ex-service personnel whose mental condition had been accepted as having been caused by their war service. That matter has been examined, and the Repatriation Commission and I both consider that the request made by the organization is a reasonable one. The request was that the automatic adjustment of pensions should be a responsibility of the commission in the viase of temporarily totally incapacitated ex-service personnel at the expiration of three months after their committal to an institution, rather than that the patient should have to make representations so as to initiate action. That matter has now heen adjusted and I consider that the system of automatic adjustproblem], will he have an investigation ment will operate more smoothly in connection with both single and married men than has been the procedure that has been followed in the past. attention been drawn to a cabled report from Washington that the TJnited States State Department had announced on the 6th June that about 94,000 tons of military scrap metal had been sold for £10,000 to Mr T. Carr, of Sydney? If so, was approval given for a dollar allocation to Mr Carr to purchase that scrap metal, and has the Treasurer any information about how Mr Carr intends to dispose of it following its arrival in Australia? the statement to which the right honourable member has referred. Such a purchase would probably have come under my notice if it had involved a substantial provision of dollars. Matters regarding small purchases requiring only a small payment of dollars, however, would be dealt with by the Exchange Control Branch of the Commonwealth Bank in tiie ordinary business manner, and on general principles that have been laid down. The particular instance referred to has not come under my notice, but I shall have inquiries made and let the right honourable gentleman, have an answer as early ae possible. Mrs. BLACKBURN -Can the Minister for the Interior inform the House of the circumstances under whioh 43 aborigines, members of the aboriginal co-operative tin-mining venture at Moolyella, Western Australia, have been arrested and marched several miles in chains, to a gaol in the Marble Bar area, Western Australia? Has the Minister received a request (o) for the release of these aborigines; (b) for government assistance for the natives' own ventures.; (c) for thc appointment of a representative and negotiator of. their own choice; and (<2) for the release of these people from the harsh measures used under the Natives Administration Act? If the Minister has no knowledge of this made? Does the Minister know tnat in that particular area the aboriginal workers have, in recent years, engaged in many co-operative enterprises, and have also established a school and a branch of the Junior Red Cross, and have won the admiration of. all who have visited their camp? as I have pointed out on previous occasions in answer to questions in this House, that responsibility for the control of the aborigines in Western Australia falls within the jurisdiction of the Western Australian Grovernment. The Australian Government has no jurisdiction or control in association with the Native Affairs Department of Western Anstralia over aborigines in that State. I know very well the area to which the honourable member has referred, and I have had no advice about the establishment of co-operative societies or schools",10,Friday 1 July 1949

10,Mr Johnson,"I point out again,by the natives there. From my knowledge of the district I should say that the statement that the natives have formed co-operative societies and established schools is grossly exaggerated. I ' also believe the allegation that the natives were chained and taken to a gaol at Marble Bar is also exaggerated, because the natives of that area are a civilized -community, and 1 am confident that there would :be no necessity to resort to the chaining of any of them. I shall, however, for the sake of obtaining information about the allegations, communicate with the Minister of the ""Western Australian Grovernment under whose jurisdiction the aborigines of the area come. Trade and Customs aware that there is a large demand for heavy British trucks in this country? If*so does he consider that it would be possible to import more vehicles of that type, and thus help Britains' export drive and conserve dollars by diverting purchases from hard currency areas? is a demand for heavy trucks in this country, but I know of no restriction upon the importation of such vehicles from the United Kingdom or other sterling countries. Undoubtedly, it would be to the advantage of our economy if demands for these heavy vehicles could be met by Great Britain instead of by dollar countries. HUME RESERVOIR. Works and Housing say when the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria intend to start work on the job of increasing the storage capacity of the Hume Weir from 1,250,000 acre-feet to 2,000,000 acre-feet, and thus make possible the generation of hydro-electric power at the wall? If there is likely to be any delay in the commencement of this work, will"" the Minister, as chairman of the River Murray Commission, impress upon the State governments concerned the urgent need for action, so that residents of the Murray Valley in both States may be assured at the earliest possible moment of adequate electricity supplies as well as a sufficiency of water for irrigation purposes, and so help to free the people of the Riverina district and of northern and north-eastern Victoria from the thraldom of coal ? reached between Victoria, New South Wales, and the Commonwealth on this proposal. Designing work is now being carried out, and preparations are being made for the commencement of construction work. There is however, a serious problem to he considered in connection with the project. The raising of the wall may mean the inundation of the township of Talangatta. Consideration is now being given as to whether a retaining wall should be built to keep the water away, or whether the township should be removed to another site. When that decision has been made, we shall be able to get on with the work. COAL STRIKE. ister's attention been drawn to a statement by Mr Edgar Ross, associate editor of the miners' official Communist journal Common Cause, made at a public meeting yesterday, that the freezing of funds would cut no ice on the coal-fields and that. . . tlie men who fought the lock-out of 1920, stood up to armed force during the Rothbury riot, will not be frightened by pigmy politicians. If so, what action does the Prime Minister intend to take to make it clear to this Communist that the Government, and not the noisy traitorous Communist element, is in control of this country? statement to which the honourable member has referred. I assume that the honourable member has obtained it from a newspaper report. However, I have seen some of Mr Ross's other statements on this matter. I do not think that the latter portion of the honourable member's question is relevant to the issue. Both the Australian Government and the Government of New South Wales have made their attitude to the strike quite clear, and there the matter stands. Nothing",11,Aborigines

Was the Prime Minister consulted hy the Joint Coal Board ahout the terms of settlement ? Has the Prime Minister seen a statement issued by the Australian Council of Trades Unions that there is only a small gap between what one side is prepared to concede and what the other side will accept? In view of the fact that the country is rapidly entering upon a period of full unemployment, will the Prime Minister, if asked by the Australian Council of Trades Unions, preside over a conference of the parties with a view to bringing ahout a settlement? honourable member has in mind the conference held on last Sunday morning. At the request of the Joint Coal Board, a compulsory conference was called by the Coal Industry Tribunal, Mr Gallagher, at which I understand there were representatives of tbe mine-owners, the miners' federation, and, I think, the Australian Council of Trades Unions. I was not consulted about the terms of settlement. All the parties were present at the conferof the Coal Industry Act 1946, which ence, and had the right to put their points provides that any person who refuses to of view before Mr Gallagher, who will have to make a decision on the merits of the dispute. I have taken no part in the matter. It is true that when the conference of the previous day broke down, it was suggested to the Minister for Shipping and Fuel that Mr Gallagher should call another compulsory conference. That proposal was put before me, and I saw no objection to it ; but I repeat that it is not for me to make any decision regarding the claims of the parties to the dispute. The honourable member inquired whether I would preside over a conference of the parties, if I were asked to do so. The answer is ""No"". the dispute have the right to make representations to the appropriate tribunal. I do not intend, nor, I am sure, does the Premier of New South Wales, to engage in attempts to reach a settlement. Thero is a proper way to settle the dispute, and that way must be followed. for Defence whether there is a defence production committee in existence. If so, has it any power to arrange for the production of coal or any other materials in Australia? Defence recently appointed the Joint War. Production Committee, which in Australia corresponds to a committee that is part of the defence structure in the United Kingdom. The purpose of the committee, which is just beginning to function, is to examine the industrial capacity of Australia in order to determine whether there are any gaps in it that must be filled if we are to have a strong industrial base for any war effort that we might be called upon to make in the future. I do not think that such a committee would have any power to enter into an undertaking or enterprise for the production of coal. The arrangements that have already been made by private enterprise and the States through the Joint Coal Board are, generally speaking, sufficient to provide Australia with adequate stocks of coal to meet the needs of any war effort hy Australia. General a question based upon section 54 comply with an order given by the Coal Industry Tribunal ehall be guilty of an offence against the act. The section provides substantial penalties, by way of fine or imprisonment, for breaches. Is it a fact that the Coal Industry Tribunal issued an order on the 16th June which required the central council of the miners' federation to direct all federation members to attend for work at normal starting times and perform their usual duties? Did the tribunal further direct the persons comprising the central council of the federation and any other persons that they should not advise, encourage, induce or incite-any member of the federation to As I have said, all parties to refrain from attending work on that date ? Is it a fact that later in that day general meetings were held at which members of the centra] council of the miners' federation advised the miners to refrain from work?

If no such aotion is proposed, does the Government intend that the same leniency shall be shown to any persons who may commit breaches of the lighting and power restrictions now in force? of the honourable member's question, the policing of the lighting and power restrictions is, of course, a matter for the States. With regard to the first two parts of the question, the answer to each of them is, I believe, "" Yes "". I think that in each case the order was as has been stated by the honourable member. The Prime Minister has already made a public statement in regard to these matters and I have nothing to add to it at present. The dispute has developed from the one day stop-work meeting into a much larger issue. The Government's policy in relation to such matters as have been mentioned by the honourable member is receiving day-to-day and hour-to-hour consideration. In these circumstances, I do not propose to give any indication of the action that may be taken by the Government. Our attitude towards this strike has been made clear. We are at present engaged in endeavouring to police the act which was passed by the Parliament on Wednesday of this week. I am not in any way endeavouring to avoid answering the honourable question. I propose to answer it more fully at a later stage-probabl y next week. Minister seen a report of a statement by the vice-president of the miners' federation, Mr W. Parkinson, that the miners' battle will be fought in the city streets? Will the right honourable gentleman causran investigation to be made regarding the possibility of prosecuting Parkinson for making an inflammatory statement and inciting disorder in the community? Will he inform the House whether the emergency legislation recently passed by the Parliament is being implemented? If it is, what action has been taken under it to ensure a speedy return to work hy the miners? Has the right honourable gentleman been visited in Canberra by representatives of the mine-owners? If he has, what action has been taken as a result of that visit? report of any statement that has been made by Mr Parkinson, the vicepresident of the miners' federation. The Minister for Shipping and Fuel has mentioned to me that, according to press reports, a Mr Parkinson has made a statement of the kind to which the honourable member for Moreton has referred. My impression is that the Mr Parkinson who is mentioned in the press reports is not the Mr Parkinson who is the vice-president of the miners' federation, although it may be that he is. I shall cause inquiries to be made to ascertain whether such a statement has been made, and, if so, whether it was subversive or calculated to incite violence in the community. I have met representatives of the mine owners. We discussed general aspects of the coal situation. They raised certain points regarding whether or not they should accept responsibility for taking action as a result of the stop-work meeting that was held prior to the beginning of the strike. I expressed to them my personal opinion on the matter. It is a question to which I referred a little while ago. I understand that last night the mine-owners' representatives saw the Premier of New South Wales, Mr McGirr. My discussion with them was an informal one and I cannot .make a member's statement about it at the moment, but I shall discuss with my colleagues the points that were raised in the course of the discussion. After all, it is for the mine-owners to take whatever action they think fit. I will at a later stage, as I did then, state my opinion on whether such action was wise or unwise. In reply to the honourable member's inquiry ahout the implementation of the measure that was passed the day before yesterday, I can say that every step is being taken to see that it is fully implemented. tion of the Attorney-General, or the Prime Minister, or the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction, or whoever is in charge of the Northern Territory, about the transfer of building materials from",13,Motor Vehicles

32,Mr Lemmon,"The point raised byscheme. If the diversion scheme applied to the full flow of the river at Orbost the Orbost valley would be very seriously affected. One hundred per cent, of the flow of the Snowy River at Jindabyne represents, in regard to the total gaugings of the river, approximately 53 per cent, of the flow at Orbost. The lower tributaries of the Snowy River that come into the river beyond Jindabyne flow down the Snowy Valley and go into the sea at Orbost. It is the amount of water at Jindabyne that is the subject-matter of the discussion. ter for Air read reports from London that serious weaknesses have been revealed in the design of the jet fighter aircraft that participated in the recent large-scale air exercises in Great Britain, and that the weaknesses make the aircraft of limited value for the interception of high-flying bomber aircraft? Will the Minister cause these reports to be investigated so that, if necessary, the defects can be corrected in the jet fighter aircraft that are being produced for the Royal Australian Air Force? press reports of the opinions that have been expressed regarding the ability of jet fighter aircraft to deal with highflying jet bomber aircraft. The Department of Air is investigating the matter, fn addition, it has experts in the United States of America who submit regular reports upon aircraft developments there. E do not take serious notice of what appears in the press, because it has been proved time and again that allegations of this kind that have been made have been without a firm foundation. However, the reports to which the honourable gentleman has referred are, in my opinion, of sufficient importance to warrant investigation. An investigation will be made in order to ascertain what truth there is in them. If there are defects in the design of the fighter aircraft that are being supplied to the Royal Australian Air Force, they will, as far as it is possible to do so, be remedied in conjunction with experts of the Royal Australian Air Force. for Commerce and Agriculture inf orm the House whether consideration is being given to the continued rise of the cost of production in the wheat industry? On present indications, is it likely that an increase of the price of wheat for home consumption will be announced as from the 1st December next? continuously given to the cost of production of wheat in Australia. The Government will, as it undertook to do, consider that price in accordance with the recommendations of the committee carrying out the review. The report of the committee will be furnished just prior to the 1st December next, when consideration will be given to the matter, and a decision made. JUTE. apparent good season, and particularly in view of the fact that Argentina has entered into a contract with India for the supply of 350,000 tons of jute this year by that country, will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture inform the House whether the Government has made any arrangments or contract for India to supply wheat bags, oat bags and other classes of bags to Australia? any fixed figure has been made by the Jute Controller on behalf of the Australian Government. Although prices have risen from time to time, we hope that ultimately they will decrease. Because the jute business is a gamble, private enterprise will not touch it. Although during the three years that have elapsed since the termination of the war the Australian Government has had to finance the purchase of all of the jute requirements of this country, no criticism of that touch of socialism has been heard.

The proposal .covers the erection of a building on the Commonwealth owned site at the corner of Collins and Argyle streets for the purpose of housing Commonwealth departments. The building will be steel-framed, encased in concrete with reinforced concrete floors and beams and the two street facades will have a facing of Tasmanian sandstone with a Tasmanian granite base. The building will be provided with a sub-basement, basement, ground floor and six upper floors. The approximate area of office space available will be 90,000 square feet. Allowance has been made in the structural design for additional floors. The estimated cost is £809,040. I lay on the table. of the House the plans of the proposed building. Question resolved in the affirmative. Defence and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [11.10] I move That the bill be now read a second time. The provision by the Commonwealth of lighthouses and other aids to marine navigation is authorized by the Lighthouses Act 1911-1942. The authority provided by that act, however, does not extend to minor planning modifications, the Territory of Papua or to the Territory of New Guinea. The primary object of the present bill is to bring about such extension so as to enable the establishment and maintenance of marine aids to navigation in those territories to be undertaken by the Marine Branch of the Department of Shipping and Fuel. Prior to the outbreak of war, the maintenance of lights and marine aids was undertaken by the administrations of the Territory of Papua and the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. When, subsequent to the outbreak of war, the civil administrations were withdrawn from the territories, control of the lights was assumed by the Navy. This was necessary as a war measure. During the period aids to marine navigation were installed in the area. The Navy continued to attend to the control and maintenance of the lights until April, 1948. With the ending of naval control, careful consideration was given to the question of the future control of marine aids to navigation in the area and the Government decided that the most economical and efficient means of carrying out the work would be for it to be undertaken hy the Marine Branch of the Department of Shipping and Fuel. The Marine Branch is responsible for the maintenance of lighthouses and other marine aids on the Australian coast, and it has at its disposal lighthouse steamers, equipment and the skilled personnel necessary to carry out this work. During the war years, the personnel available to the territory administrations for this type of work were dispersed, and vessels and",16,Macleod Repatriation Tubercular Sanatorium Melbourne Report Of Public Wokks Committee

The Government felt that it would be preferable to extend the activities of the well-established and experienced Marine Branch organization rather than to re-establish a separate organization in the territories. This arrangement has the additional advantage that it will permit the work of rehabilitation of the territory lights to be proceeded with more expeditiously than would be the case if the organization of the territories had to be re-established.

The Defence Committee, comprising the chiefs of staff of the three services and the Secretary for Defence, gave urgent consideration to this matter following on the termination of petrol rationing and it has recommended, from the defence point of view, that the Government should take whatever steps are needed to ensure that adequate reserves of liquid fuel are held in Australia at all times to meet the requiresituation which existed in the payment of ments of the fighting services and essential civilian services in a national emerthe three armed services.

Debate resumed from the 28th June (vide page 15S1), on motion by Mr the House could do to improve it . I was That the bill be now read a second time. Having perused' the bill very carefully and having discussed its 'provisions with a number of members of the services, 1 accept it completely at its face value in the spirit in which the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) has introduced it. We recognize that its object is to correct certain anomalies and to liberalize conditions of payments provided in the principal act which was passed last year. The Minister will recall that the latter measure, when it was introduced , met with 1 general approval in this House. The object of the measure introduced last year was to correct the rather chaotic superannuation pensions to members of is but fair to say that prior to the introduction of that legislation, superannuation contributions and payments were on a very complicated basis. There were many anomalies, and, in general, the pensions paid to members of the armed forces did not compare favourably with those paid to members of the Public Service. Indeed, so confused and contradictory was the position that it was incontinue even after the measure was enacted to rectify the position. When the measure was before the House a number of members on both sides of the House who had had experience in either World WarI . or World War II . made suggestions to correct anomalies and injustices, and it was highly desirable that the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman), who introduced the bill, should have given serious consideration to the adoption of some of those suggestions. I have in mind particularly the suggestions that were advanced by the honourable 'member for Balaclava ( Mr White), the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan), and the honourable member for Swan( Mr Hamilton). However, the Minister resolutely refused to consider favourably any of the suggestions made to him. His -attitude appeared to me that since the measure had been drafted by the Department of Defence in conjunction with the service departments, and approved by caucus, there was, therefore, nothing that left with the impression that the Minister felt that the submission of the bill to the House was merely a tiresome formality",18,Liquid Fuel Defence Stocks Bill 1949 Second Reading
43,Debate (On Motion By Mr Menzies),,19,Dedman
44,Mr Gullett (Henty) [11.19],"whicli he had to undergo. I emphasize that point now, because there are still undoubtedly a number of anomalies to be corrected, and I trust that the Minister will receive the suggestions made by honourable members more favourably than he did on the last occasion. On reading the Hansard report of the debate, I was particularly struck by a remark made by the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), in the course of the speech which he delivered on the 3rd June, 1948, more so because the forecast which ho made then has been abundantly confirmed. He saidWe have seen the Minister for Defence reject proposals made bn this side of thu chamber, and a few months later introduce the sume proposals himself. The Minister's mind is not immediately receptive, but eventually the idea penetrates. That has proved to be completely true in respect of the legislation which was then under discussion and the bill which is now being considered by the House. I trust, therefore, that the Minister will adopt a more sympathetic attitude towards any suggestions offered by honourable members. Four types of cases are dealt with in the bill, and every objection that I had to the former bill has now been met. I was principally concerned with the position of warrant omcers with families who found themselves worse off after the introduction of the new system last year than f.hey were before. That position has now heen corrected. However, I understand that certain members of the Opposition, including particularly the honourable member for Swan, still have a number of suggestions to make in connection with the operation of the measure, and I ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to any requests for amendment that may now be made to him, in order to avoid the necessity of having to introduce still further legislation on this matter. The House generally appreciates the attempt that is being made to liberalize the payments to ex-members of the armed services, and since the measure is not a contentious one, I have no doubt that honourable members on both sides of the House will co-operate with the Government to improve it. echo the remarks of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett), and I welcome the introduction of the measure because it will overcome certain anomalies. I can only repeat what the honourable member for Henty has said. It is unfortunate that in the past whenever suggestions have been made to improve measures, they have invariably been rejected by the Government, and, in particular, by the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman). Usually the Government's attitude on such matters results in further legislation having to be introduced to overcome outstanding anomalies. The bill is designed to overcome a num ber of anomalies which exist and which the experience of the services since the previous legislation was enacted last year have revealed, but the fact remains that payment of superannuation contributions at the new rates imposes a heavy burden to some officers. I have in mind particularly the case of senior officers whose rank and positions carry relatively high rates of pay. Because of the big changes that have taken place in our internal economy in recent years, the value of money has decreased, and taxes have increased substantially. The consequence is that those who receive high rates of pay have to accept correspondingly larger deductions from their pay to meet taxes and their contributions to superannuation. In the case of the Army, an officer who holds the rank of lieutenant-general or major-general is obliged to contribute for 25 units of superannuation, which amounts in some instances, to several hundreds of pounds annually. Although taxation rebates are granted in respect of the first £100, all contributions in excess of that amount are subject to the full rate of tax, and impose a very considerable burden upon contributors. I ask the Government to take that matter into account. The time is long overdue when the rebate limit should he increased beyond £100, because that sum has not the value which it had even ten years ago. I do not want to labour the point, hut I ask the Government to give further consideration to the matter. Question resolved in the affirmative.

The court recommended that the department should make full investigations into the and for the inspection of aircraft parts in situ. 2. In view of the recommendation of the court, an officer of the department was sent abroad to study the use of X-ray equipment in This officer found only one case where regular X-ray inspection of the structure waB used and inspection of one particular point. He found that the consensus of opinion was that radiography was useful with certain classes of components or types of structure where the nature and/or position of the defects which were being sought were known and it was not a reliable tool for a general search for cracks. He evidenced cases where, because of the type of structure, it was not possible for radiography to bring defects to light and also a case where means. Because of this officer's report, no action was taken to provide X-ray equipment to inspect parts in situ. 3. The officer who was sent abroad noted that X-ray technique was used fairly extensively to the inspection of completed aircraft in the field. The equipment at Penfield was a low power installation and only suitable for the examination of small competents and was quite useless for the examination of large built-up sections or for use in completed aircraft structures. The equipment had been used for examination of small parts, such as fuse caps, but as it had been designed for medical use, and in fact was the property of the Department Health, it was obviously not powerful enough for major industrial application. 4. At the time the department was investigating the equipment, it was unserviceable and of its unsuitability for aircraft use, its present position and use of the equipment since V-P Day have not been pursued. 5.

I added also that inquiries would be made of the services departments as to what form of assistance has been rendered in the instances under notice.

Mr Justice Ligertwood, on his appointment as Royal Commissioner, had inquired as to tbe position of any outstanding charges against any persons whom he might wish to call as witnesses, and the Crown Law authorities of the Commonwealth duly communicated this inquiry to the Crown Law authorities of the State. The decision to enter a nolle prosequi was made by the responsible legal officers of the State of New South Wales. The Commonwealth Government did not request them to take that action, and neither sought nor obtained information as to the reasons for their decision. Farrell had been charged with conspiracy along with three other persons. On account of the The General ing medical evidence, the trial judge at first adjourned the trial of all four accused, and later proceeded with the trial of the other three accused, granting to Farrell a further postponement of his trial. Each of the other three accused were found not guilty. No doubt after these acquittals it appeared to the State authorities to be impracticable to proceed with a charge of conspiracy against Farrell alone. The report of the Royal Commissioner is being carefully examined -by the Commonwealth Crown Law authorities with a view to ascertaining whether any charge can or should be laid against Farrell or any other person reported upon adversely by the Royal Commissioner.",21,Elood Belief
