If we examine that and if agenda. The agenda is that we have a responsisociologists examine it, it may well come out that bility to the community so that it can say to us: honourable members opposite would have 'Yes, we can learn to respect those members of reasons for saying that we should not disclose our parliament because they are willing to disclose financial position because it sets us off too far their involvement'. The fact that they have an infrom the rest of the community. One of the things volvement, historically, should not disqualify we have to face when there is a public record of them from public office. No one is saying that. members' interests and involvement is that the However, matters should be on the record so that public will make judgments upon it. I do not think the public can make judgments. I wonder why it is necessary to go beyond saying that the public honourable members opposite are worried about that. There is nothing in particular to be worried out on us. That is all. That is the substance of it. about SoI suggest to those opposite that the reason why If one has had an involvement in business this motion is important and the reason why those activities, if one has had a directorship, or if one sub-items in the motion are important is because has had shareholdings there is nothing in particuwe on this side of the House believe that we have lar to be afraid of.

The interesting thing, of him in the same charitable sense to accept that course, is that those in the clergy are held in higher many people on this side of the House believe that esteem than members of parliament.
