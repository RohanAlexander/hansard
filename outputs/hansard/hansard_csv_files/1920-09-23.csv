0,Mr M C Williams Ter For,"the Navy any information in connection with the overdue ship Amelia J., bound from Newcastle to Hobart? can hfe say whether steps, have been taken in the matter of searching for that vessel 1 formation to give .to the House. I may say that not only has the honourable memested himself in the matter of the overdue Amelia/ . , but that other members from Tasmania, as' well as the Tasmanian senators, have conferred with me, and kept constantly in touchwith my Department. I think it necessary, therefore, to make a rather long and complete answer to the honourable member's question.. I do not know of .any missing ship in respect to which more public attention hag been turned. For instance, on the 14th September a message from Captain Davis, Director, of Navigation, was received by the Navy Department to the effect that the AmeliaJ . was missing. Immediately instructions, wore sent to the wireless stations at Brisbane, Garden Island, Melbourne, Flinders Island, and Hobart, requiring those stations to send on messages to all ships, instructing liams has just sent a message to me intithem to keep a sharp look out for the mating that two aeroplanes left missing vessel. It is customary for ships Cook at 11.55 this morning, with instrucat sea to take their timedaily from our tions to proceed via, Wilson's wireless stations. Therefore every vessel the Kent Group, Flinders Island, in the waters in which this ship is supother islands in that vicinity,-down posed to be lost would be in touch with east coast of Tasmania, to Hobart, searchour wireless stations, and naturally, on ing for the Amelia J. receipt of our message, would maintain a strict look-out for her. On FridayI received a telegram from one of my constituents, asking me whether a destroyer oould not be sent out I immediately a message f r om His Excellency the Gogot into communication with the Naval vernor-General recommending an approBoard, and realized that, for the time priation for the purposes of this B ill . being, it was necessary to send the following message:Referring your wire. re search Amelia J., regret no vessel available, imt have wirelessed ull ships and stations to keep look-out. On Tuesday last I received another message, very late at night, asking that a search should be made by aeroplane. was in the House at. the time, and immediately got into touch with the Acting Minister for Defence( Sir Granville R y r i e ). him to. communicate with any of his Has the M in i morning, and discussed the matter. W it h in an hour the Minister had an aeroplane off the coast. That machine -And can operate 100 miles off the coast, and, travelling at a height of up to 8,000 feet, can maintain a better look-out than could all the vessels of the Australian FleetI have some in if they had been sent out to look for this missing vessel. This morning I received a radio message from Flinders' Island, stating that unusual lights had been seen on a certain par.t of the island known as Settlement Point, and I immediately in structed the First Naval Member to despatch the nearest warship to the locality. The Platypus, which happened .to be the nearest waTship, is now on the high seas for the purpose of searching the vicinity of Settlement Point. I think I have said sufficient to demonstrate that every attention has been given to this important matter, and. that the Director of Navigation took an early interest in it . The service which can thus be rendered by the aeroplane service we have estab. lished in Australia speaks volumes fox it . Later: Point Promontory, and the question to the Minister who, for the time being, was representing tbe Prime Minister, with reference to a complaint, from South African bakers and. merI chants as to the quality of B grade Australian flour, and the alleged unreliabilit y of Commonwealth Wheat Board certificates.

5,Mr Higgs,"Yesterday I submitted ato know now whether the Prime Minister can give me information as to the resalt of any investigations he may have made in regard to this subject? about this matter at the conference to .which I have already referred. In the first place, the ""Wheat Pool is not responsible for the sale of the flour. It sells wheat; it does not sell flour. The millers sold this flour. .In the second place, the flour, which had been gristed from, damaged Victorian second-quality wheat, which had been reconditioned, and was described as B grade, was sold upon sample, a parcel of 270 tons having been sent as a sample, and subsequent shipments were up to that sample. Buti t was sold up to sample by the millers, 1 and not by the Wheat Pool. Of course, I am sorry for the sake of the credit of Australian flour that there should have been any occasion for complaints, but there, is in the transaction no 'reflection on the Wheat Pool. I regret that it is not the only occasion on which Australians have done Australia incalculable injury. I recall an Eastern transaction in which some bolts and nuts were sold, and when the shipment was opened the belts and nuts had no relation one to the other. Those who do this sort of thing are really guilty towards this country of a crime infinitely worse than those crimes for which men are punished in the ordinary way. have the power under our Oommerce Aet to control exports so that no bad stuff if exported? we have not the power, but the honourable member must remember the circumstances in which this flour was bought by South Africa, In that country there was a great shortage of wheat, and they were perilously near the starvation border. We must also not lose sight of the fact that flour made from inferior wheat will spoil very much more readily than that which is gristed from high-grade wheat. Eor instance, 70 per cent, flour will keep very much longer than 80 per oent. flour. breed more speedily in the former than in the latter, and -some time has elapsed since this particular flour was gristed. However, South Africa bought to sample. But I am dealing with this matter' generally. We here are the guardians of the .good name of Australia, no matter what party we .belong to, and we want to seo that goods sent out from this country are 'true to sample, and that' the samples are the very best we have. The good name of' Australia is all we have to live on. WAR SERVICE HMS. ister representing the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Rodgers) could not inform me what would be the approximate amount required for the purpose of completing the War 'Service Homes scheme. I would like to know whether the Treasurer has an estimate of the total amount whioh is likely to be expended i u this direction ? that I cannot give the honourable member accurate figures, but. my last information was that about 27,000 applications for houses had been received, and just how many more will come in I do not kuow.

I corrected a statement. I bad mode in regard to this matter, and my answer to the honourable member's question is that the offer of this reward of £50,000 is to those who find payable oil on the mainland of Australia, and does not apply to New Guinea. I ' am now asked whether the Government will divide the reward up into five different sums of £10,000 each. What we contemplate is, of course, Weevils would begin to a reward of £50,000 for those who find oil in commercial payable quantities.

I point out, however, that, in the Bendigo speech the right honourable gentleman said nothing to that effect; and I have -no doubt that the farmers and others who ' read that speech understood it , as I did, as meaning a guaranteed advance for the 1920-21 crop. ister said that in order to help the' wheat growers, the Government, in addition to the guarantee for the conning crop, would guarantee 5s. at railway sidings for the 1920-21 harvest. things it means au advance, and I suppose the farmers thought that when they took their wheat to the railway sidings they would receive that amount of money. ber not usurping the functions of the Country party? side of the House there are as many wheat-growers, and representatives of wheat-growing districts, as I believe there are in the Government party or in the Country party. district of New South Wale3 except one is represented on this side. is called the premier State, although perhaps neither the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) nor myself would admit that to be the truth . I realize that every one should have an opportunity to discuss this question, and that being so, I shall not speak at length. The farmers are complaining of the attitude taken up by the Government in regard to the promise made by the'Prime Ministeri n his Bendigo soeech, guaranteeing them 5s. per bushel. The honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Cunningham), who represents a wheat-growing constituency, has received the following letter from the President of the Delungra branch of the Primary Producers U n i o n: l l t h September, 1020. sition did not champion the cause of the Dear Sir,I have been requested by thc farmers of the Delungra branch of the Primary Producers Union to write to you re the unsatisfactory position of the wheat-growers, and the guarantee of os. per bushel given by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes). As you aro well aware, farmers of this State have had a very hard time during the past two or three years, and are now, very many of them, The Prinie in a difficult position financially, and will be unable to carry on unless they can have financial assistance until such time as their wheat is paid for by the Wheat Board. . . . The Prime Minister stated, at Bendigo, SOth October, 1919, '-' That in order to help the wheat-grower, the Government, in addition to its guarantee for the coming crop, will guarantee 5s. at railway siding for the 1920-21 harvest."" Now, unless the Federal Government honours its promise, and makes the payment 5s. per bushel on delivery at railway siding, farmers In that speech the PrimeM in will certainly be placed in a most difficult position, even if the State Government does not press for repayment of advances made under the Rural Industries Board. The State Government states that it will pay 2s. (id. per bushel, as guaranteed on delivery, which equals If that means any7s 6d. per bag, which will barely pay the expense of harvesting. However, I believe that you are well aware of the position of the farmers, and know how much they are in need of financial assistance. Therefore, I am requested to ask you to use your best endeavours to induce the PrimeI s the honourable memMinister to make the 5s. per busliel guarantee payable on the wheat being delivered to the agent appointed to receive the grain. This is' a very important mattter, and I would Suggest that you would confer with your Leader as to thp best method of obtaining this fulfilment of the Prime Minister's promise. This, however, I will leave to your judgment; but it is extremely necessary for the farmers to obtain at least the full guarantee of 5s. per bushel on delivery if they are to be enabled to carry on their occupation. I have no doubt that representatives qf other farming constituencies have received similar communications. The farmers want to know exactly what the guarantee means. Doesi t mean that the payment, of 5s. per bushel will not be made to them until the wheat is sold ? We have been told this afternoon by the Prime Minister that 300,000 tons of next seasen's wheat have been sold to the Egyptian Government said that I had put the representative of the Egyptian Government in touch w it h the selling agents, and that negotiations were now proceeding. the right honourable gentleman. primaryproducers to the same extent when they were receiving only 2s. 6d. per bushel in respect of the first payment. on one occasion endeavoured to put into my 'mouth words which I had never uttered, and he was compelled to admit that' he was wrong.

I am anxious not to import any heat into the debate, and I shall not refer fur ther, to that matter. My desire is that' the. primary producers, like every other section of the community, shall get a f a i r return for their labour. That has always been my attitude. Apparently the negotiations for the sale of 300,000 tons of wheat to the Egyptian Government have not been completed. The Prime Minister said that the sale would mean anything from £7,000,000 to £9,000,000, which would mean from 12s. to 15s. 8d. per' bushel 260,000 tons are to be gristed into flour in Australia. the gristing here. that we should grjist as much wheat as possible, not only for the sake of providing employment, but in order that the offal may be made available for our stock.

I trust that the Government w ill make as good a deal in respect of the whole of the coming season's crop as is contemplated in connection with the sale to the Egyptian Government.

The statement meant, if it meant anything at all, that they would receive an advance of 5s. per bushel. Some of them will have to wait a long time for their money if they are not to receive a dividend until the whole of the 2,500,000 tons or 3,000,000 tons is sent away.. It is quite possible that we shall have a repetition pf our experience in respect of the 1915-16 harvest, when we had something like 1,500,000 tons of wheat stacked at Brooklyn,' where it was attacked by mice and weevils.

If that is not to be done if the Government merely intend to makea cash payment to the farmers after the wheat has been sold-the primary producers w ill have reason to complain that the guarantee has not been honoured, and that they have'been "" sold a pup "" that is an absolute mongrel. : very carefully to the statement made by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), and. as"" one who knows they facts of the case, I am in entire agreement with it up to the point at which we ask for information in regard to the first payment. I am not wholly in agreement with the view taken by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to the guarantee of 5a. per bushel. I think I can at least speak for the farmers of .Victoria cannot, speak for the farmers in my electorate. farmers of Vietoria, and I desire to be absolutely f a ir to the Prime Minister. I , and thc great bulk of the farmers of this State, understood that the guarantee of 5s. a bushel was given by the Prime Minister with a view to encourage the growers to increase the area under wheat to the greatest possible extent. The farmers, however, want to know what the first payment is going to be. I , , for one,'shall not press for a first payment of 5s. .per-bushel unless it .can be shown that the money may be easily raised. If ou.r farmers could manage to carry on with a first payment of, say, 4s. per bushel, they would be much better off than if they received' 5s. per bushel, assuming that it was difficult to raise the money. I think that they could' carry on with a payment of 4s. per bushel for a little, time, pending a further dividend on the sales made. honourable member interpret the promise made at Bendigo by the Prime Minister? tee that if , in the final realization, our .wheat brought only 4s. or 4s. 6d. per bushel, the Commonwealth was bound to pay the farmers Ss. a bushel for it . guarantee. of farmers at Bendigo last week, I put beforethe delegates the view I have just expressed, and I think it was generally accepted;The .farmers. desire that the first payment should be. as large as possible. with that. an, estimate where such, large figures are involved, but it is quite likely that we shall have this season a crop of 45,000,000 bushels in. Victoria, 40,000,000 bushels in JSTew South Wales, 35,000,000 bushels in South Australia,, and' 17,000,000 bushels in Western Australia, or a total of 137,000,000; bushels. That, I think, is a very, moderate estimate. To finance such acrop at. 5s. a bushel would mean that the Commonwealth would have to advance £34,250,000 I am rather inclined to think that that is too much to ask of the Government. Even 4s. per bushel on 13.7.,000,000bushels-for the guarantee applies to all wheat, whether, grown I oan at least speak-for the for export or for home consumption-woul d mean a cash' payment of £27,000,000. I think that if the Prime Minister were to announce at on early date that the farmers would receive 4s. as a-first advance, they would, be fairly well satisfied. Someof them arei a dire straits, and we are . anxious to help them as much as possible. Having regard to the good crops whioh the bulk, of the farmers are likely to get, provided they ore not visited by fire, flood or drought, it is probablethat. afirst payment of 4s. for this year will be equal to about 7s. or 8s. on. an ordinary crop. I hope that honorably members opposite will not press, this motion: I am perfectly satisfied that the Wheat Board and the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) are doing all they possibly can.. Probably one reason why the Prime Minister has not made -an announcement, in regard' to the first payment is that he hopes to see the nole to the Egyptian Government finalized at an early date.

Subject to freight, the outlook .for the wheat-grower was never brighter than it is ito-day. I am not attempting to .lessen the freight difficulty-o n the -contrary, I emphasize it-bu t I say that it is no't in superable. Let me show what has been done during the last five or six years. In the years 1915-16, 1916-17, 1917-18, 19(18-19, and .1920, the Commonwealth gave the wheat-grower a guarantee. In those years we sold most of our wheat f.o.b. Of course, ""the 'circumstances -were entirely different, because then -the wheat was sold'before it was shifted. That made it very much easier for -the guarantor, because he received This money; he was, in fact, actually guaranteeing the buyers' promise to pay.

It has 'had its -critics, and 'they --and .'the -'Government 'have l a d their -little -differences; but, on the 'whole, the system proved its usefulness during a .period -of great turmoil , when it was impossible 'forwheat to flow along the normal channels.

He said he was not yet in a position to make a statement, but that he would do so as soon as possible. Every farmer with whom I came into touch expressed the view that that was entirely unsatisfactory. In the course of his policy speech at Bendigo nearly a year ago, the Prime Minister said it was intended to guarantee 5s. per bushel at railway sidings for the 1920-21 crop. Despite what the [3,48] I Prime Minister has said to-day, and notwithstanding the remarks of the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) , that statement-mad e in the course of the policy speech-conveye d to the minds of Australian farmers that it was the intention of the Federal Government to pay 5s. per bushel on delivery. But it was purely an electioneering cry. The Prime Minister merely talked about 5s. in order to obtain the votes of the farmers; and, after twelve months, the Government are still undecided as to how to redeem their promise; indeed, concerning what to do at all.

72,Mr Lazzarini,"The whole businesscan to boost and bolster up the middleman and the profiteer, at the expense of the producer and the general community. If the farmer is to be given an opportunity to balance his financial obligations -particularl y since, in New South ""Wales, he has been badly hit by drought-the Government must guarantee a cash payment of 5s. per bushel as soon as the wheat has been delivered at a railway siding. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) this afternoon made two long, rambling statements, which contained very little information. He wandered all over the hemisphere, but it was not till the honourable member for Echuca( Mr Hill) asked k m for information regarding a cash advance that there was elicited a refusal to mention any sum whatever. The Government of New South Wales have definitely, bound themselves to pay 2s. 6d. per bushel cash down upon delivery at a railway siding. vernment are guaranteeing 3s. per bushel over and above the amount of the Commonwealth guarantee. means a great deal to the farmers of New South Wales, but will not be nearly sufficient to allow them to meet their obligations, because for the last three seasons, and, in some parts of the State, four seasons, the crops have been absolute failures. Tliere are very few farmers who are not mortgaged right up to the last penny of the value of their property. I suppose similar conditions apply to the farmers in all the wheat-producing States, and the only possible way in which their anxieties can be relieved is by a definite pronouncement from the Oommonwealth Government on the lines of that made by the New South Wales Government. The 2s. 6.d. advance by the State Government will at any rate give the farmers the opportunity of .gauging their liabilities and chances of paying off their mortgages. 1,000 bushels of wheat at a siding, and his delivery-note is endorsed at 5s. per bushel, is it not as good as a payment in cash ? vernment would arrange a system of credit, but not when the farmer is obliged to take his endorsed note to a bank or other financial institution, which get3 its "" cut"" for negotiating it. It would merely be repeating, the unsatisfactory routine of payments of Id., 4d., 5d., or 6d. on various wheat scrip, by which the farmers have been despoiled for the last four years, and which has resulted in all sorts of gambling, much of it of a very sinister nature. In fact, many of the operations of the different Wheat Pools have, to say the very least of them, been rather smellsome. It is within the power of the Commonwealth Government, acting in conjunction with the Wheat Board, to prevent all gambling in wheat scrip. The farmer should not be obliged to dispose of his scrip at under its value. It could be avoided, but when we seek to obtain the assistance of the Country party to prevent it, we find that they .are at one with the Government, and firmly believe that the only possible way jn which the Wheat Pool can be conducted is on the old bad lines of the past. According to the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) , it is impossible to give an advance of 5s. per bushel, because it would represent an advance of about £34,000,000. Yet in the same breath the honourable member says, ""We want 4s. per bushel."" wanted it. I said that we would very much like to have it. member pooh-poohed the idea of a cash advance of 5s. per bushel, but expressed the hope, and possibly anticipated, that an advance of 4s. per bushel would be made, which would represent a total advance of about £27,000,000, only £7,000,000 less than would be required for an advance of 5s. The greatest factor to be taken into consideration is the financial situation of the farmers. If the State Government of New South Wales can afford a cash payment of 2s. 6d. per bushel, surely the Commonwealth Government, with all its possibilities and opI f a man delivers portun'ties, could arrange to advance another 2s. 6d. per bushel immediately upon delivery of the wheat at a railway siding. I urge the Government to do it. One good reason why we should endeavour to give some stability to agriculture is the fact that during the last seven years the area under crop in Australia has been de-",31,Adjournment Formal Wheat Harvest 1920 21 Guaranteed Price At Railway Sidings

I hope that at a very early date the Government will tell the farmers that they will receive bad time.. They did not benefit last year 2s. 6d. or 3s. per bushel immediately on the delivery of the wheat at the railway siding. That offer, in conjunction with the State Government's cash payment of 2s. 6d. per bushel, would enable the. farmers of New South Wales to carry on for a certain time; but, so -far as the farmers of Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia are concerned, the amount should be increased.

I am pleased to recognise the reasonable attitude of the direct representatives of the farmers in this Chamber, particularly that of the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) . sentative of the farmers as is the honourable member for Echuca. cause the honorahle member for Echuca was specially selected by the Australian farmers to represent them on the Wheat Board. He takes up the reasonable attitude, that, owing to the prospect of Australia having a harvest of 135,000,000 bushels, an expenditure of, roughly, ment of a guarantee of 5s. per bushel immediately upon delivery. I take quite a contrary view to that of the honourable member for Calare( Mr But, alLavelle), that so' much wheat will be cut for hay. I believe that very little will be cut for hay. I think that the farmers will be only too anxious to get the benefit of the world's prices for wheat, particularly in New South Wales, where there would possibly be a total guarantee of 7s. 6d. per bushel. Of course, I recognise that the farmers of that State have had a by the high prices obtained for the wheat grown in other more fortunate States, and it is possible that, on account of tliis, the State Governanent has guaranteed them a payment of 2s. 6d. per bushel.

I am not going to argue that there should not be a camp at Rutherford. As time goes on it wil l be found that the population is sufficiently large to warrant the provision of separate camps, and I certainly think a mistake has been made in deciding to close down the camp at Adamstown. It appears that the matter was first reported on'by an officer from Melbourne, who declared that the Adamstown site was one of the best that could be selected. It is connected up w it h Newcastle, and can be supplied for less than it would be possible to supply any other camp in any other part of the country, yet it is to be closed -and the sons of artisans-boy s out of the mines-ar e to be compelled to travel 25 miles to the Rutherford camp, which is some imiles away from the range at which they will have to do their shooting.

I do not know whether visited the camp, and I am at a loss to understand how they could estimate progress that the district is making without a personal inspection. no doubt that the district is rapidly developing. who recently saw it and who expressed their astonishment was being made. The Business Board referred the whole matter to a Board of three, two of whom live in the district to which these buildings are to be removed. In fairness to them, say that they urged that there was room for two separate camps. the Adamstown camp will be to make a serious mistake. within-the next few years, it will be found necessary to re-build it. yesterday that compulsory training is designed not only to fit our boys for military service, but to develop them physically. The Adamstown camp is peculiarly fitted for the training of boys. It is situated on healthy, undulating country, and is within a few minutes' walk of the sea beach, where trainees can enjoy a refreshing bath. This case illustrates the ineptitude of some people connected with the Department. Mr Watkins. wasted. It will cost more to remove the buildings from Adamstown to Rutherford, which is a timber district, than it would do to erect at the latter place new buildings constructed w it h locally-grown timber. I ask the Minister, before definite action is taken, to carefully examine the report of the Board of three. They are reliable military men, one of whom saw service abroad, and they reported that the necessities of the case would warrant the provision of two distinct camps. into the matter. I draw the attention of the Assistant Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Ryrie) to the fact that we are to have at the end of this year a visit from a Bisley team, and that there is no rifle range in Western Australia which provides for the maximum range of 1,000 yards. A t Osborne, which is the official military range, and is used also by members of most of the metropolitan rifle clubs, the maximum range is 800 yards. Por some was the result of inquiries months the National Rifle Association of Western Australia has been in communithe members of that Board cation with the Minister for Defence as to the desirableness of increasing the the range to the maximum of 1,000 yards. I understand that the chief difficulty is due There can be to a dispute between departmental ofiicers and the executive of the National Rifle That is the opinion of members Association as to the cost of making the extension. The Association estimates the at the progress that cost at only a few hundred pounds, whereas the estimate of the military authorities is about £2,500. This is an urgent matter.

The construction of such a range on the ordinary military scale would probably cost the amount estimated by the Department. Such a range, however, is not essential. It is very seldom that, under the military curriculum, there is any necessity for military units to fire Money is to be absolutely over more than 500 or 600 yards.

There is considerable talk about our not doing wisely in publishing details which might be qf interest to a potential enemy, but the probability is that most of the information is known a great deal earlier and more completely to outside sources than to members of this Parliament. Honourable members should be informed whether any alteration has been effected to the design of the Lithgow rifle, and whether it is proposed to continue the manufacture of rifles at more than double the price at which they are being turned out in other parts of the world to-day.

There are in GreatB r it a in to-day hundreds of thousands of rifles which w ill never be used again, and which any Dominion Government can buy at an exceedingly low figure. I think offers in that direction have been made. I know that the bigger guns are being offered at considerably less than half the guns can be bought almost for the cost of taking them away. In Erance, the other day, there was a sale of guns, including rifles, which were distributed practically for a song. There are stacked to-day in England thousands upon thousands of up-to-date rifles, which the AusHonorable tralian Government may' purchase for an exceedingly low figure.. The type of rifle which"" we produced before the war is not such as can now be called an up-todate arm. Honourable members should be made acquainted with the type of weapon being manufactured, and w i th the class of ammunition being turned out. We should know the whole policy of the Government respecting these matters. Without question, the manufacture of rifles at Lithgow has been, to put it very mildly, f a r from a success. Some of those arms were used in Palestine; but, in Europe, they were discarded, as they were regarded as being f a r from modern. changed during the war, because of the higher grade of ammunition which came not? into use. It was not the faul t of the Lithgow rifle. MrM c WILLIAMS I do .not say that it was the f a u l t of the Lithgow rifle, but, if we are turning out a weapon which is not suited for the up-to-date ammunition now employed, the mistake is ours.

There is one capable man 1 know of who could form a company to start operations to-morrow, if there was any prospect of success, and such a company would be formed at once but for the prevailing conditions. This is an important question, particularly in the district represented by .the honourable member for Hunter( Mr. Charlton) and myself; and I agree with him that the time has come when there should be a testing station established by the Cornimonwealth. A t the present time the miners have to buy their own powder in considerable quantities, and, according to the Coal Mines Regulation Act of the State, only such explosives are authorized as appear on the permitted list of England. It might happen, though I do not say that it has happened, that an explosive on th© permitted list, which had been tested in England The Government could (make a a long time ago, would be sent out here and used without a second test, or an inferior explosive sent bearing a superior brand.

Sir GRANVILLERYRIE know that there is any thing to prevent the establishment of such a station. The report continues"" The next step will be the organization and equipment of an inspection department. The main work of this department is the systematic examination and proof of war materiel for issue to forces, and, further, the proper custody and storage of all standards for manufacture of war materiel. It is on the inspection department that will fall the issue of all working, drawings, drawings of gauges, and the organization of inspection of factories, Government or private. The policy of the Department is to provide as funds permit for the erection and equipment of such additional shops an'd factories as are required to meet the peace demands of the Forces for war materiel, and its repair and upkeep. At the present time Australia possesses no establishment capable of making ammunition, high explosives, or fuses, nor is there any provision for filling ammunition with explosives or gas even if the several components were prociirable from outside establishments. These outside establishments, sucli as engineering shops or chemical factories, can only be brought to function in war if the Government possesses facilities for rapidly training masters and foremen, and is possessed of the necessary technical information in a form readily available, and which will make quite clear what is exactly wanted."" It is along the lines briefly set out above that the Department is creating a nucleus organization for dealing with the problem of munition supply. Without such an organization Australia must remain dependent for war materiel upon the maintenance of British control of the seas, and, in these circumstances, the description of our army as "" a Defence Force"" is a fallacy which deceives no one but ourselves. I desire to emphasize that point. put very clearly in this report that unless we can manufacture munitions it is futil e for us to train our men. us to have a Small Arms Factory where we can manufacture rifles if we cannot manufacture the ammunition for them'. In such circumstances all our efforts in the event of war would be absolutely futile. mark apply also to the supply of coal to keep our industries going? If we could not get a supply of explosives reto prequired in connection with the coal minstation ing industry, what would be our position? to perI n the event of war we could not manuof exf a c t u r e explosives for such purposes unless we had a testing station. I do not Sir GRANVILLERYRIE Q u it e so. That should be one of the functions of the Commonwealth. We must manufacture everything that is requisite for an army in the field. If there are things which we cannot at present manufacture we cannot help it . But we should do our best to produce as speedily as possible all our requirements in this regard. Honourable members must realize that if we are to have a Defence Force, it is essential that, so far. as its requirements are concerned, we should be self-contained. We cannot say that the seas will be open to us in war time, and that we shall be able to obtain supplies from abroad. We must have big guns and supplies of ammunition for those guns. Honourable members who. have' had military experience know that a force without artillery has no chance whatever against a force with artillery. The force possessing big guns could shell the other side, which would have no means of retaliation. By the time that it got close enough to engage the opposing army otherwise than by artillery, its ranks would be decimated. When you are being shelled by an opposing force, and you want to advance, you must be able to shell the enemy's gun positions with the object of stopping them or keeping their fire down. If the enemy's artillery can put its guns wherever it pleases, and shell your advancing force, which has no artillery to retaliate, the position of that advancing force is absolutely hopeless.. It is of the utmost importance, therefore, that we should manufacture munitions of war in Australia, and make ourselves as self-conI t is tained as possible in regard to army supplies.

I intend to take up a few minutes in continuing from last night, as briefly as I can, my survey of the defence jjosition. The item before the Committee, and the two subsequent items, represent a proposed vote of £2,000,000 for the purposes of defence. I have distinctly stated before that I have no objection to votes for purposes of defence under ordinary circumstances. But these are not ordinary circumstanoes. This vote is not only for the maintenance of the existing system of defence; it is a proposal for the augmentation of our defence expenditure by millions of pounds per annum. conclude, I shall have something to say in regard to the attitude of the so-called Economy party. In this matter there are only two things in view-eithe r peace or war. It has been said by the Assistant Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Ryrie) that whosoever states during this debate that the present is a period of peace, and that there will be no further war, is talking bosh and nonsense. that.

The Assistant Minister says he is a liar. Leave it at that. What the Prime Minister said is not true. There is no peace. fought in order to bring about peace. We have not entered the green pastures. We have not entered upon a peace that will endure. war have conquered a white race, 16,000 miles away in order to build up preparations against another enemy close to our shores. If we are to make preparations for war with another nation, which nation is it to be? The Assistant Minister for Defence told us that we have to protect the White Australia policy. He believes in that policy; he has always -believed in it. If we have to defend the White Australia policy we must defend it against some other people. The Prime Minister told us that, whosoever, in this Chamber or elsewhere, utters one word which may arouse the hostility of any particular nation, does, by that word, incite to the very evil aud danger he professes to deplore. The Assistant Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Ryrie) has said that we are confronted with a menace to our White Australia unless we BeforeI make the necessary defence preparations. He has said the very thing that his chief, the Prime Minister, has denounced. We are told that if we mention the name when seeking to discover our possible enemy, we are doing something injurious to our country, and we are asked to believe that, while this potential enemy has ears with which to hear our words, he is so blind as not to be .able to see what we are doing. We are told that we must prepare to fight against a possible enemy with I did not say armed forces, and that enemy is presumed to be Japan. It is useless to blink that fact. The militarists appeal to the public by saying that the White Australia policy must be defended, leaving it to be inferred that our potential enemy is Japan, and against her we have to prepare for the defence of our country. If that is so, we I should not blink the issue. Is there any possibility of Japan becoming our enemy ? Yes, or no? Some say yes; others say no. In the early part of the war, I distinctly pointed out the possibilities of Japan. I said that while she was an ally of Great Britain, and while Great Britain and tlie Allied Powers were fighting for their existence against the Germanic Empire, Japan was in a position to make a claim for compensation or concessions. It has been stated sub rosa that she did make claims. Whether she The war was not did or did not it is quite evident that from the beginning to the end of the war she kept her compact with the Allied Powers.

If , on the other hand, turning fro m the policy of armed force, she enters the sphere of peaceful economic penetration, even then, apart from the great natural resources of that country which has been the cradle of nations, she has a vast field for her energies for centuries ahead. If . by neither armed force nor peaceful penetration she can maintain herself in Siberia, if out of Soviet Russia there comes a mighty force that sweeps her out of the country, even then she will be no menace to Australia, for in eastern Siberia, at her own door, she will have a power that w ill gnaw like a rat at the very vitals of her civilization. Then, upon what grounds do honourable members say that J apan at this hour threatens, our civilization ? Whatever may have been It is evident that Japan her opportunities from 1914 to 1917, she did not take advantage of them.

Some £60,000,000 is going out, in one form and another, to the soldiers. Australia is in the sweeping away of the unproductive load of debt. I have been reading in the papers that expenditure upon various civil Departments of this country has risen by about 50 per cent. I cannot help thinking about the newspapers themselves, and about their magnificent proprietaries. I cannot help recalling that they have raised the price of their daily papers by 50 per cent., and by at least 100 per cent, on Saturdays. Asf o r the price of advertisements, they have gone up 120 per oent.; and even the prices charged for soldiers' memorial notices have risen in Uke proportion. But if I were to say to these great newspaper proprietors, "" W h y have you raised your prices?"" they would answer, "" It is not due to red tape; it is not to be set down to waste in departmental expenditure ' ' for these gentlemen would not permit any waste in their business; they are so anxious to rake everything into their own pockets that they take mighty fine care not to keep wasteful servants. No ; they would explain the rise in the price of their commodities by pointing to the enormous increases in cost of materials-as a result of the war, of course-and in the scale of wages demanded by labour. What is true for them, as private individuals, however, is equally true of every Department of States and Commonwealth. No t along those lines can one hope to economize. But, here are these honourable gentlemen of the Country party, who came into this Chamberf r o m among their simple r u r a l constituents. When I lay at home, sick, I read that a majority of honourable members in this Chamber were about to increase their remuneration. lighted. I knew that the project would be carried to victory; and I knew that these honourable members in the Corner, although they were fighting the proposal most vigorously:-ther e never was such a band of heroes-whil e they went forward and with the sincere and honest belief, and with the holy joy of knowledge in their hearts, that they were bound to be defeated. How magnificent was their courage! See how they fought for these few thousands! And now rises a question involving millions. I want to see them defend the proposal to save those millions. Of course; what is a Why should this country proceed to spend millions more upon its defence, after years of warfare, than before the war? The only possible hope for Can any honourable member justify it? Honourable members to whom I am addressing myself do not reply. They are driven to ignominious silence.

Here we have an opportunity to cut it down, not by a few thousand pounds, but by a couple of million pounds, and yet there are honourable members in this Chamber who claim to be neither abject followers of the Government nor their definite opponents, and who are pledged to a policy of economy, although all the time their party has been in existence they have done nothing but make protests about in finitesimal items of expenditure, and propose to do nothing where the Estimates could easily be curtailed by £2,000,000. actions since we have been here.

195,Mr Anstey,"Yes, and also to therather than to give abject votes for the Government without one single word of explanation. On what grounds do honourable members of his party support this particular vote, upon which they have an opportunity of curtailing the expenditure of Australia by a couple of million pounds ? The least they can do is to voice their support of the Government's proposals. country, which I shall quote, not because I always believe in what it save, but because it suits my book to do so. I know f u l l well that the same journal, when an election crisis comes, w ill denounce and seek to drive out of publio life every man who voices the opinions it has supported prior to the election, and that it is its policv to denounce the Government, in between elections, and support it at election time -keep Father Jergeri n Australia; but paper? men worship, and follow, when they think it convenient to do so. A t any rate, this great daily newspaper, on the 4th November, 1919, made this affirmationIs Australia's danger greater than Germany was beaten? If I had made .use of these words, the statement would have been used against toe, but I quote it now, because ib has been said by a paper which no Victorian dare controvert. When I tell honourable members that this statement appeared in fche Age, they will remain silent. However, this is what it says: Is Australia's danger greater than it was before Germany was beaten? If so, the appalling sacrifices of the war have been made by this generation in vain. It will be hard to convince tbe people that we need defences greater than those which sufficed to win "" the war to end war."" Yet we are told that no preparation is being made for the lean days in front of us. When we have a dead weight of in debtedness weighing us down into the slough of depression, our only hope is to curtail our expenditure wherever possible. Age reminds me of the devil quoting Scripture. Age because it voices my opinion, and because honourable members cannot denounce an opinion which they know must also be their own. I conclude this disconnected speech by taking the opportunity of saying two things. Last night the Minister representing the Minister for Defence interpolated a remark about a gentleman named Jerger. It had nothing to do with the subject under discussion, and it had no application to myself, but I know the purpose for which it was made. My family connexions were English before any GermanK in g sat upon the throne of Britain, and whatever may have been There is a newspaper in this the merits or demerits of this Father Jerger, I have no desire to discuss him or the question of Catholics versus nonCatholics, or matters concerning any man's religion or nationality; b ut I do desire to discuss an odious law in its application to men of the working class of British origin. Great as is the power of the Church of Rome, with its ramifications throughout Australia, apparently it was not sufficient or powerful enough to there are other gentlemen who can be kept here. While Father Jerger was being exported, Mr Hirschfeld could sun himself on the sands of Coogee. He was a man who came here in full-blown manhood. He was a supporter of the German Empire, and he did before not confine himself to words only, but his actions were inimical to the interests of this country. What influence had he behind him ? He has no church to keep him here. Then what order of black masonry of wealth enables him to silence justice and the .Administration of this country ? The other day the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr) mentioned the case of another German named Herz, who, apparently, is not a member of the Catholic Church, but yet is able so to direct influences here as to silence the Administration and justice, and maintain himself here. Perhaps, later on, we shall be able to have some light thrown upon the merits of these men. The TEMPORARYCHAIRMAN The honourable member has exhausted his time. had thought that after, the speech of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr. Anstey) one of the Country party would 1 merely quote the have justified what I anticipate will be their vote upon this expenditure.

200,Mr Mcgrath (Ballarat) [ 8 . 9 ],"Iwar, and I cannot comprehend what their answer will be when their constituents ask for an explanation of their support of this increased expenditure. that. MrM c GRATH You ""will find it a difficult task. I have just returned from an election campaign where a farmers' candidate had the pleasure of paying £ 5 0 into the Consolidated Revenue, and in that campaign on every platform I spoke against the creation of a military class in this country. We were told tliat the war was to end wars, and was to make Democracy safe, and establish peace for all time; that if we only conquered Germany, as explained by the article fro m the Age quoted by the honourable member for Bourke, Australia would be in a much safer position. conquered; yet I believe that in a few years' time it will be victorious; at least, it will not be obliged to pay for military and naval establishments. hand, those who went to the war had one set purpose, and that was to defeat the Prussian Junkers. They littl e thought that in defeating the military caste of Germany they were creating a military class in Australia. There would not be many Australians anxious to go away again if they thought that their doing so would be merely for the purpose of adding to the millitary fetters on the people of this country. but failed to do by conscription, it is now seeking to do by means of this Budget. sought to impose militarism on the people, and any one who dared to say a word against conscription was charged with being a pro-German, or w it h being disloyal to the British Empire. who said a word in favour of it was charged with being an anti-Labourite. MrM c GRATH with being an anti-Australian it would have been truth , but, as a matter of fact, put up a better fight in 1914 than the any one who said a word in favour of conscription was an anti-Labourite. cannot understand how men who at one time professed to be Labourites could support a proposal for conscription. If they had seen something of the war they would not have been so anxious to send any one to fight. What would have been the national debt of Australia if the people had accepted conscription ? Our burden is bad enough as it is, but we would have been faced with financial ruin. Had members on the benches opposite had their way they would have bled Australia white of its manhood. They proposed I hope you w ill . to send away 16,000 men per month. There would have been hardly a young man l e f t in the country. Thank God they failed at both their referendums to conscript the manhood of this country. But, although they failed then to create -a military class, this Budget w ill _ do it. I shall vote on every occasion against increased expenditure on military and naval items. It is unnecessary to have military training. If the war proved anything it proved that young Australians, many of whom had not previously known one end of a rifle from another, were after training for a month Well, Germany has been or two equal to, if not superior to, any other troops engaged in the fighting. member is not arguing that an untrained On the other Australian is better than a trained Australian ? MrM c GRATH I am arguing that we are wasting the lives of our boys by training them: to t u r n to the righ t and t u r n to the left. I have been where the honourable member has not been, and no one can deny that when they are marching up the lines of communication the officers do not care a rap whether the men are in step or out of What this Government sought step. All they care about is that the men get up to the f r o n t the best way they can. The faul t of the BritishA r m y By means of conscription it was that they were splendid on parade. The very life was driven out of them by continuous drilling, with being taught how to click their heels together, and salute. Our lads could not do that so well as the soldiers in other armies, but And any one they could do tlie real thing much better in the fighting in the trenches. If he were charged did some pretty good work! . MrM c GRATH No army could have regular BritishA r m y ; nobody will deny I that for one moment, in view of the trials they had to undergo. the most trained men. were well f e d ; but, unfortunately, later on, England had to go into the slums of the Old World for recruits.

When I hear a proposition to take lads for ten weeks at a time, and throw them into a military camp for 3s. or 4s. a day make no mistake, the youth of this country will not go, for ten weeks a year, into a camp for three and four shillings a day. Sir member ought to be ashamed of himself for making such a suggestion 1 MrM c GRATH I can prevent youths from going, I shall do so. I will do anything I can to prevent them being taken away for ten weeks in one year. Many of the men affected are married, and I wonder how their wives and families are going to live during that time. Apart from the matter of pay, it is my belief that preparations for war never prevented war. The whole reading of historv teaches us that every nation that is prepared for war has-a war brought about; the more preparations are made for war, the greater certainty there is of another war. If Germany and France had not been led by the junkers of both countries, this war would never have occurred. And , then, as soon as the war is over, the Commonwealth Government bring out Lord Jellicoe and Sir William Birdwood, with a view to gigantic preparations in the Military Force and the Navy. As the honourable member for 1 Bourke( Mr Anstey) pointed out, there will be no war here for the next twenty years. Honourable members forget that there is another class arising in -this country who will have a say as to war. That class will not allow politicians to talk, as in the past, about the abolition of secret diplomacy, and then, as soon as war is over, resort to it , for it is that method of diplomacy that brings about war. Only the other day the leader of trade Unionismi n England said to Mr Llovd George, "" A t your peril, touch the Russian workmen, and you w ill have to deal with the workmen of tlie .United ""Kingdom."" The same spirit that prevented the capitalistic classes of England going to war with Soviet Russia w ill prevent Our boys themany other war in this world. In Australia many of the military class, who have pretty good comfortable jobs, desire another war. These men took care that they did not place their lives in jeopardy, and did not make any financial sacrifices because of the war; they know, as has often been said"", that war means promotion, and, therefore,, they wish to create a military caste or class here. As an Australian, I trust that Australia will mind her own business, for if she does not seek to steal the oil of somebody else, or to attain some commercial supremacy, the chances are that our boys will never have to undergo another war. I am going to vote to-night, and I shall vote when the Defence Estimates are before us, to reduce expenditure down to I guarantee that if that of pre-war days. There is no necessity for building new battleships and creating an A r m y of 130,000, with five divisions, in a young country like this. We ought not to fill the minds of our children with hatred of th© people of other countries; it is a most cruel thing to instil such an idea into the minds of young people; and if we do it we shall certainly bring about another war. if we reduce the Estimates to their pre-war dimensions we must have very much less efficiency than in those days? have nothing to thank themselves for in connection with what was done in pre-war days, so f a r as concerns the war itself. There was not much efficiency then, I admit, for there were not many on the permanent staff of much use. The best men we have had in the Australian Imperial Force were volunteers, and any efficiency was not created by the staff that existed previously. if we look up the records of some of the members of that staff, we find names of those who are figuring largely to-day as so-called military leaders, b u t they were, in some cases, returned from the war because their services were no longer required. Nowi t is proposed to create another large permanent staff. Duntroon is being used to turn out lads who are superseding the men now on the instructional staff, men who did good work at the war.

I hope that honourable members who came here mouthing economy w ill take advantage of the opportunity now presented to them. their f a it h in the principles they espoused cry that we must enter it to end war and to on the public platform. There is no fear that the efficiency of Australia to defend herself w ill he impaired if this expenditure is reduced. As Australians have defended themselves in the past without any training, so they w ill in the future. We at least know that the one enemy we were told to guard against, namely, Germany, lies crippled to-day, and cannot, for twenty or thirty years, be a military nation. I am hopeful that the German workmen will abide by the terms of the Peace Treaty. They ought to be thankf u l for those terms, for they mean that their A i m y and Navy are done away with. Germany w ill be the gainer by that step. While we are piling up taxation to increase our A r m y and Navy, Germany has nothing to fear, for no nation w ill attack her. markets abroad, and neither she nor Australia need fear the Russian workmen.

Major-General Sir John Davidson, speaking in the House of Commons, said that in 1919 provision was made for an expenditure of £405,000,000; that in 1920, that expenditure was cut down to £125,000,000, and that there was a continuous clamour to reduce it to a normal year's expenditure of £60,000,000. Brigadier-General Cockerill, speaking in the House of Commons on the 22nd March last, said that the number of combatants before the war -infantry , artillery, engineers, cavalry was 150,000, and that today provision was being made for 170,000. fore the war GreatB r it a in had only about 150,000 trained troops. It s A r m y of nearly 5,000,000 strong was built up in a few years, which shows that it does not take long to convert a civilian into a well-trained soldier. If that was possible in Great Britain, then I may say, without offence to the Old Country, that it would be a much easier task in Australia. The Australian is a man of vast initiative, and no people could more quickly make themselves ready to defend their country than could the people of the Commonwealth.

He was followed by a young and eminent professor of the JapaneseU n i versity, who spoke in a similar strain. It is stated in this Associated Press message that never has there been such political turmoil in Japan as in recent times, owing firstly to the franchise having beeu denied the great bulk of the people, ancl secondly because of opposition to the military class in power. Very strong views are being expressed in practically every Parliament of the world in opposition to excessive m i l i tarism and increased naval ancl military expenditure.

I am only concerned about the indemnity in showing how unreliable the statements were when we were told of the great work of the Prime Minister at the Peace Conference. When we come to reflect on the great work whicli we are told was done by the Prime Minister at the Peace Conference, and upon the fact that the great indemnity which Australia was to get has vanished into thin air, we are rather inclined to doubt that the right honourable gentleman was something that Australia should be proud of, or that he stood out at Versailles as the one great figure among the representatives of the nations of the world. to asked for money, he cannot find it ; he does not see how it can be got.

For the benefit of honourable members. I shall repeat them. When the honourable member was speaking, the M in ister for the Navy( Mr Laird Smith) claimed that hn had included expenditure upon Expeditionary Forces £700,000. ports. deliberately omitted these figures, and he d i d not include the Navy items of £356,000 for Miscellaneous, and £10,000 for trading vessels. The three items, Transport Services, Miscellaneous, and Trading Vessels represent £1,066,000, which he omitted from his calculations. Apart from that expenditure the total provision on these Estimates for military, naval and air defence is over £8,000,000. On page 158 of the Estimates the total military expenditure, not including war services, is £1,550,000. On page 343 the total' expenditure on additions, new works and buildings for the Defence Department is £1,302,153. On page 369 there is a total of £318,204 for expenditure from loan funds for Defence works. On page 328 is an item of £1,547,924 representing W a r services payable out of revenue. These items of military defence amount to £4,718,281. Then we t u r n to the Navy. On page 195 of the Estimates we find that tlie total expenditure on the Navy, not including war services, is £2,279,238. On page 344 we find an item of £313,214 for additions, new works, buildings, & c , for the Navy Department. On page 370 the expenditure out of loan funds for works for the Navy is set down as £302,100. That gives a total of £2,849,000 for naval expenditure, apart from the £1,066,000 to which I have just referred. On page 345 we find an item of £294,000 for new works for military a i r services, and on page 196 the sum of I shall not say £305,833 is set down for air services, generally, giving a total of £590,000 for this branch of defence. The grand total of expenditure under these headings The item before the is thus £8,222,000, apart from the is not £3,000,000, b u t £1,066,000 which I have just mentioned, and which would increase the total to £9,288,866, as set ou t in tlie Estimates introduced by the Treasurer.

Afterwards, when we were sitting in the lobby, I said to him, "" Sir Thomas, what was wrong about that statement of mine?"" touched a bell and said, "" Have a d r in k; every word you said was true, but I was not going to let you get it in . "" Knowing the Treasurer's principles, I would not accuse him of being ready to act on the first words of Sir Thomas Bent, but, as for the rest, I leave honourable members to judge. Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) was asked, after making a broad statement, to give details, and he did so, but because, on one of the pages to which he referred there was included an item about the £1,500,000, but about the statement made by the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook)-becaus e there happened to be included an item of expenditure on the graves of dead soldiers. for Hume mentioned' the item of £1,500,000. Works and Railways( Mr Groom) has now come into the scuffle, although I find it hard enough to handle one man a.t a time. The Treasurer was not fair, even to himself, when he imputed base motives to the honourable member for Hume, simply because the latter had complied w it h the request for details. Neither th© honourable member for Hume nor anybody else objects to that particular item of expenditure. WhatI oppose is not expenditure on our Expeditionary Forces, or in connection with our dead soldiers. Sir commend the honourable member for that. His colleagues are not game to do what he is doing. goes again! In any case, whatever may be the diversities of opinion between the Treasurer and my colleagues, he and I can at least say that we stand on a most fraternal basis. items before us, just as I objected to the £1,300,000, not because they are for the maintenance of any existing form of defence, but because, under various pleas, additional expenditure is proposed at the very hour in the history of our country when the Treasurer says it is in a critical position. I do not oppose any expenditure which goes to the men-of-war's men and soldiers of the country; and I have said so repeatedly; but there is a conHe stant switching away from that standpoint. ber's position is ' perfectly clear and straightf orwar d. which may not seem to be so clear as to my reasons. Permit me to read a quotaThe honourable member for tion so as to get it into Hansard, a publication which people interested in the welfare of the country may sometimes read. The Prime MinisterI quote h im in order to exhibit my reverence for him -mad e this statementWe cannot hope to be'the same as before the I am not talking war. We have great and crushing burdens, which we must bear. The Treasurer will endorse thai:We have a debt as great as Canada and South Africa put together. The firm foundations upon .which the world rested before the war have been undermined, and we are now living in a world rocking and tumbling with violent convulsions. Of course, that is somewhat in conflict with what the right honourable gentleman had said a few days previously, namely, that we were in the "" green fields of perpetual peace.'' How we can be "" rocking and tumbling with violent convulsions"" in the "" green fields of perpetual peace '' is a conundrum. The Prime Minister also saidThe nations impoverished by war are confronted with a new set of financial, national, and industrial circumstances. Humanity has indulged in a terrible orgy of destruction-it must pay the price. The Treasurer says that also; and it supplies my reason for opposing these items, tempt' to switch off to other motives, which are implied in such questions as, "" Do we not need defence?"" or "" W h a t would have happened to us if Germany had won?'-' The same question might just as well be p u t to German workmen.

In conclusion, I may say that, in passing this vote, it must not be said that I am acquiescing in a continuation of the present naval policy of Australia. surer) [10.16] I think that something should be said in answer to the statements made by the honourable member for Frankmischievous, and should not have been made in an assembly such a3 this. If the honourable member really means what he says, he should not vote for one penny on these Estimates, because any man who says that our present Navv is useless should not contribute one penny towards its upkeep. May I remind the honourable member how idle it is to say that our Fleet cannot defend Australia in and by itself? A schoolboy knows that. nothing more to be said? Have we not any right to make any contribution to that great Fleet which defends the whole Empire? Surely, because we cannot do everything, it cannot be said that we should do nothing at all. Does the honourable member think that, because we cannot defend 12,000 miles of coastline by ourselves, we should not do anything ? The honourable member says that our Navy is a farce, and that we are wasting money upon it ; but surely he is not serious. lieve that, until we can get a Navy which w ill make us absolutely self-contained in the matter of naval defence, Ave should not spend anything at all? It is a preposterous argument. the opinion I held when I was in company with the Treasurer on the other side of the House. the honourable ment does not count for very much, and the -man who glories in the fact that war has not changed his opinions in the No .

Sir JOSEPH COOK I am afraid I shall still have to rely for my naval direction and final judgment on those who are experts, and who have devoted their whole time to naval matters. These authorities do not suggest that our ships are obsolete in any sense of the term, and they in for m me that they can be made a very useful addition to the great British Navy. The honourable member's argument is f a t al to any Navy, and fatal to the expenditure They are most of any money. It is our duty to make as f u l l a contribution as our finances w ill permit towards the development of as large a naval force as, in conjunction with the British Navy, w ill give us a reasonable chance of defending our shores from attack. That is the position, in a nutshell. I admit that we cannot defend Australia by ourselves. Our Navy is not big enough to do that; but we can do our duty and make an adequate contribution But is there to the sum of those forces which, next year, are to be considered by the I m perial Conference, and which w ill , in the end, I believe, give us a naval defence in the Pacific which will save us from any predatory designs that may be entertained. But I beg the honourable member not to raise those issues now. There is really only one thing to do in connection with this item, and that is to pay our debts. This monev has been spent. story !

They brought their Estimates in in the following year. notcorrect. Australia has been a matter which has given rise to very many discussions in this .House. I remember a famous speech delivered by the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook), in Adelaide', I think, wherein he referred to the boats of the River classthe vessels which were really the nucleus of the Australian Navy. I refer to those destroyers which were named after the river running through the Treasurer's constituency-that is to say, the Parramatta -and the river which runs through my constituency, namely, the Yarra.' in order to create good relations between yourself and the Treasurer. I remember that speech of the Treasurer concerning the River class of vessels; bu t I do not propose to do, as was done last night, namely, to t u r n up the records of utterances ten years old. I intend, rather, to refer to the actions of some honourable members, who are still in this Chamber, when they put out a Government of which I was a member, not because they would not agree to the formation of an Australian Navy, but because they would not give a Dreadnought to the Mother Country. Those honourable members were glad enough of the actions taken by the Government at the inception of the war in regard to the Australia, when the German warships, the Scharnhorst and the Gneisenau, were known to be in Australian waters. Sir whatever to do with the Australia. office because we would not give a Dreadnought to the Mother Country. Following earlier remarks of mine this evening, the Treasurer stated that I was right and that I was also wrong: I was right in the figures which I quoted; I was wrong in not putting them a l l in . Since the Minister spoke previously, I have found another item, of £1,210,000. I do not say, even now, that the total is complete, because these items can be found all through the Estimates. This sum of £1,210,000 is set out on page 361. Of course, it is an item which has to do with last year. No financial year has ever passed in which we have not been called upon to consider belated Estimates, after the money has been spent. The amount represented .in this item has probably also been spent. Then, there is still The naval policy of another matter for addition to our grand total. A new defence system is being in augurated.

In addition to the present grand total of £10,478,866 it must be remembered that that sum is quite apart from any supplementary estimates which may be brought down. Wlhat is the use of talking about an expenditure of £3,000,000 upon defence, and £3,000,000 upon the navy?

I have since that date received telegrams from ""Western Australia in forming me that the staff at the Henderson Naval Base has received a month's notice, which expires on the 31st October. There is a general feeling of alarm amongst the residents of Fremantle, because it is anticipated that this particular Commonwealth work is likely to be closed down. I want to know from the Ministeri n charge of the B ill just what work is intended to be undertaken there during the ensuing twelve months? If we review the Naval Base situation throughout the Commonwealth, we shall realize that during the last seven or eight years we have completed what was ' in tended to be very small and minor sub-bases at Flinders, and that in respect to the major Bases, which were to be provided, for under the original report of Admira l Hfenderson, namely, those at Oockburn Sound and Port Stephens, nothing has been accomplished. Making due allowance for the fact that we have passed through years of war, and that money has been very difficult to obtain, there has been a sufficient lapse of time to have enabled the officers of the Department and the Government to determine what their policy is to be. In the answer given to my question, I was told that it was proposed to expend £30,000 on survey work at the Henderson Naval Base, but the history and records concerning that Base demonstrate that surveys have been made there from time to time, but that the work has been delayed and postponed. Speaking as the representative of the constituency most vitally affected, I want to enter a protest against any further postponement of this i m portant work. ""We have had investigations by Admira l Henderson, by Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice, and by Lord Jellicoe, and now, apparently as the result of their concentrated wisdom., it is intended to postpone the development of the Henderson Naval Base indefinitely. I cannot allow this measure to pass anxious to know what is i h the mind of without voicing in the strongest possible terms the objection of the people of Western Australia, and particularly of more convenient if the clauses of the B ill my own constituency, to this method of are first dealt with, as it seems that the doing business.

I remind the honourable gentleman that work has been done in connection with the dredging of the Pamela and Success banks, and unless those works are maintained they are likely to deteriorate. I remind the honourable gentleman, also, that it took years to procure the necessary staff for this particular Base, and if it is now in tended to scatter the members of that staff throughout Australia, whenever it is the intention of the Government to resume work at the Henderson Naval Base, it will be necessary to again go through the trouble of securing the right type of men ior the job. I appeal to the Minister to make some statement which will throw some light upon what is proposed in connection with this particular work, and in connection with the Naval Base policy, of the Government generally. I have mentioned Port Stephens, and on looking through the Loan Estimates I find that the only provision made in respect of that place is a vote of £23,000 for land resumption. member is wrong there. The amount to be appropriated under this B ill is only £8,926. able member's attention to the fact that in the second column of the schedule there appears an amount of £14,074, which is already available under appropriations made under previous Acts, and this, with the amount to which he has referred, brings the total vote for the resumption of land for the Port Stephens Naval Base to the amount of £23,000, which I have mentioned. I do not wish to detain the Committee, and if the M in ister will consent to make some statement as to what is proposed to be done at the Henderson Naval Base, I shall resume my seat. I do desire that the honourable gentleman should make public the intention of the Government in regard to that particular Base, as I am being deluged with wires on the subject fro m Western Australia, and the people there are very the Government.",72,Loanbill 1920

Scheduleter for Works and Railways) [10.58] In reply to the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Burchell) I have to say that the question of the construction of the Naval Bases came under the review of the Naval Board, and the members of the Board had to consider it in the light of the money available. Of the amount of £187,000 set down for the Naval Bases, £27,635 represents the expenditure for the Naval works staff, and an amount of £84,431 is made available for the F l in ders Naval Base to complete the work tliere. The Department has already gone into-occupation of the Base, and the sums set down are simply to complete the work there. As regards ""the Henderson Naval 'Base, it was some time ago decided by the Board to curtail the work to a great extent. All excavations and works of that kind were stopped, and only a certain amount of preservative work continued. Dredging was gone on with for a time, but now the Board has decided to cease operations. brought in for overhaul, and sufficient of the staff will be kept on for that purpose. In the meantime a special marine survey, which has already been started, will be completed. -vey previously ? -the special survey is the result of a recommendation of Lord Jellicoe. The question -of the whole naval policy will come up for review later on. Of course, a number of the members of the staff will 'be dispensed with, but a few will be kept on for the work I have mentioned. move That the following items be left out:"" Federal Capital Territory-Initia l settlement, efficiency and economy, and this is cer£90,000; preparatory works, £60,000; railways, completion of construction line, -Federal Capital Territory, £250."" I am sorry that owing, to the hubbub in the chamber it was impossible to raise an objection to this expenditure earlier in the evening. Some honourable members say that this money is being invested in reproductive works; but if there is one item on the schedule on which we can economize, it is in relation to Canberra. The removal of the Seat of Government to Canberra to-day is a proposal I strenuously oppose. I think the time might be ripe for a change ten years hence, when our burden of debt is considerably less than it is now; and I can say that there is a considerable backing for the opinion I am now expressing. This question has been sufficiently debated, and I shall not detain the Committee, by, as it were, dragging out ghosts, or opening up old sores. deal has been said about honourable members preaching economy during the election campaign. I was not prepared to cut down absolutely essential expenditure on defence; but there is not the least doubt in ' m y mind, nor, I think , in the minds of honourable members generally, that the people of the country, as a whole, are opposed to spending money on the Federal Capital at the present time, whatever may be decided in this connection in the future. It would be a waste of money to undertake such a work when money is dear, material and workmen scarce, especially in view of the fact The vessels will be that there is a dearth of houses throughout Australia. Like the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) I shall not detain the Committee with any lengthy remarks. There is no need to debate the question, because I am sure that every honourable member has made up his mind. I do not think that there is an honourable member who can truly say that to build this Capital now is to undertake useful work. I desire to support the amendment, and I should like to have some explanation of the item, "" Landi n Federal Capital Territory, £ 1 0 , 8 0 0 . "" I am not opposed to the building of the capital at Canberra when money is available, and we have returned to normal times; but at present I think that such a work would be a great mistake. The Country party stands for tainly a matter in which we can economize with efficiency. Eveni f we do spend £150,000 on the Federal Capital, in the next ten years we shall not have a place to which we can shift the Seat of Government. In the meantime we shall have to keep up the buildings, and a lot of work will have been done there for no purpose.

I support the amendment of the honourable member for Bass for a reduction of the Estimates by the amounts mentioned. I support the amendment of the honourable member for Bass, but I am lost in amazement at the conspiracy of silence of those who are prepared to commit the people of Australia to such an expenditure at this juncture in our affairs.

It is obvious that there has been a conspiracy to rush this thing through in the quickest possible time, without members being given an opportunity to debate a matter which is of the utmost importance to the whole of the people of Australia. A t this late hour I should like the consent of the Minister in charge of the business to continue my remarks to-morrow.
