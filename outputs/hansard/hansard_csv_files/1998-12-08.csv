One of the reasons we can say with in a higher income bracket. A reduction in the number of tax brackets from 29 in 1973-74 to 4 in great confidence that we are not adding an 1978 contributed to this increase in taxation. extra impost on the Australian people is that According to Dr Alan Tapper, (author of The we will be collecting less tax overall under Family in the Welfare State) between 1960 and the new system than we do under the existing 1990, the effective tax rate on individuals rose by system because we have a surplus on the 83 per cent, and the effective tax rates on the budget. We are handing back to the Australfamily rose by 360 per cent. The ""effective tax"" Ian people-the shareholders in Australia-a rate takes into account both taxation and benefits. part of that surplus, effectively as a dividend. Dr Tapper claims that in the Australian welfare state today, there is a large transfer from young In restructuring the system, yes we are households to old (over 55) households, sole-parent going to have the GST but we are going to families are substantial beneficiaries of the welfare make sure that, where people are going to be state, and two-parent families are net losers, adversely affected purely in terms of the GST, contributing more in taxes than they receive in benefits. they get compensation in one form or another, depending on their circumstances. So if you It is also interesting to note that in 1987 Mr are a pensioner, you get a pension increase. Don Edgar, then Director of the Australian If you are a self-funded retiree with some Institute of Family Studies, said: money in the bank, because the cost of living ... a one income family with two children required will go up by 1.9 per cent or thereabouts and an income of $42,900 a year in order to have the therefore your nest egg is slightly devalued, same standard of living as a single male on average yearly earnings of $24,000. you will get a lump sum to compensate so that your nest egg is not devalued.

So everybody gets of the taxation system. And therefore I want compensated to some extent. It seems to me to see that situation adjusted, and what we are that that is a very good way to approach proposing in this legislation is aimed very things. much at making sure that young families get a better deal. The reason we need to do some of these things is that the present system is frankly I think it is also important that we look very broke indeed. My electorate in fact has very carefully at the proportion of taxation a very high proportion of young families, and that governments raise from various sourcesthose young families are doing it quite hard both through the indirect taxation system and in the area of taxation, and have been doing from the personal taxation system. Again, I so for quite a long time. I quote from the would like to quote from the same source: Kevin Andrews book Changing Australia. The Australian taxation system relies disproportionThis is a very good basic reference book; it ately on the taxation of income, particularly investment income, relative to consumption. Over is not a book of opinion. It actually quotes the past decade, personal income tax as a share of good sources-the ABS and others-on total Federal Budget revenue has risen from 35 per factual information. I read to the House a cent to 54 per cent. This compares to an average of short extract from that book on the subject of 31 per cent for nations in the OECD. Overall, families and taxation which will give the personal income taxation in Australia (across all House, I hope, an idea of why we need to levels of government) is 40.1 per cent of all taxes collected, compared to an OECD average of 27.5 change the tax system: per cent. It has been estimated that by the early 1990s, a family paid two and three-quarters times the tax I think that one of the most telling condemnapaid in 1996-97, while the single person paid one tions of the current tax system is found in and two-thirds times as much. Much of the increase marginal tax rates.

I can assure the House that what we are proposing is a jolly sight So it seems to me that that whole process more straightforward than what we have at demonstrates that there is a lack of incentive the present time.
