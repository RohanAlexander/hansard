Prime Minister whether, in view of the non-receipt of advice' from Colonel Hoad at Tokio that he has been allowed to proceed to the front, he will cause representations to be made to the Japanese Government with a view to induce them to permit the'only military attache representing the Commonwealth to pursue the object pf his journey, and not occupy his time in Japan, itself. the Minister of Defence, has been considering that matter already. I have not had an opportunity of speaking to him on the subject to-day, but 1 understand' that his intention is tb endeavour to induce the Japanese Government to grant permission to Colonel Hoad to go to the front. Failfrig such permission, he will instruct Colonel Hoad to return to Australia.

I would ask, further, whether the Minister has any official information with regard to the proposal, and, if 'so, whether he will lay it before the House, so that, in dealing with the High Commissioner Bill, , we may be able to define, as far as possible, the powers attached to the office, particularly in this connection. of any official information, or of any information other than that which the honourable member has indicated as having been derived from the press. If such a proposal be made to this Government officially, every opportunity will be afforded honourable members to consider the' powers and duties of the Commissioner as a member of the proposed board, when the High Commis-. sioner Bill is before the Chamber.. following papers:Report by Mr Chesterman upon the proposed Federal Capital site, iu the Tooma district.

My honourable colleague, the Minister of Home Affairs, has already taken preliminary steps in ail the States, ancl in some of them, including New South Wales, arrangements have been completed for the ie-collection of the rolls for Federal purposes. nearly finished sary particulars are available the Government will take steps for -a redistribution of the electorates, if , as we anticipate, the rolls show that such a course is neccesary. Mr G. B. EDWARDS the Prime Minister whether it is the intention of the Government to appoint a Committee of Public Accounts. The late Government promised that this matter' should receive attention, and I think it is desirable a committee should be appointed, if only to preserve the simplicity that is at present observed in the public accounts. any detailed attention to the suggestion, but I think that the principle is a good one. It has been adopted by a number of the States and also in Great Britain. however, that looking at the matter as a private member for a considerable time, I thought that the system followed by my predecessor, the late Treasurer, was such a good one that there was no urgent necessity for making a change. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -We should take measures to preserve the present simplicity. the desirability of preserving a good system of keeping the public accounts, it may be necessary to create such a body as that indicated by the honourable member.

In view of the large additional outlay involved, it is not considered practicable to proceed at present with the reconstruction of the corps recently disbanded; and it is proposed, therefore, to postpone the consideration of this question until the financial year 1905-6. The grant of militia rates of pav in Tasmania represents an increase of about' £6,000 ; but, owing to the decrease in the number of troops by 484, the nett increased expenditure involved will be about £4,000. change embrace all the troops? in any other State. that are admittedly volunteer corps, and I would ask it is not proposed to pay those. Under the new scheme proposed by the General Officer Commanding, a certain proportion of the troops in Tasmania are to be placed on the footing of militia. That intention was not carried out last year, owing to the desire of the late Treasurer to assist'the Tasmanian Government; but this year we propose to spend .£4,000 in converting the volunteer corps into Militia Forcesis without defences. I must say, to that. the Prime Minister whether he intends to lay upon the table the report of the recent Conference on the question of Federal Quarantine, and, if so, when. league, the Minister of Trade and Customs, is now absent from Melbourne, and I am not aware of his intentions in this reThe spect, but if the honourable member will repeat his question next week, my honourable colleague will furnish him with an answer.",12,Electoral Act Administration Committee

22,Mr Watson,"My honourable colupon notice. Whether there is any justification for the following statement by the Honourable R. W. Foster, ex-Commissioner of Public Works for South Australia :"" The increasing burdens consequent on Federal extravagance cannot be much longer borne with equanimity. It is exasperating to know that, as .the State is economizing at every point, the Federal powers continue to spend with airy prodigality."" pare the present expenditure with that which was incurred before Federation, for the reason that certain services are now charged to the votes of the Departments, which, in .the various States, were either free or charged to votes of other Departments under State control. The principal of such services now debited to the Departments are (a) cost of maintenance of buildings and works; (b) rents; (c) water and sewerage rates; (d) printing, advertising, and stationery; (e) postage and telegrams; (/) railway travelling; (g) audit. Of course, it is possible that certain of these services were charged to the Departments in South Australia, but I have no accurate information to guide me on this point. It is admittedly difficult to glean from the mere perusal of the Estimates or Appropriation Acts of the various States the exact position prior to the transfer of the Departments to the Commonwealth. It would, therefore, be impossible to make an accurate comparison, unless a special officer were sent to South Australia to collect proper data. Another difficulty presents itself owing to the fact that, in order to institute a fair comparison, the expenditure for arrears should be eliminated from the years to be. compared. As caref ul an examination as has been possible without incurring the expense of sending an officer to South Australia, has been made, with the following result:-The cost of the Customs Department in 1900-1 was £ 2 5 , 8 4 6 ; in 1901-2, £ 2 7 , 2 9 5 ; in 1902-3, £ 2 5 , 9 5 1 ; in 1903-4, £ 2 5 , 6 1 8 . Thus, there has been a net reduction of £ 2 0 0 . The expenditure in connection with the Defence Department was, in 1900-1, £55,'999 ; in 1901-2, £ 5 4 , 1 8 8 ; in 1902-3, £ 4 9 , 5 8 3 ; . in 1903-4, phone service is also responsible for an £ 6 6 , 4 5 7 , or .an increase of-approximately £ r 0,000. The expenditure upon the Post' Office was, in 1900-1, £ 2 2 2 , 2 7 1 ; in 1901-2, £ 2 3 1 , 1 9 8 ; in 1902-3, £ 2 3 7 , 0 7 3 ; in 1903-4, £ 2 4 0 , 1 0 3, or a net increase of about £ 1 8 , 0 0 0. The total expenditure upon the whole of the transferred Departments was-1900-1 , £ 3 0 4 , 1 1 6 ; 1901-2, £ 3 1 2 , 6 8 1 ; 1902-3, £ 3 1 2 , 6 0 7 ; and 1903-4, £33 > 7%Therefore, there is an appa2 1 rent total increase of £ 2 8 , 0 0 0. The expenditure of the Defence Department for the year 1903-4 shows an increase of £ 1 0 , 4 5 8 , when compared with the expenditure for the year 1900-1, but included in the expenditure for the year 1903-4 is a charge of £ 2 2 , 8 92 to cover arrears in connection with the maintenance of the Auxilary Squadron, the usual annual charge being only £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 . That fully accounts for fhe increase in the expenditure of the Defence Department. Under the heading New Works, the expenditure of the Defence Department in 1903-4 was £ 1 2 , 0 3 5, which included £ 1 0 , 2 9 4 for rifles and reserve ammunition provided out of revenue, whereas, -in the year 1900-1, £ 1 6 , 2 5 6 was similarly expended, but the money was provided from loan funds. The paying for stores from revenue is in accordance with the policy adopted some time ago by the Commonwealth Parliament, that all such expenditure and the expenditure on new works and buildings should be provided for out of revenue, and not out of loan funds. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -It is a sounder policy than that of paying for such things with loan money. expenditure of the Post Office, shows an increase of £17,832 during the three years under review; but it must be remembered that, prior to the classification of the Public Service Commissioner just issued, the ordinary increments due in accordance with the South Australian law, have been paid to South Australian officers, and these payments account for a total expenditure of £11,167 in the three years 1901-2, 1902-3, and 1903-4. The minimum wage provision of the Commonwealth Public Service Act has involved an increase of £5>447-' Of course, the amount paid in salaries has been reduced a little by -deaths, dismissals, and so on; but there is no doubt that a large proportion of the increased expenditure is due to the operation of the South Australian Aet providing for : increments.

25,Mr Watson.,"In my view, it is. Theexpenditure .of the Postal Department is the transmission of a larger number of telegrams in South Australia, owing to the reductionof rates made by this Parliament. grams transmitted in South Australia has been increased by nearly 300,000. tional telegrams haye been sent, and, of course, their transmission has involved expense in the payment of extra ofBcers. The figures which I have given show conclusively that there is no justification for the charge of extravagance against the Federal Administration. The net result is that the transferred services in South Australia show a nominal increase of about £20,000 for the year 1903-4, as compared with that of the previous year; but £11,000 of that expenditure was due to the operation of the South Australian Act, providing for increases, for the passing of which rhe Commonwealth was not responsible, and £1.2,000 went to pay arrears on account of the Auxiliary Squadron. matters, charges now properly debited to the Federal Departments, but formerly debited to other departments, more than account for any difference. tration has been cheaper than the State administration was. ments in South Australia are administered on a more economical scale now than was the case under State control. POST AND TELEGRAPH MASTERS. General, ufon notice1. Are those post and telegraph masters who, in the State of New South Wales, have to perform the duties of registrars of births, deaths, and marriages, and electoral registrars, to perform such work without being remunerated for doing so ? 2. Did the Public Service Commissioner, when grading and fixing the salaries of post and telegraph masters in New South Wales who have to perform the duties referred to in question i , take those duties into consideration? 3. If not, will he, the Postmaster-General, see that arrangements are made for the payment of such postmasters for the extra work entailed upon them by having to perform such duties? 4. And will he see that remuneration is made to such postmasters for the four years they have been performing the above work without !re-muneration ? honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. Yes, when the work is performed during regular hours; overtime payments have been made for States electoral work performed after the usual hours. Postmasters who are Divisional Returning Officers receive £26 per annum. 2. Yes. 3. Answered by replies to 1 and 2. 4. Any claims that are made for remuneration for such work, necessarily performed outside regular hours, and prior to the operation of the Commonwealth Public Service Act, will be considered. . ADMINISTRATION. Trade and Customs, upon notice1. Was the Customs revenue for each of the two last financial years larger in New South Wales than in Victoria; if so, what were the figures for each State? 2. Why did the Public Service Commissioner classify the salaries of forty-nine Customs officers In regard to other in Victoria at £19,235-he , at the same time, classifying forty-seven officers doing similar work in New South Wales at £14,415? 3. How was it that under the circumstances the salaries of the forty-nine Victorian officers were increased £576, and the salaries of the forty-seven New South Wales officers increased only £360? 4. Why are a Chief Clerk and an Inspector of Accounts, at salaries of £750 and £650 respectively, required in Victoria, and not in New South Wales? 5. For what reason is the Excise Inspector in Victoria to receive £535, and the corresponding officer in New South Wales to receive only £360? 6. Are not the collections of Excise revenue about £250,000 greater in New South Wales than in Victoria. In addition, has not the officer in New South Wales to control the payment of £40,000 per year as bonus on white-grown sugar ? 7. Why are the Accountant, Cashier, Clerks in charge of Jerquery Statistics and Correspondence Rooms, and Revenue Detective Inspectors in New South Wales to be paid lower salaries than similar officers in Victoria? 8. Why is there such a marked difference between the salaries of the Clerks in the Long Room, Warehouse Accounts, and Statistical branches in New South Wales, and those of like officers in Victoria? 9. Why are thirteen Examiners in Victoria to receive a total of £5,120, and thirteen examiners in New South Wales to repeive only £4,290? Minister of Trade and Customs, I beg to leply as follows : 1.

The difference is accounted for owing to the dissimilar tariffs in the two States prior to Federation. omcers, as a rule, had more responsible positions, owing to the Protective tariff, and received higher salaries than in New South Wales, and in accordance with the principles upon which classification is made, no salary has been reduced. troduced in New South Wales, the staff had to be supplemented by a number of new hands at lesser fates of pay than those received by the Victorian officers who had longer periods of service to their credit. In time, however, the New South Wales officers will work up to the higher salaries, the. law providing that omcers must progress through the subdivisions of their classes; they could not be suddenly raised to the same rates as the Victorian officers who had worked through their subdivisions. 3. It is not known, what particular officers are referred to out of the large number in both services, but the difference probably arises from the fact that there were a large number of Victorian officers receiving salaries between subdivisions, and being meritorious were adjusted to a subdivision under the Act. 4. The Chief Clerk in Victoria occupies a position with relation to the Collector similar to that of the Chief Inspector in New South Wales. In each case the officer is next to the Collector, and acts in his absence. The difference is practically only a question of title. The officer in Victoria is shown at a salary of £750 because he was receiving such salary when the Department was transferred from the State. The Commissioner has, however, ruled down the salary in classification, and any future occupant of the position will be appointed at a minimum of £520, and cannot exceed £600 per annum. are really Audit Officers. Under the system in Victoria, the audit of the Customs transactions is performed by a special Customs staff. A. proposal is now being considered to transfer this staff to the Audit Office. The Inspector of Accounts also received his present salary prior to classification. 5. The Excise Inspector in Victoria receives £535 per annum because he was receiving such salary at the date of transfer. The classification of the positions by the Commissioner in New South Wales and Victoria is now, however, made the same, the maximum salary of which is £500 per annum. The maximum salary of each class will be attained by an officer through length of service and ability displayed in his position. For instance, if the officer in Victoria were to retire at once, he would be replaced by an officer promoted from a junior class, who would commence at the minimum, and if meritorious, would in course of time progress through the subdivisions of his class to the maximum value of the position. The officer, in New South Wales will follow the same course. The Inspector in Victoria has 38 years' service, and has had the f u l l responsibility of the Excise Branch for many years. The Inspector in New South Wales has thirteen years less service, and has not been very long in his present position. He has had, moreover, an addition of £60 made to his salary -the greatest given to any officer in the Department-unde r classification, with the prospect of further advancement. Mr Watson. 6. Yes. The excess of New South Wales for 1903-4 was £242,920. The amount of sugar Under the State iaw, Victorian bounty paid during 1903 was £40,154, but was controlled by the State Collector. 7. The differences in these positions may arise from a variety of causes. The position itself having been considered, and placed in a certain When the Commonwealth tariff was inclass, the officers themselves have to be dealt with, their length of service in the position, the Departmental reports on the ability they have displayed therein, the measure of responsibility taken by each officer, are' all factors to be taken into account, and though two officers may be occupying similar positions, they themselves may be dissimilar in any of the respects mentioned. For instance, the Revenue Detective Inspector in New South Wales has seventeen years service-the Victorian officer twenty-eight years. In the Statistical Branch the difference is merely that of a subdivision, w^hich will disappear as the effects of classification come into force. .The New South Wales officer had an increase of £35 011 his present salary-the Victorian officer £20. The Jerquer in Victoria has charge of a staff of Drawback officers, which increases the responsibility of his position. In New South Wales these officers constitute a separate branch. The differences in other positions are due to one or other of the causes previously mentioned. S. Work is done in the Long Room in Victoria which is not done in New South Wales. In Victoria five officers in this Branch with salaries of £450, £300, £200, £200, and £180 respectively, were in receipt of such salaries under the State, but in each of these cases the position has been marked down, and the salaries that will be obtained by future occupants of the positions will be much less in every case. The same applies to the Statistical Branch. The ComThe Inspector of Accounts and his staff missioner's classification of the positions is similar in each State, one Third Class, two Fourth Class, and the remainder F if t h Class officers. Four Victorian officers receiving salaries of £300, £300, £260, and £200 respectively, do' not get these t>y the Commissioner's classification, but received them Under the State. There is a marked difference also in the service of these officers. The average service in the Statistical Branch in Victoria is seventeen years, in New South Wales seven, hence the salaries of the former ""were higher. In the Warehouse Branch the positions of the Victorian officers have been marked down in a number of cases, amongst others, officers receiving salaries of £325, £325, £3°°i £3°°) obtained these amounts under the State, and not by classification. Tliere are a larger number also of F if t h Class officers in this Branch in New South Wales as compared with Victoria, and they will receive annual increments until they reach the maximum of their class. 9. It is assumed the thirteen Senior Examining officers in each State are referred to. In Victoria, the three highest salaries with five others were obtained under the State, and not by classification. The systems of the two States also vary. In New South Wales a separate Invoice Branch is in existence, which shares the responsibility borne in Victoria by the Landing officers alone. Going beyond these thirteen officers, and taking the whole of those engaged upon the work, the difference is in favour of New South Wales, the total number of officers in the Landing Branch (including Invoice Room and Laboratory), being sixty-eight, w it h total salaries of £ 1 5 , 5 0 0, while an almost exactly similar amount is divided in Victoriaf o r the same branch among seventy-four officers. master-General, upon noticeW h a t was The total amount of Post and Telegraph Money Order business fo and from Western Australia from and to each of the other States of the Commonwealth for the years 1901, 1902, and 1903? have been furnished by the Acting-Deputy Postmaster-General of Western Australia :Issuedi n WesternA u s t r a l i a . 1901.

It may be well to recall to the minds of honourable members' the steps which have been taken in this Parliament up to the present time to provide for the choosing of a site for the Federal Capital. It will be remembered that at the end of the first session of the First Parliament, the then Piime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, moved in this House the adoption of a series of resolutions, which were also introduced in the Senate, with a view to providing for a joint sitting of the two Houses, so that their members might vote together in the choice of the Capital site. The resolutions were The Minister of Defence stated in agreed to in this Chamber, but rejected in the Senate, so that the arrangement for which they provided, and which presented Subsesome distinct advantages, in being likely to secure an early settlement of the question, The Assistant could not be carried out. The next step taken in connection with the matter was the /' introduction by the honourable member for i Hume*pf a Bill very much on the lines of the measure now before us. In one of the clauses of that Bil l a blank was left, which was to be filled by the name of the site chosen, and that blank was filled in Committee of this House by the insertion of the word "" Tumut."" The Senate, however, when it received the Bill, struck out the word "" Tumut,"" and substituted for it the word "" Bombala."" Those proceedings occurred very late 'last session, and towards the close of the life of the last Parliament, so that no further action was taken in connection with the matter. I do not know thai' the delay which was caused has created any particular disadvantage. Indeed, I think that it has resulted in manifest advantage, though I clo not agree that that admission is necessarily an argument for further delay. The reason why I say that the delay which has occurred has not been an altogether unmixed evil is that previous to our consideration of the matter a large number of sites were ready for submission, and the effect of parliamentary action has been to reduce that number to two or three, so that public attention is now concentrated, not on some nine sites scattered all over New South Wales, but upon two or three only. These sites have been compared one with another, and criticisms have been",17,Register

Moreover, a great deal of additional information has been obtained in regard to them since last session closed. Most valuable reports upon the sites in the Southern Monaro district have been received from Mr Surveyor Scrivener, and equally valuable reports on the sites in the Tumut district from Mr Surveyor Chesterman; while I have to-day laid upon the table a report from the-latter gentleman in regard to the latest proposed site, that near the township of Tooma, on the TJpper Murray. This report has not yet been printed, but it w ill be printed and made available for honourable members at the earliest moment possible. Hume constituency which has not been reported upon? suitable sites in that district have not been reported upon. The constituency is one which does not suffer from a paucity of suitable sites, nor, as the Attorney-General reminds me, for want of a good man to represent it. These later reports are a distinct advantage, because they enter into 50 much more detail than did the earlier reports. By their aid we are able to come to a definite conclusion much more readily. We have had . most complete contour surveys of the two principal districts. We have also had the advantage of receiving reports prepared by the right honourable member for Swan, the ex-Minister of Home Affairs. Those documents are, in my opinion, distinctly valuable. Further, we have had a report from Colonel Owen, and Mr Pridham's report concerning the various ' sites. additional information, a great many more honourable members have seen the sites than had had an opportunity of visiting them when the Bill was discussed on a former occasion. I believe that honourable members all round are in consequence better equipped for coming to a wise decision than they were when the Bill was previously before the Chamber. I should not have troubled the House with any general remarks upon the question-confinin g myself directly to the Bill itself-ha d it not been that the honourable member for Corangamite has given notice of an amendment on the motion that the Bill be read a second time. His object is to bring about an amendment of the Constitution by altering what has always been considered to be a compact with the State of New South Wales. Eveni f that object were not attained the carrying of the amendment would cause considerable delay. Though the honourable member may be serious in moving his amendment, I do not think that he will receive very much support, either in this House or outside. My own view is that there are very many reasons why the question should be settled as early as possible. I do not argue that it is a matter of extreme urgency, but certainly there are very many reasons for a setlement without unnecessary delay. In the first place, the Crown lands around the suggested sites-a t all events around those which have been., regarded as having some chance of selectionhave been expressly reserved by the New South Wales Government from occupation. Those lands cannot be leased or sold. The consequence is that a considerable area of New South Wales territory is, for the. time being, without value. Failing an early settlement, we should withdraw the request made by the Federal Government to the New South Wales Government, and allow them to sell or lease these Crown lands. We have no right to dilly-dally with this matter, and at the same time keep New South Wales lands closed from settlement. Another reason, and a much stronger one to my mind, why we should bring the matter to a definite issue, is that the needs of the Commonwealth Departments for accommodation are growing. We require a habitation. We need to have some place where we can build the necessary offices for the administration of the affairs of the Commonwealth. In addition to this comfortable than we are now. member for Wilmot is one of those who believe in a man having a bit of land that he can call his own. I admit that we are most comfortable in our Melbourne quarters, and I appreciate to the very fullest the generosity of the Victorian treatment of the Federal Parliament in the matter of accommodation. The hospitality of Victoria has certainly been more generous than I expected. We ought to remember that we owe an eternal debt of gratitude to this State. Our work would have been exceedingly difficult if we had not had such arrangements made for us. But we cannot indefinitely trespass on the hospitality of Victoria. This magnificent pile of buildings cannot be occupied by us for all time.",18,Second Reading

I believe that these Parliament Buildings cost about £800,000, and I do not know that Victoria is prepared to allow us to have the perpetual use of property of that value rent free. At any rate. I am quite sure that we have no right to ask for any such thing. We have no right to continue in indefinite occupation of these premises without paying rent for them. if we go to Bombala. discuss the relative merits of the suggested sites. There will be many opportunities for doing so later on. I fully acknowledge that we have been splendidly treated by Victoria. But, at the same time, there are some inconveniences attached to the present anangement. We have no opportunity of providing for the increased accommodation which is becoming necessary owing to the growing demands of the Federal Public Service. Our Departments will continue to grow, however much some sworn economists may deplore the fact. It istheir nature to grow. Administration branches out into other fields, as we commence to do all the work which we are empowered to do under the Constitution, and possibly secure extended powers, the necessity for increased accommodation will become more and more urgent. During the past few months considerable difficulty has been found in providing the absolutely necessary accommodation for Commonwealth administrative purposes. Having to lease private. buildings which were not erected for the purposes of public'offices, but for much smaller operations, we are not able to concentrate the Departments sufficiently. The lack of concentration means that the supervision cannot be so good as it otherwise would be. We also labour under the disadvantage of being able to offer only short terms for leasing the premises that are available. that we are paying more than we otherwise should pay. siderations which I urge upon honourable members to show the absolute necessity of the Commonwealth having some habitation -som e place where we can build the necessary accommodation-as early as possible. provide should not be larger than is I do not think Vicrequired, and it should be so planned that the Commonwealth can remain in permaI question very nent occupation. Another reason which I urge as being important, though I do not think that it is of the greatest importance, is the anxiety, not to say restiveness, exhibited in New South Wales amongst politicians and the press with regard to the settlement of this question vond the politicians and the press. that that is the case, but it is expressed through politicians and the press. I have not any doubt that there are in New South Wales a very large number of people who I do not wish to entertain the same feeling. Indeed. I think that the people of that State generally have good grounds for asking that the Federal Capital question shall be settled. But the fear that has been expressed that there is any sort of combination or any general desire on the part of any of the States to do New South Wales out of the Capital, or to baulk her in the carrying out of the agreement that was entered into, is entirely groundless. There is no such desire anywhere or amongst any section of the people. So far as I can gather the facts, the objections that have been raised As the Commonwealth to proceeding with the* selection, of the Federal Capital at once, arise from the fear that the undertaking will be costly, and from the feeling that some cheaper method might be adopted than the one that has been proposed. A good many people think that it would be better to locate the Capital in one of the principal citieseither Melbourne or Sydney. However, the people of New South Wales may fairly ask that the question shall not be postponed, but that it shall be settled at the earliest possible moment; and the allaying of any possible source of friction which might arise if the present delay were continued, is a good reason for coming to a definite conclusion. Mr Waddell, the Premier of New South Wales, recently made a request that the selection, of the site should be postponed until the new Parliament was That means elected in that State. His idea was that the New South Wales Parliament should These are some of the conselect a site, and, I presume, offer it to the Commonwealth Government.

It rests upon the only body which is representative of the whole of .the States of the Commonwealth. only body which can properly carry out this dutyWe must recollect that this is entirely a Commonwealth proposal. It is not a question affecting only the interests of New South Wales. It is not a question primarily for New South Wales, except in so far as that State has to grant the land. It is a matter in which every State of the Commonwealth is just as much concerned as is the State of New South Wales. This Parliament being the only Parliament which is representative of all the States of the Commonwealth, it is the only body that is properly qualified to select the site. Besides, there is the fact that we are directly charged by the Constitution with the duty of selecting the Capital site. lancl, it remains with the New South Wales Parliament to say whether or not it shall be given. that point later on. I do not for one moment anticipate that if this Parliament selects a site, the New South Wales Parliament will raise the question of our right to do so, or of their right to have a voice in the matter. My own opinion is that New South Wales will cheerfully acquiesce in the -decision of this Parliament. There is another objection to the proposal of the honourable member for Corangamite; and it indicates the chief reason for having the matter settled at tbe earliest possible moment. The honourable member's amendment -suggeststhat with a view to securing greater ^freedom of choice in tlie future, steps should be taken to alter the Constitution by striking"" out the words "" and be distant not less than 100 miles from Sydney,"" in the 125th section of the Constitution, and to add the words "" or Sydney"" after "" Melbourne "" in the same section. I understand from that amendment that the honourable member's desire is to enable the Parliament of the Commonwealth to meet in either Melbourne or Sydney. ticularly. member's desire is that the 100-miles limit shall be removed, so that, if desired, the Seat of the Federal Government shall be in iSydney. expensive than to create a capital? be a great deal more expensive; but I shall deal with that matter presently. In my opinion the effect of the estabThis Parliament is the lishment of the Seat of Government in Sydney or in any other of the States capitals would be to thwart the whole object for which a Federal Capital is created. The Seat of Government is, in my opinion, specially intended to be altogether free from any State or local influences. We must not forget that this is a Federation of States, and that, in some respects, each State has interests separate from the interests of the other States. There are State interests which frequently conflict; there are antagonistic circumstances which cause a good deal of friction. The Commonwealth Parliament is charged with the duty of giving the fullest and freest consideration to all those conflicting interests when they arise in connection with we do choose the any legislation which may be before us. It is a great deal better, therefore, when we are considering such questions, that the Commonwealth Parliament should be away from any existing capital, because there we find focussed, as it weie, whatever special State interests there may be.

New South Wales free-traders who, on coming across the border into Victoria, became pronounced protectionists; and this only shows the influence of environment.

I do so for this reason, that as the expense of going further in the erection of the capital increases, as if may largely increase, there wil l be a progressive settlement which will tend to swell the revenue derivable from the land within the Federal area, and thus provide a fund not only for meeting interest, but also for the extinction of debt. This was put, not as a wild socialistic experiment in land legislation, but purely as a business proposal. I regard this matter as quite different from the ordinary proposal in regard to land nationalization. The right honourable gentleman proceeded in a similar strain for half a column. He said :If I had had to consider the question of the disposal of land at a time when scarcely any part of Australia had been alienated, I might have been inclined to look with favour upon a general system of leasing, but I am afraid that in our ordinary methods and transactions we have gone beyond the point at which that appears to be a business possibility. That consideration, however, does not apply to a limited area such as that within which it is proposed to place the Commonwealth Capital, and which is to constitute a small territory governed by the Commonwealth. The considerations that apply in this case are entirely different. Sir tion any number of acres, did he ? number of acres to do with the question?

If a radius of seventeen miles from Tooma had been taken, some of the Victorian country would have been included, and therefore the radius has been drawn from Tumberumba, and just touches the Murray.

The population of the Tumut site, which includes part of Gundagai, is 10,356, and the unimproved value of the land £ 4 9 7 , 0 0 0 ; but, reckoning in improvements, the total value is estimated at £948,100. within the Tumut site, and most of the population in the district is in and around the township of Tumut itself, so that the value of the improvements in that part of the district is very great.

In conclusion, I wish to express the hope that, in choosing the site of the Federal Capital, no personal, party, or parochial considerations will have influence. The question is absolutely a non-party one, and the site, when chosen, will stand, either as a monument to the sagacity of the members of this Parliament, or as a permanent proof of our incapacity. We may fairly hope, therefore, to obtain such a choice as will reflect credit upon us. to the House that, as the Minister of Home Affairs has not in any way referred to the comparative merits of the respective sites, and as I have understood from his speech I suggest to the that a later opportunity will be given for such a discussion, I propose, with the concurrence of honourable members, to rule against their discussion now That all the words after "" T h a t "" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof, the following words :"" in the opinion of this House it is inexpedient that a selection of the site for the Federal Capital be proceeded with at the I merely desire to present time, and' that with a view to securing greater freedom of choice in the future, steps should be taken to alter the Constitution by striking out the words and be distant not less 1 than one hundred miles from Sydney' in the 125th section of the Constitution, and to add the words ' or Sydney' after ' Melbourne' in the same section."" the honourable The Minister of Home Affairs attacked my amendment before I had an opportunity to move it, but I recognise that he had a perfect right to say what he has said, and I am indebted to him for one or two admissions which, it seems to me, should I think that it is a strengthen my arguments in its favour. He told the House' that the delay -which has taken place in connection with the choosing of a site has not been altogether disadvantageous, and, in point of fact, has produced man vi advantages. I may fairly contend, therefore, considering the great importance of the question to Australia, that further delay will be advantageous. We have heard a great deal of the compact in the Constitution in regard to this matter. I take it that the spirit of that compact is that the Federal Capital shall be placed in New South Wales, and my amendment recognises that compact. It provides, not only that the Federal Capital shall be situated in New South Wales, but that after three years, and I think it should as soon as the necessary arrangements can bi made, the provisional capital shall be removed from Melbourne to Sydney.

I feel that I need offer no apology for submitting this amendment.

I should like to draw attention to various items which will go to make up the proposed enormous expenditure. In the first place, there must be connecting railways constructed on almost every site mentioned; and that is a very serious matter. Then there must be buildings, dams, pumping stations, and so forth, for water and electric supply; and, in addition, the making of roads, the laying out of parks, and so forth.

I think I am quite safe in saying most of the honourable members here will have ceased to take any interest in the question. The creation of a Capital is by no means an urgent matter, and my amendment will leave the final decision to the Australians of a future generation. We have heard a great deal from time to time to the effect that the improvement in the value of the land selected will repay the cost of creating the Capital; that the granting of leases and periodical revaluation will result in sufficient revenue to meet all expenditure. We have heard similar arguments used many times in Australia; and I think that they were not unknown during the time of the Melbourne land boom, the after effects of which we all remember. warning to the honourable member in the matter of the Federal area. we must not lay stress on the hope that there will be any considerable increase in the value of the land.

In the districts surrounding a "" bush capital,"" there will be places where melancholic lunatics could live and thrive. hope, in all seriousness, that honourable I members will consider this amendment on its merits, and not prejudge it in any way. I ask honourable members to regard the amendment apart from any promises they may have made, or any conversations they may have had, in relation to any of the COOK -The honourable proposed sites, and to look at it from the point of view of economy and common-sense. If honourable members do so, I am satisfied that I shall have far more support than the Minister has indicated. ing the amendment, I feel that the honourable member for Corangamite has correctly stated the reasonable view of the Federal compact, a view which, I think, ought to be accepted by most honourable members. The situation of the Capital was undoubtedly a consideration which largely influenced a portion of the electors of New South Wales in assenting to Federation. I take it that had the Federal Parliament been given the right to choose a site in any. portion of New South Wales, the majority for Federation in the State would have been larger-that the effect of limiting the choice, judging by a careful examination of the newspapers of the State at the time, had a prejudicial effect on the number of those who voted for Federation. The object of the amendment, as I understand it, is not to break faith with the people of New South Wales, but to give them and this Parliament a wider area of choice-to give New South Wales a greater privilege than that State now possesses under the Constitutiona larger concession. It is not out of place to offer some reasons why I believe it is in the interests of the whole Commonwealth that that larger concession should be given. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo interjected, It is a warning that when the honourable member for Corangamite was speaking, that the amendment was a giving away of Victorian rights. I cannot appreciate the force of that view, because I think the advantages of"" a Federal Capital are very slight. When Federation was established, I was one who thought that deadly it was an excellent stroke of business to have the temporary seat of Government fixed in Melbourne; but after three years' experience, I am convinced that there is not such advantage attaching to the compact as I then imagined.

The various estimates which have been submitted, seem to me to have been put forward on the most swelledhead principles. Every scheme has been discussed as if the minimum population of the Federal Capital at its very initiation would be about 25,000, and upon the supposition that in a few years it would run -up to 300,000 or 400,000. If we turn to the great Republic of the United States; what do we find in the city of Washington ? Admitting' that it is the richest country in the world, and that its population has been increasing by leaps and bounds, and that it now numbers over 80,000,000-notwith standing these enormous advances it has taken over 100 years for the population of Washington to reach 250.000. Yet we have put before us in solemn earnestness estimates of how much it will cost to establish a Federal city for a population of 250,000.

I cannot see that any new industry will be built up. I cannot see that the wealth of the country will be added to one iota by the expenditure of millions of money in this way. Therefore, the more of that money we can_ save the better it will be. The sole reason why I support the amendment is to save not only Victoria, but every other State in the Commonwealth from having its revenue depleted by such an unnecessary expenditure.

By doing so we should save a large expenditure of money and all the taxpayers of Victoria would be benefited. I have not yet heard, either through the press or any other source, of any disadvantage which would ensue to Victoria from the temporary Seat of Government being removed to New South Wales. to me that a proposition which will save the expenditure of millions of money, and enable the first years of the Commonwealth Parliament to be marked by a due regard for economy, and by as much concern as possible for the convenience of the various States, ought to commend itself to honourable members as an advantageous one. But, apart from those grounds, I feel that the proposition to establish the Federal Parliament in some out-of-the-way township is, from the stand-point of the purity of politics, one of the most dangerous propositions which have ever been suggested. able members, who have studied Mr opportunities for corrupt influences to Bryce's monumental work, The American Commonwealth, know that he lays it down clearly that one of the great causes of corruption in American politics has been the fact that the Legislatures of the States, It means that the burden and the Congress of the Republic, have met in back-block townships., and that the great organs of the press have not been . able to fully present their doings to the people of the States, or to the people of the Republic. .

As the Federal Parliament meets in a big city, the powerful organs of the press are able to expose daily to the public gaze the doings of honourable members. I know that sometimes the It seems criticisms of the press hurt us.

That has been the universal experience of the States of the great Republic. Honourable members know that in the United StatesI believe without exception-the State Legislature meets not at the real capital of tihe State, but at a smaller township, and, as Mr Bryce points out, upon evidence whicli cannot be gainsaid, it has been found that the meeting of the States Legislatures in those small townships, far away from the influence of the press and the pressure of public opinion, has resulted in jobbery and corruption of aU kinds. The lobbyist-the man who seeks special privileges at the expense of the whole community, the man who has an axe to grind, and is prepared to grease the palms of honourable members in order to fill his own pockets-ha s a far better chance to attain his end if he can do his work where there will be no publicity afforded to his doings.

It does not matter to me in what city Parliament meets so long as there is a powerful press ready to report and expose what is being done in the legislative halls. I advocate that the Parliament should meet in Sydney, because I believe that New South Wales has a moral claim upon us, apart from any provision in the Constitution.

In the reports presented to us, I find that in some cases the expenditure of millions .is contemplated. I do not wish to discuss the merits of the respective sites, but I propose to mention them in order to indicate to honourable members the expenditure in which we shall be involved if any of them are chosen, as compared with the small outlay that will be incurred if we simply rent a few suitable buildings in Sydney. In connection with the Bombala site, for instance, it is gravely proposed that a railSydney, then by all means let us way should be constructed from Bairnsdale to the Victorian border, and thence to Bombala and Cooma. wealth Government? is to construct the lines, but some one would have to build them.

The lines proposed to be constructed in New South Wales would also entail a considerable outlay on the part of the State Government. That proposal appears to me to be unthinkable, and no State or States would be justified in incurring such an expenditure as would be involved. way from Cooma to Bombala has already been authorized. induce members of Parliament to vote in favour of the construction of railways.

T believe that the closer to a laige city we can establish the Seat of Government, and 6B the more direct the influence exerted by public opinion and apowerful press upon Parliament, the better it will be for the whole Commonwealth. I do not take the slightest notice of considerations of centrality, water power, climate, and other matters to which so much importance has been attached in the reports which have been placed before us at such great cost. The chief question is: How can the public be best kept acquainted with the doings of Parliament; how can they best keep their eye on Parliament? If that can be best done by the Parliament meeting in meet there, or at the best available place near that city. The proposal involves no sacrifice of Victorian rights. I am not the Commonaware of any doctrine of Victorian rights upon this question. I do not know that the meeting of the Federal Parliament in Melbourne has been attended with very much advantage to the people of that city. As I have said, the only benefit has been derived by a few hotel keepers. In the next place, if the proposal be agreed to, the finances of the States will not be dislocated by expenditure upon buildings and other projects in connection with the establishment of the Federal Capital. We shall insure economy, and, at the same time, safeguard the rights of the people in New South Wales Finally, the doings of the Federal Parliament will be more fully reported than if it were to meet in a small city in the back blocks, and the wide dissemination of knowledge as to Parliamentary doings will' afford the best safeguard against corrupt influences undermining the morality of the Legislature. ney) I cannot agree with many of theOne honourable memsentiments expressed by the honourable and more inclined to support the view of the I do not Minister that the Constitution, especially in a matter between one State and the other States, should be carried out to the strict letter.

I am only answering the argument used by the honourable and learned member for WannonI wish it to be understood that, in the remarks which I am about to make-and I shall have occasion to refer to some statements which have appeared in the pressI do not wish to imply that either the people of Victoria, or the members of this Parliaiment, desire to commit any breach of the bond entered into with New South Wales. I know that a section of the people of Victoria, which is represented by a portion of the press, may entertain such an idea, but I believe that neither the people of that State as a whole, nor the people of the other States, contemplate such an injustice. I desire to point to the reasons which the people of New South Wales have for believing that something of fhe kind is intended by some Victorians. The following statement appeared in the Age when this matter was previously before Parliament:A divergence of opinion between the two Houses will secure a further opportunity for inquiry, and above all for delay. impossible at this late period of the parliamentary session to adjust any disagreement between the two Houses, and this will insure just what ought to happen-that the selection of a Federal Capital shall be left to a future Parliament, one which will take a higher view of its duty in the matter than that which operates with the present New South Wales Opposition. The article was written during the life of the last Parliament, and we are now in another Parliament. It continues: In time, when we have broken down the unreasoning jealousy of the mother State, and when the Commonwealth is financially iu a position to turn its thoughts to the establishment of a capital city, we may repeal the fettering conditions of the 125th section, and leave Parliament absolutely free, as it ought to be, to take the very best site available, wherever it may be found. amendment means. believe that the honourable member who has moved the amendment means anything of the kind, but his amendment would probably have that effect if it were carried. Here we have a great press organ advocating absolute repudiation of the agreement with New South Wales. The same newspaper, in its issue of to-day, publishes the following statement:There is a belief amongst members that New South Wales would not be averse to boxing up honourable the Federal Capital area in a territorial trap, and cutting it off from free means of ingress and egress. For this reason there is a strong desire to have either the Murray River or Twofold' Bay as the boundary of the Federal area. A territorial limit of 900 square miles in the centre of New South Wales would be the same as if a man were to give his friend one acre out of a 340 acre paddock, and were to fix it in the centre without any means of access. There is an insinuation that ordinary consideration and fair play will not be given by the State of New South Wales to the Federal Government, if the capital is situ.ated within its territory 'in such a place that it cannot be approached without entering the State of New South Wales. It is extraordinary that the Age, which is quite satisfied that we should be boxed up in a territorial trap in Victoria-as we are at present, according to its own line pf argument-for any length of time, should tell us that we must' not trust ourselves to the tender mercies of New South Wales. The case put by the Age is similar to that of a State Government objecting to erect its Parliament Houses within a municipality because of a fear _ that the municipality might bar ingress' or' egTess just' as It will be if they could not trust the people whom they were to govern. The Age cannot recognise that we are not separate peoples, but are all people' of the one Commonwealth, and that it is the Government of that people, which is seeking a site for its own buildings, for its own Departments, and a home for its own officials. Surely, arguments of that sort indicate that, at any rate, there are some who would make a breach of the condition in the Constitution, and who, though ready to trust their own State to deal fairly towards the Commonwealth, are not ready to trust any other State to deal with equal fairness. There is a further statement in the newspaper to which I refer, advocating ffie resumption of a larger area of land than that",37,Second Reading

This might amount to some millions more, and the interest on that purchase money must be met before anything can be said about the proiits of unearned increment. The writer objects to the cost of the land, and gives that as one reason for not establishing the Federal Capital at the present time, while immediately afterwards he says that a much larger area than that provided for in the Constitution should be taken.

I have also noticed that, in certain quarters, attempts have been made to have the Federal Capital located as far away from Sydney as possible; to place it on the borders of New South Wales, and, if possible, nearer to some other capital than to the capital of that State. I think that such action is reasonably regarded by the people of New South Wales as unfair, and in support of that belief, I will quote some of the statements which were made when the matter was being discussed in New South Wales prior to the acceptance of the draft Constitution by the people of that State. This is a statement as to the resolution which was passed by the Conference of Premiers in 1899It is considered that the fixing of the site of the capital is. a question which might well be lef t to the Parliament to decide; but in view of the strong expression of opinion in relation to this matter in New South Wales, the Premiers have modified the clause so that, while the capital cannot be fixed at Sydney or in its neighbourhood, provision is made in .the Constitution for its establishment in New South Wales at a reasonable distance from that city. 6 B 2 x Victoria insisted upon two conditions : that it should not be within 100 miles of Sydney, and that Parliament should sit in Melbourne until it met at the seat of Government. There is no doubt that an effort is now being made to do something which is quite opposed to the understanding then arrived at. The effort to whicli I refer has for its object the location of the Capital, not "" at a reasonable distance from Sydney,"" but at a place as far away from Sydney as is possible. It is being made oneof the conditions of eligibility of a site that it shall be as disI hold that, the provision in the tant from the capital of New South Wales as it can be. When this question was raised in New South Wales by those who There is no doubt, opposed the acceptance of the draft Constitution by the people of that State, certain prominent men in Victoria replied to the objections of the leaders of the movement against the Bill. In the first place, let me The other States, quote what was published on the subject in the ArgusThe broad fact is that no English community is ever guilty of deliberate treachery and deceit, and that in this instance the people of Victoria will be as the people in any of the Colonies would be, faithfu l in word and spirit to their bond. They will nol be allowed to break their compact, and they would not seek to do so if allowed. I have already shown the spirit in which the Premiers framed the provision in the Constitution after passing a resolution which requires, first, that the Capital shall not be situated within 100 miles, of Sydney, and, secondly, that it shall be within a reasonable distance of Sydney. Then we have the statement of the right honourable member .for Balaclava, who, on behalf of Victoria, made the compact with New South Wales. He saidI am perfectly certain that the representatives of Victoria won't attempt in any way to prevent the Federal Parliament fixing the site in New South Wales, and getting the necessary buildings erected at ah early stage in the Federation. No doubt the question will be submitted to Parliament during its first session and decided, providing that New South Wales is ready with the necessary area of land and several alternative sites. I am sure none of the Colonies will do anything unfair. We in this Colony have made a compact with New South Wales, and we are not going back on it. That statement was quoted from one end of New South Wales to the other by those in favour of the Bill, as evidence of the intentention of the people of Victoria to act",38,Second Reading

It has never been considered that such is the case, and consequently that attitude has never been taken up by the representatives of New South Wales. graph is always taking up tbe position that Victoria is trying to obstruct the selection of the Capital. view is justified by the attitude of a section of the press in Victoria. honourable and learned member for Corio heard what I read from the Age. That extract justifies the feeling that there is in Victoria a movement under strong auspices for breaking the Constitution, and for dishonouring the bond that was entered into. the people of Victoria is that extravagance should not be indulged in, and that there should not be any great buildings constructed in the Capital. agree with the people of Victoria in that respect. I think that we ought to manage thefinancesin connection with this business with the greatest care. We ought to incur the least possible expenditure. expenditure of millions, it naturally frightens people. smallest amount that can possibly meet the case should be expended. The New South Wales people have done their share. They have had to pay extra taxation in consequence of their entering into the Federal compact. They have had to find extra money month by month, and year by year, since the imposition of the Federal Tariff. The establishment of the Federal Capital in one of the existing large cities would not reduce proposed expenditure, but would increase it considerably. A thousand feet of land in a city like Sydney would possibly cost £.500,000; and of course 1,000 feet would be nothing like sufficient to meet requirements. far more than the land. buildings for Federal purposes, in a city like Sydney, would have to be of a character in keeping with the leading buildings already erected in the city. would not cost so much as railway communication with some of the sites. tion of railway communication is one of the elements which will have to be considered in the selection of the Capital. I do not intend to discuss the sites themselves at this stage; but, evidently, one of the first and most important considerations is centrality. The Capital should be in a portion of the country where settlement is gravitating, and where there will be a tendency for population to gravitate in the No doubt the future. It should not only be on a railway line, but, if possible, ""on a line which connects, or will connect, the different States, and be used as a main line. Water supply is, of course, an important factor, but I do not feel so strongly as do some honourable members upon the importance of natural features. It must be recollected that the ioo-mile limit has disqualified some of the most beautiful, spots in New South Wales. If we go west, over the mountains, we are forced on to the plain areas. Of course we could go south, along the coast of New South Wales; but Commissioners, and to some extent also members of this House, have objected, for climatic reasons, to selecting a site near the coast, although, strange to say, some of those same members have suggested that Sydney, which is actually upon the coast, should be the site of the Capital. The coastal climate of New South Wales, for about eight months in the year, is perhaps as fine a climate as there is in Australia. I admit that for the remaining four months there is a humid heat which, some people object to. But when we are forced to choose a place 100 miles from Sydney, and we object to the climate of the southern coastlands, we are forced on to the plain country, where there is not the same amount of beautiful scenery as we find in the coastal regions. We must, however, remember that Australia is a newcountry, and that the beauties which we admire in other lands are not always-in deed, are not often-du e to purely natural features. Many of the most famous beauty spots have been the creation of centuries; and many parts of New South Wales, which look very unpicturesque at the present time, will, in the course of a generation or two, become very different in character, and will possess some of those scenic beauties which are to be met with in older lands.

But the natural features of that country that the ground are not grand, are not I think I am correct in saying that there is not a mountain in the British Isles over 5,000 feet in height. There are very few mountains approaching that altitude. There are no great natural features in the shape of large rivers, such as there are in the United States. growth of trees and hedges, the construction of buildings, and improvements made by one generation here, and by another generation there, have created many of those beauty spots in England which most attract the visitor to that country. in Australia can, by the same means, turn many situations which are now not at all picturesque into sites which years hence will display many of the beauties which have proved an attraction in older countries. Therefore, scenic beauties, and the presence of grand natural features, have not so much influence upon my mind as they seem to have upon the minds of many honourable members. have to remember that we are a Federal Parliament, and that our public departments are created for business purposesto perform important services for the community. where that business can be most effectively performed in New South Wales. not wish to delay the House by further discussion upon this point. sired to answer, in the first place, some of the statements which have appeared in a portion of the press, and also to point out the true position, which I do not think is altogether apprehended by those who are supporting the amendment. Undoubtedly it would be an advantage to New South Wales to place the capital of the Commonwealth in Sydney. fect would be to bring the Federal Capital under the influence of the intense local atmosphere of the main city of that State. It would enable the New South Wales members to attend with greater facility than they can when Parliament meets at a greater distance. Many men, whose services cannot be obtained at the present time, would be enabled to enter the Federal Parliament. Consequently,^ the influence of New South Wales in the. counsels of the nation would be increased. But I can quite Mr Dugald Thomson. see that on the ground of fairness, the other States may object to that. they will. object, as a New South Welshman, but I imposing, speaking generally. try to look at this question from the aspect of the other States, as well as from the aspect of New South Wales. I can quits see that the other States would have objections-reasonabl e objections-to New South Wales acquiring such influence permanently. Therefore, even in the interests of New But cultivation, the South Wales, I am not prepared to support an alteration of the Constitution, such as that suggested.

But at this stage we have to consider whether the time is ripe for the people of Australia to launch into an expenditure of a very large sum of money on the erection of a Federal Capital. It is quite idle to talk of creating a Fedeial Capital in the bush at practically no expense. Are we to have a Parliament House of galvanized iron? Are honourable members to emulate the very laudable desire of the honourable member for Darwin, and live in tents?

I was exceedingly glad to hear the Minister of Home Affairs say that there is to be. no borrowing in connection with the Federal Capital. Such an undertaking will, I hope, have the unanimous approval of this House. I am sure it will receive the general approval of the electors of the Commonwealth.

It is a matter of time; we are not creating the Capital for a generation only. ter must .admit that, during the life of the present generation, the expenditure on the Federal Capital will be a handicap on the taxpayers of the different States. thing of the kind. some extraordinary system of finance, which, at present, has not been expounded, every penny spent on the Federal Capital will, in the absence of any return, have to be taken out of the taxpayers' pockets. have to be made up in any case. We cannot live on air, even if we do not establish a Capital. MrM c WILLIAMS If we could put aside the beautiful visions in which some honourable members have indulged ; if we would only come down to hard fact, and say, "" L e t us erect our parliamentary and public buildings in a civilized community within direct reach of the people,"" then the expenditure would be a comparatively small one, and one which I believe the taxpayers of Australia are prepared to undertake. land, resumption in the place which the honourable member indicates? MrM c WILLIAMS for a suitable locality in the vicinity of a large town, we took a quarter of the care which has been taken in exploring the wilds of-Australia,'planning gigantic waterworks, and estimating the cost of railways, we should secure a site with everything requisite, and well within the limit of our financial position. The erection of a Federal Capital is not a new undertaking. it is not to other countries. I would ask honourable members, before giving a vote, to carry their minds back to what has occurred in Washington and Ottawa, and to what is occurring there to-day. Washington is supposed to be one of the most beautiful cities in i*he known world. But at what cost has it been created? For probably sixty years it remained dormant as a federal capitala disgrace to the United States. which has been erected within a generation ? MrM c WILLIAMS I s the honourable gentleman prepared to propose an expenditure as large as that which has been incurred at Ottawa. Is he prepared to come down with a proposal to expend over £2,0005000 on the erection of public buildings in the Federal Capital? that expenditure spread over ? MrM c WILLIAMS The chief expenditure was incurred on public buildings, and, speaking from memory, it was spread over not more than twenty years. Ottawa was a little village known as Bytown before it was selected for the Seat of Government. It could not be selected as the site of the Dominion Capital until after the North American Colonies had federated in 1867. But in ihat brief time, to make up a population of slightly over 50,000 I quite admit that. MrM c WILLIAMS I think I am fairly accurate when I say that the population of Ottawa is about 50,000. Leti t be remembered that it is the capital city of a Dominion with a population of 6,000,000, and that Australia is not in nearly so flourishing a condition as is Canada. Here the growth of population has practically ceased; in fact, in some States-Victoria, to wit-ther e is practically no natural increase. Our trade is not nearly so largeas that of Canadai f we consider the goods that pass over the border line into the United States. Probably the If , in the search exports from Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide are greater than the exports from Montreal; but in the United States, Canada has a neighbour with a population of 80,000,000, and there is an enormous interchange between the two countries.

MrM c WILLIAMS had employment to offer. comparison between the position of Canada to-day and that of Australia. nately for us, the Australian Colonies federated with an indebtedness of about £250,000,000, while the North American provinces federated practically free from indebtedness. The State debt of Canada to-day is a trifle, but the State debt of Auswill again have to grin and bear it. But tralia is, per head of the population, by far the heaviest in the world. And now, before Federation has got well on its feet, it is deliberately proposed to incur an expenditure which must press very heavily, and particularly, upon some of the smaller States. Unquestionably, we have to look at these matters from different stand-points. It is very unfortunate, indeed, that in this Commonwealth one has to consider more particularly the interests of his own State. In the interests of the Federation, perhaps, we should all take a broad view, and consider the different States alike; but it is only natural, and I think only proper, that an honourable member should express the opinion of the State with whose circumstances he is more directly intimate. I am reminded of the old eastern proverb about the different bowls-the glass bowl and the copper bowl-driftin g down the stream. In a federation, the smaller States represent the glass bowl, because in all matters the smaller States suffer most, financially, for the reason that all their payments are on a smaller scale, and they have not resources to f a l l back upon, such as have the larger and richer States. The new expenditure on Federation is pressing heavily on some of the smaller States. are in direct communication with the local Governments, know that the States are compelled to impose on their people direct taxation of a very serious nature, in order to make good to them the cost of Federation.

MrM c WILLIAMS that the attractions of Sydney would be greatly added to by the establishment of the Seat of Government there. The fact that the Federal Parliament has met in Melbourne for the past four years has not had any appreciable influence upon the financial or commercial conditions of that city, and I do not suppose that the results would be any more marked if Sydney were chosen as the Seat of Government.

I cannot conceive how the honourable member can reconcile the two statements. It is provided in the Constitution that the Federal Capital shall be situated within New South Wales territory, not less than ioo miles from Sydney, and that the Federal area shall em-. brace at least ioo square miles. Those are the terms of the bond which the honourable member says hei is anxious to observe, andsyet stitutions which we could not very well do he proposes to vote for an amendmsnt which entirely ignores the agreement entered into. The people of New. South Wales are just as anxious as are those of the other States to observe the compact which is embodied in the Constitution. Some public men in New South Wales have, for party political purposes, talked very loudly about breaking away from the Federation, unless their views are, considered in connection with the selection of the Capital site; but we need not pay very serious attention to such statewould remind the honourable and learned ments. The honourable member for Corangamite proposes that the Constitution shall be altered by eliminating the provision with regard to the ioo-mile limit, and he also contemplates that until the Capital site is selected, the Pederal Parliament shall meet in either Sydney or Melbourne. He does not, however, propose to interfere with the provision in the Constitution, to the effect that the Federal territory shall embrace at least ioo I do not think square miles. The honourable member poses as an advocate, of economy, and yet he would practically commit us to the selection of a Federal Capital site, embracing ioo square miles, at or near Sydney. Does the honourable member realize that the purchase of ioo square miles near Sydney would involve a ruinous outlay? The honourable and learned member for Wannon has expressed an absolute disregard for all such considerations as water supply, and salubrity of climate. His sole concern is that the Federal Parliament shall be dominated by the press. He expects the daily newsI shall, therefore, vote for the papers to give to the public a complete account of everything we do, and to keep a vigilant eye upon the doings of honourable members, in order that the public may be safe-guarded against our engaging in swindles such as have occurred in other parts of the world. Honourable, members surely will not claim that the press fairly represents the doings of the members of this or any other Parliament. We should, at least, be satisfied that the reports of our proceedings published by the press will be fair and accurate before allowing any consideration for the newspapers to weigh with us. I recognise the need of a powerful press to inform the public as to the proceedings of Parliament, and in some degree to act as the people's watchdog. Although we are sometimes severely criticised in the newspapers, .the press is one of our modern inwithout. It is, however, not correct to say that the public are well and correctly informed as to the doings of Parliament by any one particular newspaper. All newspapers boom the political party whose doctrines they favour, leaving it to the newspapers holding opposite views to boom the opposing party.

For more than five years past the Crown lands in the vicinity of the sites reported upon by Mr in directions which have not yet been Oliver as suitable for the location of the Federal Capital have been reserved from alienation. Corangamite proposes that the Government of New South Wales shall continue to keep this land put of use for another three years at least, leaving the people of that State in a simmer of expectation and uncertainty for probably another ten or twelve years.

No doubt that is so; but no desire for alteration has been expressed. If we are to take the statements in the Victrusted, as a governing body, to consider torian newspapers as an expression of public opinion in opposition to the selection of a site for the Federal Capital, that opinion is based on the most miserable provincial giounds. The Age, especially, deals with the question in the most narrow spirit. The articles published in that newspaper speak of the probable expenditure upon ' the Federal Capital as likely to amount to millions of pounds, although the writers of them know that it would be nothing like so large. Of course, when the people are told that the building of the Federal city will be so costly , as to necessitate the piling up of taxation upon them, they aie ready to that we . should be say, ""We do not want a Federal Capital."" The honourable member for Franklin has pleaded the cause of the smaller States, whose people, he says, are now overloaded with taxation; but, as a matter of fact, the average taxation of the people of the ComI do not say whether it was or monwealth is not higher now than it was prior to Federation. Then, we are asked to wait until the Governments of the StatesI am of opinion that if no such have a surplus : but does any one expect that if a State Government ever has a surplus it will not at once proceed to spend it ? But the Do we not know that Governments and Parliaments have a tendency to spend, all the money they get? The State of Victoria, that has been described as going down hill to ruin, has a surplus this year, and its Parliament is considering how it shall be spent. The various States will have time to economize before any taxation in connection with the Federal Capital can be imposed upon them. They can save money touched They might tackle the question of their second Chambers and The honourable member for their Governors; and they would find that there is plenty of room for economy in that and in other directions. My own opinion is that the taxation of the people will not be raised one penny. Sof a i , the forecast of the effect of Federation in this respect has been proved to be correct-that is to say, that we could unite the Australian States under one Government without adding to the burdens of the people. I admit that there has been an increase of taxation in some of the States; but, taking the average for Australia there has been no increase, and it It may be said has been clearly proved that we are maintaining the Departments which we have taken over more economically than the States did previously.

There has been no delay in the construction of public works. Buildings have been put up where they were wanted, and we have proved that we can construct public works out of revenue. Any one who faces the facts need have no alarm that the Commonwealth is going to be extravagant, or to rush into any expenditure of an unseemly kind, or to be hasty in erecting elaborate buildings costing large sums of money. But it is our duty to be true to the trust that has been reposed in us, and to carry out the Constitution. We must have a place for the meeting of Parliaiment, and buildings for carrying on the administration of the Departments. At the present time we are meeting in a building belonging to the State of Victoria. We are here on sufferance. We are renting offices in Melbourne for Commonwealth purposes, and are paying .heavy rents for them. If we have buildings of our own, paid for out of revenue, we shall have to pay no interest on their construe tion. to the interest on capital cost. and those who think with him, cannot get the idea of interest out of their heads. If the honourable member had saved up money, earned by his own labour, and built a home for himself out of it, he would recognise the importance of having no interest to pay. When we construct our buildings out of revenue we discharge' the cost of construction immediately, and have no interest to pay. A t the present time we are saddled with heavy rent charges. Some honourable members urge that we should locate the Capital in Sydney and erect buildings there. The cost of doing so would be enormous, as compared with the cost of erecting buildings in a Capital city of our-own. The appeal that has been made to us to delay the selection of the Capital is unfair to New South Wales. The people of that State have been waiting patiently. They have given us every facility. The croakers who are making statements in the press in favour of delay are simply doing so from reasons of party political bias. learn the New South Wales people desire to be generous towards the Commonwealth. New South Wales not being willing to grant to the Commonwealth a larger area than 100 squaremiles does not represent the true feeling of the people of that State. It was surprising to me that the late head of the Government in New South Wales, Sir John See, should have expressed his disapproval of the granting of a larger area than that State is forced to grant under the Constitution. We do not desire to take land from New South Wales without paying compensation to those who now own the land that may be resumed. There is no desire to act unfairly to any one.

Before Federation was accomplished, I felt it my duty to speak in Victoria and other States in support of the Constitution under which we now live. meetings I said that there were a number of provisions in the Constitution to which I objected, but as there were so many other provisions which were worthy of support, we were bound to take the bad with the good. One of the mistakes of the Constitution was the provision in reference to the Federal Capita], but as the bargain has been made, it must be kept. what honourable members of the first Federal Parliament would have said if a Victorian member had proposed to excise, for example, the proviso which gave ' Western Australia the right to levy a special Tariff for a certain number of years. Thai was one of the provisions which, from my point of view, ought never to have been in the Constitution; yet, in order to get Federation, we had to concede that special Tariff just as we had to concede the Federal Capital to New South Wales. Those special provisions were objected to by myself and a number of other persons; but, having invited the people to vote for Federation, I conceive it to be my duty to see that all compacts are kept. New South Wales declined to federate unless the Capital were placed within the territory of that State, and that compact has to be kept just as we have kept the compact with Western regard to the Tariff. cumstances, the airy proposal put forward to f a i r l y surprises me, coming from the special quarter it does. that the honourable member for Corangamite and his seconder will, a few days hence, when another proposal is put forward to alter the Constitution, be amongst those who will seriously condemn any interference. They will tell us that the Constitution is a matter not to be trifled with. posal as I spoke. for an alteration of the Constitution had come from the Labour Party, the honourable member for Corangamite, and those who now support him, would have been most severe in their condemnation; yet in order to delay-possibly , honestly enough -the selection of a Federal Capital, they resort to the same expedient. cannot mean anything but delay, if it does not mean something worse, namely, repudiation. At the best, the amendment can In addressing various only mean delay of a kind which will be far more irritating to the States concerned, and more particularly to New South Wales, than would any other proposal that could be made. When the honourable member for Corangamite talked about keeping the spirit of the compact, I could not possibly follow him. What does the honourable member, and those who I wonder think with him, mean by the ""spirit of the compact ?"" Are we keeping a compact when we break it up ? Do they propose to keep the compact by, if not destroying, at any rate varying it in such a way as to make it of no use? When those honourable members speak of the experiment of building a Capital in the back-blocks, the fact is that it would be an experiment to place the Capital anywhere else. The historv of Federations shows that the"" Capitals have always been distinctly removed from any of the existing large cities. There may be some little disadvantage in such a policy, but I am one who thinks that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, and that eventually we shall be delighted to think that we took the step. I am surprised by the statement made by the honourable and learned member for Wannon, that the location of the provisional Capital in Melbourne has Australia in been of no use to Victoria, and, indeed, In those cirthat that State would have been better without it. Practically the whole of the new alter or vary the Constitution expenditure in connection with the Commonwealth takes place in Melbourne. If there I have no doubt have been any advantages hitherto from Federation, Victoria has enjoyed those advantages. Is Victoria, therefore, to stand selfishly by, and, because she is reaping benefits, say to the other States, and particularly to New South Wales, "" You shall never get any of the advantages which we pledged ourselves to give you"" ?

Public men would still continue to do their duty without fear and without favour, and no sufficient reason has been shown for breaking or delaying the execution of this compact.

In my opinion, it is not true to say that the people of New South Wales were not prepared to accept that Constitution unless such an addition were made as a guarantee that the Federal Capital would at least be within their territory, for they had already, by a majority, approved of the Constitution. I admit that the effort to secure the location of the Federal Capital in New South Wales was a clever piece of diplomatic tactics at the time.

The Victorian representatives should recognise that they have had a fair innings, and that some years must still elapse before the Seat of Government can be transferred to the Federal Capital, and they should be prepared out of consideration for their fellow members from other States to facilitate the selection of the site. I do not think that there has been any unnecessary delay up to the present.

I regret that many honourable members have taken so little interest in this question that they' have not troubled themselves to inspect any of the sites.

I believe that the sole object of the honourable member for Corangamite, in moving this amendment, is to cause delay. I fail to see how any other interpretation can be placed upon hia action. If the honourable member, as a Victorian, is not prepared to abide by the compact entered into between the right honourable member for Balaclava and the right honourable member for' East Sydney in days gone by, and has no hesitation in repudiating the promises made to New South Wales, I think that he will stand almost alone in this Parliament. I do not agree with those honourable members who advocate the erection of temporary buildings at the Federal Capital. I think that any buildings erected there should at least be of such a character that they will reflect credit the use of Parliament House free of upon the Commonwealth, and provide reasonably good accommodation for all those who will have to transact Government business. Furthermore, I am not in accord with those honourable members who object to borrowing money for the purpose of laying the foundations of the Federal city. How can it be pretended that we shall be able to provide out of revenue money sufEcient even to make the most unpretentious beginning? Those honourable members who seek to tie the hands of the Government by preventingthem from borrowing money are practically imposing conditions which will render it impossible for the Seat of Government to be transferred to its permanent home for many years to come. It is not desirable that we should start the Federal Capital upon lines similar to those which have been followed in connection with all our great Australian cities. We do not desire to see within the Federal area those features which have marked most of our settlements in their primitive stages. We could not contemplate with pleasure bark humpies or huts constructed of kerosene tins, such as may be found in interesting variety upon our mining fields and other places. We should take advantage of the experience gained in connection with the foundation of our great cities, and proceed upon lines which will from, the outset make the Federal Capital a creditable home for the Parliament and administrative offices of -the Commonwealth.

In the first place, we shall have to provide for an adequate water supply, for the installation of thorough lighting, and sanitary systems, and for the laying out of the city, before we proceed to erect the necessary buildings. Is it reasonable to suppose that we can perform even these preliminary works out of revenue within the next twenty years ? It is nonsense to talk about building the Federal Capital without borrowing money. If we look at the matter from a business stand-point, we must remember that the Commonwealth is paying a large sum of money every year to rent buildings in this city for the accommodation of the Federal Departments. It is true that we have charge, but that concession was made to the Commonwealth by Victoria in return for advantages which her people hoped to obtain from the meeting of the Federal Parliament in Melbourne. The honourable member for Bourke has referred to the advantages which the people of Melbourne obtain from the expenditure undertaken by the Commonwealth in this city; but every representative of a Federal constituency is nevertheless grateful to the State of Victoria for the accommodation which he is permitted to enjoy here. But does not the honourable member for Melbourne Ports realize that it might be a very good business transaction to borrow money to erect Federal buildings, instead of paying interest on rented buildings ? ing altogether. the honourable member is opposed to expedition in the settlement of the Capital site question. If he is against borrowing where a fair return could be obtained in excess of the saving of rent brought about, he is impaled .on the other horn of the dilemma, and must be regarded as opposed to proper provision being made for the accommodation of the Federal Parliament and officers.

When we hear the honourable member speak of the large amount which it will cost to construct a railway to give communication to any of the proposed sites which may be chosen, I ask if it is expected that we should walk to the Capital, carrying our ""blueys"" with us. Surely the honourable member must recognise that railways are necessary to enable us to get to the Federal Capital, and that to make these railways it will be necessary to borrow money. We are justified in borrowing for that purpose, if we can obtain a profitable return for our expenditure. I believe the honourable member for Corangamite has not seen any of the proposed sites. reading the reports that none of the proposed railways, if constructed, would pay for the axle-grease used on the trains. how the honourable member can make a remark so discreditable to his intelligence, since he has not seen the country through which any of these railways would run. I have visited all the sites, and while I admit that some are better than others, I know that it would pay to construct a railway to any one of them.

I do not agree with those who are opposed to reasonable borrowing. It is always wise for the public, as well as for private individuals, to borrow money for the construction of works which will pay a good return upon its investment.

Whatever site we select, we must borrow -money before we can build upon it. wealth has plenty of money. borrowing. what I know to be impracticable, merely to please the public. I do not wish them to believe that the Federal Parliament can perform miracles, by erecting public buildings without money. What we have to see is that the money we borrow is wisely spent, and applied to a legitimate purpose, so that we shall get a good return from its investment. So far as the Federal Parliament House is concerned, I do not think it would be necessary to erect an elaborate building, such as that in which we now meet. I should like to see plans prepared by a competent architect which would allow the building to be put up in sections, so that we could gradually increase our accommodation as our requirements expanded I understand that the buildings in which we meet cost £800,000, and there is more wilful extravagance to the square, foot in them than I have seen in any other public building with which I am acquainted.

But we have to recognise that the people of New South Wales, with their eyes open, accepted the Constitution with those provisions. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -And they gloried in the fact. to say that; but no doubt honourable members who advocated the Bill find room for satisfaction. I am speaking as one who conscientiously opposed the Constitution, which I conceived to be against the interests of New South Wales. No one more than myself would like to see the Constitution amended in the disrecfdon of enabling Sydney to be chosen as the Capital city-o r any other area within the ioomiles limit. in the Commonwealth?

Australia. tion belongs to South Australia. geographical position of Sydney in relation to the,, commerce of the world, especialteration in various other directions, of ally in the light of the new developments promised by the construction of the Panama Canal. where we place the Federal Capital, the prestige of Sydney, as the chief city of Australia, is fully established. Panama Canal will shorten the distance from Europe and America to Australia to such a considerable extent as to make it a foregone conclusion that it will be the highway of commerce between Australia and the rest of the world, just as the Suez Canal is the highway between east and west. I should like to mention incidentally that in this connection the strategic position of the New Hebrides group of islands in the Pacific is a question of grave significance to the future of Australia and British commerce on the Pacific Ocean, and their importance to Australia should not be overlooked in the consideration of this question. I am not in accord, however, with the mover of this amendment in his argument about the use of park lands in the neighbourhood of Sydney for the purposes of a Federal Capital. I hope that all lands which have been dedicated to the public for recreation purposes will be jealously guarded against appropriation co any other purpose. Buti f the ioomiles limit were once repealed, I could call the attention of honourable members to an ideal place for the establishment of a city, perhaps one of the fairest sites in the whole world, and that is a site between George's River and Port Hacking River. To my mind, in all the vast areas in which we are asked to make a selection at the present time, there are not to be found any areas equal to those which are contained within the ioo-miles limit. The area bounded by George's River on the one side, and Port Hacking River on the other, with its picturesque bays, its magnificent stretches of water, the beautiful undulating character IfI of its conformation, and its contiguity to water and fuel, would certainly incline me, but for the knowledge of the certainty of the whole question being shelved, to give my adherence to the amendment. AlthoughI opposed the acceptance of the Constitution as strongly as I could, still I should be one of the last to lightly agree to any attempt to alter one of its provisions until it has had a fair trial. I recognise that once we do make the attempt to alter the Constitution in any one direction-quit e apart from the difficulties to be met-w e shall open the way to its which we may not approve. If we adopt the plan of supporting the amendment, it will It' does not matter simply mean that the question of selecting an area for the Federal Capital will be hung up indefinitely, to the great prejudice The of everybody concerned, and to the great inconvenience of not only the representatives of New South Wales, 'but the representatives of other States. There is a point which has caused me much perplexity ever since I read the Constitution, and that is in regard to the question of the Seat of Government.

442,Mr Johnson,"I am speaking of theIn a note on the Seat of Government, in the of the Constitution provides that the area Annotated Constitution, Quick and Garran of the site shall not be less than 100 square say, at page 979The phraseology of this section, and its involved grammatical construction, raise several difficult questions of interpretation. How is the Seat of Government to be. acquired by the Commonwealth ? What is the eflect of its acquisition ? And what is to happen pending the determination of the Seat of Government? These and other questions must be answered; though the obscurity of the section makes it impossible, in the absence of judicial interpretation, to answer them with absolute confidence. Here is' one of those cases where, through an ambiguity of phraseology, even the most skilful legal minds are left in doubt as to the interpretation of a certain sentence or paragraph. I could easily understand that territory which is granted is intended to mean territory which is granted by the State; but the section contains the words territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth. I do not find in the Constitution any provisions which cover this point of the acquisition of territory. How is territory 'to be acquired? The Parliament of the Commonwealth may select, in New South Wales, certain territory with a desire to acquire it, and the State may refuse to grant it to us. In that case, can the Commonwealth, by force of arms if necessary, secure the territory ? That is a point which does not seem to be made clear in the Constitution ; yet it is one which I think should have been fully developed and explained so as to leave no doubt on the subject. that there will be any trouble of that kind. 13 ut still these are points which have to be considered beforehand, and involve possibilities and contingencies which, in my opinion, ought to have been provided for by specific -enactment. regret to find that there is nothing definite as to what, is meant by the acquisition of territory. for is that, whatever territory may be decided upon by this Parliament, no objections to its acquisition will be raised. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Even if we should want to take half the State? I disagree entirely with the honourable member for Gwydir's remarks, which seemed to me to be somewhat in the nature of a threat against the State Parliament, if it did not agree to a demand which it could not have been expected to be called upon by the Commonwealth to agree to. Certainly section 125 0 miles; but I think that the spirit underlying that provision was that it should be somewhere near that area. If we make a demand for 900 square miles, we shall invite a great deal of opposition, which there is no necessity to provoke. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -We might negotiate for that area, but it ought not to be mentioned in the Bill. think that we ought to go to the Government of New South Wales, and with a pistol pointed at its head, say, "" We shall have this large territory, or none."" That is not the kind of spirit in which the Commonwealth Parliament should approach the State Parliament; but the ordinary rules of courtesy ought to be observed. I am hot byany means in accord with those honourable members who have spoken about using temporary structures in the'Federal Capital. My idea is that the best advice available should be taken. If possible there should be a conference of the most skilled architects and engineers to consider and devise a plan for the Federal city, or competitive designs invited at a suitable premium, in order to induce the best architects to compete. While I recognise that every attention should be paid to the development of such an important place as the Federal city, and that it should be our ultimate aim to make that city an example in architecture and every other respect to the whole world, of Of course I do not anticipate what a model city should be, and as showing what Australia is capable of doingwhile I hold that that should be the central idea, I admit that it would be simply madness to attempt to erect the buildings at once. But whilst the general idea could I very much be kept in view, such sections of a general plan could be carried out as would meet present requirements first, and others proThe only thing we can hope ceeded with as they became necessary from time to time. Every addition to the original structure would then be part and parcel of the whole plan. The principle would be the same as that on which so many magnificent cathedrals have been erected, and the buildings when completed would make a harmonious whole. I do not agree with the honourable member for Gwydir that the honourable member for Cora'ngamite desires to promote delay in the consideration of this question.

In those States where the cry for economy is loudest, there would appear to have been a good deal of extravagance in the past. We often hear railway construction blamed-most unjustly, I think-for the waste, of public monev; but my opinion is that railways have made Australia what it is. If money has to some degree been wasted in connection with, railway construction, the extravagance has not been carried to the same extent as in connection with other public works. It appears to me that those who were parties to the borrowing policy of the States and who joined in spending the money as fast as possible, until it was dimcult to borrow more, are now on the opposite taqk and are opposed to any further borrowing. Only. the other day, when a very advantageous offer was made in connection with our naval defences, we were told, by these advocates of economy, that we ought to have a local navy, apparently unmindful of the fact that it meant a large loan expenditure, In fact, those who preach economy one day, support ex travagance the next.' I think, however, that when the time comes for us to establish ourselves in the Capital city, we shall find that the people and their parliamentary representatives are in favour of good, sub stantial buildings which will be no dis credit to the Commonwealth. I hope no long speeches will be found necessary on -the motion for the second reading of this Bill, and that we shall dispose of the amendment quickly. I feel quite sure that there is no large number of honourable members who would vote for the amendment in the shape in which it is presented.
