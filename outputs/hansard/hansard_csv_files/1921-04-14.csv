Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. ' In giving notice of m.Y intention to move the adjournment of the House to discuss the present excessive and crushing rates of ocean freights on Australia's exportable products, I thought I was doing my duty in taking what' seemed to me the best opportunity available to draw public attention to a very serious a-nd urgent matter. I h addition to giving you, Mr pared with those of the latest date. In Speaker, and the members of the Ministry, notice of my intention to take this action, I thought it only courteous to make a similar intimation to the Chairman of the . Overseas Shipping_ Companies and to the press, and I was a little surprised to read in a Melbourne news'paper yesterday a telegram from its ,Sydp ney. correspondent stating thatresentment is expressed by tbe representatives and at latest dates of 1921:of tlie owners of overseas shipping at the report from Melbourne that Mr Jowet^, M.H.K., intends to move the adjournment of the House to discuss the excessive and crushing rates of ocean freights now being charged . . Per-lb.'Weight. upon the exportable prqducts of Australia. I do not feel in the slightest degree hurt or discouraged by the resentment thus expressed, especially since the paragraph in which the words I ""bave read appear is headed "" Overseas freights reduced from to-day,"" and contains details of some reductions that have been made. If the Overseas Shipping Committee will make substantial reductions in freights every time that I incur their resentment, I shall be prepared to continue to incur . it daily for the rest, of the year. : This motion of adjournment is not to be regarded asreflecting in the remotest degree-upon thp Government or upon any member of ""it; because for some considerable time past Ministers have done everything possible to bring about a reduction [301] of freights. There has been correspondence on« the subject ibetween the Pastoralists Association and the Government.. The latter replied, on !the 16th March, to a communication sent to them by the association, and, on the '4th April, Mr Deane, the Secretary to the Prime Minister, wroteI desire to inform you that urgent representations have been made to tlie Ministry of Food upon' the matter, and cabled advice has now' been, received from the' High Commissionerand so on. I quote thispassage to show that the Government have done everything in their power to bring about the most necessary reductions in freights. In my. opinion, the reductions which' have been announced during the past few days, and of which a great deal has been made, are totally inadequate, as I think honourable members will agree when I have given them a brief summary of the overseas freights ruling before the war comorder that no injustice ,niay be done to the overseas shipping authorities, I have arranged that, should they make further reductions this afternoon,' before I have finished my speech-whic h is not unlikely, remembering their promptness of the last few days1 shall announce them to the House.

13,Mr Jowett,"That is a very pertiAdjournment. the greatest pests that has ever troubled Australia is the rabbit. friend says that the rabbit is not a pest, I must differ from him as to what a pe3t is. this Chamber called pests. personal application of that statement, I might even disagree with the Prime Minister also. One of the means by which the rabbit pest has'been kept 'down has been the enterprise and industry of the people who trap rabbits for a living. The reward for their arduous labours and privations has been the price received for carcasses and skins. I nnd that the freight on rabbit skins has increased 200 per cent., and on frozen rabbits 205 per cent. In other words, the freight on the products of the men who earn a living by trapping rabbits has been trebled. As showing what rapid changes have been made since the end of last week, when I gave notice of this motion, I find in this morning's paper the following cable from London:The Australian ship-owners have agreed to reduce the freight on rabbits to 168s. per ton. The importers asked for a further reduction, but the ship-owners replied .that this was imtion possible. My calculation of an increase of 205 per cent, was based on that reduced figure mentioned in this morning's cable. I have received thc following letter, which I think it only fair to read to the House:The rate of freight on rabbits is 184s. per ton, to be reduced, according to the newspapers, to 168s. per ton. Pre-war it was 5§s. per ton. It then cost about 2Jd. to land one pair of rabbits in England; now it costs about 7Jd. per pair. Exporters have asked for a rate of 130s. per ton meanwhile, in order to make business possible. The shipping companies suggest the reduction be gradual, though when increases were being made they were not made on a gradual scale; but the request for a rate of 130s -meanwhile shows the exporters of this section are prepared to recognise a gradual reduction. At 130s. the rate would still be 136 per cent, above the pre-war rate. At 130s. it is believed business could be done, wool, which in respect of total value and and this would mean employment for some hundreds, if not thousands, of trappers and others,as well as being a source of revenue to the country. Perhaps more important still is that, through the cessation of trapping, rabbits [301]2 [14 APRIL, 1921.J Adjournment. 7449 will largely increase, and by next year prove a greater menace than ever to many land-owners. Not only has trapping ceased for the export carcase, but rabbit skins have fallen to such a price that trappers have discontinued trapping for the skin also. freight charged by the Commonwealth Government Line is 55s. per ton measurement. 1914. The Commonwealth Line has done magnificent work, but it has not kept the freight on. rabbit skins down to 55s. is correct. items of jam and fruit in cases. There is no more important industry in Australia at the present moment than fruit-grow ins, the success of which is dependent upon a profitable export trade in jam and tinned fruits. The freight on jam and fruit in cases has been increased from 30s. a ton in May, 1914, to 120s,, although I am under the impression that the reduction from 120s. to 105s., made on the same day as the ship-owners expressed' resentment at my action, applies to fruit in cases is even worse than I have said. I have based my calculation on. the reduction to 105s., and that shows an increase in the' freight of 250 per cent, from the rate ruling in May, 1914. Only la^t week a deputation of fruit-growers waited upon us, and told us that the freight on cased goods was now £6 per ton as compared with 30s. or 35s. before the war, and also that refrigerated space for fresh fruit was costing them 8s. per case as against 2s. 9d. to 3s. before the war. One deputation assured us that they are so disheartened by the prospects that in their district many of them will not prune their apricot and pear trees this year, although they will lightly prune their peach trees. As time is limited I must leave this subject, and pass on to the question of volume of output is one of the most important of all the Australian products.

23,Mr Jowett,"If that 13 so the posithe'-war: '' Owing to the chaotic conJ dition of the wool markets of the world' it is impossible for anybody to say what relation present prices for wool bear to those ruling before the war; so much.of the wool is unsaleable that it is idle to say that it is worth a. certain price if a buyer cannot be found. At all events, there are some kinds of wool, not of the best quality, which are now worth much less than they were before the war. Every practical farmer knows that, however good your sheep may be, and however much you look after them, the actual value of a pound of wool is very largely determined by the district in which it is grown, the nature ,of the soil, and the season. richest land is so infested with trefoil burr and seed that it grows what from the manufacturing point of view' is the most inferior wool. Nobody should say that a man. ought to grow better wool if the best quality pays; every man grows as good a class of wool as he possibly can. I have some startling information brought Co my attention only this morning. Fortunately, publicity was given to the fact that I intended to move, the adjournment of the House to-day upon this subject, and, as a consequence, I had already received voluntarily a great deal of information from most reliable people. Further communications came to hand this morning from an undoubtedly reliable source. Sixty bales of scoured and fellmongered i wool, shipped in November last per s.s. JJlysses, according to the account sales just to hand, were sold in London at an average price of 4^d. per lb. Quite apart from the price paid for the sheepskins, it cost the shipper of these 60 bales, in fellmongerihg, scouring, and in freight, 6Jd. per lb.; so that he sold the wool at 2£d. per lb. less than it cost him to fellmbnger it and ship, it . wool into 'the manufactured article, it costs' 4s. 6d: per lhi ber is perfectly right. In spite of the fact that some Australian wool-growers are receiving practically nothing for their wool, it is impossible for any .one in the world io buy clothes.at a reasonable price. Extension of time granted. The increased freight on sheepskins is apparently one of the most crushing of all. Before the w.ar, the rate was 75s. per ton; it is now 297s."" per ton, an increase of 296 per cent. Sheepskins are not included in the reductions recently announced. It is certainly highly desirable to have our own sheepskins fellmongered before export, providing that the sheep farmer gets the world's parity for them; but, from the example I have just given, it is .quite apparent that, at present prices, they cannot be fellmongered locally. Furthermore, obviously the. sheep farmer must look to the sheepskin exporter to obtain some recompense for the trouble of treating the skins, and for the cost he Sometimes the incurs in sending them to market. In regard to sheepskins, the Sydney correspondent of the Argus saysIn the case of hides, skins, tallow, copra, and certain other lines of cargo, it has heen represented to the ship-oWners that the' rates of freight have prevented business. Shippers have not complained that the rates were unreasonable, but that, owing to the great fall in the prices of their commodities, they cannot do business unless there is a great reduction in the freights. The Ship-owners' reply hag been, "" Show us what rate of freight you can do business at, and we will consider reducing it for you."" Where this had been done the ship-owners have reduced the rate accordingly, and, in one instance, space was actually offered free. It is asserted that the policy of the ship-owners right through has been to assist traders. Answering allegations about a Combine controlled by Lord Inchcape, which is slowly squeezing Australian shippers to death, the owners state that no such Combine exists. I have made no reference to any Combine, but, as this, matter has been introduced into the reply sent to me by those persons who resent my taking steps in this direction in the House, I think I am justified in introducing it now. The article proceeds:The number of companies under the direction of Lord Inchcape does not account for more bhan a decimal fraction of the tonnage trading to Australia. The information brought to me yesterday from a most reliable source-fro m ' people who understand what they are talking aboui>-doe s not bear out the view taken by this writer.

A loss on one year's operations does not by any means prove the venture to be a failure; there might be a loss of, say, £2,000, but we have to consider the many thousands of pounds that the presence of these steamers on the coast put into the pockets of the producers. I do not call such a venture a failure if there is a loss on the running of the vessels beto show whether or not there are undue cause, as I say, we have to bear in mind the number of people benefited. -The House and the country owe a debt of gratitude to the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) for the facts he has laid before us. It is not quite fair for the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) to charge the honourable member for Grampians with not having proposed a remedy, because, as we know, the honourable member's time expired before he had said all he desired. I have held for very many years that the shipping of the world to-day is dominated by the Inchcape Shipping Combine, which has purchased practically the whole of the line3 running, not only to Australia, but running in Australian waters.

I know that the cost ofrunning ships has enormously increased; everything connected with shipping, from sails to wages, and dock charges to insurance, has been increased in cost, very largely in some cases, as compared with the period before the war. But I say that the prices charged before the war enabled nearly every one of the companies trading to Australia to practically renew their fleet out of the profits made. fact, as stated to me in the House two days ago, that the freight on a 40-lb. case of fruit from Australia to England is 8s., whereas in 1914 the cost was 2s. 3d. to 2s. 9d. that, I think, in 1914. the freight at that time.

Mr Larkin, the manager of the Commonwealth Line in England, has said on more than one occasion that it is not the policy of the Government to enter into a rcight war with the Comf bine.

Instead of that amount being distributed in Australia, much of it will be represented by overdrafts bearing interest at 7 per cent. That is a serious position.

The black flag with the skull and cross-bone3 is what the Shipping Combine should be flying. The only hope we have is the competition of the Commonwealth Line of steamers, and if that line is to work by arrangement with the Combine, the primary oroducers will be at the mercy of Tiberius. {3.55] I should like to settle this matter in a few moments. I am pleased that the question of freights has been raised' by a member of the'Country party. The farmers are always fond of a little bit of Socialism if it suits them, but they do not care to give much to the poor unfortunates in my'electorate. The honourable has complained of a freight charge of 8s. for a case of apples. There is not enough refrigerated space in the Commonwealth Line of steamers to carry all the Australian fruit to the Old World, so that if the whole of the Commonwealth freight were made available, most of the fruit would still have to be handled by the Combine. The honourable member said that the Commonwealth Line should lower its freights. fruit went to England for 6s. per case, and the honourable member were charged by the Combine 8s. per case, he would grumble. The only satisfactory solution, therefore, is for the Commonwealth to carry the whole of the fruit. We can-, not build the requisite number of ships in time. We must charter sufficient ships to carry the whole of the Australian produce to Great Britain. After we have Although some honourable done that, and lowered the freights, the Inchcape Combine will come into compelower in order to beat us. And the producers will, thereupon, rush their goods into the. ships of the Combine, the chartered ships will go to the wall, and the whole undertaking -will then be pointed to as another instance of the failure of State enterprise! contract for five years. signed contracts. Every time an attempt has been made to socialize any public We cannot allow the high utility the private combines have fought the Government undertaking with lower charges. The people msh the lower charges, and the State enterprise is wiped out. Another example of the folly of Socialism! If the Government were to charter sufficient ships to carry all Australia's exportable commodities, thc Shipping Combine is strong enough to fight us with lower prices. When that happened would the producers refuse to avail themselves of the cheap rates?

What is the use of honourable members making suggestions without indicating what they are prepared to do to defeat the «Inchcape Combine? ' They will get every assistance from honourable members on this side in inaugurating a Socialistic shipping enterprise. shipping charges are too high, and it is impossible for things to continue as they are to-day. The honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) will show that some of our minerals, cannot be exported on account of the high freights. If the stoppage of the export of certain commodities would lead to the expansion of some of our local trades, such as fellmongering, I would hail the existing conditions with joy; but it does not have that effect. On the contrary, it helps to defeat the particular trade I have mentioned. If the members of the Country party and Government supporters desire to embark upon a'Socialistic venture in the shape of Government control of shipping, we will help them; but we require also the assistance and loyalty of those who sent them to this House in order to make it a success. A Government, enterprise could not succeed if , as soon as the Inchcape Combine lowered its charges in order to squeeze the Government out of the market, the producers transferred their support to them.

It is the duty of every v honourable member who served on that Select Committee to see that justice is done to all parties. In regard to the question at issue today, I have been waiting to hear a . remedy proposed. We are exceedingly fortunate that already there has been a slump in freights, which have decreased by from 60 per cent, to 70 per cent. I I know that the wish they would fall further, but we must tackle the problem from a practical point of view in such a way as to bring us back gradually from abnormal and artificial conditions to normal conditions. The solution cannot be found in any other way. slow process, I am afraid. a slow process, and it will not be completed in a month or a year. The same remark applies to the high cost of living. Certain figures have been submitted by the Prime Minister to-day, which not merely tell against the capitalistic or. monopolistic party, but apply all round. The Select Committee on the Sea Carriage of Goods received ample evidence as to what was responsible for the increased shipping charges. When those charges are fairly tackled, and reductions made all round, there will be a howl-of opposition from honourable members on the Opposition side as well as from the monopolists. party? Will they be satisfied? because they are nearly* all sensible men, and represent not only a section, but the whole community. It is useless for honourable members opposite to talk platiare to face the existing problems, let us face them fairly and squarely, and admit' that if freights are to be reduced, they can be reduced only by fair reductions all .1 round.

Another apologist for the Combine is the Treasurer. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) deserves the thanks of the country for having brought before the House the subject of oversea freights. But his gun is not loaded; he merely makes a noise with blank cartridge. As the honourable member for Perth( Mr Eowler) has told them times us. out of number, the Country party have the remedy in their own hands; but they choose to do nothing. Last year they took the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) to task for having spent £10,000,000 without the authority of Parliament, but he told honourable members that they ought to thank God that he had done it, because thereby the whole of the Commonwealtli had escaped from the tentacles of a Shipping Combine.

The honourable member for Franklin( Mr bought the Commonwealth steamers beMcWilliams) has ' pointed out that, whereas the freight on fruit before the war was not higher than 2s. 93. per case to the United Kingdom, to-day it is 8s. per case. What would happen if any member on this side of the House moved that the freights chargeable by the Commonwealth Line of Steamers should be reduced to the normal conditions applying before the war? member think it possible to get back to those conditions with the present cost of labour and the other high charges? expect it ; but can the Treasurer say that reduced. When I saw the announcement the charges have gone up to an extent that would justify imposing a rate of 8s. per case for fruit to the Old Country? can only say that there are no abnormal profits being made by the Commonwealth Line of Steamers on the overseas trade. want to make profits.

The honourable member complains that the shippers are fleecing the people here, but that remark cannot apply to the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. wealth Line of Steamers charge the same freights as the others do who fleece do charge the same freights, all I can say is that the charge does not express itself in the shape of inordinate profits. is that the Commonwealth are in the Combine just as much as other ships are. The Prime Minister told me yesterday that my education as a mathematician had been neglected, but the facts as they present themselves to me are that in 1914 for less than half the cost to-day. The Prime Minister' told us that he cause he was far-seeing enough to realize that there would be a general combination of shipping throughout the world which would so manipulate freights as to bring injury to the primary producers of Australia. To that sentiment the Corner party said "" Hear, hear!""; in fact, they tendered him a dinner, and some of them helped to subscribe £25,000 for him for what he had done. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) is a member of the Pastoralists Union, one of the biggest Combines in Australia, and he does exactly what the other fellow is doing.
