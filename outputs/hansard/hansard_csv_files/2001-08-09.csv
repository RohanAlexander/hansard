It being 6 p.m.,Thursday, 9 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29649 Thursday, 9 August 2001 ----Cardinia Shire: Out of School Hours Care Program the outstanding work done by the Cardinia Shire out of school hours care team. I have visited this centre, which is run by probably one of the most enthusiastic people you are ever likely to meet in the field of children’s services. Her name is Maggie Farrell, and she heads an outstanding group of dedicated staff who are providing child-care services to families in the Pakenham district. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, as a Victorian you would be aware of the massive growth which has taken place in the Pakenham area over the last four or five years. That massive growth is set to continue over the next five to 10 years. It is anticipated that the township of Pakenham-which is very quickly becoming part of the eastern suburbs of Melbourne-will increase in size from 10,000 people, which is its population today, to probably 20,000 people within five to 10 years. There will be massive growth in the Pakenham district, and we need to make sure that the services keep up with this demand which is obviously going to develop. The out of school hours care program is funded by the federal government. WhatI am concerned about is that we are not keeping up with the demand from the local community there. The federal government is not giving enough places to the Cardinia Shire so that it can provide services to the families who are moving into the Pakenham district. It is an outstanding service which they run and, because of this, more and more families want to access this service. It places the staff and the shire under considerable pressure when some families can access the out of school hours care program and others cannot because there are not enough places being provided by the federal government to Cardinia Shire so that they can run this out of school hours care program. The out of school hours care program is one which families in the district feel very comfortable using. Many parents-not just in Pakenham itself but further east in my electorate in West Gippsland, in particular the Drouin district-are able to drop their kids off on their way through to work in Melbourne and then pick their kids up on the way back from Melbourne. This enables parents to spend some quality time in the car with their children before they drop them off, knowing that they are going to be properly looked after before school and that they have a safe place to return after school, and then when they pick them up and take them home. This is a great program. It is exactly the type of program which we want to encourage in terms of children’s services. It is the type of program which provides real support for families, and the federal government should do more to make sure that people in the Pakenham district are able to access these types of excellent facilities. (Time expired) Petrie Electorate: Community Groups Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (9.54 a.m.)-I would like to continue my remarks from yesterday in support of a federal government initiative. In this International Year of Volunteers, the Small Grants Program has provided funding of up to $5,000 for proposals consistent with the themes and objectives for this year. One of the chief benefits of the program is that it benefits community volunteer organisations in providing them with an opportunity to truly celebrate the significance of the year and to raise awareness of what they do out there in our community. From the two funding rounds in February and July this year, nine local Petrie electorate organisations have shared in over $17,000.

The successful organisations include Aspley Classes for Seniors, Chermside and District Senior Citizens Centre, the Down’s Syndrome Association of Queensland, North Aspley Rugby League Football Club, Redcliffe Neighbourhood Centre, Redcliffe Peninsula Yacht Centre, Redcliffe PCYC Dolphins Soccer Club, Redcliffe Tigers AFL Sporting Club and Southern Cross College P&F Association. These grants do not limit the organisations to simply hosting a function. In my electorate many of these funds have been used to train volunteers, to seek coaching accreditation, to publish material and to host functions that acknowledge the work of volunteers. The Small Grants Program is important because it offers community groups like those in my electorate the opportunity to demonstrate the extraordinary contribution to our society by volunteers. Volunteers can make a difference. We need to recognise the fact that they play a key role in our community. ABS figures indicate that over 500,000 Queenslanders volunteer over 90 million hours of work each year worth approximately $2 billion. A survey by Volunteering Queensland found that 25 per cent more Queenslanders had volunteered in 1999 than had in the previous year, 1998. The volunteers had very diverse skills that also will deliver job related skills later. This year gives us a unique opportunity to examine the impact that volunteers have had on our local communities, the broader economy and the Australian work force. Volunteersquite often our unsung heroesprovide care and assistance to meet the growing demands of our society. Volunteering also gives volunteers a sense of achievement, of doing something great for others. The Small Grants Program has been very instrumental in raising awareness of this contribution by volunteers. I look forward to the continuation of the program to ensure the success of volunteers at the local level. The program not only has been an important initiative in raising that awareness across my electorate but also has been important in ensuring the ongoing support necessary to ensure the survival of this great diversity in our society. I would like to see the program extended in the future. Perhaps the government could look at capital grant funding. (Time expired) Lyons Electorate: Levendale School electorate, Levendale Primary School. It is a small country public school situated between Woodsdale and Runnymede on the east coast of Tasmania. It is a beautiful and rather isolated part of the state, and the school is set in the middle of sheep and forestry country. The school used to have high school students but now has kinder to grade 6-26 students are currently enrolled. It is guided by its present principal, Mr O’Keefe. Levendale Primary School was built in 1901. Therefore, this year it is celebrating its centenary. During the year it has had a series of events to celebrate this important occasion. It is still something of a marvel that it has achieved this age when public school all around Australia have faced closure or integration with other schools. It shows what a strong, enterprising community Levendale is. The school staff, present and past, should be congratulated on upholding excellence in education for over a century. I had the opportunity to visit while the pupils and staff took on the apparel and the ways of students back in 1901. The school had found Mr Keith Baverstock from an organisation called Colonial Schools. He is an actor-teacher who is touring around Australia during this centenary year with a carpetbag full of slates, chalk and costumes so that children from all over the nation can get a feel of how it was in school in 1901. The school lent itself perfectly to the reenactment because the re-enactment took place in the original hall, which has not changed much over time. I sat up the back of the hall with a number of parents and watched the youngsters struggle with the slates and the chalk. A cane was very much in evidence! BeforeI went into the classroom there was a lot of loud talk and chastising taking place. The children took it in their stride.

The little exercises that the children went through were carried out in the fun and those that stock had listed a number of misdeeds and the punishment for them. Those punishments must have made school a pretty scary place in those days. One wonders how anyone learned.

I proudly represent the north-west coast of Tasmania, including King Island, in the electorate of Braddon. One feature of Braddon, apart from its sheer beauty, is its coastline. There are major ports in Braddon. The International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 is relevant to my area with its proud maritime history. The International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill will amend four acts: the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Act 1989, with consequential amendments to the Admiralty Act 1988 and the Navigation Act 1912; the Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act of 1981; the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983; and the Submarine Cables and Pipelines Protection Act 1963. I support the second reading amendment moved by the shadow minister for transport, Mr Martin Ferguson. The amendment reads: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its neglect of the Australian shipping industry, leaving the Australian economy, environment and community exposed to the risk of marine accidents, port pollution and infiltration via ports and the sea of deadly diseases like foot and mouth disease.” I wholeheartedly support this amendment. It should serve as yet another wake-up call for this government in regard to its shipping policy. The basis of the amendment is that the House condemns this government for its neglect of the Australian shipping industry. As I said, it should be a wake-up call for a government that is continually accused of being asleep at the helm. Nowadays, it only stirs when it senses a looming political backlash. This has given rise to a new political equation of backlash equalling backflip. This is a government that still is not listening-it reacts. A huge question mark still hangs over its commitment and its performance in regard to shipping policy. How has this government reacted to shipping issues critically important to the industry and our nation? The answer to that is it has attempted to bludgeon change.

How has this government reacted to concerns over the impact of shipping on our marine environment? It persists with a strategy to increase the number of foreign flagships on our coastline and to avoid cabotage provisions. How has this government reacted to concerns over the welfare of seafarers? In effect it has turned a blind eye. A further question could also be asked: can this government continue to ignore its national and international shipping responsibilities? The answer to that is clearly, ‘No, it cannot.’ It is about time the Howard coalition government became proactive rather than reactive across the broad brush of government policy. Yet, as many of those opposite know, the Prime Minister and his followers do not listen until they are forced to. It should not take the threat of a maritime disaster like that posed by the grounding of a ship on the Great Barrier Reef, as we saw earlier this year with the Malaysian freighter Bunga Teratai Satu, for the government to listen. It should not take the discovery of appalling living conditions seafarers are forced to endure on the so-called ships of shame, as I saw last year when the Greek owned Nicolas Star sailed into Burnie, for the government to listen. Yet what can you expect from a reactionary government? And what other conclusion can be drawn from its reaction times to the issues and challenges facing the Australian shipping industry when examining its poor maritime track record? Indeed, this government’s approach to shipping policy and its attitude towards those who work in the industry is as predictable as it is deplorable. It does not disguise its ideological obsession with belting unions. Day in, day out we have the pleasure of the belting union syndrome in this House, more recently in the case of the Maritime Union of Australia and the attempts by this government to bludgeon that union and to bludgeon changes. To many, this government is not genuinely interested in waterfront reform; it is only interested in destroying the Maritime Union of Australia. It should heed the warning that, as in education policy and health policy, industrial relations policy is a key to underpinning a fair Australia. Indeed, the recent events in the automotive industry bear clear testimony to that. But what have we seen in terms of policy? I come back again to this government’s backlash equals backflip equation. What we are seeing now are policies of about-turns and of backflips that have not only left the budget in tatters but also severely tarnished this government’s economic management credentials. At present, so many areas of policy are being driven by shortterm politics, not by any long-term plan. That certainly holds true in the approach to shipping. We all know that seafaring is a global industry, infamous for ships of shame and flags of convenience ships. I come from an island with a long and proud maritime history. Our reliance on the sea for commerce, transport and recreation is enormous, and anything that impinges on this must be very carefully scrutinised. Tasmanians, and indeed the rest of Australia, must feel secure in the knowledge that the ships that ply our waters are safe, that the crews manning the vessels are well trained and that onboard practices are of the highest standards. That is, that it is a humanised industry as well as an efficient and effective industry. Sadly, the arrival of the Nicolas Star in Burnie only served to highlight to me the challenges ahead. I add that the local branch of the Maritime Union in Burnie, led by the state secretary of the MUA, Mike Wickham, succeeded in securing lost wages for the Filipino crew of the Nicolas Star and helped get on-board conditions improved. But what do you think happened to the crew at the ship’s first overseas port of call? They were sacked, they were blacklisted and are unlikely to ever work again at sea. Sadly, that is how international shipping sometimes works. Is this how this government wants it to work here? It seems so because it continues to sit on its hands, content to see Australia’s shipping industry sink further. In 1996, the coalition government commissioned a report on the future directions of the Australian shipping industry; this report, of the shipping reform group, was handed to the responsible minister in April 1997. By August 1998, the government had not responded to the report. In November 1998, the government commisThursday, 9 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29653 sioned a further report, the shipping reform working group’s report on the future directions of the industry, which was handed to the minister in April 1999. In December 1999 the responsible minister announced that the government would not make fiscal measures available to the Australian shipping industry. The shipping industry has still not received a response to the shipping reform working group report. I can report that there are no Australian ships calling at Tasmanian ports for national or international cargo, other than regular freight services from Devonport and Burnie to Melbourne. It should be borne in mind as well that Burnie’s port is the fifth largest container port in the Southern Hemisphere, and that the vast majority of Tasmania’s export trade goes out in containers. This is consistent with the decline of Australia’s trading fleet. In 1989, Australia’s shipping fleet numbered close to 80. Now it numbers less than 50 and is diminishing further. The decimation of Australia’s shipping fleet and the emergence of foreign vessels operating on our interstate and intrastate routes is no coincidence. Foreign vessels are literally taking cargo off Australian ships by obtaining single voyage permits, or SVPs, or continuing voyage permits, CVPs, thus carrying interstate cargo without having to obtain a licence. Picture this: Australian crews on Australian ships, waiting outside Australian ports, watching Australian cargo-that is, cargo that they should be transporting-being loaded onto foreign ships. Remember that the practice is being aided and abetted by this government’s shipping policy-or, indeed, the lack of it. According to a submission by the Australian Shipowners Association to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, which is looking at the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2000, the proliferation of permits has resulted in an increasing volume of coastal cargo being carried in foreign vessels. The shipowners’ submission notedand I quote: It is well known in the industry that cargo interests intending to seek a permit keep track of Australian vessels so as to ensure that an Australian vessel will not be available when they make their permit application. Moreover, permits are usually sought and granted at such short notice that it can readily be contrived to avoid engaging an Australian ship. Cargo carried in vessels issued with SVPs and CVPs increased by 0.7 million tonnes, or 10.1 per cent, to eight million tonnes in 1999-2000, which represents growth of 507.5 per cent compared with figures for 1991-92. The cargo carried per permit issued continued to increase-from 9,778 tonnes in 1998-99 to 11,430 tonnes in 1999-2000. Vessels issued with SVPs and CVPs transported 15.1 per cent of the Australian interstate and intrastate transport industry task by sea in 1998-99. What about the ever present danger to our marine environment by dubious shipping practices? Again, in Tasmania, we have first-hand experience of this. The Pacific seastar is causing havoc in southern Tasmanian waters. From the Derwent estuary, it is slowly but surely making its way up the east coast of Tasmania. The unwelcome seastar arrived in the ballast of an overseas ship and is now posing a very real threat to our marine environment. It threatens valuable scallop and abalone fisheries, together with other lucrative aquaculture industries. As I have mentioned, there have been a number of inquiries into shipping practices and ship safety over the past decade or more-most notably, the three Ships of shame reports conducted by the then House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. These reports have been instrumental in raising national and international awareness of the nature and extent of problems affecting the safety of ships and the welfare of their crews. The last of these reports, Ships of shame-a sequel, was produced in 1995 and makes for very edifying, if concerned, reading. I have highlighted issues raised in these parliamentary reports before in this parliament, but on recent evidence it seems there is still a long way to go before we can have complete faith in the shipping business. Unfortu29654 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 August 2001 nately, it is still the case now, as it was then, that flag of convenience ships continue to avoid their responsibilities under international maritime safety obligations. Ships of shame, rust buckets, coffin ships, casino ships are just some of the names that describe the growing fleet of flag of convenience vessels threatening our coastline. FOC ships fly the flags of other nations because they are cheap. They can take advantage of low registration costs, low or no taxes, poor standards and cheap crews. About one-fifth of the world’s 80,000 or more ships fly a flag of convenience, but FOC shipping represents more than half of worldwide ship losses. As the last Ships of shame report states: This final report highlights the fact that the work of this committee has really only just begun. Substandard shipping and inhumane treatment of crew must be eradicated to ensure a safe, environmentally responsible, clean and efficient shipping industry. Yet despite these findings, successive Liberal governments have eagerly set about undermining the Australian shipping industry and the welfare of our seafarers. Why else would it want to avoid having cabotage provisions? Contrast the record of this government with that of Labor in regard to shipping. The Labor Party knows and understands the economic and strategic importance of maintaining a vibrant, efficient and safe domestic shipping industry. It was reaffirmed at our national conference in Hobart last year. Our platform summed up our commitment. For the record, it states that Labor will: Ensure that Australian domestic shipping is crewed by workers operating under Australian award conditions, under established cabotage arrangements. Encourage the continued operation of an Australian shipping industry-and in doing so ensure that Australian shipowners continue to employ Australian crews. Encourage the expansion of Australia’s participation in international shipping And pursue productivity, increased competition and investment at our ports. Again, contrast that with the approach of the coalition. The charge that this government is not listening is easily sustained in regard to Australian shipping. It would do well to listen to the outcome of the latest inquiry into ship safety conducted by the International Commission on Shipping. The independent commission was set up to inquire into and report on ways of combating substandard shipping. Its report titled Ships, slaves and competition was released in March this year. The commission received more than 120 written submissions and commissioners travelled around the world gathering evidence during the year-long investigation. Some of the major concerns expressed to the commission were: The vital need for crew skills, competence, quality training and authentic qualifications. The failure of nations registering ships to ensure that the ships met international maritime safety standards. The need for complete public accountability or transparency in shipping operations. The need for all those in the chain of responsibility to ensure that quality shipping is maintained and to help eradicate substandard shipping for the seas of the world and The urgent need to end the horrific abuse and exploitation of seafarers. As we have seen with previous reports, the International Commission on Shipping Inquiry found that thousands of seafarers continued to work in slave conditions, with minimal safety, long hours for little or no pay, starvation diets, rape and beatings. The inquiry was told of a crew who disappeared after complaints to officers and employer practices of black-listing sailors who complain to unions. Surely those opposite would not condone this sort of thing. Yet it seems this government is a willing accomplice with those plotting the demise of the Australian shipping industry. How else could one interpret its obsession with doing away with cabotage provisions and its support for flag of convenience ships and as a consequence the threat to our marine environment? Thursday, 9 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29655 It is a fact that unsafe ships have caused the majority of maritime and ecological disasters. And removal of cabotage provisions would result in a large influx of these types of vessels into Australia’s domestic trade. Consider again the findings of the Ships, slaves and competition report, which states: Little effective action has been give to the working conditions of seafarers on foreign ships. Remember that this report was handed down only this month. It goes on: Although many ship owners act responsibly, the failure of many flag states and the international regulatory system to adequately implement international labour standards has exposed thousands of seafarers to exploitation and abuse. Concerted action is needed to redress this deficiency. The report also reiterated: The human factor which has been identified already as the principal cause of shipping accidents and pollution incidents is of greater significance if crews are fatigued, malnourished and under personal or social pressure. There is a consistent theme running through all of this but, unfortunately, it is often ignored and forgotten. The government would not like it too much, but the independent inquiry also found that unions are the seafarers’ best form of redress and protection in a competitive labour market. But what we have is a government obsessed with destroying those unions. Keep in mind that the International Commission on Shipping was an independent global inquiry. This, and I suspect many of the other reports, is a damning reflection on the current system and should be a wake-up call for this government with regard to shipping policy. Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.21 a.m.)-I, like the previous speaker, the member for Braddon, come from an area, the Hunter, that has a proud history associated with the shipping industry. I grew up on the North Coast of New South Wales and over the years, as I have researched the history of the area, I have found that it also had a shipbuilding and shipping industry, but it is long gone. I am worried about what is going to happen to the shipping industry throughout Australia. The International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 seeks to amend the acts of parliament that relate to Australia’s compliance with international conventions. This legislation is largely technical and facilitative in nature, and it is uncontroversial. It is legislation I support, unlike the government’s treatment of the shipping industry. Unfortunately, this is a government driven by an ideological hatred of the maritime union. It is this hatred rather than the future of a viable shipping industry that has driven the government’s policy in relation to the shipping industry, one of the industries most important to Australia. It is an industry that provides jobs and one that is linked with Australia’s future. We are an island nation and we have vast distances across which we need to transport goods. The government’s pursuit of the union, our Australian mariners and the workers within the industry has really been to the detriment of the Australian economy and one of the most important industries in this country. We have only to look to the UK to see what the Thatcher government did to the shipping industry there and to see the recognition by Tony Blair, when he came to government, of the need to rebuild that industry. He recognised that having control or your shipping industry means having control of all those shore based industries as well. It is for these reasons that I support the amendments moved by the shadow minister. This government has shown a determination to weaken the Australian industry since it came to office in 1996. It abolished the PAYE tax exemptions legislated by the Labor government, along with other policies that I will detail in a moment, which led to a steady reduction in the Australian fleet. Firstly, BHP’s Iron Pacific, one of the world’s largest coal carriers and well known at the port of Newcastle in the Hunter, was sold to the Bergesen line of Norway. Howard Smith, a name synonymous with the shipping industry, has all but left the industry, except for towage. This has happened because of the government’s ideological attack on the maritime union. As I said, this attack extends beyond the towage. The government has pursued a 29656 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 August 2001 policy of issuing single voyage permits, and even continuous voyage permits, which are having an enormous impact on our shipping industry. Yesterday the shadow minister really detailed how this increasing use of temporary licensing of foreign ships was impacting on Australia. The Labor government issued 421 permits to carry a total of 3.2 million tonnes of coastal cargo in 1995-96. In the financial year 1999-2000 the minister approved 629 single voyage permits to carry 7.3 million tonnes. The Labor government did not issue one continuous voyage permit because the Labor government actually cares about Australian coastal shipping. In the year 1999-2000 the minister shifted a total of eight million tonnes of domestic freight from the Australian shipping industry to foreign ships. This really demonstrates the lack of commitment of this government to our shipping industry. Furthermore, in the year 1999-2000 there were 73 continuous voyage permits issued, compared with none by the previous Labor government. You can see the impact this would have on our shipping industry and its viability in this country. Up until the end of the March quarter there have been 476 continuous voyage permits issued. If this continues in Australia we will not have a shipping industry. It really presents an enormous threat to the sustainability of the Australian shipping industry and, along with that, to our environment. The policies of the government have led to a dramatic reduction in the size of the Australian fleet. There is now only one Australian flagship based at the port of Newcastle in the Hunter. Australian flagships are subject to Australian laws and standardsstandards that do not allow the types of ships of shame that were detailed in the report on Ships of shame by my predecessor, the former member for Shortland, Peter Morris. The one remaining Australian flagship in the Hunter is the Wallarah and it carries coal from Catherine Hill Bay to the port of Newcastle. I know in other speeches I have detailed a scenario where you have one of these ships of shame shipping coal from Catherine Hill Bay to Newcastle, a rust bucket with inexperienced crew. There is an accident; it runs aground. The fact that the crew is poorly trained and that the ship is substandard could lead to environmental devastation on the beaches between Catherine Hill Bay and Newcastle-a very important scenic area-with all the environmental issues that would be associated with it. Peter Morris also was the chair of the International Commission on Shipping. They prepared a report, Ships, slaves and competition. In this report ‘ships’ refers to international operators and ‘slaves’ refers to the many thousands of seafarers who are exploited, abused and ill treated by those in pursuit of lower freight rates and those who are not working in true competition. ‘Competition’ is unequal competition that exists between those shipping companies and those involved in the shipping industry who do not abide by the rules and do not provide standard shipping. They are the kinds of ships that are sailing around the coast of Australia; the kinds of ships that this government is allowing to take the work of Australian flagships. They are the kinds of ships that will be carrying our cargo in the future unless the government acts now to turn the tide and support the Australian shipping industry. Australians value their environment. Our beaches are renowned worldwide. If these rust buckets are allowed to travel in Australian waters while carrying Australian cargo produced by Australian people, there is the potential for enormous devastation. Those beaches that we all love and that are known throughout the world could be devastated. And then consider the Great Barrier Reef. The impact that these flags of convenience ships could have there, the devastation that could be caused by them, is beyond comprehension. The Australian shipping industry provides many jobs. Australian mariners are known throughout the world for their skills and expertise. They are models within the industry. But this government does not like the Maritime Union of Australia. Unfortunately, this government is prepared to forsake more than 40,000 Australian jobs simply because it does not like the Maritime Union. As I just mentioned, there are more than 40,000 people employed in many jobs in the maritime industry. There are the tug crews, the port staff, et cetera, and there are also many shore based jobs. There are professionals such as lawyers, accountants, insurThursday, 9 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29657 ance agents and those involved in management and training. These are jobs that go with the shipping industry. If we have no shipping industry then these jobs do not exist. It is about jobs in all areas, it is about a viable industry and it is about an industry that is of paramount importance to a nation like Australia. Finally, I turn to cabotage. We all know that the Access Economics report was critical of the government’s policy to eliminate cabotage. It has never surfaced, and the reason is quite obvious. The effect of removing cabotage would be catastrophic. It has the potential to have a devastating effect on our industry and on our Australian environment. The report was prepared in 1999, and we are still waiting with bated breath for its release. The government’s attack on the Australian shipping industry is an attack on Australia, on our Australian way of life and on jobs, and it is driven by the ideological hatred of the Maritime Union. Unlike the government, the Maritime Union is committed to ensuring a viable Australian shipping industry. Ms WORTH (Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (10.33 a.m.)-in reply-I would like to thank members who have taken part in this debate. Firstly, because so many have strayed from the subject of the International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001, I want to remind members what this bill is all about. The International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 amends four acts. Most of the amendments are in response to changes to international conventions and are intended to ensure that Australian marine environment protection standards are in accordance with international best practice. The amendments to the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Act will increase the liability limits that apply to a shipowner where there is a claim for compensation as a result of loss of life or personal injury or damage to property arising from the operation of the ship. The changes in liability limits are in accordance with the amendments to the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims and will not apply in Australia until that convention has entered into force internationally. The Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981 has been amended to revise the list of chemicals in respect of which the Australian Maritime Safety Authority can take intervention action to prevent pollution. This amendment is in accordance with recommendations made by the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organisation. There are a number of amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983. This is the act which implements the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships and is therefore the principal Commonwealth act intended to prevent pollution from ships. The most significant of these amendments is the requirement for Australian ships over 400 tonnes to have a waste management plan and to carry a garbage record book. There is also a revision of some offences and penalties in the act-in particular, any person who is responsible for an unlawful discharge from a ship into the sea of, for example, garbage or oil, will be guilty of an offence. Finally, I mention the amendment to the Submarine Cables and Pipelines Protection Act 1963 to reflect the wording of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea rather than the wording of an older superseded convention. That amendment is simply a change in wording which has no effect on the application of the act, which provides that it is an offence if an Australian ship damages an undersea cable or pipeline outside Australian territorial waters. While individually each of the amendments in this bill is minor, taken as a package they represent an important and significant step in the protection of the marine environment. I would like to turn to a number of the points that have been raised by the opposition. I will begin with some points that the last speaker made. As usual, she has implied that it is only the opposition that understands these issues or that understands the shipping industry. I would like to have reminded her, but she has escaped, that my excellent colleague the member for Rob29658 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 August 2001 ertson, who does such a fantastic job in his electorate, was a member of the Firemen and Deckhands Union and the Merchant Service Guild and had 10 years excellent experience in the maritime industry. So there are certainly government members with a wide range of experience in all sorts of areas, and this is just a classic example of that. I think it is also appropriate to mention that the member for Throsby is retiring at the next election. I take this opportunity, because I may not have the opportunity again, to wish him well since he has taken this decision to leave the parliament, and to congratulate him on the work that he has done. This has been an area in which he has shown a lot of interest over the years, and he tells me that this is very good legislation and that he supports it. We are pleased to have opposition support and I note, of course, that the opposition is supporting this legislation. The member for Bass referred to substandard ships operating on the Australian coast and to the types of defects found on ships detained by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The fact that ships are detained is evidence of the vigilance of the AMSA in detecting substandard ships. They are detained in a port until identified deficiencies are remedied. It is not possible for every ship to be inspected every time it enters a port. I refer the opposition to the 2000 Port State Control Report produced by the AMSA. That report advises that in the year 2000 at least 60 per cent of foreign ships entering an Australian port were inspected. This high rate of inspection indicates a strong commitment to remove defective ships from Australian trade. The member for Melbourne Ports accused the government of spending taxpayers’ money on waterfront redundancies. I remind the opposition that this is not the case. Redundancies have been funded by industry, through the stevedoring levy. Opposition speakers have also raised single voyage permits and the continuous voyage permits. I would like to make it quite clear that these are only granted where Australian licensed vessels are not available. Further, the claim that Australian ships and seafarers stand by and watch cargo carried under permit by foreign vessels is not sustainable. I must also refute the point made that the southern sea star is related to substandard shipping; it is not. Maritime pests such as these are spread through the ballast water, and ballast water is carried by all ships. Despite having to clarify these issues, I thank the opposition for its support. I commend the bill to the chamber. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole. Ms WORTH (Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (10.41 a.m.)-by leave-I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. I move amendments (1) to (4): (1) Schedule 3, item 10, page 32 (after line 21), after subsection (3), insert: (3A) For the purposes of this section, damage to a ship or to its equipment does not include: (a) deterioration resulting from failure to maintain the ship or equipment; or (b) defects that develop during the normal operation of the ship or equipment. (2) Schedule 3, item 37, page 38 (after line 23), after subsection (3), insert: (3A) For the purposes of this section, damage to a ship or to its equipment does not include: (a) deterioration resulting from failure to maintain the ship or equipment; or (b) defects that develop during the normal operation of the ship or equipment. Thursday, 9 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29659 (3) Schedule 3, page 49 (after line 20), after item 94, insert: 94A After subsection 26D(5) Insert: (5A) For the purposes of this section, damage to a ship or to its equipment does not include: (a) deterioration resulting from failure to maintain the ship or equipment; or (b) defects that develop during the normal operation of the ship or equipment. (4) Schedule 3, page 53 (after line 20), after item 119, insert: 119A After subsection 26F(9) Insert: (9A) For the purposes of subsection (9), damage to a ship or to its equipment does not include: (a) deterioration resulting from failure to maintain the ship or equipment; or (b) defects that develop during the normal operation of the ship or equipment. These amendments to the International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 are in response to a decision in the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Morrison v. Peacock& Roslyndale Shipping Company Pty Ltd. In a number of sections of the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983, the master or owner of a ship is strictly liable if there is a discharge from the ship into the sea of, for example, oil, sewage or garbage. But a number of defences are available to the master or owner. In two sections, it is not a defence if the discharge was the result of non-intentional damage. This defence is not available if the master or owner intended to cause the damage or acted recklessly with knowledge that the damage would probably result, or damage was the result of the negligence of the master or owner. In another two sections, it is a defence if the discharge was a consequence of damage to a ship or its equipment. In the Morrison v. Peacock case, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal held that the similar New South Wales act includes wear and tear. This is outside the intention of the meaning of the term as used in the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, where damage is intended to mean accidental damage-that is, damage resulting from an accident. The precedent value of the New South Wales decision may mean that wear and tear defence can be used in cases of discharge resulting from poor maintenance of a ship. These amendments will ensure that wear and tear defence cannot be used inappropriately, by providing that damage to a ship or its equipment does not include deterioration resulting from a failure to maintain the ship or equipment or defects that develop during the normal operation of the ship or equipment. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House with amendments. Motion (by Ms Worth) proposed: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Defence Estate Organisation: Contract Management ously in this place. It concerns the Defence Estate Organisation, a government agency, and its head contractor, Asset Services, and their treatment of Ridgewell, a company in my electorate. I have raised these concerns with the Minister for Defence, and they have yet to be addressed. These concerns relate to fraud being committed by this particular agency. It appears, on the basis of the information I have received back from the minister, that this agency continues to mislead him. So, for the purposes of the parliamentary record, I will raise the re-",105,International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment
289,Mr Byrne (Holt) (10.44 A.m.),"I rise today to discuss a matter that I have raised previ29660 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 August 2001 sponse by that agency to some of the allegations that were made, and provide the evidence that counteracts that response. I will give a brief overview. Ridgewell Pty Ltd entered into a contract with Asset Services for remedial works to the Junior Sailors Galley Cafeteria building at HMAS Cerberus in November 1999. This company experienced continuous alteration to the scope of works by Asset Services, taking 12 months to clarify the matter. This delayed the completion of the works required. To compound this frustration, there was non-payment of delay costs by Asset Services to Ridgewell, totalling $91,250. For raising this issue, all they received was victimisation and intimidation of Ridgewell staff by Asset Services. There were threats from Asset Services senior managers to prevent Ridgewell from being awarded future contracts for services if Ridgewell pursued claims for delay costs. There was a request by Asset Services for Mr Ashman, the director of the company, to sign a blank contract to cover up previous mismanagement by the head contractor and the Defence Estate Organisation. There was a request for Ridgewell’s director to sign a new novated contract with the Defence Estate Organisation, removing Asset Services as the head managing contractor, for a sign-on fee of $24,950. If he had done that, it would have resulted in his committing fraud. I raised five specific issues with the minister: the claims of continuous alterations to the scope of works; the claims for delay costs; the behaviour of Asset Services staff; the threats against potential involvement in future projects; and the request to sign a blank short form contract. In terms of the minister’s response to the first allegation regarding the scope of the work, the response I received was as follows: The scope of work entered into by Ridgewell matched the Defence works brief to SSL Asset Services in respect of the remedial works to the Junior Sailors Galley. In response to that, it can be stated that no tiling work-which represented $156,696 out of the $256,696 contract-was included in the original scope of works. So, basically, over half the cost of the work was not included in the original contract. The contract was awarded in November 1999 verbally, with no contracts available. Suddenly, after the contract was awarded, the tiling of the galley was included and all other works were put on hold so that the tiling could be carried out during the December shutdown period. Specifically, Mr Swarris of Asset Services told Mr Ashman to forget the rest of the works for the moment, and that the contract and revised scope of works would be forthcoming. Of course, Mr Ashman, the director of the company, had to wait for exactly 365 days for the revised scope of works and the contract. Mr Tony Sullivan, state manager of Asset Services, also told Mr Ashman to put all other works on hold in the contract so that the tiling could be completed. This was done in February 2000. It is about time that the Defence Estate Organisation became involved in this matter. With respect to the issue of the claim for delay costs, the minister responded as follows: SSL Asset Services have advised Infrastructure Division that the claim for delay costs was rejected as there was no contractual or other entitlement for Ridgewell to be paid these costs. Ridgewell was not instructed to suspend works and had access to the site for the entire period of the contract. In response to that, I have a copy of the minutes of a meeting where Mr Tony Sullivan instructed that the galley contract be placed on hold until further instruction. In terms of the issue of the behaviour of Asset Services staff, the minister’s response indicates that there was a high degree of professionalism and that, effectively, there was not any degree of intimidation relating to this matter. I have minutes of discussions which read as follows: Mid-January 2000: received a phone call from an officer of the department who again threatened ‘we will ban Ridgewell from any further contracts for Defence’ if I kept on pursuing the following ... I could go on but, unfortunately, time constraints prevent me from doing so. In terms of the further persecution of this individual, the company has been asked to remove its sheds and equipment from the contract base, even though it is telling the minister that they have not actually done that. The minister must undertake an inquiry into this organisation. This organisaThursday, 9 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29661 tion continues to mislead and defraud the taxpayers of Australia. I will keep raising the matter in this place until the minister undertakes a proper inquiry into the conduct of this organisation. Central Coast Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol, Central Coast Division. Thursday, 26 July unfortunately dawned very cold, windy and wet, but nothing could dampen the spirits of the members of the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol on that day because it was the day that they were going to launch their new rescue vessel, the Spirit of Federation. It was the culmination of many years of fundraising and hard work on behalf of the volunteers to ensure that they had a vessel that suited the area and was able to perform the rescues that needed to be undertaken on a regular basis throughout the Brisbane Waters area of the Central Coast and out to sea. I am very pleased that, under the Federation grants that were allocated to each federal electorate, the local committee that looked at these projects decided that this was a worthy project to be awarded $20,000 from the federal government. That $20,000 culminated in this vessel being put on the water and functioning as a rescue vessel. The Gosford City Council and the North Sydney Rugby League Club contributed to the fundraising. The general community also put in to raise the total amount of money needed for this vessel. On that day I had the honour, as the patron of the Central Coast coastal patrol, along with my wife, Kerry, to launch and name the vessel the Spirit of Federation. It was a great honour for both of us. It was an enjoyable day despite the weather-and, as I said, nothing could dampen the spirits of the coastal patrol members. On that day I also had the honour of presenting the National Medal to a number of members. The National Medal was awarded by the Governor General, on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, to persons who have provided service to the Australian community in organisations that protect life and property at some risk to their members. Obviously, all of the royal volunteer coastal patrols in Australia fit into that category. I was able to present the National Medal to Mr Stanley Oakes, Mr Jack James and Mr Robert Craig. Also on that day other members of the Central Coast coastal patrol division received National Medals: Joy and Norm Smith and Daryl Ross-Sampson. In addition, three people who were not from the Central Coast but who came on that day received the National Medal: Commanding Officer John Nicholos; Chairman of the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol Council, Commodore Keith Jenkins; and the Chief Officer of National Medals for the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol, Commodore Michael Stringer. I would like to pass on my congratulations to the commander of the Central Coast division of the royal coastal patrol, John Weeden, for the tireless efforts that he and all his members put into raising the money needed to provide this essential rescue vessel for the coastal patrol. I am sure that this vessel will save many thousands of dollars worth of property and, more importantly, it will save lives, particularly those of the recreational boaties who enjoy the Central Coast. It is appropriate that I mention this on a day when this chamber has passed the International Maritime Convention Legislation Amendment Bill. I listened to the speakers opposite on that bill. As the parliamentary secretary mentioned, you would think that the speakers opposite were the only people concerned about the maritime industry and the people who work in it. I am the patron of the coastal patrol because I spent 10 years in the maritime industry. The last vessel of which I was first mate and captain was 224 feet and had a crew of 28 young people, whom I was instrumental in training. Many of those people are still in the maritime industry. Most of them had no experience when they first came on board the vessel. We put them through their pre-sea courses and their coxswain courses. Many of those people now have",113,Adjournment

I have a master class 4 ticket. As was mentioned earlier, I was a member of the Firemen and Deckhands Union and a member of the Merchant Services Guild. Members on this side, members of the government, do understand how important the safety of the marine industry is and how important the workers in the marine industry are. We fully support safety in the marine industry. (Time expired) Roads: Calder Highway ment’s apparent plans to pull out of funding the duplication of the Calder Highway in central Victoria and to siphon off the Calder’s funds to the Scoresby freeway in Melbourne. The scrapping of federal funds for the Calder after the completion of the forthcoming Carlsruhe section will leave 56 kilometres unduplicated, which represents nearly 40 per cent of the length of the Calder Highway between Bendigo and Melbourne. Bendigo retains today the dubious status it had when this Prime Minister came to office: the only major provincial city in Victoria not connected to Melbourne by a high-standard duplicated highway. In this year of the centenary of Federation, the Prime Minister is stripping the Calder Highway of the 50 per cent federal funding he guaranteed it in 1996 when he proudly proclaimed it a road of national importance. I am disappointed at the answer I recently received from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to my questions on notice, and his subsequent comments. His answer and later comments confirmed that the federal government intends to cut and run from the Calder Highway after the Carlsruhe upgrade. The federal government plans to pull out after paying up only $100 million, less than 20 per cent of the estimated $600 million total cost of the entire project-and only one-third of the $300 million share it contracted to pay under the RONI pledge. The Howard government blocked the Carlsruhe upgrade last year and had to be dragged by the neck in May this year into committing its $25 million share of the cost. Not only has it refused to back the Bracks state government’s 2006 deadline for completing the duplication, but it will not commit to funding any Calder project after Carlsruhe. That means that it will crash the major roadworks that are needed between Kyneton and Bendigo. This includes reneging on the $70 million federal funding needed for the Kyneton to Faraday section and the $95 million needed for the Faraday to Ravenswood section. Only weeks before the Aston by-election, this desperate government suddenly found $220 million for the Scoresby freeway in Melbourne. Only weeks after the by-election, this tricky Prime Minister has been caught out as pulling $200 million out of the Calder’s funds. Last year, the federal government claimed in its budget that it aimed to achieve only a ‘substantial completion’ of the Calder upgrade by 2006. This year the budget language worsened. It now promised that the government was ‘working towards a strategy’ that ‘eventually envisages’ completion-a Yes Minister answer for sure. In fact, the government strategy is now a ‘never, ever’ strategy. The transport minister, in his reply to my recent questions, unloaded the government’s RONI responsibilities by claiming that the Calder is only a state arterial road. In fact, the then transport minister, Mr Sharp, officially declared it a national arterial road when he proclaimed it a RONI in 1996. The present minister, in his answer to my question, said: The deadline to duplicate to Bendigo by 2006 was set by the Victorian Government without any consultation with the federal Government. In fact, that deadline was set by the former Liberal state government and agreed to by the Howard government. Mr Anderson also said: Given the Calder is a state road, the Victorian Government is free to commence all other necessary works to meet its set deadline.",115,Adjournment
291,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (10.55 A.m.),"I rise to express my disgust at the federal governThursday, 9 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29663 No clearer signal is needed of this government’s intention to abandon federal funding for the Calder after Carlsruhe. Mr Anderson has now again confirmed that he has no commitment to any project after the Carlsruhe project, because his press release in Bendigo yesterday stated: Nowhere in my answer-I repeat, nowhere-do I indicate that federal money for the upgrading of the highway as committed will not be forthcoming. I emphasise the words ‘as committed’ because all he is guaranteeing is funding for Carlsruhe, funding that was already allocated and announced in the budget. This is the only project he has committed to and is committed to-and even that project he really did not want to fund. The Calder Highway is Bendigo’s and central Victoria’s lifeline to Melbourne. It is vital for our region’s economic growth. It is an outrage to see it being so cynically downgraded, and it is vital that it be restored to the status that it demands. We have the Bracks state government completing the fast train links to Bendigo and Ballarat. It is doing its part to assist regional development in these places. The Bracks government is committed to funding the Calder in consultation with the Commonwealth government, but the Commonwealth government now wants to run away from those funding commitments. It is, therefore, retarding Bendigo’s ability to attract industries, to develop in regional development areas as we so desperately need to do. I urge the minister, the Prime Minister and the government to rethink the strategy and allocate the necessary funds to see this project completed and give Bendigo a fighting chance. Members of Parliament: Entitlements O’Malley, Mr Des announcement by the opposition-that the Leader of the Opposition will be funding that road if the opposition are fortunate enough to win government next. It will be interesting to see. Honourable member interjectingThe first one is probably a bit superfluous, because the point of my making these comments is not to run off and do a press release on them but more-heaven forbid-to stimulate a bit of discussion and debate in this place, which does not really happen; rather, we deliver prepared speeches. I want to make some comments on the Australian National Audit Office report into the entitlements of members. I fervently believe in the party system, and I think most people around here would probably believe the same. I believe that system is the best form of government for Australia, though I am well aware of its shortcomings. I am not telling anyone anything they do not know when I say that the public do not at the moment particularly like what they see. Sometimes it is because there are false impressions given by the media, but sometimes it is because MPs cannot be bothered to temper their behaviour and their activities-for example, during question time. As with any group in the work force, there are people on both sides who are decent, caring, hard working, altruistic individuals, and there are some that you would not feed. There is no doubt that some entitlements are used for party political purposes, and it is difficult to say where the line should be drawn, because most things we do are innately political. If we do not want to drive the public into the arms of independent and single interest groups with the inevitable political instability that follows-and we need look no further than Italy for examples of this-I believe that we need to make some changes. I do not believe that MPs are overpaid, though I have my doubts about the usefulness of some of the overseas travel. The attention given to the $300-odd million by the media ignores the fact that the vast majority of this figure is for running offices for the purpose of serving our constituents.",116,Adjournment

293,Mr Lawler,"I did not hear a commitment, no. I rise to speak on two unrelated issues.29664 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 August 2001 I believe the major parties would say behind closed doors that, if the guidelines were tightened, the other side would be advantaged. For example, the coalition would say that the unions’ contributions to the opposition’s coffers would allow them to do a lot more than the contributions we have received would. thousands of dollars given by the various unions. I think the most that he mentioned was the $680,000 given by the AMWU in just one year and the $653,000 given by the AWU. would say that the Greenfields Foundation would contribute significant amounts of money to the government side. I believe that a global budget for charter, post, printing et cetera, with no open-ended allowances, would go some way towards shutting down some of the activities of those who do abuse their privileges. I also believe that we need to encourage backbenchers who have a greater interest in people than in party machines to work towards the necessary changes; hence, I have made those comments. There is one other completely unrelated issue I want to touch on. Last Friday was the last day of a long serving school principal in my electorate: Mr Des O’Malley, who has just retired from the South Dubbo Public School, a primary school in my electorate. In the several visits I have made to the South Dubbo Public School, I could not help but notice the enthusiasm of the teachers, the enthusiasm and happiness of the kids, the presentation of the school and the way the buildings were maintained, and, as with any organisation, much of the credit has to be shared at home with those at the top. Des O’Malley has served for 41 years of continuous teaching. In 41 years, I understand he has had only six sick days. The man is one of the most outstanding primary school teachers I have ever seen, and probably one of the most outstanding individuals I have ever seen. If the comments that his ex-students and fellow teachers make about him are any indication, I think the community shares the high regard that I have for him. I wish Mr O’Malley well in his retirement. He has overseen a lot of changes in his school. He is very forward thinking; in fact, in the words of the Daily Liberal, which is the newspaper in my electorate: He was always a modern thinker, open and ready to take on new ideas. Environmental Information Systems for Parkes in trying to engender the debate that really is required as a result of the Audit Office report. In saying that, I also have had the pleasure to follow him on just a couple of occasions here. I can remember a speech early in his career when he said that one of the disappointing features he felt about the parliamentary process was that there were too many set speeches and there was not enough interaction, discussion and debate about matters. I, for one-and I hope this does not sound too patronising-am disappointed that he will not offer himself as an alternative candidate at the Parkes election. My party allegiances mean that I would not have been able wish him all the best if he had, but I think that his short career here in this place has been very worthwhile and I wish him all the best in the future. TodayI wish to briefly speak about environmental information systems. There is not enough discussion about the type of information that we have available to make sound decisions on matters to do with the environment. We receive briefings from the Australian Greenhouse Office that paraphrase the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is a group of some 2,500 scientists around the world. These briefings indicate such things as the snow cover worldwide has decreased by 10 per cent since the 1960s and the global average sea level has risen between 0.1 and 0.2 of a metre over the past century. The projections are",117,Adjournment

298,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (11.05 A.m.),"First of all, I congratulate the honourable memberThursday, 9 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29665 that, if there could be a 1.4 to 5.8 increase in world temperature, the sea level would rise between 0.09 and 0.88 by the year 2100. These sorts of figures have great impact. Whilst there is some uncertainty about the exact figures, there is enough precision to know that we have to really take them seriously. We have such documents as the Australian Dry Lands Salinity Assessment 2000 which indicates that some 7.5 million hectares is at risk or affected by dry land salinity in Australia and in the next 50 years the figure at high risk will treble to 17 million hectares. The report goes to say that there are some 200 rural towns where the salinity is affecting infrastructure. These are the types of problems for which we really have to have the base information that we can make sound decisions upon. In the past I have championed the idea of the state of environment reporting. I was introduced to that by the Canadian document of 1991. As you can see, these are heavy tomes. In 1996 we had the Australian version. This is a very thorough document, but one has to wonder, first, in the last five years has it been used and, second, therefore, is it useful? For academics it may be. I have found it very interesting but I have scientific training. Is it the type of information that is required by the public to be involved and by government to be able to involve the public in the decisions? In the Canadian context, after producing two state of the environment reports, as part of budgetary constraints they withdrew the funding of the state of environment reporting. That was just a simple economic decision. Now they are revisiting it and looking at the way that they can put in place what they describe as a Canadian information system for the environment. Their minister has put in place a task force on Canadian information systems for the environment. This task force produced an interim report earlier this year and in their autumn-our spring-will produce the final report. Basically this task force was asked to recommend ways in which these information systems could be put in place that achieved three things: first of all, to provide information that was necessary to make the robust decisions to achieve sustainable development systems within Canada; to provide information upon which the citizens of Canada could keep their government accountable in this area; and to enable the community itself as a civil society to make informed decisions. The honourable member for Page is in the Main Committee at the moment. He, as the chair of the House of Representatives environment committee, knows that one of our frustrations when doing inquiries is the simple lack of reliable base data that is at a national level on which we can make the decisions that see us go forward. I am going to return to this debate about the need for environmental information systems. I hope that a government of whatever hue will pick it up, because it is really the required base information that is needed to make proper environmental policies for the future. (Time expired) Moreton Electorate: Wellers Hill State School schools in the federal electorate of Moreton. Some of them are very old, and some of them are quite recent. Amongst the old schools is Wellers Hill State School which this year is celebrating its 75th anniversary. It was back in 1917 that residents in the Sandy Creek area wrote to the Department of Public Instruction outlining a need for a school in this particular area, but it was not until March 1926 that the Lieutenant Governor of Queensland, with the advice of the Executive Council, approved that the school be established at Weiller’s Hill, via Annerley, Ipswich Road, Brisbane. In fact, Mr Francis Watt was transferred from Mapleton State School to take up duties as head teacher on 31 March 1926, with the school opening on 6 April that year. The school has served the community extremely well. In a couple of weeks time it will undertake the Third Harmonies on the Hill occasion which brings the local community and various schools together, including of course students from what is now known as Wellers Hill State School, for a very pleasant afternoon. I certainly encourage anybody who might be in Brisbane at that time to visit this historic school and to enjoy the day’s events.",118,Adjournment
299,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (11.10 A.m.),"I am honoured to represent a number of fine29666 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 August 2001 Looking back over the 75-year history of Wellers Hill State School, it is interesting to note some of the changes and some of the events that the school and the students have witnessed. In March 1928 the school closed to celebrate the arrival of Bert Hinkler into Brisbane. A halfday holiday was granted when Amy Johnson visited Brisbane in May 1930. The school already had its motto by that time: ‘Strive to succeed’. The school used to have Brisbane City Council sanitary pans collected from the school. The collection was decreased from five to four when a urinal pit was dug for the boys. These are the highlights of the school’s history; they are quite interesting to look back on. On 12 May 1937 there was a holiday for King George VI’s coronation. There was a holiday in March 1941 for the American Fleet visiting the Port of Brisbane. In 1942 the school played a very important role in my electorate because, during the Second World War, children from Junction Park State School, another historic school-in fact so old my grandfather attended it at the turn of the last century-and from Yeronga State School-which is about 130 years old, and other family members of mine attended that school-were sent to Weiller’s Hill, as it was known in those days, when their schools were closed because of the Second World War. Weiller’s Hill was considered safe because of its remote location hidden in the bush, and relief workers dug an air raid shelter. As well, there were half-day holidays granted in 1943 and 1944 to watch the march pasts of the 9th and 7th divisions respectively. There was a holiday on 9 May 1945 for VE Day. For the visit of the Duke of Gloucester they cracked another holiday. And from 20 to 22 August there were holidays for the peace celebrations in 1945. It is interesting to note that the school officially changed its name to Wellers Hill State School, although some lobbying had taken place for the name of Tarragindi State School. The school committee preferred the name of Wellers Hill because it conformed to the Surveyor General’s decision in May 1942 to change the suburban area name from Weiller’s to Wellers-heaven knows what the Weiller family thought about that at the time. It is interesting to note that this school is working hard to overcome the fact that, though it has a clean environment, even as students from the school itself say, it is a very old school and the buildings in the school need lots of work and attention. That it is not perhaps getting the support it needs from the state government with regard to maintenance is a shame in their 75th year. But the school is looking forward to the construction of a new multipurpose shed: it is just about complete. The school has two wonderful choirs, the junior and senior choirs. In fact, when the students wrote to me late last year inviting me to be part of the celebrations of their 75th year, they stated quite proudly that they are the best kids in Australia. I have to say, having visited the school on many occasions-most recently handing out Centenary of Federation medallions directly to school children-they are a very well-behaved group of students. They also have a tremendous respect and understanding for older people in the community. Their ANZAC Day ceremony this year, following on a great tradition, featured a visit from the Queensland Governor, Major General Peter Arnison. All in all, this school has a great sense of history and a great sense of commitment to the future. I congratulate the teachers and the staff headed by John Webster, the principal, on all they do in fashioning a fine set of citizens for tomorrow. Main Committee adjourned at 11.15 a.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Human Rights: Sterilisation Procedures (Question No. 2539) (1) Has the Government’s attention been drawn to a report commissioned by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission titled “The Sterilisation of Girls and Young Women: Issues and Progress”. (2) What steps will the Government take in respect of the recommendations of the report to (a) review the Medicare Benefit Schedule to require Medicare claims for sterilisation procedures for minors under 18 to be accompanied by either a formal authority or full clinical notes on the need for the procedure and (b) place the issue of how to best achieve a non-adversarial and inexpensive formal approval process on the agenda of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. (1) The Government is aware of this report which was commissioned by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and released on 24 April 2001. As I noted in my media release on 26 April, illegal sterilisation is an extremely serious matter which constitutes a violation of the human rights of any girl or woman who has been subject to it. (2) (a)I am advised that consultations are currently underway between officers of my Department and the Department of Health and Aged Care, with a view to providing advice to the Government on this matter. The Schedule was amended in November 1998 to ensure that doctors are aware of the requirement that any sterilisation of a minor be appropriately authorised. (2) (b) The regulation of sterilisation procedures for children has previously been on the agenda of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General but there were no useful outcomes after some years of deliberation. I have written to State and Territory Attorneys-General alerting them to the recent report and foreshadowing that I may seek to raise this issue at the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General again in the future. I am advised that the Report was discussed at, and copies of the report were provided to, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General Human Rights Working Party on 8 June 2001. Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Question No. 2631) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 5 June 2001: (1) What measures does the Government intend to introduce to extend the so-called +2% requirement for the replacement of fossil fuels in electricity generation by 2010. (2) Will the Government introduce a +10% requirement for 2020 and will there be further requirements for +20% in 2030 and so on. (3) Will the Government establish a substantial R&D fund for the exploitation of renewable energy: if so, what is the intended scale of such a scheme. (4) Is it a fact that Australia’s emissions of carbon dioxide amount to approximately 15% of the world total when fossil fuel exports are included. (5) When will the Government abandon its opposition to controls on greenhouse gas emissions and recognise that Australia can make a significant impact acting unilaterally. (6) What is the energy efficiency of electric railways in kilowatt-hours per tonne kilometre, if regenerative braking is taken into account and how does this compare with road transport for equivalent journeys. (7) Is it a fact, as reported by the Transport Minister in the debate on the Diesel and Alternative Fuel Grants Scheme Bill 1999, that the Bureau of Transport Economics has estimated that fuel-use by transport will increase by more than 50% by 2015. (8) Is it a fact that the fastest growing source of carbon dioxide pollution is road transport.",119,Adjournment
300,Mr Mcclelland Asked The Attorney,"General, on notice, on 22 May 2001:",121,Questions On Notice
301,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(9) What measures will the Government adopt to ensure that the projected growth in transport fuel consumption does not occur. (10) Given the higher efficiency of electric hauled rail transport, what measures will the Government adopt to ensure that the anticipated growth in transport demand is taken up by the railways. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000, which came into force on 1 April 2001, requires that an independent review of the operation of the Act be undertaken as soon as possible after 1 April 2003. The review is to include consideration of the overall target and interim targets. (2) Same answer as for (1) above. (3) Substantial R&D support that is accessible by the renewable energy sector already exists. An example is the R&D Start program, which is administered by the Industry Research and Development (IR&D) Board. This merit-based program is available to Australian companies, and is designed to assist Australian industry to undertake R&D and commercialisation through a range of grants and loans. It is expected that financial assistance of approximately $180 million per annum will be offered for new projects under the program each year up to June 2006. Another example of support is the Australian Co-operative Research Centre for Renewable Energy (ACRE) based in Perth, which was established by the Australian Government to facilitate the development and commercialisation of renewable energy and related greenhouse gas abatement technologies. (4) Australia’s share of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion is around 1.4 per cent of total world carbon dioxide emissions. This figure does not include other greenhouse gases such as methane or nitrous oxide (not all countries report these gases). Australia is a significant net exporter of energy. Carbon dioxide from combustion of Australia’s fossil fuel exports contribute around 2.1% of total world carbon dioxide emissions. (5) The Government is taking significant action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Australian Greenhouse Office estimate that existing abatement measures will reduce business as usual emissions of greenhouse gases in Australia in 2010 by 57.5 Mt carbon dioxide equivalent. (6) Regenerative braking is used in a number of electric rail systems including the Melbourne tramways/light rail system, and some coal haulage operations in Queensland. To date no definitive analysis has been undertaken of the increased efficiency of these systems. However rail can be more energy efficient than road for some transport tasks eg long distance heavy freight. The Bureau of Transport Economics estimates that on average, rail produces one third of the carbon dioxide emissions of road freight per tonne kilometre. (7) Yes, the Bureau of Transport Economics predicts that business as usual projections for energy use by road transport between 1990 and 2015, will increase by around 50%. (8) Transport is the second fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions having risen by 20.3% over 1990 figures. However indicators for transport include that total emissions per passenger kilometre travelled were 1.7% lower in 1995 (the latest year for which there is data) than in 1990, and emissions from freight operations were 2.7% lower per tonne kilometre for the same period. (9) The Government has introduced a range of initiatives, to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector as outlined in the Prime Minister’s statement: Safeguarding the Future announced in 1997 and Measures for a Better Environment in 1999. Key elements: Negotiate with the automotive industry to achieve a 15% improvement over business as usual to the national Average Fuel Consumption (NAFC) target by 2010; Introduction of the fuel consumption label, as of 1 January 2001; Introduction of fuel efficiency targets for Government fleets by 2003; Improved fuel quality standards; The $75 million Alternative Fuel Conversion program that is aimed at encouraging the greater use of alternative fuels with lower greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy produced. The Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program (GGAP) will also assist Australia reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The objective of GGAP is to reduce Australia’s net greenhouse gas emissions",121,Questions On Notice
302,Mr Truss,"The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following anby supporting activities that are likely to result in substantial emission reductions or substantial sink enhancement, particularly in the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol (20082012). $400 million has been allocated to the Program between 2000-01 to 2003-04. On a per capita basis, Australian Government expenditure on greenhouse gas reduction measures exceeds almost all other nations. (10) The Commonwealth last year committed $250 million over four years to upgrading interstate rail infrastructure. Among other things, this will support work to evaluate the market share impacts of achieving network performance targets agreed by Commonwealth and State Transport Ministers and evaluate corridor performance required to enable rail to gain a higher share of the interstate freight task. However, responsibility for transport planning, other rail infrastructure proposals, and the development of new rail services are the responsibility of State governments and the private sector. As part of the National Greenhouse Strategy Measure 5.14, the Commonwealth together with the States and Territories has commissioned a study on options to reduce freight emissions. This will test the scope for efficiency and modal shift to achieve emissions reductions. Specific policy measures will be modelled for estimates of emissions effects under this study. It is expected to be completed by the end of 2001. Sri Lanka: Ambassador to Australia (Question No. 2737) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 21 June 2001: (1) Did he receive a letter dated 8 May 2001 from Dr Brian Senewiratne expressing his concerns with the recent appointment of Major-General Janaka Perera as Sri Lankas Ambassador to Australia. (2) Is he aware that Dr Senewiratne is of Sri Lankan decent and from the Sinhalese Community (3) Can he confirm that Dr Senewiratne has expressed the view in his letter to him of 8 May 2001 that Major-General Janaka Perera has about the worse record of human rights violations of any army officer in the Sri Lankan Armed Forces in the two decades that Dr Senewiratne has monitored the human rights situation in Sri Lanka. (4) Has he seen a media release of 17 June 2001 from Amnesty International Australia expressing its concerns with the appointment of Major-General Perera as Sri Lankan Ambassador to Australia. (5) Has he seen a media release of 15 June 2001 from the Australasian Federation of Tamil Associations Inc. expressing distress with the appointment of Major-General Perera as Sri Lanka’s Ambassador to Australia. (6) What advice did he receive of the suitability of Major-General Perera to be the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Australia and who provided that advice. (7) Did he receive any advice independent of the Sri Lankan Government on the suitability of Major General Perera to be Sri Lankan Ambassador to Australia; if not, why not. (8) Does the Australian Government have the right to reject Major-General Perera’s appointment as Sri Lankas Ambassador to Australia; if so, in what circumstances can it reject such an appointment. (9) Will he review the appointment of Major-General Perera as Sri Lanka’s Ambassador to Australia; if not, why not. (1) Yes. Dr Senewiratne also spoke at length with officers of my Department on 7 May 2001 outlining his position with respect to the appointment. (2) Yes. (3) Dr Senewiratne expressed such a view. (4) No. However, Amnesty International set out their concerns in a letter to me of 2 May 2001. (5) Yes.

Attached are the curricula vitae of these individuals. (2) States do not have a role in nominating candidates for election to the International Court of Justice. Article4 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice provides that candidates are nominated for election to the Court by the National Groups of Arbitrators for the Permanent Court of Arbitration. Attached is a list of the names and nationalities of the candidates nominated and the National Group which nominated them.

Australian Defence Force: Cadets (Question No. 2777) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 28 June 2001: (1) What amount of the additional funding for the Defence Force Cadets announced in the Defence White Paper is earmarked for (a) changes to command and management arrangements, (b) the provision of information technology support and (c) the pilot indigenous project. (2) For (a) navy cadets, (b) army cadets and (c) air force cadets, what is the average amount of annual Commonwealth financial assistance per cadet for (i) uniforms, (ii) staff salary costs, (iii) annual camp, (iv) unit running costs, (v) regional and national overheads, (vi) federal police checks, (vii) unit accommodation, (viii) staff training and (ix) other assistance, if any. (3) As a result of the White Paper has there been any change in the level of Commonwealth financial support to individual cadet units in respect of the items referred to in part (2); if so, what are the details. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) (a) $1.3 million, of which $0.6 million is for existing staff (b) $2.03 million (c) $0.845 million. (2) (a) (b) and (c)To date, the range of Cadets costs have not been discretely itemised within Defence accounts. The Cadets: The Future Review report estimated the financial, resource and in-kind support for the ADF Cadets to be $24 million. That amount was accepted by Defence as the baseline for the operating and resource costs for the ADF Cadets, to which an additional $6 million was allocated in the 2001 Budget. (3) Defence sponsorship is delivered mainly through resource support rather than direct financial grants to individual cadet units. The Government’s wide-ranging enhancement program, to be implemented over three years, will result in a more cohesive framework and support base for the ADF Cadets. The impact of the enhancement program on individual cadet units cannot be quantified at present.
