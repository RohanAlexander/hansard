The Chief Electoral Officer shall forthwith, after he has determined the number of Members of the House of Representatives to be chosen in the several States in accordance with this Act, make and forward to the Minister a certificate setting forth the number of Members of the House of Representatives to be chosen in the several States. -I move That the Senate's amendment be amended by inserting in lieu of the .word ""certificate"" the word "" notification,"" and agreed to. I wish to make this amendment, because "" certificate '' has a technical meaning, and the ' use of the word in the proposed new clause may create confusion. When the Bill was going through Committee before, the Attorney-General and other members of the Government stated that its great merit was that the Executive would have nothing, to do with the determination of the number of members to represent any State. I pointed out that the Bill stopped short at the presentation of a certificate as to the population of each of the States, but was told by the Attorney-General, and the Minister of Home Affairs that the trouble which I foresaw would be cured in the Electoral Bill. has been left to the Senate to amend the Bill, so as to give full effect to the original intention of the Government which introduced it, and we should be much obliged to them for having rectified a matter which was overlooked by the Attorney-General, notwithstanding his keenness, and the great interest which he took in the drafting of the Bill. honourable member are admirable in themselves, but have no relevancy to the amendment of the Senate. Motion agreed to. That the resolutions be reported. Bill was first introduced I pointed out that it was wholly unnecessary to occupy our time with its consideration, because the Electoral Bill gives full power to the Government and Parliament to make redistributions of electoral divisions. I am sure that the Attorney-General, if the question were put to him, would have to admit the correctness of that view. clause 9 insert honourable and learned member on the point. crease our powers in any way, and has been introduced merely to delude the public that further legislation was necessary to give effect to the Electoral Act. I protest against the time of the House being occupied unnecessarily. not agree with the honourable and learned member for Werriwa. The Bill may not have been needed to provide for the redistribution of electoral divisions, but its introduction was necessary to allow a number of gentlemen, who some time ago opposed with might and main the proposals of the late Administration, stating that they would injure Victoria, to recant their utterances. Fortunately or unfortunately, I will not say which, the scene has been changed since their original statements were made, and, having accepted office, they have been forced to provide some means to escape from the difficulty which they themselves created. They knew full well that the last Administration proposed to take the right course, but, having stated that the course proposed would do injustice to Victoria, they found, on coming into power themselves, that they were forced to commit Apparently, however, it that so-called injustice by proposing a legal enactment. There is too much . hypocrisy about the utterances of some honourable members, and the House should set itself against the un-Federal attitude which was then taken up. pleased to be able to express my gratitude to the Senate for having proposedthese amendments. As the Bill left this House, the whole control was left in the hands of the Minister, but the Senate, in view of the extent to which the interests of certain States have been neglected, have made a very desirable amendment. They have, in fact, adopted the suggestion made by the honourable member for Parramatta, and rejected by the Attorney-General when the Bill was previously before us. He claimed that the measure was his own, and was complete, and apparently he thought that a gentleman of his legal training and experience would suffer a loss of dignity if he accepted a suggestion from a mere layman.

Question resolved in the affirmative. Reported that the Committee had agreed to the Senate's amendments, with amendments ; report adopted. That leave be given to bring in a B ill for an Act to amend the Immigration Restriction Act 1901. B ill presented and read a first time. External Affairs) I move That the Bill be now read a second, time. I am obliged to honourable members for having allowed the B ill to be advanced to this stage. The Immigration Restriction Act, No. 17 of 1901, covers two entirely distinct classes of immigrants. The first comprises those who are sought to be excluded because of differences of type and tendency, which render their assimilation with the people of our own race difficult, if not impossible. It was thought necessary in the earliest days of the Commonwealth to pass a measure for their exclusion. The Act does not on the face of it distinguish between the nations to which it is applied, and in only one or two portions of the measure does a word occur which even indicates that its administration is intended to be directed) to peoples such as those to whom I have referred, who are not members of the group of races which from colonizing Western Europe, have spread themselves over a large portion of immigrants dealt with are those under contract, who will presently be the subject of comment in. connection with another measure. WhatI am now asking honourable My point is that but for members to examine is a proposed amendment of the Act, which will apply particularly to those peoples to whom I have referred, some of whom are separated from us by a great gulf of inherited traditions, character and aims; and all of whom under administration come within the scope of the existing measure. Our control is exercised by means of the application of an education test, which is neither the most convenient form of exclusion nor that which is most readily appreciated elsewhere. It involves a certain amount of indirect action, although from the very first day that it was adopted until the present, time, it has been directly and consistently employed, and by this time its purpose is everywhere understood. When the education test was adopted as the least objectionable method of excluding those whom we felt bound to keep from cur shores, it was feared that the control exercised would be less efficient than if direct prohibition had been resorted to in regard to people described by race or colour. I think, however, that experience has shown that the apprehension was groundless. The annual returns, whichhave been laid upon the table, prove not only that a smaller number of coloured aliens are being admitted into the Commonwealth, but that year by year the number of departures of such people exceeds the number of arrivals. They also show that of those who do come here a considerable number are only nominally admitted, as in the case of the pearl shell fishers, in order that they may sign contracts which are fulfilled on the sea. In a similar manner, the greater number of the Chinese and others who figure in the returns as having entered the Commonwealth have been .previously domiciled here, or Have been in possession of State permits or other permits entitling them to admission. Consequently, the gross figures demonstrate that the number of coloured aliens within the Commonwealth is decreasing steadily, and is likely to decrease more rapidly year by year. Then, when judging the education test, which has been applied to only a limited extent, honourable members must remember that those recorded as hav-",13,Representatio N Bill

19,Motion (By Mr Deakin ) Agreed To,,14,Immigration Restriction Amendment Bill Second Reading
20,Mr Deakin (Ballarat,"Minister ofing failed to pass the test, and who have been refused admission to the Commonwealth, do not represent anything like the whole number of those who have been prevented from coming here by its operation. Those who come here and subject themselves to the test represent the few who have some hope of overcoming the difficulties presented by the Act. Probably thou^ sands were deterred by it from embarking for Australia. that the education test, as now applied, has proved efficient, and has enabled us to shut out from the Commonwealth those whom it was desired to exclude. Only a few individuals have succeeded in defeating it. This measure proposes to make a series of minor amendments, rendered necessary by the ingenuity of professional men, who have been able to discover particular means by which the intentions of the Act can be defeated. The first amendment is intended to make members of the police force of any State officers under the Act. Thisk necessary, 'because the Commonwealth officers are stationed on the sea-board, and when a prohibited immigrant manages to reach the interior an officer has to be despatched from the sea-board to apply the education test. The proposed amendment will enable aniy policemanwho may be on the spot to administer the test. to allow any member of the police force to act? the reason when we reach the Committee stage. under the Act to appoint policemen as officers for the purposes of the Act? have in reference to the police is that contained in section 14. We are there empowered to appoint particular police officers, but that involves a separate appointment in every case. What we seek is authority for any policeman to apply the education test provided under the Act. Under paragraph ta of sub-section 3 several legal difficulties have arisen in regard to the dictation, test. First of all, there is doubt as to whether the word ""passage"" does not imply that the test to which the immigrant is subjected shall conform to certain requirements. that the passage must contain only fifty words, and that the dictation of fifty-one or forty-nine'words invalidates the whole test. Then the use of the word "" European"" by implication draws a distinction between people to whom the test is intended to be applied, which so far as the administration of the Act is concerned, is quite unnecessary. ThisB ill is designed to repair slight omissions and to close small loopholes, which have been discovered in .the practical working of the Act. With exceptions to which I shall presently I am justified in stating allude, I might conclude, with these few words, my statement of the purposes of the measure. But, in addition, the fact cannot be overlooked that-howeve r silent the Act may be upon the point-it is intended to be applied to people of particular races. That provision must not be regarded as having been inserted in anv Pharisaic spirit, and must not be held to imply any assertion of superiority on our part. Probably every nation, every tribe -and even smaller gatherings-is satisfied that its country, its district, its village is the best in the world, and thati its members are better than anybody else, partly because they try themselves by their own standards. even to Ministries. in the case of Governments. People try themselves by their own standards, and, naturally, return a verdict which is favorable to themselves. But assertions of superiority are neither conveyed nor implied Yes . I 'shall explain in this B ill , which simply recognises the incontestable fact that, despite the unity of humanity, its diversity is more operative in H a v e we not power fact. The branches and families into which the human race is divided have followed different paths for ages. They have The only power we developed in. different directions to such an extent that it is now found that any attempt to suddenly blend their blood, unite them in institutions which are foreign to them-o r in politics or economic relationsleads to disruptions and disturbances of a serious kind.

Again., it is urged mode and to the fact of such blendings.

28,Mr Deakin,"I refer both to thewere grouped in one mass as if they were divided by no other than artificial distinctions which, by the mere alteration of systems of education, could be readiliy overcome. That idea is passing away, even in the British Empire, made up of many races, following many different systems of life, with widely divergent religious beliefs, who are able to unite for the purposes of maintaining and extending that Empire. Certain bounds have been drawn between its peoples to trespass which means not only peril, but undoubted loss. That' is the experience of modern times; it is the. experience of those Englishmen who have devoted their lives, to work in Asia and elsewhere amongst people foreign to ourselves, -whom half-a,-century ago we should have endeavoured to turn into Europeans by imitation on then existing, European patterns. We have since found that it is wiser to allow each people to develop along its own lines, by the perfecting of its own methods of civilization, than to endeavour to impose our methods upon them. They do best for themselves in their own countries. I say this because occasionally we find ourselves challenged from the pulpit and the lecture-room as setting up claims to superiority over other nations which no thoughtful man would prefer. As we cannot know how we ourselves look in the judgment of an-All-seeing Eye, we do not attempt to judge other peoples, but we recognise that racial ""and national differences are prominent features which we have to take into account in practical life. Nor are we selfishly exclusive in our laws"". Owing to the exceptional conditions prevailing in this Continent, and to the fact that the native races promise to become extinct, the first settlers of Australia have an opportunity which has existed nowhere else in the world, of endeavouring to gradually people our land with the descendants of white races capable of blending with advantage and relatively all of about the same grade of culture or possibilities of culture. That is what we generally refer to as the White Australia policy. This measure, instead of detracting in any way from that policy, aims at rendering the law more efficient in its enforcement. In formulating that policy and abiding by it, we are not called upon to cast, even by inference, any slur upon amy other people, to imply in them any special defects, or sugexcluding permanent settlers from among gest anything more' than a separateriess of character, aim, and tendency to which I have already alluded. It is an imperative Mr Deakin. necessity at the present time that, in pursuance of our great national ideal, we shall exclude the people of the East, of whom two races in particular possess claims upon our respect and admiration. Within the Empire, we have an empire-Hindustan some of whose rapes are amongst the most intellectual that the world has known. They rank amongst the intellectuals to-day, and enjoy many heritages comparable with those of most advanced peoples. A tribute to their accomplishments in literature and art is unnecessary. Their records are sufficient to merit admiration same origin as European people. Hindoo races are supposed to trace their ances.try back to distant seons, it being one with ours, although that theory is not so universally accepted as it used to be. making another misstatement. the inquiry whether all races had not originally a similar ancestry. That is immaterial for our purposes to-day. I wish only to safeguard those who support legislation of this character against the assumption that their action is derogatory to any people. The Hindoos as members of the same Empire are entitled to special consideration at our hands. Then there is the nation who have recently sprung into such prominence,"" attracting the admiration of the world for their ability and patriotism, by their achievements in arms, science, and industry. They are the allies of the Empire to which we belong. Before they won their recent successes many people, including myself, bore tribute to their standing and promise. Now the whole world realizes that it is confronted by a young and virile people, whose possibilities cannot be gauged, although we know that they are of a very high order. It becomes us, .therefore, to see if, in regard to the excluded races generally, but particularly in regard to the two I have mentioned, we cannot, without altering the policy to which this country is pledged, amend the expression of our law and its administration. We can convey to them our appreciation of their qualities, and, while them, inflict no sense of offence. To this end we propose to omit the word ""European"" before the word ""language""",15,Immigration Restriction Amendment Bill Second Reading

52,Mr Deakin,"T h a t has nothing to doBill provides not for an alteration of the policy of a White Australia, but for a change in the method of administration. Surely if the Government of India, by agreement with the Government of the Commonwealth, prevented natives from emigrating to Australia that would be just as satisfactory to the supporters of the principle of a White' Australia as. would be our preventing their landing here when they came. We hope to make arrangements of that kind. we have done in other measures, that such agreements shall not come into operation until approved by resolution of the House? shall be happy to consider anv suggestion in the direction indicated. Sub-clause 3 of clause 4A is explicit as to its termination. It provides thatAny such notice shall cease to have effect upon the Minister notifying, by notice in the Gazette, adjourned. that it is cancelled. Any arrangement made will be subject to that power. By way of illustration, I may point to the fact that we have at present an arrangement with the Governments of India and Japan that has proved satisfactory. When previously in office I had the honour to submit the original proposals to those Governments. Subsequently they were approved by the Government of which the honourable member for Bland was the leader, and final effect was given them by the late Administration. The arrangement in each case is to the effect that tourists, merchants, and others visiting Australia shall not be subjected to the education test; but shall be provided by their Governments with passports, _ the production of which will entitle them to pass freely through Australia. That system has been carried out up to the present time with entire satisfaction to all concerned. There were two cases in which it was thought that passports had been improperly obtained; but we have been able to satisfy ourselves that in one of these the person concerned landed in the Commonwealth prior to the introduction of the system. There is, therefore, only one case in which we have reason even to suppose that the passport system may have been abused. It is possible, by an extension of this system, to study the feelings of other visitors from these countries who desire to come here either for business or pleasure. There is no reason why similar arrangements should not be made with other countries. for an extension of the system? desirable, in order that arrangements of the kind described may be made formally with the approval of the Parliament. In the cases to which I have referred, we took action practically upon our own responsibility; but with the consent of the Parliament, we may be able to apply the system over a wider area. I do not wish at this stage to detain honourable members, but ask them in looking through the Bill to realize that it marks no change in the existing policy. On the contrary, with the exception of the clause making friendly arrangements possible, its provisions consist of those minor amendments which the application of the original Act to our extensive coastline has proved to be necessary for its economical and efficient administration. That leave be given to bring in a B ill for an Act relating to Immigrants under Contract to perform Manual Labour in the Commonwealth Bill presented, and read a first time. External Affairs) I move That the B ill be now read a second time. The purpose of this measure is, first of all, ( to remove the many misapprehensions that have clustered around the application of the contract.labour sections of the Immigration Restriction Act. The present Act, as originally drawn, was to apply only to the general exclusion of coloured races. But, during its consideration in Committee, a new clause was inserted which was aimed at all races whether they could assimilate with ourselves without injury to our institutions and standards or not. Dealing with immigrants solely from the economic standpoint, it applied to people of our own race, and even to those of our own country, who might happen to be outside the Commonwealth. Consequently, the original provisions in relation to coloured peoples have affected British citizens who seek to enter the Commonwealth under contracts to perform manual labour. A great deal of misapprehension has thus occurred which ought to be removed.

Coloured labourers under contract would be subject to both measures. first of all be prohibited immigrants under the Immigration Restriction Act, but if they, were exempt they would still be subject to the conditions imposed by this Bill. For all thiat, this Bill is very unlikely to be applied to them. No circumstances Have arisen in Australia to lead to a proposal to introduce coloured labour under contract. This Bill, though applying to all persons coming here under,contract to perform manual labour, will really affect Europeans, and, so far as one can see, them only. lately taken steps to modify the strict law which they originally enacted, excluding all persons under contract. amendments, I believe, professional people and certain persons engaged in mental pursuits are admitted although under contract. by the original Act are largely evaded. the United States Act has been so amended as to bring it more into conformity with our own law on the subject, which deals with persons seeking to enter the Commonwealth! under contract only to perform manual labour. Judging by experience, there is no reason to suppose that either under the existing law, or the amending Bills now submitted, there is likely to be any considerable influx of contract labour into Australia. there are not many employers who desire to introduce labour under contract,, and that the number of men whom they wish so to introduce is very small. I doubt if, since the passing of the original Act, there have been more than a dozen applications, covering altogether two score contract labourers. There is ahvavs a possibility, however, that changed conditions, may lead to a. greater demand for contract labour. employers, arbitration laws will constitute "" changed conditions."" indeed, all other laws passed by the States, will remain unaffected by this measureNothing that can be done under it will add to or take away from the States control of all employees within their own. areas. are organized. fere with the existing, laws of the States.

The immigration for which we are most anxious, taking our experience as a guide, will be free immigration-not , to any noteworthy extent, immigration of persons under contract. InI dare say. But the great bulk of cases those who come here, like those who go to Canadai and South Africa, will be men whose desire in coming to a new land will be to obtain that which has been denied themin the crowded countries of the old world, men whose ambition it is to make some spot of land their own, to settle upon and to cultivate. The stream of immigration which we need, for which we hope, and which we ought to assist, is a stream It would appear that of men who do not wait for a contract or obligation. The immigrants who go to the United States and to Canada in thousands are immigrants of this kind, those who are under contract being, in comparison, a mere handful. does' not do what the Bill proposes to do: M i . DEAKIN -We will consider that matter when we come to it. Our circumstances are different, and necessarily the treatment may be so.

68,Mr Hutchison,"The American lawconsidered first in the light of the intention of the contract labour provision in the Immigration Restriction Act, to ascertain if it has been made with reference to industrial disputes here, to displace Australian workmen by imported labour. It is universally recognised, I believe, that this is a proper precaution to take, because it is felt that no settlement of an industrial dispute by such a method could be permanent, or would contribute to the prosperity of the community. Industrial disputes arising in connection with local .conditions should be settled in accordance with those conditions, instead of by the importation from abroad of men ignorant of them, or perhaps belonging to races allied to our own, who have not reached the same stage of industrial development. I think that honourable members generally agree that the importation of labour to take part in strikes should be prohibited, and it will continue to be prohibited. The first point to which consideration will be given in connection with any contract submitted will be whether it wiM affect any existing, or contemplated -industrial dispute. Sub-clause b aims at the same end. The intention is to prevent an irruption of contracted persons in such cases, and I believe that will be preventive that will be considered in connection with a contract is whether the remuneration, terms, and conditions of employment provided for are those which obtain in the place to which the contract labourer is to be sent. immigrants from being bound by misrepresentations. I believe the Bill to be sufficient for this purpose. fulfil the conditions which I have outlined, no more will be said. But, while every contract of any magnitude will, doubtless, be submitted beforehand, an compliance with the requirements of the measure, it has been thought necessary to make provision for other cases-practically the only ones with which we have so far had to deal-in which one, or two, or three men are brought unexpectedly to Australia under, agreement, because of their special proficiency in some particular trade or callin"". It is thought that there may be some oversight in regard to the submission of contracts covering theimmigration of such units,and it is provided that they will be void if those brought out under them land before the contracts have been approved by the Minister, unless he is satisfied that there was a good reason for not previously Mr Deakin. submitting them. Security must be given, and an opportunity allowed for the scrutinizing of the terms. If the Minister is satisfied that the omission to obtain his approval in advance was unimportant, and the transaction, bond fide, it will hold good. to declare the contract null and void, allowing the man imported under it to remain ? under such a contract might find that there was no place open to him.

When I am asked why the Commonwealth Government does not submit a proposal to foster immigration, I reply that whilst .this Parliament is in favour of such a policy, we feel that it can be carried out only when the people who come here can be settled upon the land of which we have vast areas idle, or provided with employment at their own trades and callings by the encouragement of the manufactures and the development of the resources of the country. Until we are able to offer immigrants employment either in the cities or in the country, what inducement can we give them to come here ? graduated land tax. troversial issues, but contend that if we inshall neither reap advantages in which its troduce immigrants at random, and merely throw them on the labour market, or upon the land-knowing , as we do, that in the latter case they will probably be kept waiting for six or twelve months, or even longer, before suitable holdings can be allotted to them we shall be guilty not only of cruelty to the immigrants, but of conduct which must result injuriously to Australia as a whole. What we need to do is to make opportunities for settlers. Then we shall attract a large proportion of enterprising people, whose operations will enable tis to still further augment our numbers. I do not share any alarm with regard to contract labour. As the honourable member for New England has remarked, it has its advantages. The man who knows that he has work to come to, and where it is, has a greater attraction than a man who has merely speculative yjrospects of employment. By the introduction of immigrants under contract, we ought to obtain excellent settlers, first because the employer will try to select good men, and secondly because others who would not otherwise be tempted to come would be inclined to throw in their lot with us if they could be assured of situations or homesteads. Moreover, contract immigrants would he introduced without expense to the State. Neither during my previous term of office, nor since I last assumed the position of head of the Government, have any overtures been made to me by any person desirous of bringing in any large number of contract immigrants for any purpose whatever. Still, it has been suggested that if the large fertile areas still unoccupied in Queensland and elsewhere are to be settled, it is quite possible that some contract proposals will have to be made with the object of introducing settlers and giving them a good start on land which those States rich in territory are both ready and anxious to offer. I can only say that proposals of that kind ought to be most sympathetically received. If we are satisfied that immigrants are able to take part in new developments of production, trade, commerce, or industry, it seems to me that they should be welcomed. We should give our fullest assistance to proposals of that kind. They are among, the means to which we must resort if we desire to make this really a White Australia. As I have said, over and over again, an empty Australia is not a White Australia. Until the Commonwealth is I desire to avoid conpeopled, and its resources are utilized, we present population are entitled to share, nor shall we see this country protected by settlers whose interests will be bound up with it, and who belong to our own race.

But I think I express the views, not only of representatives of my own State, but of those of other States, when I say that we did not contemplate a perpetual systenl of bounty being extended to white-grown sugar, as contrasted with sugar which is produced by black labour. it now. MrM c CAY point. In 1901 or 1902, when the first Sugar BountyB ill was submitted to this Parliament, many of us were led to believe that the payment of the present bounty for a period of five years, which will expire at the end of 1.906, would probably prove sufficient to accomplish the purpose for which it was granted. have been hasty in arriving at that conclusion, and we may not have paid sufficient attention to the warning of others. I am free to admit that in the light of -subsequent events, those who entertained the opinion to which I have referred, came to '3i hasty conclusion, and one which the present condition of affairs does not justify. MrR . EDWARDS wanted the bounty to extend over a period of ten years. MrM c CAY just possible that during the continuance of -the bounty the Queensland sugar-growers have not displayed that zealous desire to effect the change which we might fairly have expected from them, in view of the generous way in which they have been treated. But whatever the causes may be, I must confess that in order that the White Australia policy may be carried into effect, further reasonable assistance must be granted to the sugar industry, and, therefore, we are fully justified in advocating an extension of the bounty for some period, the duration of which may be determined in Committee. At the same time, I wish to point out that no State is making greater sacrifices in connection with this 'sugar question than is Victoria. In considering the interests of Australia, every honourable member is bound to recollect how any general policy affects that State with which he is most familiar. Victoria is undoubtedly a heavy loser, and will be a heavier loser in years to come, as the result of the operation of this policy, because her financial candle is being burnt at both ends. She is losing a large revenue upon sugar, and is also suffering by being obliged to contribute to the bounty. Notwithstanding that, I believe that the people of Victoria-especiall y since they are now enjoying a measure of prosperity to which, from the State Treasurer's point of view, they have been strangers for some yearsare prepared to continue to make reasonable sacrifices for the purpose of rendering Australia available for practically a white We do not contemplate population. But I do not think that the people of Victoria, or indeed of any other I 'am coming to that State, are willing to see the bounty continued indefinitely, nor do I consider that they should be asked to do so. It is in that connection that I desire to draw attention to the specific proposals of this measure, and to point out the extreme probability of our being requested in 1911 to continue the bounty for a further period. We may Within fifteen months of fhe termination of the bounty under the existing Act we have a proposal to extend it at its f u l l rate for a further term of five years. Although, nominally, a change is being made by increasing the bounty from £ 2 to ^ 3 per ton, the existing state of affairs will practically remain unaltered. The excise on white-grown sugar is to be increased by j £ i He a r , hear. I per ton, as against the import duty of £ 6 per ton, and as the bounty is also increased by £ 1 per ton, the disadvantages of growI am aware of that. It is ing sugar by black labour are to be increased, while the advantages of producing it by white labour are to remain practically untoucEed. We are told that the bounty must be continued in order to successfully carry out the substitution of white for coloured labour in the production of s.ugar in Australia. We are told, and rightly so, that the sudden disappearance of the bounty would inevitably check, to a large extent, the intentions of the Federal Parliament. I am very much afraid that if the B ill be passed in its present form we shall have the same statement put before us in 1910 or 1911.

I agree with it ; it accords not only with my views upon this particular question, but with the general principles I favour as regards the propriety of State assistance of industries by bonuses and protective duties. As aprotectionist, of course, I can have no scruples in supporting a bounty system.

MrM c CAY but some honourable members seem to think that the payment of the sugar bounty affects the fiscal question. To my mind, the bounty is paid merely to secure a White Australia. But it is the duty of Parliament to tell the growers of Queensland that the opportunity which we have provided for making a change from black to white labour cannot be continued for ever. There should be ample time in a period of ten or twelve years to make that change, and special inducements to make it cannot be continued indefinitely. The payment of the sugar bounty is no part of the protectionist policy of Australia. tectionist policy to induce the production of commodities by white labour? MrM c CAY , T h a t is a very important part of the Australian policy, but it is not part of the protectionist policy as. contrasted with the policy of the free-traders or revenue tariffists. Free-traders as well as protectionists can support the bounty. white grower of sugar is no greater than the protection given to the makers of hats and boots. MrM c CAY price for refined sugar varies at the present time, according to quality, from about 7s. i i d . to u s . pd. a cwt. MrM c CAY price, and not on the Australian price, that the duty is paid. Ten shillings per cwt. would be a fair average price to take, and when the bounty is added to the ,difference between the excise and tlie import duty, a protection of about 50 per cent, is given to the grower of sugar-cane, which is more than amv other Australian industry gets. by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. parison with other protected industries the sugar industry is very well treated. I do not make that remark In any grudging spirit, because I know that part of the assistance given to the sugar industry is given to it for the avowed purpose of encouraging the employment of white instead of black No bounty is paid to the labour. But we are entitled to sav that we do not intend to give this assistance for all time. The Minister in charge of the B ill has said that. The most effective way of I s not the white labour making our wishes known to the growers is to embody them in ah enactment"", and, therefore, I urge honourable members to It is the main reason; accept the sliding scale which I have suggested, so that the bounty will diminish until it finally comes to an end. appear automatically? MrM c CAY No ; that is another matter. . charged on sugar alone? MrM c CAY E x c is e is charged on stimulants, tobacco, and starch, and is a method of raising revenue chiefly from the consumption of luxuries. The difference between the excise and import duties is a matter to be dealt with in connection with I s it not part of the proa revision of the Tariff, and the protection to be given to the .industrv must be determined by the relation of those two duties. The excise duty is imposed for revenue purposes, and may: be regarded as justifiable or unjustifiable according to the point of view, but in itself does not affect the fiscal question. Unless Parliament provides for a sliding scale by which the bounty on sugar The protection given to the will ultimately disappear, we shall have a demand, five years hence, for the payment of the f u l l amount for another period of five years. But strongly as I desire to as I think that it is.

The method I propose is the least violent way of putting an end to it. I urge the representatives of Queensland to remember that' there has been no niggardliness on the part of the other States in regard to this matter hitherto; but we have a right to say that we shall not continue the bounty for ever. We cannot bind future Parliaments, but A good deal of it is taken we should indicate our intentions on the face of the B ill .

MrM c CAY the right honourable member for Balaclava in that I propose to extend the bounty in f u l l for four years, and on a sliding scale for a further four years; and it seems to me that that is a more favorable arrangement from the point of view of the grower, who claims that the f u l l bounty should be paid during the transition stage, when white is being substituted for black labour. If the representatives of Queensland prefer that the bounty shall be paid for two years'in f u l l , and for eight years on a sliding scale, I am perfectly willing to agree to that. It seemsi to me that the arrangement I propose will be more favorable to the growers^ although I must admit that the payment of the bounty for two years hi f u l l , and for eight years on a sliding scale, would be equivalent to five and a half years' f u l l bounty, whereas my proposal provides for only a five years' payment. learned member does not understand all the aspects of the question. MrM c CAY any question in all its aspects. AndI am. perfectly prepared to meet the representatives of Queensland, who have the most knowledge of the subject, if they prefer the plan proposed by the right honourable member for Balaclava. My point is that there ought to be a sliding scale, tapering off to nothing,, in order that f u l l notice mav be given of the termination of the bounty period. We cannot for ever make a distinction: between black and white labour. If we do we shall perpetuate a black Australia, instead of bringing about a White Australia. The only way of announcing to the Queensland planters that Queensland is not to have ami eternity within which to effect the change from black to white labour upon the sugar plantations is by informing them in some express manner that the special encouragement nf the emplovment of white labour is to last only for a reasonable time. If they fail to make the change, they cannot expect the Federal Parliament to continue to grant financial assistance. If we intend to insist upon the policy of a White Australia, we may have to adopt other measures. It is The right honourable memconceivable that a future Parliament: mayhold that tha attempt to bring about a White Australia has proved a. failure,, but I trust that the facts will never justify any such conclusion. The only way in which we I go further than did can bring about the results we. desire, without dislocating the industry, and causing a loud outcry from all those concerned,, is by adopting a sliding scale, which, according to my idea, should have a steep slope towards the end of the term rather than a gradual slope from the beginning. No difference of principle appears to me to exist between a sliding scale; providing for two years' f u l l payments, and eight years diminishing payments, and others providing for four years? f u l l payments and fouT years upon a sliding scale; or three years' f u l l payments and five years upon a sliding scale. But I think it. is desirable that the tapering period should be short, and .towards the latter end of the term. The question of the protection of the sugar industry can always be dealt with by adjusting the import and excise duties, and I shall always be prepared to give protection to that, as to any other industry. I am a protectionist, irrespective of the position in which I sit in this Chamber. But upon The honourable and this matter I speak quite apart from the fiscal issue. What we want to do now is tonotify the planters of Queensland that I do not understand we cannot go on assisting them for ever; if they will not take advantage of the extended term we offer them. dealing with this question, it is necessary to consider what has been, accomplished by means of the bounties. No one can read Dr. Maxwell's report without realizing that we have failed to bring about the substitution of white for black labour on the sugar plantations. Although, at first sight, 'it may appear, that there are some indications of success, the report, when carefully examined, discloses the fact that the reverse has been the case. We were told by the Minister of Trade and Customs that the number of white sugar, planters had increased..by 1,160. The greatest proportion of that increase is represented by the expansion of the area , under white-grown sugar in the southern and central districts, where there is a larger white population, and where the climatic conditions, are more favorable to the employment of white labour. There has been, an increase of only eighty-",29,Joseph Cook Cor N Duties Are Generally But To The Sugar Growers Of

I believe that white labour can be successfully employed to the south of Rockhampton. been an increase such as I have indicated in the number of employers of white labour, there has been no decrease in the number of black labourers employed. I find that in the southern district, the Kanakas employed number 128 more than they did two years ago. Altogether 2,424 Kanakas were engaged upon the southern plantations at the close of 1904, and in addition 750 other coloured aliens were engaged, making a total of 3,174 coloured labourers. That has occurred in the district where the conditions are claimed to be most favorable to the employment of white labour. only 2,807 Kanakas, but there are 3,977 other aliens, or a total of 6,784 coloured labourers. thirds of the sugar-cane grown in Queensland, whilst the southern district, in which' 3.174 coloured labourers are engaged, produce one-third; therefore, there is about the same proportion of black labour in the southern areas as in the northern fields. These figures seemto show that the bounty has entirely failed to accomplish its object. shows that the bounty does not represent the full difference between the cost of employing white and black labour. reason why it is proposed to increase the bounty. As one-third of the sugar output of Queensland is the product of white labour,, it is clear that in those districts where that class of labour is chiefly -employed there is exactly the same proportion of black labour as is to be found in other It is not so long ago that districts. planters get rid of the Kanakas? I did not contend am simply endeavouring to show that the My view is that in operation of the bounty has not had the effect of displacing the Kanaka. sugar produced by black and white labour in those districts the same asi it was before The greatest success has we enacted special legislation for the industry ? Yes , but not in the Maxwell's report, there are 128 more The success in the cenkanakas employed in the southern district to-day than there were two years ago. Of course, there has been a corresponding increase in the quantity of sugar produced. It is notable that, whilst there has that the Kanakas have not been displaced indicate that the planters cannot do without them? learn from D r . Maxwell's report, the bounty of £ 2 per ton has not accomplished its purpose. That officer practically makes that admission. The proposal to increase the bounty by £ 1 per ton is intended to expedite the abolition of Kanaka labour. The great advance in the production of sugar by white labour is practically confined to the densely populated parts of Queensland, where white labour can be easily obtained, and where the plantations In the northern areas, there are are chiefly being carried on by small men. In the central district, for example, small farms have always been the rule. A great These districts produce twomany of the plantations there were carried on by small farmers, even before the Sugar Bounty Act came into operation. On the other hand, the employment of black labour in the southern district is confined to the large plantations. Of course, if a vast difference is to be made between the excise payable upon sugar produced by white and that produced by black labour, it is possible that these plantations D r . Maxwell's report may be broken up into small farms, and in that wav the conditions that we desire to bring about may be established. Today there are 3,442 farmers or ""holders of No ; and that is the land in Queensland.

177,Mr Lonsdale,"S of ar as I can-points. Speaking of the proposed increase in the bounty payable upon white-grown sugar, he says it is possible that in the southern and central districts it may entirely do away with the employment of black labour. by releasing the black labour which is now employed in the southern district, a larger number of coloured men will be available to produce sugar in the northern district. That means that the White Australia policy will not succeed there. We have been repeatedly assured that white men can successfully labour in the cane-fields in the northern parts of Queensland. I should be pleased to know that that is so. If the statement be true, it confirms my conviction that we have no right to sanction the proposed bounty. The payment of a bounty can be justified only upon the ground that there are natural difficulties in the way of the employment of white labour which must be overcome. men to compete with Kanakas in doing field work. produce sugar successfully in the northern areas there is no justification for the payguided solely by a desire to do that which ment of a bounty. Personally, I think it is much better to admit that they have to encounter adverse climatic conditions which make it necessary for us to extend to them some assistance. The conditions that prevail upon the coast of Queensland are quite different from those which obtain on its table-lands. humidity of the atmosphere is very much greater than it is on the table-lands. It is the climatic conditions which obtain that less, be made to disprove this statement, militate against the employment of white labour in the cane-fields of the northern areas. To me it has always seemed that we should have acted more wisely, if instead of attempting to get rid of the Kanakas by means of legislation, we had allowed them to graduaillv die out. I am opposed to any legislation which has the effect of in£907,254. During the same period, 29,147 denting men from any place under conditions which practicallv amount to slavery. In my opinion it would' be in the interests of the men employed in the various other departments connected with the sugar industry if we allowed the growers in the north to employ Kanaka labour. would be a larger number of white men engaged in those districts if the Kanakas were permitted to do ""the field work. Seeing that the operation of ai bounty of £ 2 per ton upon sugar produced exclusively by white labour has not had the effect of getting rid of the Kanaka, I feel sure that the increased bounty now proposed will not achieve that end. In speaking upon the He declares that Budget, I pointed out that other industries are in full swing just at the period when the largest number of white workers is needed in the northern district. I then said that whilst white men could obtain employment in shearing, woolpressing, and other pastoral pursuits they would not think of working in Ihe cane-fields. One of the representatives of Queensland interjected that there was no such employment available. I did not intend to suggest that such employment could be found about Cairns or Bundaberg, but I knew that the further statement made by the honourable member in question that it would take the men months to travel from the sugar-growing to the pastoral districts was absurd. To set the matter at rest, I wrote to my son, inquiring how long it would take to journey from one district to the other, and received a reply that the distance could be covered in three or four days. It is necessary that, in dealing with this question, we should be is best in the interests of the community as a whole. My opinion is that we should have acted wisely had we allowed the employment of Kanakas on the cane-fields to continue. I come now to the question of cost. This attempt to set up unnatural conditions of employment for white men, Along the coast the and to abolish coloured labour tfn the canefields, has cost the community in one year nearly £1,100,000. An attempt will doubtand I therefore wish to make my meaning perfectly clear . If it can be shown that 4 my assertion is erroneous, I shall be glad to be corrected. In 1904-5, 151,209 tons of sugar were produced in Australia, and as a result of the import duty the cost of this to the community was increased by tons, of sugar were imported, and the duty on this amounted to £174,882, so that the total increased cost to the community was ,£1,082,136. Of that sum, all that went into the coffers of the Treasury by way of duty was £174,882, so that the local manuThere facturers of sugar received over £907,000 out of the pockets of the rest of the community. It is true that from that amount we have to deduct £453,627 in respect of the sum paid by way of excise duty, but",31,Joseph Cook Cor N Duties Are Generally But To The Sugar Growers Of

179,Mr Lonsdale,"If white men canby means of the sugar bounty we returned to them about .£121,000. Thus the net loss to the community for the year was nearly £600,000. assuming that all the sugar consumed last year was imported. the sugar consumed last year was imported or locally produced. My honourable friend knows very well that locally-grown sugar is not to be obtained at £ 6 per ton less than the price of the imported article. The local manufacturer reaps the benefit of the duty of £ 6 per ton, .and puts it in his own pocket. If all the sugar consumed in Australia were imported, the revenue derived from the import duty would go into the Treasury, but that is not the case. In view of these figures, it behoves the House to seriously consider whether the advantages 1 derived from this system are really commensurate with the cost. It is remarkable .that an attempt should be made in this way to help a few people at the expense of the great bulk of the community; but we fiind a tendency on) the part of many honourable members to move in that direction. As members' of a Parliament which controls the destinies of the people of the Commonwealth, we should have regard to the interests, not of the few, but of the whole community. I propose now to put before the House a few figures showing what we are gaining from this vast expenditure. a number of white men are engaged in the mills, and would be employed there irrespective of the payment of the bounty; but on the basis of Dr. Maxwell's report we are calling upon the people to pay something like £600,000 per annum, in order to benefit about 15,000 persons. right that such a system should be continued? Dr. Maxwell points out in his report that the cane produced .in the northern area is of greater value than is that grown in the southern or central areas of Queensland, the average price for the sugar-cane from the northern area being 17s., whilst that for sugar-cane grown in the central and southern districts is about 13s. 6d. and ios. 6d. per ton respectively. Taking 13s. 6d. per ton as a fair average, we find that the total value of the whole of the cane placed in the mills in 1904 was £895,716. To secure this result we have mulcted the people in a payment of about £600,000. member arrive at his estimate of value? report. comparison of the value of the cane, with the increased price due to the import duty, is not a fair one, inasmuch as the duty is paid, not upon the cane, but upon refined sugar. The difference in value must be recognised. of the value of the cane at the mills. The quantifies produced iby means of black and white labour in Queensland in 1904 were as follow:-Northern area, 947,105 tons; southern and central areas, 379,884 tons. This output, at 13s. 6d. per ton, was worth £895,716. My point is that, in order that the whole of this output may be produced by white labour, the people are being called upon to pay nearly £600,000 per annum in respect of duties on sugar. member's figures to be correct, the people paid nearly £600,000 in order to obtain a certain quantity of refined sugar at the end of the season. is in the hands of one company. I recognise the point which the honourable member desires to make, namely, that the value of the raw sugar is much lower than is the value of the refined article. I suppose I am aware that that, on the average, one ton of sugar is obtained from ten tons of cane; but. once the cane reaches the mill, no black labour is employed upon it. .sugar is about fifteen times that of the Is itcane product. learned member is losing sight of the fact that I am speaking of the tons of cane, and not the quantity of sugar produced. I wish the House to realize that, first of all, the bounty, in so far as it relates to the policy of a White Australia, has been an absolute failure. There are proportionately as many black men engaged in the production of sugar-cane in the so called"" white area of Queensland as are employed in the so-called black areas. produced by black labour has increased.",32,Joseph Cook Cor N Duties Are Generally But To The Sugar Growers Of

The result of Mr Chamberlain's denunciation, of the Sugar Convention has been to reduce the price of sugar in If it is unEuropean countries, and increase the price in Britain, and, as a consequence, to enable them to compete more effectively with English manufacturers in industries I heard such as the making of confectionery.

Protection is a .system, which feeds on itself.

We should not consider the special interests of special classes. However, I do not wish to prolong my remarks, because I desire to give the honourable and learned member for Werriwa a chance of speaking. If a division is called for, I shall vote against the continuance of the bounty, though that is not likely to be agreed to; and in Committee I shall certainly support the sliding scale proposal.

In Victoria they have had proI think, too, that if we vote for the continuance of the bounty for another five If we conyears, we shall at the end of that time be met with a demand for a further continuance, because I agree with the honourable member for New England that the history of bounties shows that those who benefit from them never cease to demand them, and make very little effort to carry on their businesswithout Government assistance. The bonus system is the least objectionable form of protection, but we know that those who have once received tbe benefit of a bonus are just as unwilling as are those who have derived the advantage of protection to give it up. It is for us to con, sider whether the bounty should be con? tinued for any lengthened term. I have come to the conclusion, after reading the report of D r . Maxwell, whom I regard as a thoroughly reliable authority, that the industry could not be carried on without the assistance of bounties; but I think the Government are making a mistake in proposing to grant an extension for five years beyond the term now provided for.

State is pledged to a policy of protection, and cannot say one word against its appli-^ cation to the sugar-growers. I think that the sugar bounties should be paid for an extended period, but the extension should be accompanied by an intimation that the bounties will be gradually diminished, until they cease. The best plan would be to adapt a sliding scale, extending over . a period of eight years, and providing for reductions at the rate of 1 2 per cent, per 1 annum. As the Minister of Trade and Customs has pointed out, we are rapidly approaching the time when we shall produce more sugar than we require for home consumption. When that stage is reached we shaJl be face to face with a very serious problem, because we shall have to export ( Sugar upon which the bounty will have been paid. WhilstI am perfectly prepared to do f u l l justice to Queensland and to the planters who have invested their millions .in the industry, we must consider the interests of the other States, and see that they do not pay too much for a White Australia. I believe that if a sliding scale such as I suggest were adopted, the planters would gradually become reconciled to the changed conditions, and we should have no further demands made upon us. The sugar-growers of New South Wales are not entitled to any consideration, because, but for the provisions of the Constitution, they would not have: received any bounty whatever. I trust that in Committee the B ill will be amended in the direction I have suggested. was first made for the pavment of bounties for the production of white-grown sugar in the Excise Tariff Act of 1902. In this age of Act provided for an excise duty of 3s. per cwt. upon manufactured sugar until the ist of January, 1907,-less-fro m the ist July, 1902a rebate to the grower of sugar-cane and beet; the rebate in the case of sugar-cane to be 4s. per ton on all sugar-cane delivered for manufacture, and' in the production of which sugar cane white labour only had been employed after 28th February, 1902. When that was done, it was pointed out that it would hardly be possible to provide for the bounties in that way, because under the Constitution they would have to be contributed to by all the States. ThereN o complaint has been fore, the Sugar Bounty Act, No. 4, of 1903, was passed, providing that a bounty should be paid at the rate of 4s. per ton on cane yielding 10 per cent, of sugar, the bounty being 'increased or reduced proportionately to the sugar contents of the cane. It was urged that owing to the policy we had adopted in regard to a White Australia, it was necessary to make some concession to the employers of white labour in the cane-fields. A t that time. I pointed out that the whole question, was misunderstood, and subsequent events have proved that the view I then took was the correct one. The import duty upon cane sugar was fixed at £ 6 per ton. I find that in 1902 we consumed 176,300 tons of sugar; in 1903, 182,600 tens; and in 1904, 180,300 tons; whilst it is estimated that our consumption for 1905 will amount to 187,000 tons. A duty of £ 6 upon these quantities would represent sums varying from ,£1,060,000 to £ 1 , 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 . For the purposes of my argument, I 'propose to assume that the average is £1,1.00,000. That is undoubtedly the amount of taxation contributed by the people of Australia, and the sum that ought to be paid into the Treasury. But, owing to the difference between the import and excise duties, the revenue received amounted in 1902 to £180,000; in 1903 to £ 7 9 0 , 0 0 0 ; and in 1904 to £ 6 2 8 , 0 0 0 ; whilst in 1905 it is expected to reach the sum of £607,000 .

262,Mr Ewing,"S i x hundred thousand tonslearned member's figures do not tally with those with which I have been supplied by my officers. numbers, but the figures which I am using were collected by that well-known statistician, Senator Pulsford, and verified by me. Pulsford one of the best statisticians in. the wcrld, and all who have taken the trouble to read his publications must admire the dispassionate way in which he is able to deal with figures, whether they tell for or against his argument, and his wonderful power of sound deductions from them. Roughly, the taxation on the 190,000 or 185,000 tons of sugar used in the Commonwealth amounts to £1,100,000, but the net revenue received is only £450,000, leaving a balance of about £650,000, which represents the amount which the people of the Commonwealth are called upon to pay for the production of 600,000 tons of cane by white growers. I entirely exclude, of course, the production of black-grown cane. The honourable member for Yarra and others have said that they have no intention to protect the production of cane with black labour, and would be willing to make the Excise on black-grown sugar equal to the import duty. This Parliament, in its mad eagerness to settle things, although honourable members regard the employment of black people in any Australian industry as one of the worse of evils, has fosteredtheir employment in the canefields at great cost to the community. We are transferring a large sum of money annually from one class of citizens to another ; in fact, we are robbing those who own poorer land in order to confer an advantage upon those who own some of the richest land in the world. I cannot conceive of any more serious evil than that which will arise from the continuance of the bounty. We are told that the law providing for the deportation of the Kanakas will take effect in 1907. Sir member must not forget that there are about for Sou'.h Sydney tells a different story. 15,000 aliens in Queensland, apart from the Our Tariff arrangements have made a great Kanakas, who number between ^,000 and difference to the jam manufacturers of New 8,000. the first instance, that the bounty was needed only until such time as the Kanakas were deported, and I should like to know why it is regarded as necessary to continue it beyond the year 1907, when the last of the Kanakas will be returned to their homes. If the Kanakas are not to be deported, honourable members should be fully informed upon the^ subject. Would it not be better for us, instead of continuing the bounty, to say to the planters : "" We will pay you so much annually, and have done with it."" As I have shown, we could afford to give each of the white growers, in excess of the number who were engaged in sugar planting in 1902, an amount of £ 6 1 1 per annum. Will any honourable member pretend that we are conducting the business of the -arranging them, and (drawing Commonwealth in a reasonable manner when such conditions exist? It should not be forgotten that sugar is one of the raw material's . used by many manufacturers. If there is one product that should be free from duty it is sugar. Lett us consider the extent to which the fruit-growing industry is affected by the high price of sugar, and let us also' pay regard to the extent to which it is used in the jam-making and other industries. affects mutton. ton, but it does affect the bacon-curing industry, in which a large amount of sugar is used. Mr .FISHER -There is a duty of £ 1 4 per ton on jam. honourable member understand that the higher the price of a product the less the demand for it, and, consequently, the smaller the amount of employment afforded. product is already reasonably cheap it may be consumed to the fullest extent possible. an instance in which a decrease in price has not been followed by an increased consumption. Even in the case of bread, which is the staff of life, we find that a fall in price leads to a slight increase in consumption. That indicates how close some of our people are to what I may 'term the pinch of life. much duty on sugar prior to Federation.

Their market is not as large as it was, because when they enjoyed a rebate to the f u l l extent of the'duty they were able to send their goods into the markets of the world. Now they are not in that.position. I contend that it is unfair to single out anv class of the community and confer upon it special benefit at the expense of any other class. In addition to involving' the consumers of the Commonwealth in heavy loss, we are discouraging production in industries other than sugar-growing. How can we tell our orchardists that they are being benefited whilst we call upon them to pay a duty of 6s. per cwt. on sugar? They do not in many cases obtain a return of more than 2s. per cwt. for their fruit. Of course I am speaking of the total amount of sugar .used in the Commonwealth in the manufacture of jam. the export trade our manufacturers are not required to contribute so much. not monstrous that all the lemonade and cordial manufacturers throughout Australia should be called upon -to pay an additional 'price for their sugar 'as the result of the operation of the proposed bounty ? I submit that the case against the payment of a bounty is unanswerable. any set of citizens be called upon to contribute to the support of the holders of some of the richest lands in the Commonwealth? In Committee I shall do my best to prevent any extension of the existing bounty beyond 1907. From that time onwards, I think that a sliding scale should be adopted under which tbe bounty should be annually decreased by £ 1 per 'ton, until at the expiration of three years it would entirely disappear. adjourned.
