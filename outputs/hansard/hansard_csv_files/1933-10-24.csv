If the matter is much longer delayed, the commission considers that it is doubtful whether it can deal with it and make recommendatious with respect to it before April next, when the budget proposals for the ensuing financial year should be considered by the Government. I am, therefore, suggesting to the States concerned that they should hasten the presentation of their case, so that adequate time may be given to tbe commission to investigate it fully, aud submit recommendations that may be considered by the Government when the Estimates for next year are being prepared.

6,Mr Francis (Moreton,"Assistantadvanced by tbe Government in connection witb war service homes. Since the inception of the war service homes scheme, it has been the desire of all governments to do everything possible to ensure the success of this housing scheme, which was in some measure a reward to returned soldiers for services rendered in the defence of their country. The original interest charged eligible personswas 5 per cent., although the funds from which the money was obtained cost about 5$ per cent This, of course, was a valuable concession to returned soldiers-. The war service homes scheme, under which the Government has provided over 36,000 homes, was a gigantic undertaking, and its success can be appreciated when it is realized that until the unfortunate depression arose a few years ago, the arrears of repayments amounted to only 1 per cent. This is an indication of the liberal conditions that have governed the scheme, and is also a distinct tribute to the way in which returned soldiers have met their obligations. Following the success of the Conversion Loan, the rate of interest in respect of advances to returned soldiers was reduced from 5 per cent, to 4£ per cent, as from the 1st August, 1931. A reduction of $ per cent, in the interest rate charged to civilians who had purchased from the commission properties which had been abandoned, was also effected. The present cost to the Commonwealth of loan moneys utilized for the provision of war service homes is 5.2 per cent. However, as honourable members are aware, there has been a general reduction of interest rates, and money is now available on loan to ordinary civilians at as cheap as 4$ per cent. Having in view the original intention, that returned soldiers should he assisted to obtain homes at a cheaper rate than civilians, and the rates at which money may now be obtained, the Government has given careful consideration to the matter, and has decided to reduce the interest rate on money advanced for the construction of war service homes from 4£ per cent, to 4 per cent, as from the 1st January, 1934. There will also be a reduction of $ per cent, in the interest charged to civilian purchasers of war service homes, provided, that the"" rate payable by them will not be less than 5 per cent. This concession will cost the Commonwealth, in a full year, approximately £92,000, and is equal to a capital reduction of 11 l-9th per cent. For example, a purchaser would pay as much interest in respect of a loan of £400 at 4-£ per cent, as would a purchaser with a loan of £450 at 4 per cent. The following table will more fully explain the position:Reduction in Present Loan Interest equivalent Balance. to Capital Reduction to£ £ 480 .. 40 0 075 .. 00 0 787 700 900 .. 80 0 The sympathetic interest of the Government in the welfare of returned soldiers has already found expression iu the liberal scheme that was adopted following an investigation by the War Service Homes Committee of Inquiry. The basis of thatscheme is the ability of the soldier to pay. The present reduction of the interest rate is a further indication of the Government's determination to help returned soldiers to complete their contracts> and thus fulfil the intention when-the war service homes scheme was inaugurated; that is, that returned soldiers should be assisted to become the owners of their homes. The reduction of interest .will lighten the burden which many returned soldiers'are bearing, and I feel sure that honourable members will share the gratification of the Government and myself that it has been found possible to give this further assistance to returned soldiers. The War Service Homes Commission will communicate with purchasers as early as possible, and advise them of the new instalments payable by them under the contract into which they have entered. Later: Minister( Mr Francis). whether the Government has made any arrangements under which purchasers of war service homes through the State Bank of South Australia, which acts on behalf of the Federal Government, will receive the benefit .of the reduction of interest he has just announced?",12,Reduction Of Interest Rates

Minister whether the matter of writing off a certain amount of the arrears due by occupants of war service homes, which have arisen in consequence of unemployment, has received the consideration of the Government., and whether in future they can hope for a remission of these payments ? occupier of a war service home is permitted to allow his arrears of instalments to remain in abeyance, but he has to meet his current commitments according to his income. The whole question will be reviewed in 1935, iu accordance with the recommendation made by the committee appointed by the Government.

Trade and Customs) [3.36] -It is uot necessary for me to deal at length with the business now before the committee as I gave honourable members full details of the Government's intentions in the speech which I delivered in introducing this proposal and others. has been printed and widely circulated and contains a carefully prepared summary of the Tariff Boards report and also its premises, reasons, conclusions and recommendations. I think we can agree that our difficulties on account of the present exchange basis, and also our present instability generally, are consequent upon the war and iis aftermath. Prior to the war the slight fluctuations of the exchange rate made very little difference to trade, because most countries were on the gold standard; but since the war, imperfect realization of the great economic wastage of that conflict has caused a chaotic condition in world currencies and exchanges. As our future is undoubtedly linked to the stability of exchange and currency it is essential that v/e should take cognizance of what is happening. In. spite of the oscillation of exchange in many countries, sterling remains in the most satisfactory position. It is in best repute among the currencies of the world owing principally to the integrity of the British people and also to the operations of the Exchange £150,000,000 which Great Britain has established to counteract the fluctuations of exchange as much as possible. Australia is defini tely ""linked with sterling, not per cent., one-quarter of the duty is the only sentimentally as a part of the Empire, but also in consequence of the pegging of exchange at £125 Australian to £100 of sterling. It must be realized, however, that currency depreciation affects costs. This subject was carefully inquired into and voluminously reported upon by the Tariff Board which took all factors into account. I think honourable members will agree that it is impossible to devise a general plan to enable protective duties to be adjusted automatically so as to compensate exactly for the effects of exchange. It thus remains in the general interests to make the best possible partial adjustment ou a fair and equitable basis. The Government had to recognize the problems with which the Tariff Board was faced in recommending rates of duty which would give reasonable protection to Australian industries. As I explained in my previous speech, many manufacturing costs are increased by the exchange. This made it necessary to consider exchange in assessing the degree of protection required by such industries. The That speech Tariff Board could not ignore either the anomalies which arose in the case of Australian industries whose costs were increased in consequence of the exchange, or the difficulties due to the fact that costs of many raw materials and also the price of certain imported goods were affected by the exchange. None. of these factors . has been ignored. The Government has endeavoured to look at them all in their true perspective. Their function is to protect local production and local unemployment from unequal competition. It may be said that they are the differentials and gears that separate our standards from the economic standards of other couiitries. Some honourable members have asked that I should re-state the Tariff Board's recommendations aud the decisions of the Government in connection with this matter, and I shall do so as briefly as possible. Recommendation No. 1 provides that while exchange does not recede below 20 per ceut., a deduction shall be made from protective duties of (a) one-quarter Equalization Eund of of the duty, or (b) one-eighth of the value of the duty; whichever is the less. At a 50 per cent, duty both rates would work out equal, but if the duty is below 50 less and that is what would apply to British goods. That recommendation was accepted by the Government. Recommendation ]STo. 2 is a compensatory scheme providing that if at any",18,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment
60,' Mr White (Balaclava,"Minister fortime the exchange rate should fall 20 per cent, but not lower than 12£ per cent., the deductions from protective duties shall be (a) one-eighth of the duty, or (o) one-sixteenth of the value for duty; whichever is the less. That will operate if there is a sixteen and two-third's degree of depreciation, which is what we term the 20 per cent, exchange. In recommendation No. 3, the Tariff Board urges that no adjustment of duty shall be made in regard to importations from countries with currencies depreciated relative to sterling but less than Australian currency; in other words, a state between sterling and our own currency. that recommendation in cases where it does not conflict with recommendations Nos. 1 and 2, for there is one colony within the British Empire, namely, Eiji, whose currency at the moment stands between sterling and Australian currency. Recommendation No. 4 provides for the imposition of a special duty on protected goods which are imported from countries which have a currency that has depreciated more than our own. No. 3, we should trade with the countries concerned as though on a sterling basis ? 4 is brought down in a sejiarate resolution and I suggest, Mr Chairman, that you should allow honourable members to discuss it with the others. That should limit the extent of the debate and save second-reading speeches being made on both items. Regarding recommendation No. 5, the Tariff Board was called upon to make a recommendation concerning primage which, it . pointed out, is a revenue duty which has no protective incidence: recollect that a primage resolution was introduced in which a preferential primage duty system was instituted in favour of Great Britain. That accords also with Australia's obligationunder the Ottawa agreement, to l if t the primage crease the price of our exports and reduce duty so soon as the financial situation allowed. The limitation of the adjustment to certain goods from specified British countries, particularly the United Kingdom, Canada and colonies of less importance, is as far as the Government is prepared to go, for this is legislation of a pioneering nature. If it can be proved that it renders Australian manufacturers vulnerable"" to undue competition, the Govermnent will rectify the position. So far the scheme has been subjected to very little criticism. by correspondence which I have received on the subject. ber's favourite newspaper, The Age, commends the proposal. It is encouraging to find that, in its negotiations with Japan, India has formulated a scheme which will coyer compensatory arrangements for currency depreciation. The Government has accepted The Government's proposals should substantially eliminate any 'tendency towards over-protection. So long as manufacturing industries are overprotected there is a tendency, slight in some instances and pronounced in others, for internal prices to creep up towards the cost of imported goods. there is under-protection ? Tariff Board will see that a fair degree of protection is afforded to Australian industry. Any one who believes thai trade should be a two-way arrangement and not a single way to conform with a single-track mind, will agree that the greater the amount of trade that is done between Australia and Great Britain the better it is for both countries, provided always that it does not create additional unemployment. The United States of America, with all the resources, and the bulk of the"" world's gold-, found that to live to itself was impossible. The inatter of over-protection would not he of vital importance if dependence on the prosperity Honourable members will of our unsheltered exporting industries for any reasonable measure of national prosperity were not so real. In the interests of our exporting industries, some of which are strongly protected, every possible action must be taken to intheir cftst of production. So long as depressed prices remain for our exportable commodities any disproportionate variation in the prices of secondary products must be held in check. The manner in whicli the Government's proposals have been received is a tribute to the soundness",19,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment

I shall now deal with certain criticism that has been levelled at these proposals. Dealing with the subject of the legal . necessity for the collection of deposits on duty, in those cases where the exchange adjustment proposals bring the rate of duty lower than the 1921-30 customs tariff rates, I remind honourable members that I have already clearly explained that such duties will not operate immediately. immediately down to that level. has come from certain customs agents who have increased their charges because of the additional trouble involved, and the press has taken the matter up wrongly and criticized the Government for not having made the duties operate immediately. This, however, has been the law since the inception of federation. the duties law takes only a few weeks and they would be operating now had not the budget been brought down in the interim. Incidentally, the advantage derived by importers and manufacturers, from the fact that they obtain some goods and raw materials at a lower cost, undoubtedly outweighs any slight disability that might be suffered in the meantime. abilities. satisfy the honourable member, and that in future questions which .lead to a misnnderstanding'of the position among those who are not acquainted with all the circumstances will not be asked in this chamber.

The Government undertakes to explore the possibility of making future reductions operate immediately they are tabled, instead of Waiting until they have been passed into law. Merchants and manufacturers have an exact knowledge of the position, and when goods are arriving can land what they need for immediate requirements, leaving the balance in bond until the new duties become operative. additional expense. state of perfection advocated by the honourable member during the many years that he has been in this Parliament, there would be no blemishes on our statute-book. Wc should show ourselves to be a most impatient people if we were not prepared to suffer the few weeks' delay caused by the presentation of the most popular and welcome Commonwealth budget that has been introduced for many Criticism years Standing Order which imposes, a time limit on debate does not deal definitely with a question such as that now before the Chair; consequently, I propose to treat it as a customs tariff resolution-whic h it really is. Therefore, the Leader of the Opposition, or a member, deputed by him The matter of making lo speak first, may speak for 60 minutes, and other members for 45 minutes each. The party of which I am the deputy leader is strongly opposed to the customs tariff exchange adjustment proposals, on tbe grounds that they will weaken the protectionist policy of Australia, encourage imports, cause a further drift to take place in the trade balance position, and increase the number of unemployed.. I agree with at least one statement of the Minister( Mr White); that is, that I hope that this will the exchange question presented great difficulties to the Government. The reason^ is, that the Government endeavoured to please two sides which, on fiscal questions, are as wide apart as the poles. I believe that it has pleased nobody. I admit that the criticism of the Government in free trade quarters for its delay in bringing down this schedule consequential on the recommendations of the Tariff Board was largely unjustified. My complaint is, not that thei'e was delay, but that the schedule 1 was brought down at all. There has been a complete change of government policy on this question.

""While the proposed alterations may not immediately have a disastrous effect, except in the case of the few industries that are dependent on the protective incidence, of exchange, that must be the long-range result. The competition of the British importer will be more acutely felt in the future by Australian manufacturers. The alterations can be hailed, as they are by British manufacturers, as a gift to the factories of Great Britain, and this means that they arc disadvantageous to Australian factories. Had schedule providing for the arbitrary reduction of 839 tariff items, consternation would have been caused in the Australian manufacturing world. The exchange adjustment, proposals are sugar-coated. up with economic jargon and references to Empire preference; and, so that they might be more ambiguous, there is also'talk of the introduction of an equitable formula. ""When the effect of the alterations becomes known, I believe that consternation will be caused in Australian secondary industries, many of which have not yet realized their true significance. The Government has sneaked them in by a back-door method. It has made a large number of reductions which cut right across the protectionist policy of Australia and the pre-election pledge that uo tariff alterations would be made by ministerial action without a Tariff Board report based on the individual review of each industry. Is this an individual review? Decidedly not. Hundreds of items are affected, and we are told that we cannot deal with them seriatim, but must take them holus bolus. investigation by the Tariff Board in addition to this. the Tariff Board to make an investigation of all the items affected by this resolution, to see whether the industries concerned are losing the Australian market, and whether hundreds of workmen will have to be thrown out of employment ? It has been said that the Government's tariff amendments have been well received. Let me cite some of the views of leading manufacturers' associations in Australia. There is a tendency, when a government introduces tariff amendments, for some of the manufacturers affected to be thankful for small mercies, considering that conditions might have been worse; but the manufacturers' associations have emphatically declared their opposition to the Government's tariff amendments. The following statement was made on the 6t,h October, 1933, by Mr 0. V. Potts, the president of the Chamber of Manufacturers of New South ""Wales:Manufacturers regard most seriously and with grave concern tiie Government's action the Government introduced a iu relation to tariff and exchange, as it will largely, if not entirely, uifset any benefits they would otherwise receive from the budget, and will prove a check to re-employment even if it does not indeed adversely affect many important industries. Tlie Tariff Board has certainty over-estimated tlie .protective effect of exchange, which has never equalled the They are linked reduction in overseas costs. Mr F. ""W. Kitchen, president of the Vietorian Chamber of Manufacturers, made the following comment:The adjustment to be made in customs duties to offset exchange, as well as the reduced primage duties on manufactured articles, Mr. Kitchen added, were seriously regarded by the manufacturers on account of its effect on tariff protection. What seems to have been entirely overlooked was the fact that the adverse exchange rate was a corrective, or penalty, imposed on Australia for following a policy for many years of excessive importations. As a corrective it had rendered, invaluable service to tlie Commonwealth, and had, in conjunction with increased protective duties, saved Australia from default overseas and enabled her to recover her financial footing in the outside world. Whilei t had not been possible to thoroughly investigate the effect of the various changes in regard to specific industries, a serious anomaly seemed to have arisen relative to raw materials which were imported by British and Australian manufacturers alike from foreign sources, in so far as the Australian manufacturer would still have to ibear the f u l l burden of exchange and pay the f u l l rate of foreign duties as well as primage, without any allowance for exchange Mr ""WHITE -The primage was reduced, so Mr Kitchen is wrong in that respect. age was reduced, but it was not withdrawn.

83,Mr Forde,"I admit that the primreceive concessions in respect to both exchange and primage duties when thoy were landed in Australia. Those are the opinions of the chief executive officers of two of the largest manufacturers' associations in Australia. Mr ference on account of being classed as Hume Cook, secretary of the Australian Industries Protection League and at one time a Liberal member of this House, statedThe alterations made in relation to exchange. were a concession to clamour. Of course, a subtle propaganda was carried on and the Government weakly yielded to the requests of free trade interests, whose policy it was not prepared to espouse on the eve of the last election. These consequential tariff schedules pleased the British manufacturers immensely, as is shown by the following statement which appeared in the Daily Mail:Holders of Australian loan stock and British manufacturers will be pleased with such a sound and cheering budget. Any concession that we give to the advantage of the British manufacturers must prove detrimental to our secondary industries and lead to loss of employment in Australian factories. of the dumping provisions of the Industries Preservation Act. has stated how difficult it is to administer those provisions. Other British newspapers hailed this Government's tariff amendments as a tariff gift to Great Britain. Lord Beaverbrook, the champion of Empire trade, hailed this Government's proposals as splendid news from Australia and suggested that it was a step towards Empire free trade. While that might be a splendid ideal for Lord Beaverbrook it is of no use to Australia at the present time, and I personally consider it to be impossible of achievement. English manufacturer stated in the Manchester Guardian that large quantities of unfinished continental and Japanese materials are sent to Great Britain, where they are dyed, printed and shipped to Australia as British made. Those goods are being dumped in Australia to the disadvantage of our secondary industries. . s admitted under the preferential tariff unless they have a certain British content. British-made, and as a result the products of foreign manufacturers are creeping into the Australian market under the cloak of being British-made. That, of course, is having a very damaging effect upon our secondary industries. The formula as set out by the Government fails to meet the case of the textile manufacturers who must purchase their raw materials at a price which represents world price, plus the exchange benefits to the Australian wool-growers. While the exchange functions as a bounty on exports there is no price advantage to the Australian spinners and weavers who operate in this country"" side by side with the growers. That fact should be kept in mind by the Minister. The formula also fails to provide for the 10 per cent, reduction of wage3 which must sooner or later be restored to all workers under Federal awards. 1 know that this Government would like to fix arbitrarily the rate of protection to the Australian manufacturer so as to make it more and more difficult for him to compete against the importers, and consequently cause him to apply to the Arbitration Court for a further reduction of wages. That would lead to reduced purchasing power and fewer sales of products from Australian factories. We are all looking forward to an all-round increase in price levels in Australia, which all the leading economists are now convinced must precede a return to prosperity. An increase of prices to the 1929 level would bring about'an increase of wages paid in Australian factories, and if that happened how would the manufacturers continue if they did not receive adequate protection Recently an against the products of cheap labour countries? The new formula also fails to recognize the need of the automotive industry for protection by the imposition of penal tariffs. Only a penal duty of 3s. a lb. on gear-wheels arrested imports of gear-wheels. The importation of laminated springs was arrested by the same means.

87,Mr Forde,"They are subject to preuseless, and this new scaling down of the tariff will result in an increase of dumping which, as the Minister well knows, is extremely difficult to prove under the Industries Preservation Act. Not only the American and Eastern manufacturers, but also the British and other European manufacturers, are offenders under that law. Their sole object is to make profits regardless of the to compete with the imported article consequences. I have no wish to examine every item in detail, but I should like the Minister to make a particular note of item 120c-towel s and towelling-and to give it further consideration. The towelling industry has been established within the last three or four years. Under the 1921-2S tariff the duty was 20 per cent. British preferential and 35 per cent, general. During the regime of the Scullin Government the rates were increased to 50 per cent, and 65 per cent. Since this Government has been in office the cotton hounty on yarns has heen abolished and a duty of 35 per cent, ad valorem and 4£d. per lb. imposed on preparation yarns, equal to 40 per cent, of the yarns used on towels. That was equivalent to a reduction of the protective duty by from 18 per cent, to 20 per cent. ferred to the Tariff Board in order to ascertain whether a dumping duty is required and the inquiry is now being made. Minister's assurance. There was a further 10 per cent, reduction in British preferential and 5 per cent, reduction in general tariff rates in accordance with the Tariff Board's report, and that left the manufacturers with a protection of 40 per cent, and 60 per cent, which, however, was not effective because of the higher cost of yarn. The effective protecthe disabilities under which Australian tion was 22 per cent. British preferential and 42 per cent, general, plus the protecexchange proposals are agreed to. There tive incidence of the exchange which was worth 11 per cent, on the average, because the manufacturers had to pay exchange on 60 per cent, of their raw material, condenser yarn, as against 25£ per cent, exchange on the f.o.b. price of imported towels. plete inquiry into that matter, and the spinners and growers have come to an agreement. inquiries will be expedited so that the cotton mills and the weaving mills will not go out of existence. One firm has spent -thousands of pounds in purchasing machinery and establishing a spinning mill, but because of the tariff amendments its effective protection has been so reduced that it will not be able unless the Government gives it immediate assistance. The manufacturers of towelling never at any time received the f u l l value of the protective incidence of the 25 per cent, exchange because they had to import 60 per cent, of their raw material and pay exchange on it. Another industry which warrants special attention is the tool manufacturing industry which makes tools of trade. Under this schedule the rate will he 35 per cent, on whioh there will be a reduction of Si per cent. A deposit of that percentage must be made, hut when once the rates in this schedule are assented to by Parliament, the 1921-1930 tariff will be repealed, and the industry will be unahle to carry on successfully against overseas competition. Similar,comments can also be made concerning a number of other industries, such as that concerned with the manufacture of malleable fittings, which I could mention. Those directly interested should place the facts before the Minister and ask for an immediate inquiry. There has been a great deal of delay by'the Tariff Board in inquiring into the position of many of those Australian industries; but that is not the fault of the Board, because it has had an exceptionally large volume of work to handle. In the circumstances, I think that the Minister would he justified in instructing a capable officer of the Trade and Customs Department to inquire into industries will be operating if these has been marked variation in price levels overseas since many of the duties now operating were imposed, and the application of this formula will inflict great hardship on a number of Australian industries.

91,Mr Fobde,"I hope that the board'sgoods that can be made in Australia and sold at a reasonable cost. This would seriously dislocate industries established for years anil lead to an increase in unemployment together with a wastage of the huge amount of capital invested. That is .exactly the eifect which the Ottawa agreement w ill have upon trade, and in consequence of the adoption of that agreement Australian secondary industries are seriously hampered. The merging of exchange costs w it h customs duties must encourage imports and may result in a corresponding inflation of the exchange rate, thus further depreciating Australian currency. There is a lot of loose talk by free trade, tariff reformers who say that the manufacturers have been enjoying an added protection of 25 per cent, owing to the present high exchange rate. Actually, the effective protection recedes from the maximum of 25 per cent, as the proportion of imported material used in the Australian product increases. The Tariff Board in its report on this question, saysGenerally the manufactured (product inI'ludes imported or exportable materials: then the protective effect of a duty is not increased by the full amount of exchange payable, but hy a proportion of it, dependent upon the relation between the value of the exchangeeffected materials 'and the whole. If half the value of duty ou an imported article lie represented by materials, an Australian manufacturer, would have to import, or for which the local manufacturer would have to pay world purity prices-includin g exchange-if it were produced in Australia, then half only of the exchange costs 'becomes additional protection and similarly with other ratios. It is evident that the manufacturers' costs have been shaded considerably as the result of the present exchange rate, and that the action of the Government w ill have the effect of increasing importations and seriously imperilling our trade balance. In. support of this contention, I quote fro m the memoranda on our trade position, supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician. He statesImports of merchandise (sterling) were valued at £ sterling 4.528.000 in June, 1033, as against £ sterling 4.193.000 in May; and exports of merchandise (sterling) at £ sterling 4.312,000 compared to £ sterling 5,898,000. Imports of merchandise increased 8 per cent, while exports declined 28 per cent. Total imports including bullion and specie were valued in sterling at £ sterling 4,002,000 as against £ sterling 4,274,000 in May, an increase of !l per cent. Total exports in sterling were £ sterling 4,999,000 in June as compared with Mr Forde. £ sterling 0,033,000 in May, a decline of 25 per cent. . . . For the month of June 1933, there wus a small and favorable commodity balance of £ sterling 216,000 as compared with a similar small balance of £103,000 for the previous June. For the twelve months ending the 30th June, 1933, the favorable commodity balance was £ sterling 21.210,000 compared with £ sterling 30,795,000 for the twelve months ending June,' 1932. Talcing bullion and specie into consideration the balance was £ sterling 3S.876,000 as against £ sterling 40,289,000 for the year 1931-32. . . . For the twelve months ending 30th June, 1933, imports (values in sterling) totalled £57,985.000 (of which merchandise represented £5U-,820,000 and bullion and specie £1.105,000) compared with £44,713,000 (merchandise £44,043.000 and bullion and specie £G70,000) for the previous trade year 1931-32. Imports of merchandise showed an increase of 20 per cent. The Commonwealth Statistician then sets out the items on which this increase occurs. This tinkering with our tariff policy encourages importation and places in jeopardy our trade balance which, during the regime of tbe Bruce-Page Government, drifted to the extent of £113,000,000 in eight years. The Minister referred to primage as being partly protective, and of a temporary nature, but the effect of exchange on customs duties is totally different. I agree that primage was imposed for revenue purposes. The Tariff Board anticipates that the present level of exchange w ill be maintained. That is an open question. It has led to revolutionary reductions in tariffs and the introduction of a totally new principle in fiscal matters. Air. GREGORY -Provision is made to cover reductions of the exchange rate. has never been suggested previously. for Trade and Customs said that it should not be and instructed the Tariff Board -accordingly. was not stabilized as it is at present. will tell whether it is now stabilized. The exchange rate is closely associated with our financial position overseas; and its variation is governed, not by the Government, nor by the T a r if f Board, but by the Commonwealth Bank, in conjunction with other Australian banks. Under this formula, customs",25,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment

95,Mr White,A t that time exchange,26,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment
96,Mr Forde,"It was, and timeduties .are being reduced, but there is no suggestion that the exchange rate should be lowered. Exchange operations maintain costs at a rate higher than they would otherwise be, and are not limited to the more immediate effect which is seen in the added cost of imported or exportable material. The value of exchange to primary producers or to exporting industries is considerable, but it adds to the cost of government in Australia when remitting moneys overseas to the extent of 7.59 million pounds annually. It is impossible to assess with any degree of accuracy the additional cost due to exchange and primage on account of the increased cost of -raw material, wages, taxation and other charges. The increases are cumulative. The depreciated currency places heavy burdens upon manufacturing industries. The exchange factor is noticeable in every phase of production costs. The primary producer benefits, not only from an inflated price for exportable primary products such as wool, wheat and flour, which have a world price level, but also from the fact that the price of his products sold for consumption in Australia is determined by overseas parity plus the premium of exchange. Experts who attended a meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers estimated the additional cost of exchange to the Commonwealth and State Governments of Australia per annum. from the present exchange rate to exporting producers, including gold producers, on exports valued at £83,474,000 are estimated at £20,868,000 per annum. In addition, the value of a fair percentage of exportable products, such as wool, wheat, butter, and flour, sold on the local market is increased. In speaking of the cost of exchange, some assume that £1 in England is of the same value as £1 in Australia. The variation is ns great as it is between £1 and the dollar or between the French franc and the Swiss franc. I now direct the attention of the Government to section 137 of the Customs Act, which provides that all duties shall be paid in British currency. Has the Minister given any consideration to this aspect of the subject? Value for duty 13 based, under existing conditions, not on Australian currency, but on sterling. I understand that representations have been made to the Government on this subject. kind would be the last straw. views of the Minister on the subject. The provision of the act is definite. An alteration of the basis of calculation would certainly increase the duties. In my opinion, the Government has made a grave blunder in yielding to the requests of free-trade interests to tinker with the tariff. It is ever ready to subject, the manufacturers of Australia to all kinds of searching investigations. Sometimes manufacturers have 30 per cent, of their staff occupied in preparing data for either the Government or the Tariff Board; and they arc told that all their cards must be placed on the table. But tbe big importing houses and the banking institutions of this country are not subjected to such searching investigations, nor are the British manufacturers. Those people who are prepared to invest their money in industry in Australia are spoken of by certain Government supporters and also by free-trade members of the Country party as if they were rogues and vagabonds, and they have to fight at 7.59 million pounds for their very existence, while overseas The benefits accruing manufacturers and their agents are given every consideration. This is deplorable, particularly in view of the fact that 300,000 people are to-day walking the streets of our cities looking for employment. The first duty of the Government is to place these people back in work. It should not heed the clamour made by the free-trade interests of York-street, or the so-called Tariff Reform League, but should stand firmly by the protectionist policy upon which it was elected. It promised that adequate and effective protection would be given to Australian industries, but it has failed to fulfil its promises. Fiscally the Government is wandering in no-man's land. To alter the simile, it is like a rudderless ship, drifting from side to side. After every onslaught by members of tlie Country Party, it changes its front. No heed should be paid to the requests of the right honourable member for Grafton",26,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment
97,Mr Patekson,An alteration of that,27,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment
98,Mr Forde,"I should like to hear the(Dr. Earle Page) or the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson), if consideration of them means a departure, to any extent, from the accepted protectionist policy of Australia. speech of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) was somewhat amusing, though parts of it which he read were also somewhat affecting. I advise the committee to recollect that the honourable gentleman, when he was Minister for Trade and Customs in the last administration, was responsible for placing most outrageous restrictions and prohibitions on the importers operating in Australia. Although he said at that time that the prohibitions, surcharges and increases of duty for which he was responsible would result in the employment of thousands more people, the number of unemployed in Australia increased month by month and the situation of the country became worse and worse. speech to-day made some reference to the effect of an increase of imports on the balance of trade, but surely even he must realize the absurdity of imagining that goods can be imported into Australia unless goods are exported to pay for them. No doubt a big reduction of imports did take place while the honourable gentleman was in charge of the Customs Department; but this was due, not only to the prohibitions imposed by his Government, but also to the fact that our exports to the other side of the world were not sufficient to create enough credits there to enable us to import more commodities. Reference is made in the report of the Tariff Board which we are now considering, to the effect of imports on the trade balance. I direct the attention of honourable members to the following extract from the report, and ask the attention of the honourable member for Capricornia particularly to the first sentence of the extract :The retention of excessive protective duties as a means of securing or maintaining a balance in overseas payments implies confusion of thought. It exposes consumers to the risk of excessively high prices; and as a means to the desired end it is unlikely to be effectivetends to be guided in its tariff policy hy To the extent to which the protective duties are effective, imports will already have been dammed back. The retention of protective duties higher than those necessary to give effective protection can have an ameliorative influence ou the balance of payments only by discouraging further the importation of those nominally protected lines which come in over the tariff wall. In 1930-31, such goods amounted in value to only about £11,000,000 out of total imports of merchandise of £61,000,000. In other words, the greater proportion of the imports of that year consisted of raw materials required by local manufacturers. Does the honourable member for Capricornia realize that it would be absolutely impossible for these manufacturers to obtain their raw materials from overseas unless we export our products to London to create credits there? The honourable gentleman cannot realize this fact or he would not have endeavoured to. crush our import trade while he was in office. The paragraph of the report from which I have already quoted continues as follows:Any alteration of the protective duties could at most, therefore, affect only a small proportion of total imports. More important still, the effects on the balance of payments will not be felt indefinitely. In the long run The honourable member in' his the costs of export industry will be affected, according to the direction of the alteration, and a larger or smaller volume of imports will tend to be followed by a larger or smaller volume of ex-ports. The effects on the balance of payments will cancel out in the long run, though with a different absolute volume of international trade. Of course our export trade affects the purchasing power of the manufacturers of their raw materials. Manufacturers can only purchase abroad to the value of the credits created by our exports less the amount which governments have to pay in interest. Two years ago, in discussing this subject in this chamber, I quoted figures to show how imports affected employment in Australia. When imports increased employment increased, and when imports declined employment declined. The honourable member for Capricornia said that the Government was attempting, by back-door methods, to interfere with the tariff policy of Australia. I fail to see how he can justify such a remark, seeing that the Government has stated clearly, on numerous occasions, that as far as possible, it inreports of the Tariff Board. At least that is its general attitude. Of course, the Government cannot be absolutely guided by the Tariff Board; I am quite",27,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment
99,Mr Geegory (Swan) [4.38],"Th esatisfied that honourable members, in dealing with customs duties in the past, have not given adequate consideration to the effects of exchange and primage. It is the intention of the Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr liament each year, such a state of affairs Paterson) to move an amendment to provide that recommendation No. 1 of the Tariff Board shall apply to all countries on the gold standard, or whose currency position is not less favorable than that of Great Britain. I regret that the Government has intimated that it intends to limit the effect of the first recommendation of the board to Great Britain. I realize the importance of bringing about a reduction in both the cost of living and the cost of production. This was eloquently advocated by the present Attorney-General( Mr Latham) in a speech which he delivered at Heidelberg during the last election campaign. The honourable gentleman said that a reduction of excessive costs was essential to the proper development of the country. But in spite of this the Minister, in introGovernment to present all reports of the ducing these proposals, intimated that even after they became effective no duties would be lower than those set out in the 3928 schedule. When I interjected at that point of the Minister's speech, I was chiefly concerned about the extra cost that would be imposed on importers by putting goods into bond. I ask the Minister now to give particular attention to this aspect of the subject, and also to the position of importers of glass. In this connection he would be well advised to pay regard to the question asked to-day respecting the attitude of Belgium. meinber for Swan desire to prevent any new industries from being established here ? classes of the community on the same level. The honourable member for Capricornia and his colleagues are interested only in the protection of the local manufacturers. price was charged for locally-manufactured goods, so long as the manufacturers and their employees were protected. It is deplorable to me that, with the exception of the tariff schedule relating to timber duties introduced in 1929, none of the schedules introduced into this Parliament since 192S have been properly validated. They have been only temporarily validated. If governments had carried out the provision of the Consiitution, and held one session of Parcould not have arisen. The Customs Act provides thai duties shall not be collected after a specified time, unless the schedules tabled in Parliament have been approved. In my opinion it is totally wrong for the Government to impose indirect taxation of this description on the people without giving Parliament an adequate opportunity to approve of it. I also"" complain that, although the report of the Tariff Board on exchange and primage was presented to the Government on the 13th April, 1933, we have not been given an opportunity t6 discuss it until now. Important reports of this character should.be placed before Parliament without^ delay. In my opinion, it should be compulsory for the Tariff Board to Parliamentdoing so. teresting to know how many reports of the board haye never been placed on the table of the House. this Government has been, or will be, presented to Parliament. of this Government particularly, but of preceding governments. I feel satisfied that dozens of Tariff Board reports have not been seen by Parliament. In the the honourable report with which we are now dealing, the board clearly points out that when making its recommendations to Parliament it had not given any consideration to the protective incidence of exchange and primage. The board reportsI t is recognized tliat in many efficient industries tlie price of the output is fixed by local competition or on production costs, and is They would not care what much below the price of imported duty-paid goods; in those cases the risk due to overprotection is slight. In others, however, there is a definite tendency for prices to creep towards the cost of imported goods. This may be due to one or more of a number of causes, for example(a) Undue profit taking; (6) Tendency to lag in efficient production ;",28,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment

A review of the board's reports over a number of years reveals that the board realized the danger of steadily increasing costs of production necessitating increased duties. Pointed and emphatic warnings have been given from year to year. In spite of this recognition of tlie danger of excessive duties, the board has', in the past, been reluctantly constrained to recommend higher duties in some instances owing to the steadily increasing Australian costs and prices. These higher duties and prices were cajHible of being maintained under the relatively prosperous conditions due to high commodity prices and heavy external Ijorrowing. Suddenly, however, these conditions fell away. Almost simultaneously many duties were still further increased, and in some cases doubled, without inquiry and reportby the Tariff Board. Thus duties were increased just when the prosperity which previously supported them no longer remained. That is tlie most effective paragraph in the report, clearly demonstrating that duties, plus exchange and primage, are making it impossible f o i oui export industries to carry on. I do not know whether honorahle members know or care what is likely to be the result of such a policy, but I doubt whether our primary industries have ever previously been in such a deplorable position. ""When speaking in Brisbane recently, Professor Brigden said that even if wool remained at its present price it would be from seven to eight years before growers could recoup the losses that they have sustained during the last four or five years. Consider, too, the position of the wheat-grower with wheat at Is. 8d. o i Is. 9d. a bushel at the siding, and think of his cost of production, which is in creased by primage and exchange, and by the policy supported by the Labour party of giving consideration only to manufacturers and employees! How does the manufacturer expect to buy his raw materials abroad if there is no credit overseas to enable him to do so? raw material is purchased in Australia. the stupid policy that has been supported by the honourable member and others, Australia would have been progressing steadily towards a population of from 50,000,000 to 100,000,000. There are some who talk a great deal about an adequate defence policy for Australia. Surely the most desirable means of progreater population and to develop the country. Unless Australia produces more wealth, it w ill be quite impossible for us to maintain the standard of living that has been ours in past years. Our governments have borrowed and carried on under artificial conditions, with the result that when the first cold blast of adversity came in 1929, we promptly had 400,000 of our population unemployed. In its report,the Tariff Board also statesThen the depreciation of currency took place and primage duty was added. The effect of all these increases in landing charges, together with reductions in wages and interest charges and rent, have been to grossly over-protect many industries. Surely no honourable, member desires that, under such conditions, our industries should be over-protected. The report continuesThe board is of opinion that in the best interests of the Commonwealth this overprotection should not be allowed to remain, but must be rectified insofar as practicability permits. No one knows what is going to happen to our wheat-growers. I recall that the wheat-growers of Western Australia decided last year not to bring their wheat to the railway sidings. A t great political risk to myself, I wired them, urging them to honour their obligations to those who had assisted them in the past. Another year of impoverishment is ahead, with bankruptcy staring tlie growers in the face. Do honourable members wish to see our farmers emulate the farmers in the United States of America and go on strike as a protest against the greedy exploitation sanctioned by this Parliament? The treatment meted out to them certainly warrants such action. In spite of that, many honourable members argue that consideration should be given only to manufacturers and employees. The honourable member for Capricornia has the idea that manufacturers who go before the Tariff Board should not disclose particulars of their finances. I remember that in 1925 it transpired that a firm manufacturing agricul-",29,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment

The honourable member for Gippsland proposes to move that the first recommendation of the Tariff Board shall be accepted. that the deductions from tariff duties due to exchange and primage according to the formula recommended by the Minister should apply not only to Great Britain, but also to those countries which have a standard equal to or better than' sterling. I have no objection to the Government being given power to increase duties, where currency has depreciated below sterling, but I hope that the Minister will insist that any alterations shall be made by regulation and not by proclamation, for where matters affecting the taxation of the people are to be altered Parliament should have the power to review and, if necessary, annul them. Mr ""WHITE -The minor bill that was introduced last year and has not yet been debated contains an amendment giving effect to the honourable member's recommendation. amendment applies only to the Customs Act. This matter relates to the Industries Preservation Act. If these alterations are effected hy proclamation, and not by a regulation which can be disallowed by either chamber, the only protest that can be taken is to move in this chamber that the Government no longer has the confidence of honourable members. Because of high costs the primary industries of Australia are in a dreadful position and I hope that the report of the Tariff Board will cause the Government to reconsider the whole position and ensure that the suggested reductions will apply in the case of all countries where the currency is equal to or greater than sterling. I cannot recall any Tariff Board report to the perusal of which I have looked forward with greater interest than this one dealing with exchange and primage. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) has twitted the Government with having instructed the 'Tariff Board to make this inquiry because of pressure Parliament should have the brought to bear on it by members of the Country party. If the action of this party has been the means of bringing into being these schedules, I am, indeed, proud of it. It will be remembered that towards the end of last year the Country That will mean party urged upon the Government the necessity for dealing with the position which has arisen as a result of the protective incidence of primage and exchange. It was then pointed out that, instead of there being only two protective factors, as was normally the case-the natural protection afforded by ocean trade, marine insurance, landing charges and so on, plus that accorded our industries^-ther e were no fewer than four such, the cumulative effect of which was to increase duties to a prohibitive degree. We pointed out that there were, in addition to the natural protection of ocean freight and other charges, and the ordinary lavish protection granted by this Parliament, the protection of primage-imposed , no doubt, for the purpose of obtaining revenue, but having, I think it will be agreed, a most pronounced, protective incidence-and the currency protection of exchange, under which £125, Australian currency, is needed to purchase £100 worth of British goods. ""We considered that it would be most dangerous to Australia to allow these four protective factors to operate simultaneously for an indefinite period, because the inevitable result would be to build up unsound industries, which could exist only under these extreme hot-house conditions, and would probably peter out if exchange returned to normal, or primage were no longer charged. We felt also that some-industries would be conducted on inefficient lines, because of the absence of outside competition. We believed that, if such industries were allowed to secure a vested interest, it would be most difficult to get rid of them when they could no longer enjoy this exceptional protection. We argued that, if the Government saw fit, owing to the improvement of the financial position, to remove some portion of the primage duty, industries that had been started under extremely artificial conditions would receive a severe jolt; and",30,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment
108,Mr Gregory,No; the proposed,31,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment
109,Mr Paterson (Gippsland) [5.5],"that, if the exchange rate became normal, we should have the spectacle of manufacturers imploring the Government or the Tariff Board to increase their protection by 25 per cent, to make up for what they had lost. We further pointed out that Article 10 of the Ottawa agreement must remain a dead letter unless some deduction were made from existing duties, partially to offset the protection of the exduties an amount regarded as fair, parchange rate. No one will gainsay the soundness of that contention. By article 10, the Commonwealth Government undertook not to protect Australian industries to an extent greater than would allow of reasonable competition by British manufacturers. Eveni f duties were imposed which, without the protection of exchange and primage, could reasonably be regarded as competitive, the addition of those two items, totalling 35 per cent., would make the protection absolutely prohibitive. We urged the Government to remedy these defects. It was said that our proposal was impracticable. Some honourable gentlemen, who at the time adorned the treasury bench, said that it was impossible of adoption; and I well remember certain sections of the press referring to us gibingly as "" amateur economists rushing in with proposals, the complexities of which we did not and could not understand."" We replied that some of the difficulties could be surmounte'd more easily than our critics supposed. When it was alleged that, in the general tariff column, deductions could not be made that would be just to half a dozen countries with different exchange rates, we said.that there was no necessity to make alterations in the schedules; that a special resolution mit of the complete withdrawal of this enabling a deduction to be made from existing tariff duties should be brought down, to offset to some extent the protection afforded by the exchange rate. Members of the Country party are particularly pleased at the fact that the recommendation of the Tariff Board almost completely embodies our suggestions. able member moved for a complete reof the duty that would be payable at the duction to the 1921-28 level, without a rates listed under the British preferential Tariff Board inquiry. Mr Paterson, lutely no connection with the point that I . am now making. The Minister will find in the parliamentary debates confirmation of my statement that we recommended that the tariff schedule he not interfered with, but that special legislation be brought down enabling the Customs Department to deduct from customs tially to offset the protection of the exchange rate. On the 9th November, 1932, the adjournment of the House was moved to discuss the following matter of urgent public importance:The necessity {or reducing costs in both primary and secondary industries, and for lightening the intolerable burden due to the cumulative eifect on industry of customs duty, primage, and exchange, by amending the Customs Act to provide that when the amount of duty payable upon importation is being assessed, an amount shall be deducted from the rate of duty applicable, equivalent to an agreed upon proportion of the adverse exchange rate operating against the importer concerned. I say that, in effect, what has heen done is substantially what we then suggested. Unfortunately, however, the Government is going only a part of the way recommended by the Tariff Board. That body recommended the removal of primage from all items where it was protectively applied, so soon as the finances permitted such action to be taken. I realize, of course, that the qualification attached is a. substantial one, which leaves the Government free to determine when and to what extent primage charges should he removed; but it is the Government only which is in a position to say when itconsiders that the country's finances percharge. I shall deal now with the recommendation of the Tariff Board with respect to exchange. In this case the board recommends that deductions from duty should be made partially to offset the protection of exchange. This recommendation is absolutely specific; it has not attached to it a tag, as the recommendation in regard to primage has, but tariff, or 12^ per cent, of the value for",31,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment

The Tariff Board realizes that to permit the continuance of duties recommended withouthaving taken into consideration exchange and primage would be dangerous, and I fully endorse that view. Some relief has been given in respect of primage, but I regret that, it has not been given to a greater extent. Minister has said that the Governentirety, and as the Government has given honourable ment cannot see its way to forgo more than about £585,000, and that it is giving relief to that extent by reducing the 10 per cent, primage to 5 per cent, in the case of British goods, and to 4 per cent, in some instances, also by withdrawing it altogether iu other instances, while leavwith the exception of a few items. I notice that there is at least one item relating to British goodsa protective, and not a revenue duty-wher e the 10 per cent primage is apparently to remain. I refer ro galvanized iron. The board in its original report of April, 1931, made two recommendations to the Government. It said that in view of the exchange, primage and so on, there was really no need for a duty at all; but realizing that exchange might not last, it recommended that a duty of £4 10s. a ton should apply on condition that the manufacturers agreed to reduce their prices to a certain amount. into account. the exchange is a illogical in suggesting that, because a price arrangement had been entered into between the Government and the manufacturers of galvanized iron, there was no necessity to take exchange or primage into consideration in these proposals. The board proposed as one alternative a sliding scale of duties, rising or falling in adopted the decision to exempt galvanized iron from the deductions in this schedule would have been a common-sense one. That proposal, however, was not adopted, but a substantial duty of £4 10s. was imposed. In these circumstances, to say that in respect of galvanized iron there is no need to give relief to offset exchange on is wholly illogical and inconsistent. I cannot follow the reasoning of the Government at all. When the Ottawa treaty was arranged there was no exception made in respect of the terms of the treaty just because some particular manufacturer had made a price arrangement with the Government.

The Government's attitude in connection with recommendation No. 4 is sound; it is an improvement upon that of the Tariff Board, and I shall support it ; but I do. not think that the Government has given any good reason for deviating from the board's report in £125 connection with items Nos. 1 and 2. For certainly indefinitely from the present point that reason I move the amendment -of view. Government's tariff proposals now before the committee should be supported by all reasonable protectionists. A majority of ihe Australian people have adopted a policy of what is usually termed adequate protection, but which in some instances amounts to prohibition. A tariff which was considered 'adequate by a majority of the people has for some time been increased by the high rate of exchange, and in the circumstances the only reasonable course to follow is to set-off as much as is necessary of the existing high exchange rate. The tariff passed in 1929, which at that time it was considered would afford complete and effective protection for Australian industries, was amended in 1930-31 by the Government then in power without any regard to the recommendations of the Tariff Board. That was a slap-dash tariff, consisting of It is duties sufficiently high to satisfy all the manufacturers in Australia, but it only served to incite manufacturers to make requests for still higher duties. Generally speaking, Australian manufacturers were delighted with the Scullin tariff which, to a large degree, has been maintained by the present Government. The incidence of exchange now affords an additional 25 per cent, protection on all goods manufactured in Australia from Australian materials, and, to a smaller extent, on articles manufactured from imported materials. In reviewing the items in the schedule the Tariff Board acted on the assumption that exchange was at par, but for two years the rate has been against us at £125. After ful l inquiry the Tariff Board is now satisfied that the increased rate of exchange is to be more or less permanent. It realizes further that, while Australia is establishing some slight excess of credits in London, the amount is small, and that should bad seasons occur, there might be a shortage instead of an excess of funds in London. Professor Giblin, who assisted the board in its inquiries into this matter, after conferring with other economists, t said:I think we must regard ourselves as on this basis with comparatively little variation one way or the other, almost indefinitely,",34,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment

134,Mr Naien (Perth) [5.37].T,"TheThe present rate of exchange can, therefore, he regarded as permanent; and, if we are to maintain an adequate tariff, we must reduce duties in proportion to the extent hy which they have been increased by exchange. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Eorde) quoted the opinions of individual manufacturers in Sydney and in Melbourne, aud also that of the secretary of the Chamber of Manufactures. I do not think that we should take any notice of the opinions of such persons, because they are directly interested in maintaining present duties at higher than reasonable rates. In giving evidence before the Tariff Board, one witness representing the manufacturers envisaged an increase in local prices. He saidExchange prices also inflate the price level? of local goods which are wholly consumed within Australia, for it i * presumed, and it is not a matter for argument, that the depreciation in currency results in a general increase in commodity values, calculated or measured in terms of that currency. He argued that further protection by way of a high exchange rate should be maintained, because exchange has the effect of increasing local price values, and should continue to increase them further. That gentleman had in mind a further increase in the price of commodities consumed in Australia, but such an increase is not justified by costs. According to an estimate of the Tariff Board since the exchange was increased, wages have fallen in Australia by 15 per cent., and, in addition, there has been a substantial reduction of interest. On this subject, Professor Giblin saidRunning costs of production in Australia, apart from raw material imported or exportable, have fallen appreciably more than in Britain. Although fallen, the cost of goods of Australian creased in anything like the same ratio. plate an. increase in price levels have provided the Deputy Leader of' the Opposition with a brief in support of excessive protection such as would continue if the exchange were disregarded. weapon should not be placed in the hands of manufacturers for use against the public. There is much to be said in favour of the amendment moved by the J/r. Xairn. Deputy Leader of the Country party. There is no more logical reason for giving excessive protection against foreign countries, than there is in maintaining excessive protection against Great Britain. Many foreign countries are excellent customers of ours. ""We have a favorable trade balance with Italy, Belgium, Germany, aud Japan. The currency of Japan has depreciated more than that of Australia, but the Tariff Board has recommended that in the case of Japan, or other countries in that category, duties should be increased. ""We should pay some regard to general trade considerations. ""We cannot afford to sacrifice our favorable trade balance with Japan of many million pounds. Australia has already suffered a good deal through the retaliation of other countries which have resented our irritating tariff embargoes. If Japan chose to adopt an unfriendly attitude towards Australia we should lose a great deal of the trade that we at present enjoy with that country. Tariffs should have regard to the general and not to the particular interests of a country. It is desirable sometimes to sacrifice particular to the general interests. It might be wise for us to allow a certain quantity of Japanese goods to enter Australia in order to safeguard the substantial trade that we are at present doing with that country. I support the Government's policy in connection with exchange and primage and fail to see that there is any reason for opposition to it, for tlie interests of Australian manufacturers will not be inimicably affected thereby. gratulate the Government on having introduced this measure, because it will automatically bring about sweeping manufacturers' costs have reductions in the tariff schedule.

135,Mr Thobby (Calare) [6.52],"I contion to a particular case relating to belt fasteners imported into Australia since the new tariff schedule has come into operation. The duty on this consignment amounted to £ 1 5s. 9d., but an exchange adjustment of 6s. 5d. was allowed which made the 'duty payable 19s. 4d. collector then added 4s. 3d. under the heading of primage, adopting the new rate of 5 per cent., and following this he added 6s. 5d. for deposit. The advantage of the exchange adjustment was, in that case, entirely cancelled. The reason given for adding the 6s. 5d. was that it was necessary in order that the amount of duty payable should not fall below that provided in the 1921-30 schedule, which has been ratified by Parliament. But I ask the Minister to regard primage as a customs duty. Its imposition certainly gives increased protection to locally manufactured, articles. I submit, therefore, that the amount of primage should be added to the duty before the exchange adjustment is made. If that had been done in this case a deposit of only Is. 2d. would have been required to bring the amount of duty payable up to that of the 1921-30 schedule. I maintain, and have always maintained, that primage is, in effect, a customs duty. I strongly contend that the collectors of customs in the various States should he required to take primage into account before making the exchange adjustment. If that is done the amount of deposit required will certainly be very much lower. The belt fasteners to which I have referred were shipped from Liverpool by the SS. Ballarat and landed here early in October. In this and similar cases, the procedure adopted by the department is unfair and unreasonable for it robs importers of the advantage that should accrue to them through the exchange adjustment. Probably by the time consideration of this business has been completed hy Parliament, a large amount will have been paid in deposits. If , in the meantime, the Minister could review the procedure as I suggest, he would afford importers the relief which the Government surely intends them to have. I desire a procedure to be adopted which will give those concerned the immediate benefit of any tariff revisions that are made. Tariff schedules sometimes hang fire for years before ratification. If that Thorby) has congratulated the Governwere to happen in this case, the department would go on collecting deposits from importers, and the money so paid would be lost to them for all time, for no refunds are made in such circumstances. The principle at. present in operation is The that at 9 a.m. on the day following the tabling of a tariff schedule hy the Minister, the new rates become operative so long as they do not fall below those of the previously ratified tariff. I wish to see a provision incorporated in the tariff law which will provide that a schedule shall become operative immediately, irrespective of whether the rates provided are below those of the last preceding schedule ratified. Another complaint-1 desire to see rectified relates to the application of sales tax. In my opinion, this tax also has the effect, in many instances, of a tariff duty. Six per cent, sales tax is payable on certain imported articles, but not on similar articles manufactured in Australia. That should not be so, for it means added protection is given to the local industry. The adoption of that practice has the effect of automatically upsetting duties which have been agreed to only after careful consideration. An abuse of the same kind is practised by various State railway departments. Substantial preferential rates are granted to certain locally manufactured articles, whereas imported articles of a similar nature are subject to full rates. This also amounts to additional protection to the local article. cept New South Wales does that apply? that it applies in New South Wales aud Queensland, and I believe that it also applies on certain lines in Victoria. It has been suggested in some quarters that the Queensland railway authorities are actually contravening the Constitution by granting differential rates on wheat and flour. I trust that the Minister will reconsider the present practice in regard to both deposits in consideration of exchange deductions and sales tax. honourable member for Calare( Mr ment on having introduced this measure,",36,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment

They have not been investigated by the Tariff Board, nor have any duties been granted to them after exchange and primage have been operating. This resolution will take from them the protection previously enjoyed as the result of exchange and primage, and will probably involve them in disaster. Those are the two main points of disagreement which I have with the proposals of the Government. All who have considered the problem of exchange admit that it is most involved and intricate. Yet, after a most perfunctory examination of the matterI say it without any desire to be offensiverate of exchange cannot fairly be added the Tariff Board has presented four recommendations with formulae, and we are asked to legislate on their report. 1 ask honourable members to weigh the position seriously before they tamper with the . question on the meagre information that is contained in the report of the tion.

Neither the honourable member nor anybody else can be sure of this, for nobody has investigated the subby this proposal. ject to show to what extent the rate of exchange gives a protective duty. Many hasty conclusions have been arrived at. I have many times heard the honourable member for Gippsland adding to the. 25 per cent, exchange, the 10 per cent, primage and 40 or 50 per cent, ordinary duty, making the total protection 100 per cent. In addition to being misleading, such juggling of figures displays a lack of analytical power, and indicates a lack of investigation into the whole question of the effect of exchange on the importation of goods to Australia. .which some honourable members have been misleading the farmers. thing stands out clearly, that the full amount of the 25 per cent, exchange is a There are subsidy to export. believe even that. is that they are represented in this Parliament by persons who have made the protectionist policy a stalking horse to their own political advantage, and the disadvantage of Australian development and of the farmers themselves. It has been stated in this chamber that, as a result of the rate of exchange, the duty on a given item has been increased by 25 per cent. "" After seeing the modifications that have been made in the report of the Tariff Board, and upon certain facts being brought to light, honourable members of the Country party have modified their statements. Members of my party have contended from the beginning that the to the existing duty, and regarded a3 an added protection. The board admits it, as also does the Minister.

156,Mr Scullin,"I have a list whichderived from exchange, and more particularly from the 10 per cent, primage duty, enabled Australian industries to carry on. The removal or reduction of that protection will make, their position precarious. We are asked to vote holus bolus for the reduction of protective duties on a large number of industries, without an inquiry having been, made by the Tariff Board as to the effect which such a reduction may have upon them. It has beeu claimed that these industries receive from exchange protection amounting to 25 per cent. arrived at and false conclusion. Those who make the claim ignore many important factors. The Tariff Board itself 0 has admitted this, but in a vague way, It saysGeneral!}', the manufactured product includes imported or exportable materials: then the protective effect of a duty is not increased by the full amount of exchange payable, but by a proportion of it, dependent upon the relation between the value of the exchange-affected materials, and the whole. That is illuminating, is it not? I defy any honourable member to glean from that paragraph the slightest conception of what the proportion is. proposals. taxation proposals there is a curve, from whicli a mathematician can work out the exact figure. logician can work out this proportion. margin. hoard jumped to the conclusion that 12-J per cent, should be the maximum extent to which the duty should be reduced because of the effect of exchange. That, however, is nothing more than a guess. The Minister dealt with this matter in a carefully-prepared speech. He saidThe effective protection due to the adverse exchange on sterling recedes from the maximum of 25 per eent. as the proportion of exchange-affected material used in the Australian product increases. That is true: but what does it prove? Does it give any indication of the proportion? vague expression, which announces a truism without giving definite facts. Yet, in the absence of anything to guide the Tariff Board, the Ministry, or this Parliament, as to what proportion of protection is given by exchange, we are asked to agree to certain duties being reduced, and thus to decrease the effective protection by 12-J pei' cent. The honourable member for Gippsland admitted that, on account of the disability suffered by manufacturers because of exchange, there must be some deduction from the 25 per centHe said that the disability would be slight, because it would be caused only by the exchange on their imported raw That is a hastily materials. I join issue with him right, away. Australian manufacturers have to bear a disability caused by exchange on articles other than imported articles. They have to bear the burden of exchange, not only on every article of raw material that they import, but also on every exportable article of raw material that is worked up in Australia. Let, me illustrate my point. The textile industry uses wool as a raw material, and the cost of wool in Australian currency is from 2d. to 3d. per lb. greater than in sterling and from 5d. to 6d. per lb. greater than in gold. I invite honourable members to follow further the ramifications .of exchange, and to see what little regard has been paid to it. The cost in AusWith tralian currency of everything exported is increased by reason of exchange. Take wlieat, for example. It may be said that No mathematician or wheat is not a raw material of any industry except the flour-milling industry. I contend, however, that indirectly it is. The price of wheat is raised because of exchange. I am not quarrelling with that; I am glad that exchange enables the growers of wheat and wool to receive a higher price for their product. The point that I make is that the cost of bread is increased, and that that raises the index figure which governs the basic wage; and the basic wage affects the cost of all raw materials, machinery, and manufactured articles generally. Exchange co3ts Australia approximately £24,000,000 per annum on exports totalling £96,000,000 sterling. The cost in relation to the export of merchandise alone, which amounts to £'7S,000,000, Not the slightest. It is a would be approximately £20,000,000. The export of gold also must be added, if it is won during the season, because then it is a primary product. It may,",39,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment

159,Mr White,That is why there is a,40,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment
160,Mr Scullin,"That is why thetherefore, safely be said that the cost of exchange to Australia is between £20,000,000 and £22,000,000, out of which the governments of the Commonwealth and the States pay approximately £7,000,000 to meet their overseas obligations. Where does that sum come from? It does not come from the air. Every section of the community contributes to it. The primary producers contribute a quota, and to that extent lose some of the advantage which they gain from the higher export price for their product. In taxation and in general charges, as well as by means of a special charge on raw materials imported and other raw materials that are exportable, the manufacturing industries pay a quota. I a3k the committee: Has the Tariff Board or any other body collected data tliat give us to meet the second point or to ascertain anything like an accurate estimate of the disability caused to Australian manufacturers by exchange? One .surely could have expected the Government, before tinkering with this big national question of exchange, which has baffled some of the greatest experts within the last few years, of exchange does increase the cost of to obtain something more than this Tariff Board report, which gives no indication, even in a general way, of what the proportion is, but simply proposes by rule of thumb to reduce duties by one-quarter unless the rate of exchange falls below approximately 20 per cent. Yet, from one end of the country to the other, we have been advised not to leave these matters in the hands of Parliament, but to refer them to the expert Tariff Board, so as to obtain an exact mathematical calculation. Here is tbe result: Nothing definite, nothing tangible; merely a general statement, and a rule-of-thumb method of reducing duties by 12J per cent. whether that represents the full extent of the disabilities to he placed on Australian Australian industries. The formula remanufacturers. I say that it does not. We have to bear in mind that, although the manufacturer are reduced, there is to be no reduction of the disabilities suffered by him if exchange should drop from 25 per cent, to 12J per cent. That is a serious position, which has not been given due weight either by the Government or by the Tariff Board. The board has made the definite statement, which was repeated by the Minister to-day, that with theexception of two items exchange was not taken into consideration when the duties were fixed. I challenge that assertion. I am not in a position to go through the whole list of tariff items, but there is one upon which I have the report of the Tariff Board, which shows that the rate of exchange was taken into consideration; and at the time it was 30 per cent. No allowance is made for that in this report. The Tariff Board stated in effect that it usually disregarded the exchange because there might be a reduction in the rate of exchange or the proportionate increase of local costs due to exchange might increase. I agree with the board on the first point, but what attempt has it made what that proportion is? It has not attempted, to deal with that matter, and has left it in the air. Exchange is added to meet the costs, hut to what extent no one knows. Only one thing is certain, that our depreciated currency or the rate manufacture of local industry. I must admit that the honourable member for Gippsland had some justification for crowing to-day. The Country party has brow-beaten the Government by its constant demands for this method of reducing the protective duties applying to Australian industries. That party stands for low duties and its policy is as near free trade in many respects as anybody, who is not an avowed free trader, could wish. It objects to anything like effective protection to Australian industries, and in its fight for lower duties has emerged triumphant. Honourable members may ask It is-entitled to all the credit, if any credit is due, for aiming a. smashing blow at commended by the board and adopted by the Government provides that the duties the benefits given to on British goods shall be reduced by one-quarter, but no reduction of duties is being made on foreign goods. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Gippsland would apply to foreign as well as British goods a reduction of the duty by one-quarter, or 12i per cent, of the value, whichever is the lower, and, as the Minister has pointed out, a duty of 50 per cent, is subject to a maximum reduction of 12-J per cent. That would is 25 per cent. The present proposal will apply to goods where the currency is further reduce the British duty from 35 on sterling or where the currency is per cent, to 26£ per cent. When the appreciated in relation to sterling, or is board reported on this industry the nominally on sterling. A duty of 50 British tariff was 35 per cent, plus 30 per per cent, would be reduced by 12-J per cent, exchange, making 65 per cent., less cent., and that would also apply if the local cost of exchange. This proposal exchange fell to 20 per cent., and the will mean that the duty and exchange will Australian currency was depreciated by be 51J per cent, less the local cost of ex16£ per cent.

Let me give one illustration, which was placed before .the Tariff Board, to show that the manufacturers do not include protective duties in their charges, and that these reduced duties will not bring about lower prices for goods. Let us compare the charges made by British exporters to Australia with those they charged to New Zealand, where there is no local manufacture. It is an important factor which has to be taken into consideration. According to the general statement of United Kingdom trade issued hy the British 'Customs Department-and this evidence was submitted to the Tariff Board on oath-the average f.o.b. prices on the following commodities are:To Australia, To New Zealand, an outspoken critic of the Government per ton. £ 8. d.

One of the outstanding features of one of the board's reports is that when a duty was placed on black No. 8 fencing wire, the industry was established in Australia, and immediately the price of the imported wire fell, but no reduction took place in the price of galvanized fencing wire, because the industry had not then been established. Later, when a duty was imposed upon galvanized wire, and the industry was established in Australia, the price of the imported article was reduced. God help the farmers if they are left to the tender mercies of the importers, without Australian industries being in existence to provide competition. For the reasons that I have given, 1 oppose the proposals of the Government, and also the amendment of the honourable member for Gippsland. I welcome the proposals of the Government, first, because I believe that they will bring about a reduction of production costs in Australia; secondly, because they will improve our trade relations with our best customer-the United Kingdom-and also with other good customers when the Government has had time to negotiate agreements with them; and, thirdly, because I believe that they will go a long way towards bridging the unfortunate gap which until recently has been widening between the different non-socialistic groups in Australian politics.

It has, in some instances, adversely affected secondary industries in the market for their goods, and has handicapped our export industries as well. secondary industries to be exposed to the risk of ruin and destruction by sudden changes in tariff levels to which they have no chance of adjusting themselves.

I entirely dissent from what the Leader of the Opposition has said about the board in this connection. On page 7 of the report the following statement is made:After reviewing a large number of tariff items embodying protective duties at British preferential tariff rates up to 50 per cent, ad valorem or its equivalent, the board is satisfied that in all the cases subjected to scrutiny a reduction of one-fourth of the duty is reasonable and docs not, in any instance, db more than allow for the net effect of exchange. In many instances it does not sufficiently reduce the protective effect of the exchange-bu t a scheme to be practicable must be readily workable and cannot accurately and with equal effect deal with all goods. That statement clearly shows that the board has checked very many reports, and a great deal of evidence in its effort to gauge, generally, the direct effect of costs and, particularly, the effect of duties on the raw material of certain industries, respecting which the Leader of the Opposition gave such a lucid account. may have been years old. Mr Ha wker. later reports took into account*the indirect effect on industry of exchange and primage. I believe that the margin allowed by the board is so conservative as to eliminate any risk of unfair competition from British importers with Australian industries which are doing the fair thing. Some Australian industries will, undoubtedly, feel the effect of even this small reduction of the protection that But I do not desire our they now enjoy; but such industries are, probably, costing the country far more than they are worth. The board points out that some industries are taking an undue profit from the community, and that others are working inefficient plant hy out-of-date methods. I do not think that any honorahle member wishes to saddle the primary and secondary industries of Australia with heavy costs in consequence of certain industries being operated by Such out-of-date methods and plant. We should welcome the infusion into our secondary industries of a little fresh competition I have, therefore, read which will act as a check upon exploitation, and prevent the Australian public from being penalized by either the sloth or the greed of a minority of industries which are not worth what they are costing the community. This report brings approximately up to date between 200 and 300 other reports which the board has made during the last three years. I have been criticized by members of the Government party for having supported an amendment moved some time ago on behalf of the Country party to effect a general reduction of tariff duties to approximately the 1921-28 level. Although it' may be said that I was elected on an undertaking to revise the tariff in conformity with Tariff Board reports, and was at one time a member of the Government, I wish to make it clear, once more, that in my speeches, and in my own electorate, I reserved to myself a somewhat freer hand to deal with tariff matters. When I joined the Government, I , of course, limited myself to the revision of the tariff in the way proposed by the Prime Minister in his policy speech, and I was willing at that time to give a trial to that method of reducing the excessive costs of industry in Australia. It was only-because of the changed circumstances",43,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment
186,Mr Beasley,Some of those reports,44,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment
187,Mr Hawker,"But not even thein the Commonwealth, which had the effect of causing both the Tariff Board and the Government to lose ground, that, eventually, when I was no longer a member of the Government, I gave my support to the amendment of the Country party. When the Government submitted its fast tariff schedule to Parliament it intimated, through the Minister for Trade aud Customs, that about 214 reports had been made by the Tariff Board, and that the hoard considered that its recommendations were substantially in line with articles 9, 10 and 11 of the Ottawa agreement. But those reports gave no consideration to the changed condition which had arisen in Australia in consequence of the imposition of exchange and of primage, and the much greater reduction of wages which had taken place in this country than in Great Britain Those reports were, undoubtedly, out of date on these material and essential points. I consider that if the recommendations of the present report are implemented, we shall do a good deal to bring those 214 reports into conformity with the real facts of the case. We should, therefore, welcome this proposal. But not even these adjustments will do all tliat should be done The Tariff Board has allowed a margin for possible error, and, in any case, the-reductions are being effected at the top of the tariff. This reduction remove. only the ornamental top storey from this fiscal structure. In my opinion a great many of our tariff duties are so excessively high that a reduccally provided for in the Ottawa agreetion of them by a quarter will not have any effect at all. Some of our industries will not feel these adjustments, because they are already conducted on an efficient basis. Tbe members of the United Australia party, whether they represent rural, or city constituencies, and, I should think, deputations, that the British representathe members of all parties are glad that, some Australian secondary industries are able to carry on without using the protection afforded them by the tariff, exchange and primage. It is because we believe that the number of such industries could he very much increased and that primary industries and certain secondary industries which depend on local manufacturers for their equipment or raw material should not, be handicapped heavily for their requirements, that we approve of these proposals of the Government. Valuable secondary industries to Australia should not be handicapped by the granting of undue protection to certain other secondary industries which are worthless. Probably, as the result of the operation of the principles outlined in this report, a few inefficient and inappropriate secondary industries will fail because they arc called upon to meet fresh competition. But our natural and efficient secondary industries will not suffer by the added competition to which they will be subjected by importers. The Leader of the Opposition referred to fencing wire. I think it is probable that if the whole of the present duty on this article were removed, and not merely the 25 per eent. as is now proposed, wire could still be sold in Australia at a lower price than that at w.hich it could be imported from Great Britain. But the price could be still lower if the cost of certain raw material required in its manufacture were not inflated by the granting of protection to other industries for which Australia is unsuited. My second reason for welcoming this report is that I believe that it affords evidence, particularly to our best customer, the United Kingdom, that we are prepared to treat our good customers as friends and neighbours and not enemies. will, in many cases, We do not wish to lay the basis of a war of armaments by starting off with a war of trade. This adjustment was uot specifiment; it brings up to date a great many reports of the Tariff Board which ignored the protective incidence of primage and exchange, and were, therefore, out of line with the agreement. It is true, as the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has told tives, as distinct from the British public, knew perfectly well before they went to Ottawa that the Australian Government considered that, it was in honour bound not to concede general tariff reductions without first having an investigation made by the Tariff Board. It is no less true that the British representatives were led to believe that a revision of the tariff could be pressed on a great deal more rapidly than has proved to be practicable by having to ' pay too if thoroughness is to be observed by the board. i The adoption of a report like this, embracing a great many general circumstances which have arisen since the reports on individual items were submitted to the Government, brings the implementing of articles 9, 10 and 11 of the Ottawa agreement very much more nearly up to date. The way in which the Government has adopted the report by granting immediate preference to our best customer, the Mother Country, and by indicating that foreign countries which are our good customers may also have the benefit of a similar adjustment if it is possible to make a trade agreement with them, is another definite step in the right direction. It is a fair thing for the Government to reserve to itself the right to put foreign countries on the same favorable tariff rate adjustment as British countries, for this matter really goes beyond the actual terms of the Ottawa agreement, although it is, to some extent, a compensation for the difficulties of obtaining detailed tariff revision. If it is a fair thing adoption of this report goes a fair way for Great Britain, in the matter of -quotas, when going beyond the terms of the Ottawa agreement, to give assurances to Denmark, Argentine and other countries, it is a fair thing for this Government to make these reservations in respect of foreign countries. In both respects I welcome that side of the schedule very much indeed. Politically, the tabling of this resolution is a great relief to those honourable members who feared that the non-socialist parties were fast drifting into a hopelessly divided position which would weaken them considerably. I believe that there has been failure on both sides to make due allowances for existing difficulties. We have heard A good deal from members of the Government about the indecency of being requested to make general adjustments in the tariff, as that would mean breaking the election pledges that were contained policy speech. No doubt the Government felt that it was bound by those promises and could not go so far as it was asked to go by deputations, the Country party and myself. I call the attention of honourable members to page 13 of the report of the Tariff Board Mr Hawker. in which it refers to a recommendation made in August of last year, that the primage duty should be removed from protective items in the tariff schedule, and makes other references to its anxiety about the protection of exchange. An opportunity was then afforded to the Government to go a long way towards meeting the requests of the Country party by adopting that recommendation. Certainly when the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) was resisting the amendment that was moved later by the Country party, he mentioned a huge amount, which, he suggested, would be involved, but other Ministers advanced the argument that the. election pledges of the Government precluded it from taking such a step. The Government failed to meet the Country party; and I , knowing as an ex-Minister the attitude of the Tariff Board which is now made public in this report, in common with many other honourable members, doubted its good faith. The to restore that faith. I hope that this is.the beginning of a general effort really to give effect to the Government's election pledges. i When one analyses the extent of these adjustments one can see that they go a fair distance towards' the tariff level of 1921-28, at any rate so far as the incidence of the tariff on the. exporting industries are concerned. There are over 1700 trade descriptions in the tariff schedule, on approximately 700 of which the present British rate is "" free."" To S49 of the others this exchange adjustment will apply. In a great many cases that; will bring the British rate beiow the 1921-28 schedule rates; in others it does not go anywhere near them. The big group of specific duties which were amended by the last governmentapparently by the simple process of multiplying by two because that was the easiest calculation and Ministers were in in the Prime Minister's a hurry-wil l not be taken back to anything like the 1921-2S level and will have ro wait until the Tariff Board has completed its investigation of the whole schedule. This adjustment, however, should go a substantial way in the direction of reconciling the non-socialist parties as welf as of putting some pressure upon our inefficient protected industries. which have greatly depreciated currencies In that way it should help, if only a little, have been very good customers and good towards the average reduction of indusneighbours of Australia. Scares are trial costs in this country. It certainly raised at times as to whether they will goes a great way towards making posremain good neighbours, and it is refreshsible better trade relations with Great ing to find an Australian Government Britain and other countries. I do not intend to vote for the amendfail or not before erecting high tariff ment that has been moved by the Deputy barriers which may prove to be unnecesLeader of the Country party ( Mr sary. Paterson), who claims that the Government is departing from its promise not to alter duties except in accordance with Deputy Leader of the Country party and a recommendation of the Tariff Board; support the adoption of the schedule, but the Government, which has set such which I regard as a most encouraging store by those reports, should certainly instalment of the fulfilment of the accept it. The Government has departed Government's election pledges. Other from the Tariff Board report on the effect pledges of primage and exchange in two respects. come what has been done rather than cry It has applied the downward adjustment out against what might be done -more in the first instance only to British trade. rapidly. This is a handsome contribution to Great Britain, our best customer, and to the best defence of Australian standards. [9.0] I first ask myself whether this Honourable members will be glad to see proposal of the Government is in the best every opportunity taken to better our interests of the greatest number of people trade with Great Britain provided that it in Australia. I should say that any method does not jeopardize the existence of would be proper which would stabivaluable Australian industries.

If other countries which have, from time that is not to, be the result, I cannot ""to time, taken retaliatory measures imagine why so much real satisfaction against Australia. I regret that there is no provision in fought the Government for lower duties. the schedule for making the adjustment I ask myself whether this'Parliament is while Parliament is in recess, should a doing the right thing on behalf of every trade agreement be entered into with section of the Australian people in enter.another country, but possibly the Governing into what, the Minister has rightly adment has this matter in mind. Secondly, the Government is long a long-established and well-tried fiscal sighted and sensible in limiting the uppolicy. I base my attitude on the debate ward adjustment recommended by the which took place in the British House of Tariff Board in respect of duties against Commons last year, when the first 10 per goods from countries whose currency is cent. tariff was introduced and an adniore depreciated than our own.

188,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"soon be -whittled away unless currency was stabilized. I believe that what was then aimed at is what the Commonwealth Government is aiming at to-day. The Country party was on perfectly sound ground in suggesting that the effect of exchange, primage, freight and other factors, should be taken into consideration in fixing the tariff. There is no argument against that contention. believe, however, that those factors should be automatically adjusted so as to preserve the effectiveness of the fiscal policy when properly established. The fear of honourable members who are really protectionists is that, in achieving that object, the effectiveness of the present tariff is likely to be seriously weakened. That fear would not be felt by the Country party, which holds free trade views concerning what is not produced by chose whom its members represent. It is a high protectionist party in regard to primary products, hut a free trade party with respect to everything which primary industries do not produce but have to use as tools of trade.. That may be a sound policy from such au isolated point of view, but I disagree with it from the point of view of the best interests of the whole of the people.

Our export trade, whilst it has not gone up to any appreciable degree, has nevertheless maintained' a higher ratio than that of any other country during recent months. More than all, we are able to say that 250,000 more of our own people arc iu employment than six months ago. That is a great achievement. That is the result of Great Britain's adoption of a protectionist policy. Some honourable members deplore the nationalist point of view, and hope that one of a more international character them.

While this is going on, we propose to experiment with a new formula, the object of which undoubtedly is to weaken the protective incidence of the Australian tariff so that Great Britain and other portions of the British Empire may obtain a larger share of the Australian trade. Surely every other country understands that Australia has the right to be as independent as it can! . The Country party should be careful not to smash the secondary industries of Australia in the hopeless attempt to safeguard its primary industries. The real reason difficulties is the surplus of primary products in the markets of the world. The crushing of our growing secondary industries would not alter that position in the slightest degree. If other countries are adopting a different attitude, surely we are too optimistic if we expect to be able to play a lone hand, to be a Cinderalla among the nations, to be less nationalist than other countries which are frantically trying to extend their markets! ber mention any industry that has been protective policy.

The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) said that four factors which add to the effectiveness of the Australian tariff should he taken into consideration.

If it is not scientific to have such a multiplicity of factors, why not scrap them all and make the tariff protection high enough without them ? That could be done quite easily. Bepeatedly, will be adopted.

199,Mr Holloway,"The cycle trades-In my humble judgment, the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) was distinctly inaccurate when he said that the Tariff Board had inquired into all these items before making its recommendations. There was no up-to-date inquiry. Up to the present we have had no information as to the way in which Australian industries will be affected by the tariff proposals in relation to exchange. The establishment of local industries tends to protect the consumers. Prior to the establishment of our own manufactories, we had to pay excessive prices for imported articles. In one instance, a certain imported commodity which was sold at £25 a ton prior to the establishment of the Australian industry, is now sold at £15 10s. a. ton. There is plenty of evidence to show that the estabto the Old Country. They knew that ouv lishment of industries in this country has protected the rights and the pockets of the consumers. The honourable member for Wakefield seems to think that the only inefficient, people in this community are among the. secondary industries, but let me inform him that many of those engaged in primary industry are far from efficient. He believes that the introduction of these proposals has served to' bring more closely together two parties in this chamber which are antisocialistic. I recommend him to read what the Attorney-General of Victoria had to say about the Country party in that State. Among other things, he said that that party had put forward some of the greatest socialistic proposals ever advocated by any political party. The members of the Country party in this chamber who are strong in their advocacy of a compulsory wheat pool are really socialists. There is a difference between .the Tariff Advisory Board of Great Britain and the Tariff Board of Australia. The British board, established by a protectionist government, has to make inquiries, and if it finds that any'British industry is suffering unfairly from foreign competition, it recommends an increase of duties, which are given effect by the Treasury under the authority of legislation relating to the protection of British industries. The Treasury publishes in the Gazette a notice of the revised duty, which has the effect of law. There is no reason why the Tariff Board of Australia should not function iu the same way. We should look first to Australian industries, and then to Empire trade. When, as Minister for Trade and Customs, I visited Great Britain, many of the British manufacturers and politicians whom I met, there admitted to me that they had not -treated Australia fairly, that 'we had. granted them a liberal preference from 1907 until that time-1930-and that they had made little or no response to our splendid gesture. That was one of the chief reasons why the British delegation at,Ottawa were prepared to lend an attentive ear to the suggestions of the Australian delegation. The British delegation made no demand for this particular concession which we are now extending exchange stood at 25 per cent. There is some hesitancy on the part of the Minister himself in regard to these proposals. He realizes that this is a venture, into au entirely new field, and that ho may be treading upon dangerous ground. were something new. idea of what would happen to Australian industries as a result of giving effect to these proposals. The Attorney-General( Mr Latham) was more definite in his statement, because he admitted that this subject was bristling with difficulties and dangers This committee should, therefore, hesitate before it sanctions this new departure. The Minister has stated that if the proposals relating to exchange are found to be detrimental to Australian industries, he will at once take action to remedy the position. The matter of exchange should not be dealt with by the Government or the Parliament. In nearly every country of the world it, is controlled by experts who know their business. The. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has truly said, on more than one occasion, and the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has repeated that this Government will not interfere with the exchange, that it is a matter for the banking authorities. For the most part exchange is under the control of the Commonwealth Bank, and the weekly press publication to the effect that the exchange of",49,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment

The same condition applied to embargoes and surcharges, but it was always considered that exchange was a matter beyond parliamentary control. None of these four factors should enter into what might be termed a permanent tariff schedule, and 1 certainly object to the tariff proposals relating to exchange and their application to Australian industries in the form of reduced protection.

The honourable member for Wakefield, in discussing this subject, seemed to look beyond this chamber to his constituency. 1 suppose that is a. common practice.

I should not support a proposition of this kind. 1 think that if the Government looked to the constituencies it would not have introduced this proposal either now or later in the l if e of this Parliament. that, the Government has done yet. member's opinion. My view is that it. will endanger the life of tbe Government. I wish to quote two or three statements by gentlemen deeply concerned in both the primary and secondary industries of Australia. It was reported in Monday's press that Mr Oscar Seppelt, the retiring president of the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia, had made the following statement:The external debt itself must he Tcduced substantially from its present staggering total of nearly £000,000,000 on a sterling' basis. Only one practical and sure method of attaining that essential objective is open to the Commonwealth. We must insist on rigid adherence to the fundamental commercial principle that a nation should only buy what it can comfortably pay for. International trade on by that bank. Such any other footing cannot be maintained. To all those who assail us for the erection and primage constitute of adequate fiscal harriers we must make the same answer-that Australia already owes too much to the outside world to incur the risk of adding to that indebtedness by the thoughtless importation of goods which we can and should be making fnr ourselves. Outside that well-defined commitment, there is a liberal field for overseas trade, and particularly in respect to reciprocal treaties, and a continuance of generous aud loyal preference to Britain. This gentleman has left no doubt at all about his view of the Government's proposals. The next extract to which I direct attention is from the annual report of a certain manufacturing concern in Geelong, the name of which I am quite willin g to give to any honourable member who desires it . The report statesDuring the year, the Australian textile industry has been one of the few to enjoy fujll We do not know employment, thanks principally to the measure of protection received, and to the efficient manner in which the manufacturers as a whole have met the increasing demands for improved production. The Australian woollen manufacturers have proved very definitely that, if they are given an opportunity to meet the growing inquiry for quality goods, Australian textiles will not be found wanting. We, therefore, view with great alarm the proposed adjustment of the tariff in relation to exchange. One thing is certain-that any curtailment in the volume of production from nur local textile manufacturers will place the industry in a very precarious position. L know that the gentleman whose signature appears at the foot of that report, as a director of the company, is deeply in terested in grazing and farming pursuits, as well as in manufacturing. Although the honourable member for T h a t is the honourable Wakefield and I have had many discussions on tariff matters, and hold different views on many aspects of the subject, I feel sure that he will agree' with me that it is in the best interests of Australia that all its industries should be kept in efficient working order, and all its people kept in employment. If our industries are to be kept going they must be protected from unfair overseas competition. One of the most serious subjects engaging attention in both the political and social worlds at present is unemployment. Unless this Parliament takes every possible step to protect the industries of this country, it w ill he impossible to provide employment for our",50,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment
203,Mr Paterson,This is the best thing,51,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment
204,Mr Penton,"people. Surely it is the first duty of the Commonwealth Parliament to protect the local market for local manufacturers. I have heen amazed at the suggestion that our markets should be thrown open not only to Great Britain, but also to foreign countries! I give place to no one in my regard for the Mother Land. I have said frequently that Great Britain has done more than any other country for the welfare of mankind. We do well to remember that our forefathers, generally speaking, came from the United Kingdom to pioneer this great country. We have every reason, therefore, to do our utmost to promote the interests of the Old Land. But as one of the outposts of the British Empire, Australia should seek so to build its national edifice that it will be able to stand the strain and stress that may come upon it. if certain eventualities, occur. believe that we can best help the Mother Land by making this country as self-supporting as possible. No one is more interested *han I in the welfare of the primary producers, but we can best serve the interests of the primary producers by establishing secondary industries in the Commonwealth. No policy will be so profitable to Australia as one which will make country. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) and his colleagues often refer to the need for a large populastill be quite adequately protected. tion in Australia. I certainly favour the taking of every reasonable step to increase the population of this continent when times are better. But we shall never be able to have here a strong and virile community unless we do our utmost to establish our secondary industries on fi sound foundation. The proposal of the Country party that the doors of Australia should be thrown open for trade, without restriction, not only to our kinsmen across the seas, but also to foreigners, should, in my opinion, be strongly resisted. I desire to live in peace and amity with the other peoples of the world. So far as it is possible for us to trade with other countries, we should do so. they require some of our products, and we could do with some of theirs; but we must first protect our own industries. [ hope that this Parliament will always Mr Fenton. remember that its first duty is to the people of Australia. Trade and Customs) [9.40] -Ministers are gratified at the reception accorded to their proposals. Generally speaking, they have been well received. Of course, we have heard the usual platitudes from those who believe in prohibition. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde), and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) have said that, if the protection accorded our industries by the incidence of exchange is removed, disaster will overtake us, and. we shall again be faced with an adverse trade balance. It has also been said that the endorsement of these proposals will result in an increase of unemployment. But such prophecies were made in conI nexion with the Ottawa agreement, and proved false. History will repeat itself in this connection. Admittedly we are embarking upon an experiment.; but I assure the committee that the result of it will be closely watched. There is no likelihood of the direful predictions of honourable members opposite being realized. The Tariff Board has made an exhaustive inquiry into the protective this a highly-industrialized incidence of exchange and primage, and has declared that, if these proposals are implemented, Australian industries will towelling? held in respect of those items, but the report is not yet to hand. coming into Australia all the time. which undue importations are occurring, the Minister has the power to call for deposits pending an inquiry by the Tariff Board.

Honourable members may rest assured that our industries will be safeUndoubtedly guarded. It is gratifying to the Government that conditions generally in Australia have improved so greatly during the last few months.

209,Mr White,"In any instances inthan for many years. It was said some time ago that the Government's tariff policy would result in default, because an adverse trade balance was inevitable; but this prophecy, like many others, has proved false. I remind honourable members of every shade of fiscal thought that we can import goods only up to the limit of our exports, less the amount which we have to pay in interest and the value of such goods as are brought here in the form of new capital. The prediction that the Government's tariff policy would cause additional unemployment has proved unsound, for the percentage of unemployment at the end of the last quarter was 25.1, which is lower than that for any quarter since the September quarter of 1930. Our exports are mounting, and our secondary industries are working at full capacity. ""We are paying our way. We havt also been able to reduce taxation to an extraordinary degree. The proposals in the budget provide for reductions of taxation to the extent, of £7,000,000 in this financial year. In these circumstances, the Government can afford to disregard the warnings just voiced. The Leader of the Opposition referred to tools of trade. I have received advice from the Tariff Board only this evening that the exchange adjustment will not have any adverse effect on tools of trade. An application has also been made for a new inquiry into this tariff item, with the object of obtaining a higher duty. Tho Deputy Leader of the Opposition quoted a few sentences from the report of the Tariff Board to the effect that our industries would suffer through the extra overseas competition that they would encounter if the board's proposal were endorsed. But the honourable gentleman did not read the essential sentences in a later paragraph. In fairness to the hoard, I shall read them. They are as follow:The board considers that a reasonable duty to protect an efficient economic industry should be high enough to raise the landed cost of an overseas product to the level which will(a) compensate the local manufacturer , for the higher cost (if any) of Ausreciprocal trade treaties with Australia, I tralian labour; -(b) offset the higher costs (if any) of raw materials and overhead charges; and (e) provide a marginal advantage in favour of the Australian manufacturer. That is perfectly fair. The British manufacturer claims that he should have ""equal opportunities"". recommendations are entirely in accord with the Ottawa agreement, and are indicative of the lines on which the Tariff Board carries out its inquiries. Honorahle members forget that if we promote reciprocal Empire trade we shall have a greater volume of trade, out of which will come additional employment. The honourable gentleman also, advocated that we should convert sterling into Australian currency, and charge the duty accordingly. Although his Government introduced prohibitive duties, it did not dare to take action so drastic as that. I am aware that the then Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) hinted' at such a course, but baulked when he heard the storm of protest that it raised. The only serious amendment that has been put forward is that moved by the Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson) who asks that recommendation 1 shall also be applied to foreign countries, that it should have an automatic equalizing effect when there was any variation of the exchange below 20 per cent., and that the deduction to foreign countries should he the same as that taken from British invoices. That is a strange proposal to come from tbe Country party. After all, our greatest and practically our. only market in these days of'tariff retaliation is Great Britain. Yet the honourable member suggests that we should reduce foreign duties in 'favour of, for instance, the United States of America, and so narrow the chances of Great Britain in competition. ence to Britain would still remain in its entirety. widened by the proposal of the Government, which also opens the door for negotiation with other countries.

213,Mr White,"That preference isagreements. So soon as this proposal is given effect, those negotiations will he the task of the Customs Department, the Commerce Department and the Department of External Affairs. As the result of the preference being widened, there is a proportion of foreign duties available for negotiation which would not otherwise be at our disposal. regard the primage as sufficient to negotiate with ? Mr .WHITE -That is another error into which the honourable gentleman has fallen. The Government's exchange proposal makes a concession of some £310,000 iu revenue; if it were extended to foreign countries it would involve ' concessions which can only be guessed at. concession has been carefully calculated by the Tariff Board and the department. The Government has also given away approximately £585,000 in a preferential primage concession to Great Britain and to certain foreign countries. If it extended the exchange adjustment as the honourable member suggests to foreign countries, and involved itself in further commitments of about £200,000, the primage concession would not be possible. Further, under the Ottawa agreement, it is an obligation that primage shall be abandoned so soon as the financial position allows that to he done. On that argument alone, the honourable gentleman should allow his amendment to lapse. The Government has not sufficient data to allow for such concessions. The amendment would also cut across the principle that our foreign tariff should apply equally to all nations. Let me reply now to the honourable way), and others who feel that this proposal is actuated only by sentiment. Sentiment is a splendid cohesive force, but surely those honourable members know that Ottawa and. other ancillary agreements are founded, not only on Empire sentiment, but also on commercial common sense. The fact that Great Britain has increased its trade with the dominions aud diminished that with foreign countries shows that the Ottawa agreement is at work, and that the forebodings of its critics were ill-founded. Australia has done more than any other dominion in observing undertakings given at Ottawa, and is making the quickest recovery. Although the proposal now before the committee has no direct 'relationship to the Ottawa agreement, it manifests a ready disposition on the part of the Government to open up the channels of reciprocal Empire trade. A greater volume of Empire trade will benefit both the United Kingdom and ourselves, and each individual section of the community in Australia. I urge the committee to accept the Government's proposal and to reject the amendment submitted hy the Country party. We have listened to another diatribe on Ottawa. Ou the slightest provocation, the Minister and his colleagues will describe the Ottawa agreement as a benefit to Australia. Possibly, the Government might have thought that that would be the case, but to date, its promises in this 'direction have not materialized, The Minister brazenly makes a statement which, apparently, he believes will be accepted as true, if it is repeated a suffi-. cient number of times. The Ottawa Conference has definitely failed, and no matter how it is propped up in this chamber by proposals such as that now before the committee, and by other subterfuges, it will not succeed as an instrument for increasing the prosperity of Australia. It would appear that Australian industry is being raped in the name of Ottawa. As on other' occasions, we have to-day the extraordinary spectacle of the Government endeavouring to curry favour with the primary producers, by trying to outdo the Country party in the application of free trade principles. Every time that the "" Oliver Twists"" on my extreme left demand more and still more, this weak and vacillating Government endeavours to placate them. After the "" Oliver Twists"" have got more than they thought would ever be possible, the Government finds them still unsatisfied. This is an impudent attempt on the part of the Country party to kill Australian industry merely for political purppses. Its members have adopted as their shibboleth the cry that, to regain prosperity,",53,Tarif F Proposals 1933 Customs Tariff Exchange Adjustment

218,Mr Blakeley (Darling) [9.53],"we must give preference to, and buy goods on, the cheapest market. But their free trade principles disappear where primary products are concerned, and they are exceptionally strong protectionists when, it comes to rice, wheat, potatoes and the like. The 'Country party seeks to have the incidence of exchange considered when duties are'fixed, so that overseas manufacturers may seud their goods to Australia and compete on a more than favorable basis with our manufacturers. During the last thirteen or fourteen years, various governments have afforded protection to Australian industries. It has been left to this Government to bring down a schedule reducing duties, and now, on pressure being exerted from the Country party, it introduces this proposal. It is a great pity that we cannot have a free trade policy for six months, without sacrificing our secondary industries and workers. I know tliat bef ore the expiration of that term, those in tbe primary industries would demand a return to protection, and that instead of supporting their present representatives, they would use the big stick on them. Under free trade, the farmer paid more for his goods than he does now when he is afforded protection by the existence of Australian manufacturers. To-night, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr from protection, was instrumental in Scullin) gave definite evidence taken'from documents from the British Parliament, that on line after line, the price in New Zealand is higher than it is for similar goods in Australia. Por these reasons, I am strongly opposed to the principle embodied iu the resolution, and shall vote for the amendment. Apparently, the Government is endeavouring to curry favour with the Country party, not yet having learned that, no matter what concessions are made to it, that party will still remain unsatisfied. Its members are rabid protectionists in regard to anything that affects the primary producers, and just as rabid free traders when secondary industries are involved. They are consistent only in their inconsistency. The Labour party has no particular reason for going to great lengths in support of Australian manufacturers, because on every conceivable occasion those manufacturers have done all that they could to advance the interests of the present Ministry. honourable member must deal with the question before the Chair, which is the relation of exchange to the tariff and not the protectionist policy of any party. lieves in the maintenance of a decent standard of living, and intends to oppose these proposals because they will not assist in that direction. Only by the building up of our own industries can such a staudard be assured. We cannot see that any advantage is to be gained from entering into a poverty competition with other countries whose workers have a lower standard of living .than ours. The Government is adopting the surest means of attacking Australian industries. The Labour party believes that provision, should be made in the tariff for the protection of employees, but under the Constitution that is not possible. Wheni t was proposed years ago, the High Court held on appeal that such action was ultra vires the Constitution. honourable member is digressing. wished to give was that a so-called captain of industry, who benefited largely having the case brought before the High Court and frustrating the adoption of the new protection policy fostered by the Labour party.

SIR CHARLES KINGSFORD SMITH. and Treasurer) [10.29] I move That the House do now adjourn. I wish to intimate to honourable members that the Cabinet has to-day decided to ask the Parliament to make a grant of £3.000 to Air-Commodore Sir Charles Kingsford Smith. This grant is to be made in recognition not alone of the aviator's latest achievement, hut of his splendid record of service to aviation in Australia and throughout the world. [10.31] I wish to bring under the the notice of the Minister for the Interior( Mr Perkins) the serious position that has arisen in connection with the vacation of school teachers in the Northern Territory. I asked the Minister a question on this subject this afternoon and he told me that he had no information on the subject at the moment. I have since received the following telegram from the teachers concerned :On sixteenth October staffs .'Darwin Parap Kahlin schools were advised they were no longer eligible for Christinas school vacation of six weeks and with exception of supervisor were detailed off to various offices for duty during that period. Teachers bitterly deplore fact that no opportunity of protesting to Secretary Brown was allowed them though intention apparently known for over a week to few in administration. Neither supervisor education nor visiting inspector was consulted. It is universal custom in tropical countries for teachers to be granted special leave in addition to school vacations. South Australia granted this privilege here before Commonwealth took over. Difficulties of education here are mixed nationalities, lack of English vocabulary, mental lassitude of pupils and floating character of population, all occasioning extra drain on teachers vitality. If time 1.130] for recuperation not allowed teachers standard of educaton must inevitably suffer severely. It will be absolutely impossible to maintain in Darwin' school the standard so highly commended by Inspector ifoorhou.se in nineteen thirty-one. This will possibly have an effect on development of Territory and will jeopardise the future education of every Territory child. Even if temporary clerks are temporarily dispensed with to make room for teachers little saving would result. We ask you in interests of Territory to combat this proposal nnd place these representations before Minister. We consider any interference existing conditions will be detrimental educaton. It is incomprehensible to me that such a drastic and arbitrary alteration of the conditions of these teachers should be made. The existing arrangements have been, in force for two or three decades. I am also surprised that the teachers were not given an opportunity to interview the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, Mr Brown, while he was in Darwin recently. It is extraordinary that these teachers should be denied privileges which are extended to school teachers in every other part of the Commonwealth. In North Queensland where the climatic conditions are unfavorable the school teachers are granted two weeks' leave over and above that allowed for recreation. Scientists have declared that in the matter of humidity Darwin is among the worse localities of the earth. This makes the task of the teachers in the Northern Territory much more difficult and trying than that of teachers in other more favoured districts. Other circumstances also make the work of school teaching exceptionally arduous at Darwin. Children of all nationalities attend the school. Some children are taught one language at home and have to go to school to be taught English. It has been admitted by the inspectors of the Queensland Education Department who visit the schools in the Northern Territory that the educational standard of the children is exceedingly high. This undoubtedly indicates that the teachers do their work most efficiently. I know that children who have been educated in the Northern Territory and have subsequently attended schools in the south to finish their education",56,Pairs

236,Mr Nelson (Northern Territory),"are ingly bright and intelligent pupils. I should like to know who has ""doublecrossed "" these officers who are rendering such valuable service to the community. For what reason should an exception be made in their case to the ordinary vacation rules? School teachers, in my opinion, service to the whole community and should be accorded the best possible treatment. rests upon them, for they are training the citizens of to-morrow. Is the move to place these teachers in offices during the period they should be on holidays an effort to oust a few temporary clerical employees in the Northern Territory? Surely it will be admitted by the Minister that the teachers should have been consulted before such a drastic alteration of their condition of employment was made. If the object of the Government is to make the teachers' conditions unbearable and so get rid of them. I suggest that it should take a more direct means of attaining its end. If the policy of denying the teachers their proper vacation is persisted in, it will mean that only those teachers who are unable to find employment in other parts of Australia will accept appointments in Darwin. I urge the Government to improve rather than break down the conditions of the teachers in this far-distant territory. The children in that part of the Commonwealth have enough hardships to bear without having to suffer the drawback of an inferior education. Unless the school teachers of the territory are granted proper recreation facilities, and leave so that they may recuperate, they will become nervous wrecks. The Primp Minister said this afternoon that he believed in arbitration. I suggest that the teachers should be granted the facilities of arbitration in their present unhappy circumstances. The Government should not adopt roughand-ready methods of this description which must result in spoiling an institution which is of great importance to the rising generation. ter for the Interior) [10.40] I told the chandise honourable member for the Northern Terand the amount of import duty collected ritory ( Mr Nelson) this afternoon that thereon ? always regarded as exceedas I had no information on the subject of the school teachers at Darwin, I was unable to affirm or deny his allegations.

If the honourable member had allowed the matter to remain in abeyance until to-morrow, I should, probably, have been able to make some definite statement on the subject. I find it very difficult to believe that the secretary of the department, Mr Brown, refused to receive a deputation of school teachers while he was in Darwin, for his object in visiting the territory was to confer with the residents, to hear complaints, and to remedy any grievances that could be remedied by him. Mr Brown is at present in Brisbane, and I conversed with him by telephone, but he made no reference to any trouble of this nature. However, I promise the honourable member that I shall have full inquiries made, and communicate the result to him as soon as possible. Question resolved in the affirmative.
