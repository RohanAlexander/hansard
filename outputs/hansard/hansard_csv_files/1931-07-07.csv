If the old home, in which an aged couple have reared their family, is worth over £500, and if they do not wish to lose their pension, all sentiment must be thrown to the wind; they must sell out, and buy a cheaper dwelling.

Many pensioners will be compelled to sell out, and buy cheaper homes, which will enable the spieler, the land agent, and the "" go-getter"" to make an unfair profit over the transaction at the cost of the pensioner. This reduction is an everlasting disgrace to a Cabinet that still has the audacity to call itself a Labour Ministry. When I think of the traditions of Labour, and the fight that we have had in the past to obtain the conditions that the workers enjoy to-day, I am utterly ashamed of this Government. very little toward the provision of old-age pensions. done more for the Labour movement, without remuneration, during half of my lifetime, than the honourable member did for the section that he represents, during the period when he was striving to gain a seat in this House.

An appeal was subsequently made to the people, and Labour was returned to power with an overwhelming majority. The party has since been wrecked, and the policy on which it was returned has become a thing of shreds and patches. This Government has shown its utter incompetence and inability to control the affair's of the nation. Opposition members interjecting, honourable members opposite thirst for the blood of the Government, and at the next they fight for it like mad mullahs. When this measure is enacted, Commonwealth public servants and others in the employ of the Commonwealth Government will lose the privileges which they now enjoy under the arbitration system, privileges of whicli the members of this Government said they would be deprived if the Bruce-Page Government were returned to power at the last general election. As a result of the action which the Government proposes to take in interfering with awards of the Arbitration Court and in laying its hands upon the basic wage, a precedent is being established which will be followed by the capitalistic institutions, and, particularly, the financial institutions, of this country. adopting a principle which may be useful when we have a "" dinkum "" Labour Government in office. . This Government has adopted a policy which even anti-Labour Governments have not had the courage to introduce. It has remained for this alleged Labour Government to interfere with the basic wage, to reduce the invalid and old-age and war pensions, and the conditions under which the maternity allowance is to be paid. The Government has adopted the policy which conservative judges of the Arbitration Court would not tolerate. I hope that when a real Labour Government occupies the treasury bench not be for twenty years. member is as inaccurate in that calculation as he was when he said that he would win the Warringah seat by 10,000 votes, and squeezed in with only a few votes to spare. This bill is a scandal, a disgrace and a degradation unparliamentary, and must be withdrawn. In conclusion, I shall repeat what I said in speaking to the second reading of another measure-that this is Labour's day of degradation and disgrace. The members of the Country party will support the 'Government in carrying out the decisions reached at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held in Melbourne, which are embodied in this bill. We regard this measure as in the nature of a draught of nauseous medicine, which Australia must take as a first step towards its financial recovery, and we think that if we spurn this bitter draught, it will intensify the malady. A sick child is not restored to health by a weak or indulgent nurse who gives heed to the complaint of the child that the doctor's medicine is nasty, instead of insisting that the medicine shall be swallowed. I hope that when a vote is taken on the second reading of this bill there will not be in this chamber too many whose attitude will be that of the weak and indulgent nurse. Eight months ago, I spoke in this The Government is chamber of the need for taking this medicine in much the doses the Government is now prescribing. advocated a 30 per cent, reduction. kind. I advocated a 20 per cent, reduction on all controllable expenditure, and I further said that if the Government did not take its courage in its hands we might get into such an unsatisfactory financial position that even a bigger sacrifice would be inescapable. I said that such a reduction was inevitable, and I believe that had the treatment been undertaken sooner it would have been better for the patient. Eleven precious months have passed since, the previous conference of August last, and during that time we have been financially slipping backwards at a tremendous rate.

28,Mr Paterson,"Nothing of theiu Commonwealtli and State expenditure agreed upon at the last Melbourne conference are made, we shall still not restore budgetary equilibrium. For the financial year just closed, the deficits of the Commonwealth and the States amount to over £30,000,000, almost half of which will be the deficit of the CommonAvealth. We are also told that if the Commonwealth and States were to continue their expenditure as at present for the current financial year, there would be a further deficit on the 30th June next of approximately £40,000,000. If the reductions proposed are made, the position will be only partially met. \ Quorum formed.] The effect of the reductions which are being made will only bridge, to a comparatively small extent, the tremendous gap which lies between our present revenue and our expenditure. Some honourable members have said that if success attends the proposals of Mr of his wages in actual cut, plus a greater Hoover for an international war debt moratorium, and Australia is by this means saved £3,000,000 of interest on war debts, certain reductions need not bo made. I point out that with all the reductions proposed, even with the benefit of the remission of war debt interest, which I trust we shall get, and notwithstanding heavy additional taxation, we shall still have many millions of pounds to add to last year's deficit of £30,000,000 for the Commonwealth and the States. To those who say that the Public Service reductions should be confined entirely to the most highly-paid officers, whom some describe as the "" tall poppies,"" a most striking answer is to be found in the graph which has been circulated and which gives the relative proportions of the different salary groups to the total salaries bill of the Commonwealth. It shows how futile it would be to bring about the 20 per cent, reduction of public service expenditure agreed upon at the Premiers Conference in Melbourne recently by reducing only the salaries of the higher-paid officers. If all the officers in the Commonwealth Public Service drawing over £500 a year worked for nothing the result would be a saving of less than 10 per cent. in the Commonwealth salaries bill. If we adopted the ideas of some of the misguided gentlemen who sit in the corner opposite, and of the notorious Premier of New South Wales, whose disciples they are, and chopped off all salaries over £500 a year, the result in the Commonwealth service would be a saving of only 2^ per cent., whereas the Premiers Conference decisions require a saving of eight times that amount. The graph also shows that Commonwealth Public Service salaries up to £399 a year account for 77.7 per cent, of the total salaries bill, and salaries up to £499 for 90.1 per cent. Salaries of £500 and over represent less than 10 per cent, of the total. When, as a nation, we are compelled to save in millions, it must be obvious that every one must bear a share, and that it is impossible to obtain a sufficient reduction by dealing only with the higher paid officials in the Commonwealth Public Service. If the man on the basic wage outside the Public Service has been compelled to lose 10 per cent, amount than that due to the reduced cost of living index figures, making the total reduction he has suffered over 20 per cent., surely no one inside the Service should regard himself as sacrosanct. I feel sure that there is no honourable member who does not regret very much indeed the necessity to reduce invalid and old-age pensions. Less than eight years ago the pension rate was 15s. a week. At that time revenues were abundant, prices were higher than they are to-day, and the cost of living was dearer. The country could then afford to pay a higher rate, and the Bruce-Page Government felt fully justified in raising the rate from 15s. to 17s. 6d. a week. And two years later, when revenues were still good, and the cost of living still comparatively dear, the same Government again raised the pension to the level of £1. Now, however, when the nation is immeasurably poorer than it was a few years ago, and the cost of living has, to a certain extent, come down, a reverse proceeding on the part of the Government of the day is inescapable. The money cannot be found to continue at the old rate. But what will make it easier for the old people is the fact that the cost of living is to-day lower than it was in 1923 when the pension was increased from 15s. to 17s. 6d. a week. In that year the index figure for food, groceries, and housing, thethree factors upon which wages are fixed, was 1805, whereas for the first quarter of this calendar year it was 1546. There has been a considerable drop. able member regard as a considerable drop? to 1546, which means that with the present reduction the pensioner will be better off than he was when he was formerly receiving 17s. 6d., although he may not be quite so well off as he is to-day with a pension of £1. The small bondholder who has an income no larger than that of a married old-age pensioner couple is to be reduced by a very much higher percentage. I trust that if the Commonwealth finances at some future time permit us to restore the invalid and old age pension to £1, something will also be done for the small bondholder who is keeping himself independent of the pension, but is being hit harder than the pensioner. ber does not seem to be able to get over the hit at the bondholder. of his speech the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) claimed for the' party to which he belongs a very substantial part of the credit for the granting of old-age pensions. ber cannot deny it. elaim for any particular party special credit for the granting or increasing of pensions, but since the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) seems to claim some special credit in that regard for his own party, I shall give him in brief the history of old-age pension legislation-ho w these pensions came to be paid, and when the different increases were made. Legislatieproviding for Commonwealth old-age and invalid pensions was first proposed by a Liberal Government, which went out of ofiice before that legislation could be put into effect. The Labour Government which succeeded held office for only a short period, and it also had no time to put pension proposals into operation. Another Liberal Government then took office, and provided for an old-age pension at the rate of 10s. a week. That rate of pension continued until 1916, when just prior to going to the country the Labour Government then in office increased the pension to 12s. 6d. a week. Subsequently, when the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) was Prime Minister, and during his absence in Great Britain, the Right Honourable W. A. Watt, who was then acting Prime Minister, moved to increase the rate of pensions from 12s. 6d. to 15s. a week. Two more increases in the pension were made during the administration of the Bruce Page Government. Although, therefore, honourable members opposite may claim some credit for giving or increasing the' pension, what has been done is substantially to the credit of those on this side of the House. The honourable member for Werriwa referred to the judiciary and the salaries of its members. I understand that there are certain constitutional difficulties in the way of reducing those salaries, but, if that be the case, I hope that these legal gentlemen will offer to make a sacrifice in conformity with that made by other sections of the community. The remarks of the honourable member for Werriwa about the cost of the judiciary came from a quarter from which they were not to be expected, because only a little while ago 'that honourable member was a member of the caucus which compelled the present Government, practically at the point of the party bayonet, to appoint two additional High Court judges, although the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General both considered that at that time they would be superfluous. Honourable members in the ministerial corner who are complaining about the payment of £60 a week to members of the judiciary, were responsible for adding to that expense by insisting on unnecessary appointments being made when the Prime Minister was in Great Britain. Those honourable members, if they refresh their minds by reading the cables sent by the Prime Minister, will know that the Prime Minister and the . Attorney-General pleaded with the caucus not to make these appointments until their return. The Prime Minister",26,Setup

I come now to Part VI . of the bill. It was with great relief that most honourable members heard, on Friday last, the announcement of the Prime Minister duction of bounties. In the present cirof the Government's acceptance of the cumstances of Australia, the proposed plan unanimously adopted by the reductions are justified, but in respect of Returned Soldiers Pensions Committee. the manufacturers of sulphur and wire Some of the representatives on that comnetting, who are protected by bounties criticism from some of their league members, for agreeing to a reduction of any kind, and I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the members of that committee for the splendid public spirit that they have shown in their desire to help this country in a time of difficulty. The soldiers previously helped this country during a crisis, and now they are repeating their good work. If honourable members were, without exception, prepared to show the same courage in facing the criticism of their constituents, it would make it much easier for this Government to do the right, though unpopular, thing. I hardly thought it possible that a million pounds could be saved without affecting the soldier's own pension or that of the orphan and the widow, and I am particularly glad that that has been found to be practicable. Of course, that does not mean that the soldier pensioners, as a whole, will not. suffer some reduction, because a large percentage of them are some sacrifice because of the reduction in the pensions of their wives and children. It has been said that the unmarried individual pension is not to be reduced, but the figures show that a large proportion of the unmarried soldiers are badly incapacitated. Indeed, it is possible that their incapacity has largely prevented them from marrying. A large proportion of them are so badly incapacitated, that they are unable to undertake the owe a great deal to these men, and no one desires that their pensions should be reduced. I hope that this Soldier Pensions Committee, in its efforts to save a further £281,000, will be helped by those who are in a position to do so, by surrendering the whole, or a portion, of their pensions for the time being. If that is done the sacrifices made by those men will render unnecessary further sacrifices by those who are less able to afford them. Part VIII . of the bill relates to the re-",28,Setup

43,Mr Paterson,"If honourable memin lieu of duties, I hope that the reduction of bounties will not be offset by an increase of duties. Sulphur is an essential constituent of superphosphate, and wire netting is necessary to the man on the land, and if duties are imposed on these commodities the manufacturers' share of the general sacrifice will be passed wholly on to the primary producers. Part VIII. would have been much more complete if it had provided for a general reduction of duties as well as of bounties. The Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) said on Friday last, in justification of the 50 per cent, reduction of the bounty on gold, that the exchange rate on gold to-day is £30 10s. per cent. That argument is equally applicable in favour of a reduction of duties, because the manufacturer has that protection in addition to the ordinary duties. He is getting also the benefit of lower wages, lower rates of interest on bank overdrafts, and high duties, at a time when lower duties would suffice. A few weeks ago, I brought to the notice of the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) the tremendous gap existing between the average prices of primary products and manufactured goods respectively. Taking the prices in 1911 as 100, the average prices of primary products in January last was 117 and of manufactures, 188. I said then that I did not believe that the rehabilitation of Australia's trade was possible until that gap had been closed to some extent. The Prime Minister asked me whether my figures included the tremendous advantage which the export industries are at present enjoying owing to the exchange. I replied that I was satisfied that they did. I have since found confirmation of that statement, because, by April, many months after the exchange had risen to its present rate, the figure for primary products had risen from 117 to 119, and for secondary products from 188 to 193. No general rehabilitation of industry and re-employment of our people can take place until something is done to bring about a greater conformity of the prices for primary and secondary products. So long as the present gap between the two remains, the depression in Australia will continue. The effect of it is that the primary nroducer, to exchange his goods for manuMr Paterson. factured products, has to part with 60 per cent, more than previously. Therefore he is unable to buy the same volume of the products of the secondary industries as he did formerly, and I see no hope of employment being found throughout Australia in the secondary industries until they can afford to sell at prices which those engaged in the exporting industries can afford to pay. So strongly do I feel regarding the need for lowering duties and reducing prices in conformity with the reductions in salaries and the general decrease of the purchasing power of the people, that I would propose an amendmetit in committee but for the limitations imposed by the title of the bill, which declares that the bill is "" to make necessary provision for carrying out a plan agreed on by the Commonwealth and the States"". An amendment relating to tariff duties would not come within that title, and therefore would be ruled out as irrelevant. The only alternative open to me is to move an amendment to the motion for the second reading, but I shall not do that, because I and the members of my party have no desire to help the Lang faction in this chamber to destroy the bill. ""We believe that this legislation, unpleasant though it is, must be enacted, and as a party, we are willing to accept our share of responsibility for doing something which undoubtedly is unpopular, but we believe, is right and inescapable, and something without which Australia cannot possibly be restored to prosperity. Whilst we shall support the bill, I wish to make it perfectly clear that I consider that this portion of the plan, and indeed the whole plan agreed to by the Melbourne conference, is incomplete, because it does not provide for relief in respect of the undoubtedly high cost of production, both primary and secondary. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) referred to restrictions on industry which add tremendously to production costs. I agree entirely with what he said. We have to remove some of the shackles from both the primary and the secondary industries before industry can again become buoyant and work be found for the unemployed. The export trade should not continue to be entirely the responsibility of primary pronot been put into the debates in this duction. ""We should remove the handicaps from industry to such an extent as to enable the big natural industries to play their part in the export trade, and thus help the country to meet its overseas obligations. It is too much to expect one branch of production to get Australia out of its difficulties, while another great branch, which is growing from year to year, is left to the enjoyment of a highly sheltered market without any responsibility in regard to the load of overseas obligations. We cannot, however, expect the secondary industries to take their proper part in the export trade until action is taken to remove some of those conditions which clog their wheels and make production unnecessarily expensive. The members of the Country party regret the omission from the bill of what we regard as a vital part of any plan of rehabilitation, and hope at a suitable opportunity to get from the House an expression of opinion in regard to the reduction of tariff duties. An amendment to the motion for the second reading might only help those whom I believe to be the enemies of Australia to defeat the bill. Therefore, we shall support the measure, although we regard it as an incomplete plan for the economic rehabilitation of Australia. Debate (on motion by Debate resumed. I listened attentively to the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham), and like the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) came to the conclusion that his speech was designed merely to make a show of real opposition to the Government, and thereby placate the supporters of his party outside this chamber. .The alleged Leader of the United party ( Mr One must be quite honest, and admit that Lyons) is absent, and perhaps there is a feeling amongst supporters of the Nationalist party that enough ginger has chamber since the change of leadership. The absence of the honourable member for Wilmot presented an opportunity to his deputy to make a show of hostility to the Government in order to be able to claim that the Nationalists are the parliamentary Opposition. It is obvious, however that he is engaged in a sham fight, for the purpose of creating the impression that the Opposition parties are resisting the Government in some directions, when actually they are very pleased with the policy if has proposed. One may reasonably predict that the Opposition, having forced a so-called Labour government to adopt measures which, after all, are of Nationalist origin, will not show much consideration to its catspaws, should a later opportunity present itself to remove the Ministry from power, because the plums of office will be just as tempting to them as they are to those now enjoying them. held on to ofiice for a long time. in the honourable member's opinion; I am just as good a judge of political tactics as is the honourable member, and I knew which was the proper and fitting time to act, particularly when the demand for my resignation was being made by the however, that I rely on my own judgment in such matters, and I hope that I shall never have to take any advice from the Opposition or accept their policy while I am associated with the Labour movement. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to the policy of the Bruce Page Government, of which he was a member, and emphasized the need for scrapping all our industrial legislation. He put up the case that was advanced at the last general elections. He claimed that while the plan might effect a certain redress of the position, it was not sufficient; that, sooner or later, Parliament would have to accept entirely the proposals which his party had put before the people at the last general election. there has been a definite measure of consistency in the attitude of the honourable gentleman.

MAXWELL -The Bruce-Page Government desired the abolition of the Federal Arbitration Court, leaving arbitration to the State tribunals. Nationalist policy, but we bad had at the time an experience of what would happen under such an arrangement. in New South Wales had already brought about the abolition of rural awards, and various Nationalist iu other States were endeavouring to achieve similar reactionary objectives, so that it was obvious that their intention was to scrap all industrial tribunals, Federal and State. I point out-and this cannot be denied by any supporter of the Nationalist party-that a policy is formulated at the Nationalist conventions that are held. annually, no line of demarcation is drawn betweeu Commonwealth and State as regards the operation of the Nationalist policy, and it is the bounden duty of the party's representatives in Parliament, whether in the Federal or State arena, to endeavour to apply the policy in their own sphere where it is practicable. If that is not so, why are annual conferences held to formulate the general policy of the party? Just before the last general election took place, the Nationalist party was endeavouring to apply to the federal arena a policy that it had already applied in the State of New South Wales. [Quorum formed.] The utterances of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) this afternoon are in line with the objectives of the Nationalist party. plaining that honourable members opposite hold certain opinions; I am contrasting their attitude with the attitude of the gentlemen who at present occupy the It treasury bench. Members of this Parliament went to the polls at the last general election on a definite issue, the retention of the principle of arbitration. I . might very appositely read a passage taken from the Prime Minister's speech, when he appealed to the supporters of Labour in his then role of Leader of the Opposition. He statedThe proposal you are being asked to vote for by the present reactionary Government is nothing less than the abolition in one fell swoop of our federal arbitration system, the system which has grown out of the misery and oppression of the workers; the system which our fathers won for us, and the humanitarian statesmen have given us, building it up, act upon act. was the That conclusively proves that the main issue on which the elections were fought was the retention or abolition of the principle of arbitration. The result of the The Nationalist Government general election is well known Labour was returned with an overwhelming' majority. Naturally, it was expected by organizations those who supported the Labour party that the new Government would be the staunch custodian of arbitration in all its aspects, and would not depart from the principles enunciated by the present Prime Minister when he made his appeal to.the workers for their support. Yet, when after eichteen months of office, the Government has definitely departed from its pledge, and betrayed the trust reposed in them by the workers. The provisions of the bill that is now before the House cut right across the principle of arbitration, in a ruthless fashion, and will do what Labour has always bitterly opposed, by giving to a Minister the right to determine what wages and conditions shall prevail in industry. The Leader of the Opposition is certainly in what must be to him a most agreeable position. A so-called Labour party has destroyed the very thing which it was elected to defend, and which he has always endeavoured to destroy. When next there is an appeal to the country, the honourable gentleman will be able to hold up against the present supporters of this Government decisions of which they have approved which are entirely conI am not comtrary to the pledges upon which Labour was returned to office eighteen months ago.",31,Moloney Adjourned Wheat Marketin Gbill No 2 Moloney And Read A First Time Financial Emergency Bill Second Reading
49,Mr Beasley,"ThatThe Opposition is now in a very favorable position, and if the Deputy Leader gave free expression to his feelings he would declare himself much' pleased at the turn which events have taken. This so-called Labour Government has disregarded its promise to the electors that the salaries of public servants and others uuder semi-government control now covered by Federal or State awards should be determined by arbitration. It has arbitrarily cut back the basic wage, and departed from the policy previously adopted in arriving at that wage. The late Mr Justice Higgins, in the Harvester judgment, laid down a formula for the determination of the basic wage. principle has been safeguarded by Labour. Tear after year, Labour organizations have endeavoured to improve that formula by bringing it up to modern standards. Even during my short term as a member of the Government, representations were frequently made by the trade unions to the effect that the basic wage should not be determined solely on the statistics made available to the Government. Many unions expressed the view that the scope of the Statistician's inquiries was much too circumscribed; that the data on which he worked did not allow justice to be done to the workers. At that time the Government was anxious to investigate the subject exhaustively, in order that the interests of the workers should be safeguarded; but now it has changed its views entirely, and jettisoned the formula altogether. I suppose that the services of Professor Giblin will not be needed any longer when this measure has gone through, as no statistical inquiry of any kind will be required to determine the index figures for the basic wage of the salaries of public servants. The Government has decided to take off the £34 cost of living allowance, and then superimpose other reductions. We hear a good deal about constitutional practice in these of adherence to Labour principals is being matters. I am given to understand that, while, according to regulations, it is not proper to grant cost of living allowances retrospectively, a reduction of that allowance is to be given retrospective application. Time after time the unions have asked that their claims should have retrospective application, but have been ruled out of court on the grounds that the Constitution did not permit of it. Now, when it suits this Labour Government to apply a reduction retrospectively, the Constitution is thrown aside. Perhaps this is being done because it is thought that the trade unions have not sufficient money to fight an action against the Government through the courts. Not only is the Government going to interfere arbitrarily with wages in a general sense; it proposes also to save £1,000,000 from what is termed "" miscellaneous expenditure "". I hope that when the bill reaches the committee stage details will be given as to, what "" miscelHow jealously that laneous expenditure"" really comprises. Embodied in it, no doubt are many concessions that have been won by the Public Service, merely because they have been able, by using their numerical and financial strength, to see that justice was done to them. It is remarkable that a Labour government, which owes its existence to the strength of trade unionism, should now be the destroying agent in this matter. Obviously, the Government has accepted entirely the policy of the Nationalist party. That is why the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) concluded his remarks this afternoon by saying that he would support all the proposals embodied in this plan. His conscience enables him to do so, as they are Nationalist proposals. approved by the Labour Governments of Victoria and South Australia? governments. termine whether those are or are not Labour governments.

The Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson) went to great pains to justify the reduction of wages proposed by this measure; there seemed to be nothing else in his mind. But he uttered not a word as to the possibility of workers living on £2 or £3 a week. AH that mattered to him was that the great bulk of public servants in receipt of but moderate incomes should have their wages cut. He did *not consider whether it would be possible for those people to exist on the wages they would then receive, or whether they could keep up their superannuation and unemployment tax payments. All he thought of was ""Let us get at them so that we can cut their wages "". The honourable gentleman, however, went to some lengths to plead for the "" unfortunate"" bondholders. That seems to be an obsession with him, for on each occasion that he has spoken to measures of this description during the past two weeks, he has referred to these "" unfortunate"" bondholders. It is interesting to see who some of those people are. The Premier of New South Wales made known the names of a few of these unfortunate bondholders, and I think we ought to have them recorded in the Commonwealth Hansard, so that those who follow events may know them. Speaking of these unfortunate, bondholders, when the proposal for dealing with tax-free securities was under discussion, he said""We have Sir Alexander MacCormick with his £17(5,500,"" said Mr Lang, "" I s he a poor he ever thought of coming here. 1 person whom we should help?

57,Mr Beasley,"The honourable membefore anything was ever done for old-age pensioners and invalids by the interests represented by honourable members opposite, the Labour party had been endeavouring to mould public opinion, and to rectify the wrongs from which these people suffered. The Labour party succeeded in its endeavours, and it was the weight of public opinion, as developed inside and outside Parliament, that forced the governments of the day to recognize the claims of those now in receipt of pensions. In the older countries, and no doubt in that from which the honourable member for Gippsland comes, those claims have not yet been recognized, and the needy aged must perforce seek shelter in the poor houses. Even in this country, many who are unable to obtain relief have to resort to a similar course. Yet, when we try to defend the interests of those who have obtained some small measure of justice after so long a fight, honourable members opposite with the concurrence of the Government cry stinking fish. When the opportunity presents itself, as it does now, Although the plaii bears the name of the to force conditions down again to the old level by economic pressure,, honourable members opposite, and the interests they represent, are only too glad to avail themposals are as follows:selves of it. I can assure them, however, that we will continue to fight for the old and the infirm who have no other protectors, and we want no guidance from those who have been politically opposed to ns ever since political parties took form in Australia. I trust that I shall never accept direction or advice on these matters from honourable members opposite. Before discussing the contents of this bill, I feel that it is necessary to make some reference to the change in policy of the Government. We need only go back two or three months to the time when the Government formulated its monetary policy, and declared its intention to stand by it. After the New South Wales elections, when the people endorsed the Lang proposals, the Treasurer of the Commonwealth ( Mr Theodore) was forced to announce .a definite policy, one which is well known to honourable members on both sides of the House. Many honourable members on this side honestly and. sincerely believed that when the Treasurer advanced those proposals for monetary reform a few months ago, he intended to carry them out faithfully. He has not done so, however, and he has left his New South Wales supporters high and dry. The Government announced its intention to stand or fall by those proposals. It said that it would pass the proposals through this House, and send them forward to another place. If they were rejected there, it would take steps to test the feeling of the people on the issue. It believed, it said, that the time had arrived when the people should be given an opportunity of declaring whether the elected representatives were to control the Government, or whether it was to be controlled by private banking institutions and the Commonwealth Bank Board. The Government professed to believe that the psychological moment had arrived to test this issue at a general election. What has become known as the Gibbons plan was before the Labour party, and the Government formulated its policy largely upon that plan. bons), the Treasurer was, largely responsible for its creation. The Gibbons pro(1.)

58,Honourable Member For Calare ( Mr Gib,"The Government's proposals, based on the Gibbous plan, were submitted to the Commonwealth Bank Boardi n February of this year, while the Premiers' Conference was sitting in Canberra, and the board rejected them. The board carried a resolution stating that, subject to the Government making adequate cuts in social services, salaries and pensions, it would continue to provide financial support. The Government, in a bulletin issued about this time, commented upon the resolution of the Commonwealth Bank Board as follows:The Gibbons proposals submitted to the Commonwealth Bank Board were rejected. The Government was not prepared to accept onerous conditions imposed by the Bank Board, namely, drastic reductions in war, old-age and invalid pensions, public service salaries, and social services. That was only four months ago. All honthen, has it now surrendered? Why has orable members on this side of the Housei t agreed to accept a policy which only expected that the Government intended four months ago it violently denounced, a to proceed with its policy, that there policy which the Leader of the Governwould be no cutting of pensions and ment informed the Labour party they wages, and that if it failed, the people would never accept?

The bulletin continuedThe Federal Government's monetary policy for the rehabilitation of Australian finances is daily gaining ground and support for it has been received from world-wide economists, such as Professor Custav Cassel], of Stockholm University, an authority on exchange and international movements of capital.

60,Mr Beasley,"I have not seen anypolicy of the Bank of England. Extracts from that report which have been published in Australia show that the committee did not advocate wage or salary reductions as a remedy for the present trade crisis, and that a majority of the committee was opposed to the policy of the Bank of England. I emphasize that the committee comprised the greatest financial experts in Britainmen not associated with the Labour party. The following extract from remarks made by Lord D'Abernon was also published recently:The Central Banks have so far failed in what should he their main, objective-the maintenance of price stability and restoration may be that the members of the judiciary, of prices approximately to the 1928-29 level as the only practical means of avoiding a very grave political and social danger. Wo must discard the mugwump notion that deflation is respectable and virtuous while anything that can be termed inflation however unjustly is immoral and disreputable. The report goes on to show that the trend of events has been against the policy originated by the Bank of England. When, a few weeks ago, I mentioned in this House the association of Sir Bobert Gibson with the policy of the Bank of England, I was referring to what Sir Robert Gibson himself had said in my presence when I was a member of the Government. Sir Robert Gibson has endeavoured, through the agency of the Oommonwealth Bank, to give effect to the policy of the Bank of England. Although that was denied by the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr they are working that the employees of Crouch), the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan), when speaking of banks in Western Australia, made it clear that their policy had been dictated by the Bank of England. Why has the Government surrendered the policy which it once believed to be necessary for the rehabilitation of the finances of the country? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) smiles when he reflects on the Government's change of front, and its acceptance of the policy he has advocated. In deed, the Government has gone further than the honourable gentleman proposed to go in October last. The present so called Labour Government presents a sorry spectacle to tbe country."" During the course of a speech made by the Treasurer (Mi-. Theodore), I asked whether the proposed salary reductions would apply_to the judiciary. According to the unrevised proof of the honourable gentleman's speech, he answered that the judiciary would share in the cut that was to be made. The Treasurer has no right to attempt to mislead the House. If , as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition states, the salaries of the members of the judiciary are protected by the Constitution, and those gentlemen are to suffer no reduction in their emoluments, it is well that those who will be called upon to make sacrifices should know it. It like the judges of Victoria, will make a voluntary sacrifice only after considerable pressure is brought to bear upon them. Only at the.last moment did the Victorian judges agree to any reduction of their salary. Another departure from Labour principles is contemplated by the Government. It proposes to vest in a Minister of the Crown the right to determine the rates of pay and conditions of employment which shall prevail in any industry not specifically controlled by the Public Service Arbitrator. The new proposals will apply to the employees of the Cockatoo Island dockyard who are now working under both Eederal and State awards. The bill provides that the Minister may so interfere with the awards under which the dockyard may be placed at a decided disadvantage as compared with workers, say, at Mort's Dock. A Labour Minister is to be given the powers of an Arbitration Court judge; he will be able to set aside or to regulate even State awards to the detriment of those now working under them! what Minister these powers will be vested; it will probably be the Minister for Defence. The Government will use his knowledge, and his training in the Arbitration Court, to destroy many things which he at one time assisted to build up. Time will determine which Minister will be given these powers, i It",36,Moloney Adjourned Wheat Marketin Gbill No 2 Moloney And Read A First Time Financial Emergency Bill Second Reading

62,Mr Beasley,"I do not know inwill then be for us to let his constituents know his attitude in regard to these matters. Reference has been made to the taxation of federal public servants by the States. I am not complaining about that; but it would appear that these proposals will mean that public servants will be called upon to bear more than their fair share of the sacrifice. It would be interesting to see what would happen should the Constitution permit the States to pass legislation to exempt State public servants from Commonwealth taxation. I leave it to constitutional authorities to say whether that power exists. It would be interesting if New South Wales passed legislation to exemnt State public servants from Commonwealth taxation. that. M.r. BEASLEY -It might be worthwhile for them to try. If those who would suffer have not the means at their disposal to employ legal talent to argue their case, they will be forced to bear an undue share of the burden. Very little was said by the Treasurer about the proposed reductions of pensions. .It is now proposed that old-age and war pensions shall be treated as income. That proposal establishes it beyond doubt that there is no sentiment attached to war pensions; that they have been considered only from the point of view of pounds, shillings and pence. As I pointed out when speaking to the Debt Conversion Agreement Bill, the ful l effect of this legislation on pensioners will' not be realized until it has actually been put into operation. On the face of it, the proposal is merely to reduce pensions of 20s. a week to 17s. 6d. a week, and pensions of 5s. a week to 2s. 6d. a week; hut it will go further, for many who are now receiving pensions will, under the new scheme, receive no pension at all. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr reaping the whirlwind. Scripture truly Lazzarini) pointed out that, by taking into consideration the value of the homes of pensioners, the Government will take pensions from many persons now receiving them. When the bill reaches the committee stage the group to which I belong will members who, even under these proposals, endeavour to secure further information, will still have £800 a year, to cheer up; not in the hope of defeating the measure, but with a view to directing the attention of those who will suffer injustices under it to what the Government intends, and also to give us an opportunity to rally invalid, old-age and soldier pensioners and their friends in opposition to such proposals. The result of the appointment of a committee to deal with soldiers' pensions will be that the soldiers will be sold. I remind the Government that those persons in the community who, under the proposals contained in this bill, are to receive reduced pensions, are a force to be reckoned with. That force will be rallied, and I hope that it will speak with no uncertain voice when given the opportunity to do so through the medium of the ballot-box. measure which we have before us is a tragic one; the more I reflect upon it the more I dislike it. Nevertheless, I can see no other way out of our difficulties than that contained in what is generally called "" the plan "". It i the past forms of inflation have been advocated as a means of meeting the difficult situation in which Australia is placed; but I have never agreed with the views of those who. advocated them. In my opinion, the plan placed before us offers the only hope of our financial salvation. That being the case, I support the bill. While it is regrettable that old-age pensions should be reduced from £1 to 17s. 6d. a week, it is better that that reduction should take place than that pensioners should be forced to accept 12s. a week or, perhaps, receive no pension at all. The same remark applies to the pensions of soldiers and invalids. I can understand the attitude of honourable members in the ministerial corner when they see a Labour government apparently destroying things which they have helped to build up in the past. We have sown the wind and now we are says, "" As a man sows so shall he reap "". As a people, we have been extravagant; and, as a consequence, we are now forced to make sacrifices.",37,Moloney Adjourned Wheat Marketin Gbill No 2 Moloney And Read A First Time Financial Emergency Bill Second Reading

It is useless to whistle to keep we shall reach the millennium so quickly. up our courage. As I have said, this is a tragic measure, and I regret that circumstances compel me to support it. My objection to it is not that it means a reduction of my salary; I am thinking of those who will be less able than I to bear the burden that they will be calledupon to bear. The proposals before us include a reduction of the wine bounty. I warn the Government of the danger of undoing all the good that it did when it increased the bounty. [Quorum, formed.'] To provide for the wine bounty there is levied on the industry a special tax in the form of an increase in the excise duty. This 'proposal to interfere with that arrangement is further evidence of the intention of this Government to break faith with the people. South Australia derives no benefit from the high tariff, with the exception of the wine bounty and the grant made by the Commonwealth as compensation for the disabilities suffered by that State under federation. The withdrawal of the bounty of 4 l/5d. per gallon will make more precarious an industry which for some years has been facing a very serious position indeed. am not prepared to vote against the bill because of its provisions with regard to a reduction of old-age, invalid and war pensions, I cannot oppose it on the ground solely that it. will make more difficult the position of those engaged in the wine industry. I do uot altogether approve of the window-dressing title of the bill. is evidence of the handiwork of the we are informed, is designed "" to make necessary provision for carrying out a plan agreed on by the Commonwealth and the States for meeting in Australia, re-establishing financial stability, and restoring industrial and general prosperity."" I cannot see bow it will restore prosperity unless it is anticipated that substantial indirect benefits will be enjoyed by the people generally cial position. But I cannot believe that I am afraid that we shall have to travel for a long time along a dreary road, beset with many hardships, before we overcome the diniculties that confront ns. I very much regret that the measure contains provisions to reduce payments to old-age pensioners living in their own homes. It stipulates that for every £10 by which the home of a pensioner exceeds the value of £500, there shall be a deduction of his pension by £1 per year. This will be a very troublesome and vexatious provision to operate, and I am afraid that honourable members will be much worried by representations from these aged and deserving citizens protests ing against the reduction. It will definitely discourage thrift. Those to suffer most will be the owners of small farm properties. In all but a few cases the land and home would be worth over £500, but if this new provision is applied to them, many will be ih a serious position. I come now to another matter upon which I intend to speak at some length, namely, the travelling allowances drawn by members of the Ministry. Recently, feeling that the time had come when all sections of the community should be compelled to observe the strictest economy, and in view of the fact that the Government had announced its intention to reduce old-age, invalid and war pensions, I decided to inquire what economies might be possible in the allowances paid to Ministers and others. I was amazed at the return furnished a week or two ago in reply to questions asked by the honourable It member for Hunter( Mr James) with reference to this matter. I also asked a question, and last week spoke on this subject ou the motion for the adjournment of the House. ^ The right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) has stated that in many instances Ministers the grave _ emergency existing have not drawn one-third of the amount which they might properly have charged against the Commonwealth.

69,Treasurer ( Mr Theodore),". The measure,apply to it a much stronger term. I have gone to a good deal of trouble to ascertain the exact position. Ministers, we are informed, now charge £1 10s. per day instead of £2 2s., and the Prime Minister £2 per day instead of £3 3s. It is about time that the whole of these allowances were discontinued.' I also challenge the statement of the Prime Minister that Ministers have only drawn one-third of the amount which they were entitled to charge. examination of the figures, I submit that, except in the case of a few Ministers, it would be impossible to prove that they have drawn less than one-third, or one-fifth, of the amount which they could have drawn, even if they had been absent from Canberra on official business for every day except Sundays and the days when the House was sitting. I invite attention in the first place, to the allowances drawn by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Eorde). The return furnished by the Prime Minister shows that this Minister, up to the 24th June, drew in travelling allowances £525 16s. He was sworn in as a Minister on the 23rd October, 1929. Erom that date until the 24th June, he had been a Minister for 609 days. If we subtract Sundays, 87; the days when the House was in session, 161; and days for which travelling allowance was drawn at £2 2s. per day, 250, we get a total of 498 days. From this we find that he drew the allowance for 250 days out of a possible 361 days. That certainly was not a case of only charging one-third of the amount properly chargeable. I suggest that the Minister did very well indeed out of his allowances. ister charge travelling allowance? because of our difficult financial position, certain Ministers who seem to be making we are obliged to cut old-age pensions by 2s. 6d. a week, Ministers receiving from £5 to £6 per day, including Sundays, are not justified in drawing an additional £2 2s. per day when travelling. I go further and say that in these times the heads of departments and, in fact, all public servants in receipt of salaries over £750 a year, should not charge travelling allowances when travelling in connection with their work. I come now to Senator Daly, who has drawn £382 4s. He was sworn in on the 23rd October, 1929, and lost his position in the Ministry on the 3rd March, 1931, so that he was a Minister for 497 days. If we subtract Sundays, 71; the days when the Senate was in session, 78; and the days for which travelling allowance was drawn, 182, we get a total of 331, and find that he drew travelling allowance for 182 days out of a possible 348 After a careful days. It should be noted, also, that he was ill for some time, and was in hospital for several weeks. Moreover, the period included two Christmas vacations, when he would be at his home. I turn now to the amount drawn by the former' Ministeifor Repatriation ( Mr Anstey). His account against the Commonwealth was £369 12s. He was sworn in on the 23rd October, 1929, and lost his position in the Government on the 3rd March, 1931, so that he was a member of the Ministry for 497 days. Subtracting Sundays, 71; days when the House was in session, 112; and the days for which travelling allowance was drawn, 176, we get a total of 359. This shows that he drew the allowance for 176 days out of a possible 314 days. That certainly was more-than one-third of the allowance properly chargeable against the Commonwealth. ber been up all night getting this information ? necessary I should not hesitate to do even that to prevent the Prime Minister or any one else ""putting it over me."" My main purpose is to point to possible economies with a view to lifting some of the burden which rests upon our taxpayers, and in doing this I am entitled to direct criticism against the action of a good thing out of travelling allowances. I turn now to the present Postmaster General( Mr A. Green). He has drawn in travelling allowances £359 18s. He was sworn in on the 23rd October, 1929, and, therefore, was in the Ministry for 609 days up to the 24'th June, the date of the return. If we subtract Sundays, 87; the days when the House was in session, 161; and the days for which travelling allowance was drawn, 171, we have",39,Moloney Adjourned Wheat Marketin Gbill No 2 Moloney And Read A First Time Financial Emergency Bill Second Reading

73,Mr Gabb,"No; but if I found ita total of 419, and find that he drew the allowance for 171 days out of a possible 361a little more than one-half. Another substantial account was that charged by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), who for some time was Assistant Minister, and drew in travelling allowance £320 4s. do that? for West Sydney was sworn in on the 23rd October, 1929, and lost his position in the Ministry on the 3rd March, 1931, so that he was in the Ministry for 497 days. If we subtract Sundays, 71; the days when the House was in session, 112; and the days for which the travelling allowance was drawn, 152, we have a total of 335, and find that he drew the allowance for 152 days out of a possible 314. This, too, despite the fact that for a considerable portion of that time he was engaged in the Parkes and East Sydney by-elections. member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) draw more than 17s. 6d. per week? The next case I shall deal with is that on the day the journey is commenced. of the Honourable J. A. Lyons, formerly Postmaster-General. He was sworn in on the 23rd October, 1929, and resigned on the 30th January, 1931. He was thus 465 days in the Ministry. Subtracting from this total the Sundays, 66, the days the House was in session, 112, and the days for which travelling allowance was drawn, 141, we get a total of 319. The honourable gentleman thus drew allowance for 141 days out of a nossible 287, winch was more than the percentage mentioned by the Prime Minister( Mr abroad, 157, the days the House was in Scullin), even assuming that a claim could be made for every day, excepting the days I have excluded. I shall deal next with the Minister for Home Affairs( Mr Blakeley). This honourable gentleman drew £275 2s. He was sworn in on the 23rd October, 1929, and up to the 24th June, 1931, the date of the return, he had been in the Ministry 609 days. Subtracting from this total the Sundays, 87, the days the House was insession, 161, and the days for which travelling allowance was drawn, 131, we get a total of 379. The honourable gentleman thus drew for 131 days out of a possible 361. [Quorum formed.] Here is the first evidence of any approach to the one-third to which the Prime Minister referred. The 131 days is near enough to one-third, if the Minister had been travelling and had drawn for every possible day; but the Minister had not travelled every day. This Minister has his home at Canberra, where he and his family live. Nevertheless, I am glad that he has not ""grabbed"" as much as some of the other Ministers. His figures in this respect are better than those of the Ministers who live in Melbourne. The inference I draw from that is that the Ministers who live away from Canberra do draw travelling allowances when going to and coming from their home3, although the Prime Minister has denied that this is so. In the light of the figures which I have quoted, I challenge the right honourable gentleman to substantiate his statement in this respect. I am satisfied, from my examination of the fiVures, that expenses equivalent to at least one day have been claimed for the journey to and from Melbourne, although the Prime Minister has said that nothing is paid from 4 p.m. until after midnight The next case is that of the Minister for MarketsC Mr Parker Moloney). This honourable gentleman drew £247 16s. He was sworn in on the 23rd October, 1929, and up to the 24th June, 1931, the date of the return, he had been in the Ministry 609 days. He was absent from Australia from the 25th August, 1930, until the 30th January, 1931, a total of 157 days. Subtracting from the total of 609 days the Sundays, 64, the days session while he was in Australia, 137. and the days for which travelling allowance was drawn, 118, we get a total of 476 days. The honourable gentleman thus drew travelling allowance for 118 days out of a possible 251 days, which is a little better than half. But even if he were absent on official business for every one of the 251 days, and-did not draw for the other 133 days, he would still not be in the one-third, let alone the one-fifth, sacrificial class mentioned by the Prime Minister.

77,Mr Gabb,"O h yes, much more.this Minister for the five months he was absent from Australia. I do not know what allowance he drew during that time. I come now to the case of Senator Barnes, who drew £241 10s. This honourable gentleman was sworn in on the 23rd October, 1929, and up to the 24th June, 1931, the date of the return, he had been 609 days in the Ministry. Subiracting from that total the Sundays, 87, the days the Senate was in session, 1.06, and the days for which travelling allowance was drawn, 115, we -et a total of 30S. The honourable senator thus drew allowance for 115 days out of the Possible 4.16. This is near enough to one-third of the possible total if the honourable gentleman had been travelling on official business on every day except those for which I have accounted. I do not think that any one would, for a minute, regard that as a possibility. However, I am glad that Senator Barnes has not been as hungry as some of his colleagues. The next case is that of the Attorney£179 l is . He was sworn in on the 23rd General( Mr Brennan), who drew £241 10s. He was sworn in on the 23rd October, 1929, and up to the 24th June, 1931, the date of the return, he had been 609 days in the Ministry. He was absent from Australia from the 17th July, 1930, until the 6th January, 1931, a total of 174 days. Subtracting from the total of 609 days, the Sundays, 62, the days abroad, 174, the days the House was in session, 119, and the days for which travelling allowance was drawn while he was in Australia, 115, we get a total of 470. This honourable gentleman thus drew travelling allowance for 115 days out of a possible 254. That is a little better than one-half of the possible, but a long way short of the one-third or the one-fifth mentioned by the Prime Minister. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. {'Quorum formed.'} in my view, no Commonwealth employee or -parliamentarian in receipt of £750 or more per annum should draw travelling allowances. In the figures supplied to me relating to the travelling allowances of the Attorney-General( Mr Brennan), the amount paid in connection with his recent six months' trip abroad was not given. I now propose to refer to the allowances drawn by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton). when he was a member of the Government. These amounted to £184 16s. He was sworn in on the 23rd October, 1929, and he resigned on the 30th January, 1931, having been in the Ministry 455 days. He was absent abroad from the 6th December, 1929, until the 2nd July, 1930; a matter of 207 days. There were 35 Sundays, 207 days when the honourable member was abroad, and 60 days when the House was in session. One finds, therefore, that the honourable member drew the allowance at £2 2s. a day for 88 days out of a possible 153 days, which is a little more than half. In this instance, also, the allowance was not drawn on only one-third or one-fifth of the number of days when it might have been taken, as was suggested by the Prime Minister. I now examine the allowances paid to the Prime Minister himself. He drew October, 1929, and up to the 24th June, last, he had been a Minister for 609 days. He was absent abroad from the 25th August, 1930, to the 6th January, 1931, or 157 days. In the period of 609 days there was 64 Sundays, 157 days when the Prime Minister was absent abroad, and 137 days when the House was in session, and the Prime Minister was in Australia. Thus the Prime Minister drew the allowance of £3 3s. for 57 days out of a possible 251 days. His is the only case except one in which a Minister drew only one-fifth of the total possible sum, and for that I ' think that he is to be highly commended; but no one will claim that the Prime Minister was absent from Canberra on every possible day. The right honourable gentleman stated in the House the other day that the £3 3s. a day to which he was entitled by way of travelling allowances while attending the conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers in Melbourne would have exceeded the total allowance that he had drawn. I question that statement, but I do not intend to examine it in detail. WhatI wish to know is why the Prime Minister, wlien receiving a salary of about £7 a day, every day in the week, should be entitled to collect an additional £3 3s. a day as a travelling allowance,",41,Moloney Adjourned Wheat Marketin Gbill No 2 Moloney And Read A First Time Financial Emergency Bill Second Reading

There were also days when 1931. From the 406 days spent as a Ministers were in Canberra, attending member of the Ministry, I subtract 5S Cabinet and caucus meetings, and when Sundays, 116 days when the House was the House was not sitting. There were in session, and 75 days for which the also days spent by Ministers in their own travelling allowance was drawn, a total electorates trying to make their seats of 249 days. This calculation shows that secure. I sincerely hope that they the Treasurer drew travelling allowances do not charge travelling expenses on for 75 days out of a possible 232 days, those occasions; other honourable members or about one-third of the number of days are not entitled to do that. In addition, for which he might have collected the there were days, other than Sundays, allowance had he travelled on public busiwhich Ministers spent in their own homes. ness on every possible day. I frankly admit that I was surprised and pleased officer investigates the conditions under when I saw those figures. But I do not which these allowances are made; but I admit that the Treasurer was entitled am not prepared to accept that assurance. to three times the amount paid to him. The Minister for Defence( Mr that he left Melbourne in an aeroplane Chifley) drew £50 8s. He was sworn in one afternoon and returned to Melbourne on the 3rd March, 1931, and was in the early in the morning of the third day, Ministry for 112 days up to the 24th and his travelling allowance was made out June, the period for which the return as £6 6s., or at the rate of £2 2s. a day for was prepared.

""When the ex-Minister, to whom I have referred, drew the department's attention to the fact that he had been given three days' travelling expenses, the officer replied, "" That is the rule "". I claim that it is high time that rule was altered. Th.e time is rotten ripe when neither public servant, nor parliamentarian receiving £15 a week, or more, should be paid these allowances. that "" welter "" was a racecourse term. I believe that a welter has been made of it by several members of the Government, and that they have selfishly availed themselves of the oonortunity to draw this allowance. I remind the Government that "" welter "" has several meanings, one of which is, "" To tumble about, or wallow as a hog in the mire "". Returning to the consideration of the position of the old-age pensioners under this bill, I hope that the House will not agree to the proposed reduction to £500 of the value of the home that may be held by an old-age pensioner without his being regarded as having property that affects his pension. I ask honourable members to consider this matter carefully. I am prepared to vote for the adoption of the Government's general plan of reductions; but, if I get a chance, I shall vote against this particular proposal when the bill is in committee. Let us assume that a widow owns a house valued at £700, and is now drawing a pension of £1 a week. It is proposed that for every £10, in addition to the first £50, by which the value of her house exceeds £500, her pension shall be reduced by £1 per year. In this case the extra value amounts to £150, which would cause a reduction of £15 a year, or 5s. 9d. a week, in the pension. So, instead of sufit effective. fering the general reduction of 2s. 6d. a week, this widow will receive a cut of 8s. 3d. a week, reducing her pension from £1 to lis. 9d. a week. Talk about equality of sacrifice! The proposal is grossly unjust strongly oppose. I doubt if the Governbecause it means a cut of 40 per cent. A widow may own the cottage in which she lives; but she cannot eat wood, stones, and mortar. If she sold her property, she could only do so at a tremendous loss. This reduction would almost crucify some of the pensioners because of their thrift in from the exercise of the power which this providing a home for their old-age. Mr Gabb. With the views expressed by the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) and the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) I concur. We find ourselves in disagreement with the entire provisions of the bill before us, inasmuch as it is devoted to a reduction first, of wages and salaries; secondly, old-age, invalid and soldiers' pensions; The Prime Minister said and, thirdly, the maternity allowance. But behind these reductions there are causes of the utmost gravity, which it ia necessary that we should recognize and state. First of all, the bill represents an entire acceptance on the part of the Government of bankers' demands. In the next place, there is a complete surrender to the antihuman economic system of the day to fight which the Labour movement was brought into existence. Also, there has been an abject worship of the point of view, the ethics and the psychology of forces which we consider are avowed enemies of humanity and of Labour. I refer to the unquestioned acceptance by the Government of the authority of university professors, statisticians and the like. I propose to refer briefly to each of those. In respect of the first item, we have to recognize and admit that the bill proposes what is in the nature of an. arbitrary application of wage and salary reduction; consequently it violates the entire .principle of arbitration and conciliation, which is one of the chief planks in the platform of the Labour movement. The maintenance of that principle was the only issue at the last federal elections, and the present Government was elected and pledged to protect, support and make The proposals of the Government bring into force ministerial authority over wages and salaries, in a way that we ment has realized what a dangerous principle has been incorporated in that portion of the bill. It is possible that an anti-Labour Government will be in office after the next elections. Has the Government realized what effect is going to follow measure seeks to place in the hands of a Minister in an anti-Labour Government,",43,Moloney Adjourned Wheat Marketin Gbill No 2 Moloney And Read A First Time Financial Emergency Bill Second Reading
83,Mr Eldridge (Martin) [8.15],"agaiust Che wage and salary-earners of this country? As an example of the extent to which the Government has' unfortunately surrendered its Labour principles, we find that, among other things, there is provision for the appointment of a committee for the deciding of certain wage cuts. These, I understand, are to cover employees who are not provided for within the functions of the Public Service Arbitrator. It seems to me that this is to be what might be termed a handpicked committee. It is curious to notice that in the composition of the committee there is no intention of having a representative of the workers, unionists or otherwise. May I remind this House of the attitude that was taken up by supporters of the Government when we debated a tariff item relating to textiles. On that occasion, it may be remembered, the group to which I have the honour to belong, opposed an increase in the tariff designed to benefit employers who at that very time were approaching the Arbitration Court for a 10 per cent, reduction in the wages of the employees in that industry. Labour men, and supporters of the Government, assailed me and the members of the group to which I have the honour to belong, because, they said, it is not the function of Parliament or of Ministers to deal with the question of wages; that it is entirely a matter for the Arbitration Court. That was only a few weeks ago. I inform those honourable members that they are to-day expected to support a bill which seeks to establish the opposite principle which in its character menaces every worker throughout Australia. It is natural that we should consider the effect upon employees in the Commonwealth Public Service of the proposals relating to the reduction of wages. The views of those employees can best be ascertained by considering a statement that has been issued by the Australian Federation of Postal Unions, from a portion of which I quote the following:Hitherto, the hasic wage for the Federal Service has been adjusted on the cost of living figures for the four quarters of the year. To fix a basic wage on the figures for a single quarter as now proposed by the Government, represents a radical departure from the practice hitherto operating in the Service, and in t i o n ; therefore , I shall not go over the a time of falling prices means a material loss to the employees concerned. Had quarterly adjustments been in operation during the time when prices were climbing, Service employees would have received substantially more than they did receive. W it h annual adjustments during the time of rising prices and quarterly adjustments during the time of falling prices, Federal Service employees are being doubly penalized. That represents an important point of view. No one can doubt the accuracy of the statement in regard to the injustice that is being inflicted. The statement proceeds in the following terms:The basic wage for the Service is based on the same formula as adopted by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, but without the addition of the "" Powers"" 3s. Child endowment is paid for by deductions from the wages of all employees. The Government's proposals provide for the fixing Qf a basic wage of £182, plus child endowment, based on the cost of living figures for the quarter ended the 31st March, 1931. This represents a reduction of £34 compared with the previously existing basic wage, or a drop of £1.6 more than the drop that would ordinarily have taken place (under awards) on the cost of living figures for the twelve months ended the 31 st March, 1931. The Governmentfs proposals provide for the reduction of all wages up to £250 by 18 per Members calling themselves cent., subject to the proviso that there shall be no reduction below the new basic wage of £182;.wages from £251 to £1,000 are to be reduced by a uniform rate of 20 per cent.; wages in excess of £1,000 are to be reduced by 224 per cent. The severity of the Government's proposals will be seen from the following typical examples:(a) The basic wage is to be reduced by £34, compared with £18 under awards. (6) A wage of £234 (£4 10s. a week) will be reduced by £42 (18 per cent.) compared with £18 under awards. (o) A wage of £260 (£5 a week) will be reduced by £52 (20 per cent.) compared with £18 under awards. [d) A wage of £312 (£6 a week) is to be reduced by £62 (20 per cent.) compared with £18 under awards. In addition to these reductions and taxes, postal employees in particular are being increasingly subjected to many pin-pricking economies in other directions. In this regard recent happenings point to the conclusion that many highly-placed officials in the Postal Department are endeavouring to justify their existence at the expense of the general body of employees who carry out the real work of the postal, telegraph, and telephone services. In respect of the reduction in pensions, the honourable members for We r r i w a and West Sydney have dealt w it h the p r in c i p a l aspects t h a t call for our condemnasame ground where it may be avoided. But I feel justified in registering my protest against these reductions, which, besides being another specimen of the violation of the principles of the Labour movement, are in my opinion, reckless and callous in the extreme. While the Treasurer was making bis second-reading speech, I inquired as to whether it was not a fact that a double cut in the pensions of the old people was proposed, in the light of the particulars that he gave of the change that was to be made in the method of establishing eligibility for a pension. I refer to that portion of the proposal before us which alters the act in respect of the property that an old-age applicant for a pension may possess. I agree with every word that the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) said on that subject, as well as with the remarks of my colleagues. tice of this proposal by citing a specific example, I quote from a letter received only to-day by the honourable member for West Sydney"" from a Mr G.

I have heard with extreme regret that persons officiating as representatives of soldiers have surrendered the rights of the soldiers by agreeing to some measure of reduction in war pensions and allowances. I do not believe that decision of the representatives of returned soldiers reflects the opinion of the rank and file of the returned soldiers in Australia. On the contrary, I believe that this surrender on the.part of the soldiers' representatives is, to a large extent if not entirely, the ugly work of reactionaries in charge of soldiers' organizations. make the statement on my own behalf, and on behalf of the members of our group, that soldiers' organizations, or the ex-soldiers themselves, are not fair in further applying to us for assistance while they allow their own representatives to take up an attitude and arrive at a decision which certainly has not endorsed our action in the past, and which offers us no encouragement to continue in the work we have attempted on behalf of returned soldiers and their dependants. member suggest that, having regard to the financial position, the Commonwealth is justified in paying some of the pensions at present paid ? member have any regard for the financial position of the Commonwealth when he, and those with whom he is associated, sent men to be butchered on the other side of the world? sequences would be?

I am speaking from the view-point of one who considers that the war-time promises of this country in respect of pensions and allowances to returned soldiers, the wounded and limbless men, the widows and orphans of soldiers, were of such a character that they represented a solemn obligation of the nation to which it is committed for all time, while these unfortunate people are alive This obligation should not bei bartered away under any pretext whatever, but should be honoured to the full. In common with the work we are doing for invalid and old age pensioners and those who are to suffer reductions -in wages and salaries, the members of this group say to our returned soldier comrades that we are prepared to carry on their work; but no longer through those officials who have failed to extend to us some measure of bare courtesy, and hardly any opportunity for consultation. These officials while posing as the representatives of a nonI party organization have given many indications that to them non-party means anti-Labour. I suggest to our returned soldier comrades that they should put their own house in order before they can expect a fair deal.

92,Mr Eldridge,"It was a militantprinciples whicli are the most distinctive features of the legislative enactments of the Labour movement, and as such it is to be deeply lamented. It is an attack upon the motherhood of Australia, disguise it as you may. The £260 per annum income limitation to establish eligibility is to be deplored. It destroys the whole character of the pror posals as originally introduced by a Labour Government and permits the introduction of inquisitorial methods which will cost very much more than the saving contemplated. I base that contention on the opinion of the Prime Minister( Mr rejection of the demands of the financial Scullin) himself who sortie time ago, when just as strongly opposed to any reduction in the maternity allowance as we are, stated that the policing that would be involved in respect of income limitation to establish eligibility would cost more than would be saved by the proposed reduction. Let us examine briefly some of the backgrounds of these proposals. I said earlier that there are three types, the first of which represents an entire acceptance of the bankers' demands, and as evidence of tliis I remind honourable members that, following the conference of Premiers held in February last, the bankers presented an ultimatum. I do not know what else to call it. That was the conference at which Mr Lang launched his proposals known as the Lang plan. vite your attention to an interjection by an honourable member who has not the brains of a sparrow, nor the moral stimulus of a peanut. -Order! I suggest that the honourable member should pay no attention to interjections. All interjections are disorderly. remark and say that the honourable member has the brains of a sparrow and the moral stimulus of a peanut. The ultimatum"" of the banks was as follows:Subject to adequate and equitable reductions in all wages, salaries and allowances, pensions, social benefits of all kinds, interest money is made available. Tbe position and other factors which affect the cost of living, the Commonwealth Bank Board will actively co-operate with the trading banks, and the Government qf Australia, in sustaining industry' and restoring employment. Such was the stand-and-deliver attitude of the financial interests of the country at that time. But it was resisted by the present Governmeut. In no circumstances, said Ministers, would they consent to do what the banks demanded of them. That they were right we must realize when we recall the struggle which has been going on in this country in recent years. On the one hand we have had predatory financial interests striving for dominance, and opposed to them the Labour party with a specific platform and with a clear mandate to strive for the interests. Finally, the fight reached a stage at which the financial interests, through their executive in this Parliament-the Bruce-Page Government and after a number of financial hawks from overseas had visited this country, were bold enough to advocate the entire abolition of our system of conciliation and arbitration. There was immediately a definite issue placed before the people in circumstances unprecedented in the history of Australia. We all know that the popular will declared emphatically against the menacing aims of the banking interests, and equally emphatically for the platform and policy of the Labour party, the result being the formation of a government pledged to give effect to that platform and policy. . But that Government has now treacherously surrendered that platform and policy by accepting the demands of the bankers. This bill is its expression of that surrender. ber suggest how the Government can pay out money which it has not got and cannot get? orable member that apparently there is no difficulty in securing the necessary funds provided we meet the demands of the banking interests. they want! must do what the bankers want before is very much the same as if outlaws secured possession of the entire water supplies of Australia, and, though human beings might be perishing from thirst,",47,Moloney Adjourned Wheat Marketin Gbill No 2 Moloney And Read A First Time Financial Emergency Bill Second Reading

When everybody knew that credit resources were shrinking, and when even the ordinary activities of public utility bodies on reproductive works could not be continued, and we proposed that the Commonwealth Bank should increase its credit resources to the extent of £20,000,000, to provide work for our workless, starving people we were howled down, and decried as inflationists, repudiationists and the like. pened is that this country has been hard hit. It is like a person who has met with an accident causing a heavy loss of blood. We know that medical science can often remedy the loss of blood by a transfusion of blood, more blood being put into the system. But it is vital that this be done with sufficient promptitude and be in time to save the patient. Yet when we suggested similar financial treatment for our stricken nation we were told that it meant flooding the country with notes, and bringing ruin upon us. "" The experience of countries which had increased their note issuesafter their manufacturing and business enterprises had been annihilated, and when the step naturally proved ineffective by as a reason Why Australia should not try to do the same thing.

It is surely wise that one should keep consions. I fail to appreciate the remark stantly in mind throughout this debate the all-important fact that the outstanding need of the day is economy. Nothing but the knowledge that unless we adapt "" our expenditure to our income the inevitable alternative must be chaos and a national debacle, enables some honourable members to support this legislation. It has been brought home to us that if we do not stand by the plan decided upon at the recent Premiers Conference in Melbourne, we must, as a people, default, and that almost immediately we will find ourselves in a position which would make it impossible to pay any wages or pensions without a probable all-round reduction of 50 per cent. dict that the pages of our national history relating the events of to-day will be read with special interest and a measure of satisfaction by the generations of Australians to come. Many honourable members, iu supporting the proposals of the Premiers Conference, find themselves in an extraordinarily difficult position. The Prime Minister and his supporters arc, to a great extent, destroying some of the foundations of the edifice which is emblematical of their political faith, and which they have been building for many years. In their belated realization of the nation's dilemma, and consequent support of this and other measures which are necessary to give effect to the rehabilitation plan decided upon in Melbourne, many honourable members are risking their political lives. I have listened in vain to hear at least one member on the Government benches, who is at present opposed to the policy introduced by his own party, admit that the Prime Minister and his supporters arc entitled to some sympathy to-day. The bill deals with the following decision of the Melbourne conference:A reduction of 20 per cent, in all adjustable governmental expenditure as compared with the year ending the 30th June, 1930, including all emoluments, wages, salaries and pensions paid by the governments, whether fixed by statute or otherwise, such reduction to be equitably effected. The bill is sub-divided into nine parts, and I shall now refer to only three subdivisions, reserving any remarks that I have to make upon the others until the committee stage. I shall first of all deal with war penof the honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) that the representatives of the ex-service men's organizations are reactionaries. He seemed to resent the work that the committee representative of those associations had done. Personally, 1 think it is one of the finest acts standing to the credit of the ex-service men of this country. and file of the ex-soldiers think otherwise. mendations of the committee representative of ex-service men's organizations which have been accepted by the I preGovernment are in general accord with my ideas as to the method of effecting an unavoidable reduction in our annual war pensions and repatriation liabilities with the smallest measure of hardship to those most vitally concerned. I have long held the opinion, and I expressed it a week or two ago in this House, that an appeal to those who could voluntarily relinquish whole or part of their pensions, for the time being, would be successful; but when I first urged this step I found that I was ploughing, more or less, a lonely furrow.

114,Mr D. Cameron,"The recomhonorable members for Balaclava ( Mr disabilities. I appreciate the fact that White) and Beid( Mr Coleman) both agreed that the suggestion was worth considering, but I do not think that many honourable members had much faith in the success of such au appeal. The appeal which the Government has now promised to make along those lines, will, I believe, materially assist in bringing about a further saving of £281,770, which the committee has accepted the responsibility of endeavouring to effect. There has been much talk about the recommendations of this committee, and it has been said that certain war pensioners, particularly those who are unmarried, will make little or no sacrifice, while the great burden' will fall on the married ex-soldiers, because of reductions being made in the pensions of their dependants. About 74,000 ex-service men are receiving pensions, and, of those, approximately 16,000 are unmarried. The great majority of the unmarried pensioners suffer from serious disablements, which, undoubtedly, have made it impossible for them to establish homes or to marry. It does not necessarily follow that because they are single they have no dependants. who are now to suffer reductions in pensions include brothers, sisters, and various otlier persons. It is, therefore, unfair to say that war pensioners who are single will, under this proposal, escape a share in the general sacrifice, and I have ascertained that many of them will be ready to respond to the appeal for voluntary relinquishment. Other war pensioners at the moment-the subject of criticism, are those doing work, usually clerical work-ordinar y work for an ordinary man. They are working and living more or less sheltered lives, but in most instances their expectation of life -usin g a phrase common in life assurance circles-is bad. They are constantly in and out of hospital and the end may come for them at any time. For years they have been carrying out ordinary clerical work, and it is true it is difficult to tell, from a casual glance, that they suffer any disability. It is contended that these men should not be in receipt of pensions. That contention, I consider, is quite unfair, because they are suffering from real and definite war the Government has undertaken to make an appeal to those who can afford to relinquish the whole or part of their pensions on the understanding that their rights will be safeguarded, and that should their disabilities increase, or their ability to earn a living diminish, they will have the right to apply again for a pension. Whilei t will not be denied that an earnest attempt has been made to meet the nation's obligations to the dependants of those who, on its behalf, went down into the ""Valley of the Shadow "", and for those who fought and suffered in its defence, it must also be admitted that the reputation which the Australian Imperial Force gained for gallantry and devotion to duty during war years, the manner in which 99 per cent, of our ex-soldiers re-established themselves in their own homeland, playing important parts in the affairs of their country during the years of peace which have followed the Great War-thei r splendid record, too, so far as meeting their obligations in connection with the provision of war-service homes-hav e all been greatly enhanced by the way in which they now accept their The dependants share in a fresh sacrifice. I come now to old-age and invalid pensions. No honourable member desires to reduce either soldier pensions or invalid or old-age pensions. It is poor comfort after all for an old-age or invalid pensioner to be told that Australia, even with the proposed 20 per cent, reduction, will still be paying considerably more per head for invalid and old-age pensions than is any other country. It is claimed that with the lower prices for commodities now obtaining, there will not be any actual reduction in purchasing power as the result of a 20 per cent, reduction in pensions. The ex-Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), when addressing a meeting recently in Melbourne, was reported to have urged that the proposed cuts in old age and invalid pensions should be viewed from the stand-point of preventing the loss of the pension altogether in a national catastrophe. He pointed out that during his term as Prime Minister old-age and invalid pensions were increased by £5,400,000; that Australia at that time was enjoying great prosperity; that he was justified in not being prepared to leave the unfortunate pensioners, who were living on a bare pittance, in a situation different from that of the rest of the community; that the nation at that time was in a position to extend its social services, but that now the social services must share in the general sacrifice. The Under-Treasurers and experts, when recommending a reduction of 20 per cent, in pensions, said"" If this reduction is made, an increase in pensions annually, in proportion to any rise in the cost of living, might be considered. That is a commendable suggestion, but whether it can be carried out must depend on thefinancesof the country. If 17s. 6d. will give the old-age and invalid pensioner the same purchasing power as f l did two or three years ago-al l of these pensions being obviously used to meet cost of living expenses-the n surely many of the objections*raised to the proposed reduction are based on a misunderstanding. The proposed amendment regarding value of property needs further explanation. I am at a loss to understand why the value of the home in which the pensioner lives cannot remain exempt from calculation as property. I should like to know what saving is expected as a result of this amendment. Surely this proposal, if given effect, will debar many aged persons from receiving any pension at all. The value of their house will not provide them with clothes and food, and it is now impossible to sell property at any price, even if the occupant desires or is compelled to try to sell his home. I have no doubt that in committee the Treasurer will further explain the proposed amendment. sioner, who is without family or friends, cannot receive the pension unless he is totally and permanently incapacitated. What is his position if he has no friends or relatives? Could not exceptions be made in the case of invalid pensioners who are entirely without family or friends? I suggest that, at least, particulars in this connection could be obtained from each pensioner by means of a questionnaire. If that were done, we might be able to do s^nothiug to assist these aged and infirm people in their declining and lonely years. Mr 1). Cameron. In regard to the proposed reduction by 20 per cent, of all adjustable government expenditure, the decision of the -Melbourne conference concluded with these words: "" Such reductions to be equitably effected"". I am of opinion, after a careful perusal of the Treasurer's speech when moving the second reading of this bill, that the Government is entitled to claim that every effort has been made to make the reductions equitable so far as wages and salaries are concerned. As I understand the proposal, adult male officers will suffer a flat rate reduction of £34 on account of the decline in the cost of living since the 1st July, 1930, and a further cut of the remaining salaries varying from 3 per cent, to approximately 24 per cent., but no adult male officer of the Commonwealth will be reduced below the basic wage of £182. However, all the economies and reductions we may propose must be considered as only the first step towards the economic and financial rehabilitation of Australia. Until the great exporting industrieswheat, wool, beef, and metals-ca n be carried on at a profit, all our other efforts will not l if t Australia out of its difficulties. In recent years the exporting primary industries have borne far too great a proportion of the fall in national income. Giving evidence before the Parliamentary Select Committee, which is inquiring into the operation of banks, the Government Statistician of New South Wales pointed out -that the wool clip in 192728 was worth £76,564,000; in 192829, £71,000,000;and in 1929-30, £43,827,000. The estimated value for. the present year is about £33,250,000. Then the invalid penchange ? crop in 1927-28 was worth £53,042,000, and in 1929-30, £10,037,000. Eor 1930-31 the estimate is £23,000,000. In conclusion I repeat that the alternative facing the nation, if the Commonwealth and State Governments do not give effect to the rehabilitation scheme agreed upon at the Melbourne conference, is default, and a financial smash in which we all shall be involved. port of this measure imposes upon honourable members perhaps the most",50,Moloney Adjourned Wheat Marketin Gbill No 2 Moloney And Read A First Time Financial Emergency Bill Second Reading

117,Mr Gullett (Henty) [9.19],"Supunpleasant task that has yet fallen to them. One would expect, therefore, that the opposition to it would be simple and effective. I have, however, listened in vain to the speeches of the opponents of the measure and all the various economies and reductions it proposes, without hearing one sound argument. Instead of genuine criticism we have heard wretched political pander to prejudice and contemptible electioneering born of the deplorable brawling amongst the Labour factions. The opponents of the bill have offered no practicable alternative to the Government's proposals. not one of them said a word about the present financial and economic condition of Australia. They did not discuss the only reason for these reductions or the sole aim we have in advocating them. Again, they slurred over the all-important mitigating effect of the great fall in the cost of living which ensures that the victims of these reductions will not be materially worse off than they were before prices declined. Those honourable members who constitute the Lang group in this chamber have offered as an alternative, by inference, what is known as the Lang plan. effrontery in daring to mention in this chamber that calamitous policy, which in the great State of New South Wales has been a sheer maker of misery. The most populous, and incomparably the richest State of the union has relatively more unemployment and more wretchedness than any other part of Australia. This so-called leader, operating a so-called be followed immediately by great good, plan, has inflicted misery after misery upon the workers he was elected to serve. A government savings bank, which, having regard to the magnitude of its operations, was second only to one other savings bank in the world, has been deliberately smashed. Obligations in respect of the overseas debt of New South Wales have been wantonly repudiated. The State, under its present leadership, is .without credit and without honour. And the Lang plan is all that the honourable gentlemen in the corner offer as an alternative to the proposals of the Government ! What are the objectives of the plan, of which this bill forms part? In the first place it proposes the only means by which we can avoid national bankruptcy and all the miseries that it connotes. Next, it is the only plan that has been evolved which will, assuredly, although perhaps not immediately, restore faith in this country. required. member suggest one other step that should take precedence of those proposed in the plan ? It embodies the only policy that will ayert the bankruptcy that looms For example, so near ahead. I look confidently to it to begin immediately to resuscitate industry. I do not say that the restoration will be instant, but almost at once signs of a general revival of industry will be apparent. And, above all, it will, I believe, promote immediately an increase of employment which, surely, is one of the most urgent objectives of every honourable member, and every person of humane feelings.. I am not dealing with interest rates, but the same argument that was used in support of the proposed reduction of the interest rate on the internal public debt, I marvel at their applies equally to the reductions covered by this bill. We are proposing to contract the interest burden to the level of our present capacity to pay; the only reason for the reduction is that we cannot pay more and remain solvent. We believe, moreover, that none of the economies proposed are punitive; the temporary hardship We are inflicting will even to those who are called upon to make sacrifices for the time being. As we reduce the interest on the bond we shall increase its buoyancy and enhance its capital value. In other words, we aim at such a restoration of credit as will carry the market price of the 4 per cent, bond to par. I turn now to the pensioners. This bill, properly considered, does not destroy pensions; it preserves them. At the present time the position of pensioners is gravely insecure.

119,Mr Gullett,"Can the honorablewe do not adopt this plan we shall be heading for inevitable chaos, and the Government will be unable to continue to pay pensions. month, if we do not resort to the sacrifices to the credit of the Commonwealth at a which this bill proposes, the Commonwealth would be fortunate if it were able to pay more than 50 per cent, of its present obligations to pensioners and bondholders. This plan will ensure that the pensioners will receive at least 80 per cent, of the rates they now enjoy. It is unfortunate that a reduction of even 20 per cent, should be inevitable, but I submit to honourable members, and even to those who have spoken against the bill, that it is incomparably better to guarantee to the pensioners 80 per cent, of what they now get-whic h owing to the fall in the cost of living will buy as much as 100 per cent, bought two^years ago-tha n by the end of this month to reduce the present payments by 50 per cent. Turning now to the proposed reduction of salaries and wages of public servants, those honourable members who inteud to vote against the bill are charging its supporters with a callous disregard for the welfare of government employees, as though the sole purpose of the bill was to reduce salaries and wages in the Public Service. That is not the position. The measure is designed to restore confidence, and it expresses the desire of all the governments in Australia to pay their public servants to the utmost of their capacity. Obviously, if the wage fund is depleted, it is impossible to pay government employees on the scale hitherto obtaining. is bankruptcy. Honourable members in Langi f that were not so. They stand for national bankruptcy, with all its evil consequences. If one may judge their attitude by their speeches in this chamber, they would do for all the workers of Australia what Mr Lang has done for the workers of New South Wales. That is the example which they now ask us to follow. Dealing now with the proposal to reduce the pensions payable to ex-soldiers, I think that every member of this House, irrespective of the party to which he belongs, will acknowledge that the Commonwealth has not been ungenerous in Mr Oullett. its treatment to all classes of pensioners. They have been treated more generously than have pensioners in any other counBy the end of this try in the world. This fact must stand time like this when national adversity compels the Government to reduce payments to our returned soldiers. No honourable member would support these reductions if they could be averted. The fact that the bill is being supported by members from three major parties in this House is an admission of the complete inevitability of these reductions. The payment of pensions to disabled soldiers is an obligation as sacred and binding as any contract can be. Nevertheless, the discharge of this obligation, and of the other commitments necessary to carry on the activities of the Commonwealth, such as salaries payable to our public servants, must have relationship to the capacity of the Government to meet them at any given time. I submit that all the Governments exploited to the utmost their capacity to meet these obligations before they agreed to the proposals contained in the plan for the financial and economic rehabilitation of the Commonwealth, and I repeat that reductions in Public Service salaries and pensions, as part of the general scheme, are inevitable if we are to avoid national bankruptcy. I believe, further, that when all the proposals contained in the plan have been given effect, there will be a definite improvement in the figures relating to unemployment, consequent upon a revival in industry. This, I sugThe alternative, as we well know, gest, is the objective-the re-employment of our idle and distressed workers. The measures necessary to avoid national bankruptcy, to be followed by proposals for the restoration of confidence in industry generally. I deplore, as I have said, the necessity to make any reductions in the pensions payable to our disabled soldiers. I am not unmindful of promises made during the early stages of the war, but I cannot forget the plight of very many returned soldiers who are not pensioners. It is, unhappily, true that tens of thousands of them are in the ranks of the unemployed. Although these men are not in receipt of pensions because they are not suffering",53,Moloney Adjourned Wheat Marketin Gbill No 2 Moloney And Read A First Time Financial Emergency Bill Second Reading
120,The Corner Would Not Be Followers Of Mr First,"step is the adoption of thosefrom war disabilities-fro m that point of view their sacrifices have not been as great as those of war pensioners-never theless their service in defence of their country was as great and our obligation to help them is as binding to-day as ever it was. I suggest, therefore, that among returned soldiers as a whole, pensioners and non-pensioners in a time like the present there must be some pooling of the resources of the nation. I firmly believe that when our ex-soldiers in receipt of pensions realize that some reduction is essential if we are to avoid national bank-, ruptcy and increase the volume of employment, they will acquiesce in the sacrifice required of them far more cheerfully than some honourable members would have us believe. The position of ex-soldiers who are out of work deserves the earnest consideration and support of all sections of the community, even if the measures taken to alleviate their distress inflict some further sacrifices upon those returned, soldiers in receipt of pensions. The same may be said of the old-age and invalid pensioners. are in the main made up of the children and grandchildren of those who are receiving the old-age pension, so any sacrifices that may be made to afford relief will indicate the existence of a true community of interest. For these reasons I offer no apology for my vote in support of the bill. As for the Public Service, I regret that it is necessary to make reductions in salaries and wages, particularly in the case of those on the level of the basic wage; but we should remember that up to date, Permanent employees of the Commonwealth have not been called upon to make any contribution to the rehabilitation of the nation. They have been sheltered, as have no other class of the community. They have not lost one day's work, or one shilling of their pay. By contrast, for the last two or three years the basic wage in industry has been reduced by about 20 per cent., and there has been a decline in the cost of living by approximately 20 per cent. All that the Government is now asking of the Public Service is that it shall suffer a reduction of 20 per cent. Again the alternative is bankruptcy and chaos, as well as widespread retrenchmentand wholesale dismissals even in the ranks of permanent employees. In the circumstances, there should be no doubt about the decision. I congratulate the Government upon its proposal to reduce bounty payments. I am pleased to know that the gold bounty is to be reduced by 50 per cent, and other bounties by 20 per cent. But again the Government is somewhat inconsistent. Its proposals touch only the bounty side of the tariff. I do not suggest that the Ministry singled out the primary industries for punishment, but I cannot help remarking that, with the exception of the iron and steel bounties, practically all the reductions relate to bounties on primary production. It would therefore seem that again the primary producer has to carry the greatest share of the burden, and once more the secondary industries are favoured. I must, however, admit that it was impossible for the Government, in the time available to it, to bring down tariff reduction The unemployed proposals as part of its economy scheme. In this matter, I am aware that I have not the support of members of the Country party. StillI do not think it is practicable to give relief by a flat rate tariff reduction of 25 per cent, or 30 per cent. A proposal along those lines would scarcely touch hundreds of protective items in the wholesale monopoly tariff imposed by this Government. ticable to have a flat rate reduction as a start? would. not be done piecemeal. should have been pleased if the Government had declared that a revision of the tariff was part of the general economy scheme. I should like the Government to have declared, in connection with this measure, that it intended, immediately following upon the passage of this bill and the other rehabilitation bills, to deal with the tariff, with a view to giving relief to the people of Australia generally.

It is just that divergence of opinion, as represented by the views of two honourable members of the same party, that makes it impossible to deal with tariff matters in a hurry. The tariff is too controversial a matter to handle in that way. We have all witnessed the mess made by the present Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr nobly answering tbe call of the GovernPorde), because he has dabbled hastily with the tariff.

The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) complained that we never speak of the position of the country. Well, I do not know that I have ever spoken without alluding to it. God has blessed this country, through nature, as no other country has been blessed. In proportion to our population of 6,500,000 people, there is more food grown in Australia than any other country in the wholewide world. Had this country been blasted by a famine, and we were short of food, 1 could understand the cry of the honourable member for Henty that we were facing insolvency. The present trouble in Australia has been brought about by the failure of the financial system of the world. This calamity has demonstrated the complete breakdown of the capitalistic system as expressed in the gold standard. When the legislators-statesmen , if you like-and the financiers of the world decreed that the gold standard should obtain, they sentenced one-third of God's people to wretchedness and misery. The whole of the East-China, with its teeming 400,000,000, India, with its 350,000,000, the Straits Settlement, and even Japan-ar e suffering under this cursed system no less than are those countries in which the gold standard, as such, obtains.

140,Dr. Maloney,"I know that. As atreat old-age pensioners in that way, I would accept the plan so distasteful to the honourable member for Henty( Mr don, where they bought largely in AmeriGullett) ; I would bring down to £500 the salary or income, not only of every public servant, but also of every private individual in the country. The Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) made a mistake when he said that the plan proposed by Mr Lang to reduce to £500 all Public Service salaries above that amount would not produce more than £100,000 in revenue. In 1913, before the war, there were 33 public servants in receipt of salaries of £1,000 per annum and upwards. By 1929 the number of such officials had increased to 181. Their salaries, which amounted to £62,895 in 1913, had increased to £296,995 by 1929. The salaries of 181 officers at £500 per annum would amount to £90,500, which, deducted from the £296,995, would leave£206,495, which sum would represent the saving on that item alone. I would go further than that, for I would adopt the policy followed by England during the war when food was rationed. At that time only those persons who had children, or were sick, were able to obtain butter; others had to be content with margarine. Meat was obtainable only twice a week. Those who saved their tickets obtained a decent meal of meats occasionally. ""Were we to adopt a system of food rationing we could soon wipe off our overseas indebtedness. member suggest that as an emergency measure ? rationing every human being would have so much meat, butter, tea, bread, milk and other commodities. Invalids, of course, would be given a little extra. pay off the indebtedness on our bonds. In that way we could discharge our financial obligations. I hope that then we should resolve never to borrow money overseas again. It is from the latter habit that our troubles arise; it enables financial magnates to control our destinies. To illustrate the power of gold, the Bankers' Magazine stated that a few very wealthy financiers went from the United States of America to Loncan stocks that were low, and sold largely in English stocks that were high. They then took £11,000,000 in English gold from Great Britain to New York. The transaction brought about a depreciation in English stocks to the extent of £115,000,000, and caused an appreciable rise in the price of American stocks that they had bought. How much money those men made out of the transaction is not mentioned. That is but a small example of the practices of the financial magnates of the United States of America and Europe. It is estimated that the value of Australia's wealth is £4,000,000,000. Private wealth, lands, improvements, farms, houses, machinery, furniture, and everything else represent £3,000,000,000, while forest, water conservation, wharfs, railways, and the remaining services that go to make Australia a civilized country, make up the other £1,000,000,000. Why does the Government not declare the present to be a state of national emergency, and issue banknotes based upon that £4,000,000,000. When the associated banks of Australia issued notes, those tokens had engraved on them the promise to pay in sterling, which meant either silver or gold. With the advent of the Commonwealth note-issue-and how I welcomed it, and still rejoice that there is only one note-issuing authority in the honourable Australia-the promise was that payment would be made in gold. That promise is untrue. Its hypocrisy is similar to that of the refusal of the post office in past years to carry letters that were addressed to Tattersall's, Hobart. A number of great financial experts and bankers come to Australia and tender advice to us. Why do not they cure the financial ills of poor old England, with its terrible burden of unemployment? IfI were asked what country we should send to for financial advisers I should suggest only two. One is France. During the period when that country had standardized its franc at 124.2 to the English pound, it collected £300,000,000 in gold and raised its gold reserve from £40,000,000 to £330,000,000.

In Australia, each silver coin contains 925 parts of silver and 75 parts of alloy, whereas the British silver coin contains 500 parts of silver and 500 parts of alloy. The result is that, using the same quantity of metal, and with silver at Is. an oz., Britain could issue silver coins to the face value of £10,175,000, whereas Australia could issue similar coins to the value of only £5,500,000. The only real objection that bankers and others have made to the adoption of the silver standard is that the silver would take up too much room. But all the silver that has been mined in the world from the days when the Spaniards took the rich silver mines of South America from the native people until now would not half fill this chamber. Eveni f the bankers had not room to store the silver, the Treasury could take charge of it. I do not think that any honourable member will deny that next to gold, silver is the best form of currency that we have. If we had had a large silver currency, the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales need not have closed its doors. In any case, the Commonwealth Bank should have come to its assistance.

The old always appeal to the young to assist them; hut if the ex-soldiers appeal to the young to-day, I do not know what may happen. During these last sad months, I have been afraid to talk to the unemployed because I could not trust myself. I haye been afraid that by addressiug them. I would do harm, and I do not desire to do that. As a medical man, I would advise men to go to gaol in these cold winter months, rather than attempt to feed and clothe themselves on 5s. 6d. per week. It would cost the country more if they went to gaol, but they would be better off. I do not wish to be misunderstood. This Government has done more for the unemployed than any Government which has been in office during my long public life. But there has never been a time when the conditions have been so bad as they are now. I haye studied history, and I know that even in countries without a super-abundance of food and wealth generally, it has been considered that the danger point was reached when 22 per cent, of the people were unemployed. We have gone beyond that point to 25 per cent. If we would adopt the silver standard for our currency, we could make a profit of 450 per cent, on the money wo minted, and this would enable us to provide work for the unemployed. If the nations of the world ultimately adopted bi-metallism, such a profit would not be possible, for eastern countries always endeavour to put the full value of the silver into the money they mint. Speaking of silver reminds me that to-day 46 per cent, of the unionists of BrokenH ill are out of work. I have great sympathy for the unemployed miners in the silver lead mines and in the coal mines. The coal-miners were promised that if Labour were returned to power the mines would bo re-opened in a fortnight; but that promise was not fulfilled. another strike on the coal-field. settle all strikes. If we would cease worshipping the god of gold, and make it possible for the people to feed and clothe Our greatest safeguards against themselves adequately, strikes would be unnecessary. I hope that this bill will be amended in certain important respects. I am sorry that the Government will not declare a state of emergency and issue a currency based upon the £4,000,000,000 worth of public and private property in Australia. The day must come, unless things improve, when our people will tire of starving on 5s. 6d. per week. The dole system is not a good one. We know what is happening in England to-day. Reports have appeared in newspapers that thousands of young men have grown up who have never known what it is to work, and that girls are growing into womanhood and marrying on the dole. Is that a state of civilization to be desired? Many years ago, I visited the South Sea Islands. I found that, even in cannibal villages, a cannibal could take possession of an unoccupied block of land and make a home for himself. What would happen if any one of our unemployed men took possession of a vacant block of land iu any part of the CommonAvealth? I admit that our standard of living is higher than the standard of some other countries; but we should improve it. To-day we are breaking it down. The power of gold is proving too great for us. I protest against the provisions of this bill. The measure is wholly objectionable to me, and my conscience, which has never yet deceived me, tells me that I am right in opposing it. honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) told us in the early part of his speech that Australia was a marvellously wealthy country, which was endowed with every advantage; but, later, he said that conditions were all wrong here, and that other countries were to blame for it. To a great extent, the present position of Australia is due to the way in which the affairs of the country have been mismanaged by the politician, who has passed all kinds of grand-motherly legislation, instead of giving industry a fair chance. I was struck by the ominous silence on the part of honourable members opposite regarding this bill, I do not know whether a",60,Moloney Adjourned Wheat Marketin Gbill No 2 Moloney And Read A First Time Financial Emergency Bill Second Reading

149,Mr Gregory (Swan) [10.30],"-Th edivision will be taken on tbe second reading, but, apart from tbose representing tbe Lang group, few members opposite have spoken on tbe measure. I should like the Government to state frankly what it proposes to do in connection with the default of the New South Wales Government. The rest of Australia cannot be expected to pay the costs of this misgoverned State. If sacrifices are to be made, they should be shared by all sections. I admit that the present position is most difficult, but it has been complicated to a great extent by the long time taken by the Government in making up its mind what it would do to get Australia out of its terrible predicament. The Government's own supporters have been placed in a false position, and probably half tbeir number will vote against the Ministry on this measure. Although the Government accepted the advice tendered to it by Sir Otto Niemeyer, and agreed with the State Premiers to the adoption of a plan for the balancing of budgets, it allowed thefinancesof the Commonwealth to drift for a long period, with the result that every section of the community is now called upon to make greater sacrifices than would have been necessary had prompt action been taken. There is scope for a considerable cutting down of governmental expenditure, because of the needless overlapping of the activities of Federal and State Departments. was established at great expense, and now the Government has appointed a Public Service Arbitrator, whose decisions will destroy, to a great extent, the work of the board. A clerk in the Commonwealth Service, when travelling from Melbourne to Canberra, receives an allowance of 4s. 8d. an hour in addition to his salary, between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. and between 5.30 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. He is paid extra for the time spent when eating his breakfast and dinner! The Department of Markets might well be abolished; the Health Department is carrying out work that is already being done by various State departments; and the activities of the Federal Forestry Department clearly overlap those of the States. Australia is not wealthy enough to stand this needless duplication of public expenditure. When we take money away from production, unMr Gregory. employment must be increased. Where there is waste, progress is hindered. I admit that the heavy drop in the prices of our primary products has contributed to the present sorry condition of affairs in this country, but it is high time that governments determined to eliminate all waste and extravagance. Members of the Lang group have spoken about hardships inflicted upon old age pensioners, and they have heaped abuse on bondholders whom they choose to describe as Shylocks. I think that many honourable members have received letters from thrifty persons who have managed to save a couple of thousand pounds, but whose income will be reduced, under the Government's proposals, to an amount less than that received byold-age pensioners. I know dozens of cases in which the owners of cottages-me n who by the exercise of thrift saved enough to enable them to buy two or three small housesare unable to obtain the rent due to them, and are now in a worse position than that of old-age pensioners. All honourable members must admire the action taken by the returned soldier organizations. They are to be complimented upon the proposal that they have submitted. It shows that they are prepared to make a sacrifice at this time of national emergency. While invalid and old-aged pensions are paid as' a gift to a deserving section of the community, The Public Service Board the provision of pensions for ex-soldiers is a national obligation, and the reductions now being made should be deemed temporary only. I hope that the time is not far distant when we shall have an old-age pension scheme, with a complete scale of benefits, contributed to by the individual, the employer and the State, in equal amounts, so that the pensioner will be able to claim that he has earned his pension, and that it is not in the nature of a gift from the Crown. We have heard a great deal about equality of sacrifice. The Government contends that there must be this equality, and the honorlett) and others have argued that it is essential. I want to know what steps have been taken by the Government to that end. There can be no equality of",61,Moloney Adjourned Wheat Marketin Gbill No 2 Moloney And Read A First Time Financial Emergency Bill Second Reading
150,Able Member For Henty ( Mr Gul,"sacrifice while the Government gives concession after concession to one section, and continues to add imposts to another section. The Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson) quoted to-night figures which showed that the price levels of primary production are 119 per cent, in comparison with pre-war days, and that those of secondary production have increased to 193 per cent. ""Where is the sacrifice that the manufacturer is making? It must be recognized that practically the whole of the wealth of Australia comes from the soil, and proportionally little from manufacturing industries. Those industries have always lived on what is produced from the land. If any industries should be placed in a secondary position, surely it is the manufacturing industries, and not the great primary producing industries, upon which such a stranglehold has been placed. It is something damnable -Order! found in the Bible. tary. term "" abominable."" My only wish is to express the severest condemnation. Prior to this Government coming into power, there were complaints on every hand regarding tbe burdens that were being placed upon primary production. At that time the values of primary products were fairly high; whereas now it is per-' fectly well known that they have dropped to an abnormally low level, and that is one of the principal causes of the trouble in which Australia finds herself to-day. Yet we continue to heap upon primary production the m6st monstrous charges, and to raise to an even higher level the cost of everything that is required by the primary producer. A new sugar agreement has been signed and is to continue in force for a number of years. If there is to be equality of sacrifice, let the nation derive some benefit from this industry by the imposition of an excise 2s. a day. duty of £2 10s. a ton on all sugar consumed in Australia. If the householder is from the duty is used for the developnot to benefit by a reduction of price why ment of their country. In France the should not the nation be able to obtain some revenue from the industry, and thus make it possible to pay a higher old-age pension than is proposed? [Quorum formed.] The Government ought to be able to obtain by this means something like £750,000 a year, and thus place itself in a position'to fulfi l at least some of the promises that it has continually made. has always growled about the high price of sugar. allege that my proposal would have the effect of increasing the price of sugar to the consumer. The agreement; fixing the price, would still stand. It provides that the price of sugar and the cost of excise will come from the sugar board. There are other directions in which additional revenue may be obtained. Under the tariff proposals of the Government, the duty on imported cigars has been increased, but the excise on locally-manufactured cigars has been reduced. Thus the Government has made an absolute present to the cigar manufacturers of £40,000 a year. Why should not the Government, instead of the manufacturers, have that money, which could be obtained by raising the excise a little higher instead of reducing it? It is most extraordinary that the Government can afford to make a present of £40,000 a year to cigar manufacturers, yet cannot fulfil any of the other promises that it made to the people, among which was the promise that the wheat-growers would receive 3s. a bushel for their wheat, under an act that passed both Houses of this Parliament. The Government has also placed an embargo on matches coming into this country. Then let us have an excise on matches. Other countries impose an excise duty on sugar consumed within their borders. In Belgium the excise is £2 6s. 8d. a ton; in Czechoslovakia it is £11 8s. 4d. a ton; and the price of sugar to the consumer is only 4d. per lb.",62,Moloney Adjourned Wheat Marketin Gbill No 2 Moloney And Read A First Time Financial Emergency Bill Second Reading

In such circumstances the nation, and not the concession hunter, as in the case of the cigar-manufacturer, receives the money. Why does not the Government impose an excise duty on matches, and allow the country to obtain some advantage? If the present high prices of some commodities are to continue, the Government should sell the monopolies and allow the country to obtain some benefit. able member bring this proposal before the last Government? have never expressed opinions different from those which I am expressing tonight. ment passed a measure in whicli provision was made for the payment of a bounty on the production of gold; but although that measure has been in operation only a short time, the amount of the bounty is to be reduced by 50 per centstances, I do not suppose the Government can adopt any other course. The money is not available for the purpose; but the proposal, when compared with other bounties, is unfair. realized. also proposed to pay a bounty on the production of sewing machine heads, but, fortunately, that measure was rejected in another place. Only yesterday I received a return showing the extent to which the States have benefited by the payment of bounties. Erom 1922-23 to 1930-31, New South Wales has received £2,314,890. That amount is made up by payments in respect of cattle, shale oil, iron and steel products, sulphur, canned fruits, wine, cotton, and yarn. During the same period Victoria received £456,008. This does not include grants in respect of fruit products, which cover about £334,371. Queensland received £556,438, and South Australia £1,266,893, the largest portion of which was on wine. During the same period Western Australia received only £45,373, and Tasmania £45,585. The total amount paid to all the States during that period was £4,685,187.

It was the Government's responsibility to ascertain whether the money to pay the guaranteed price would be available before it submitted the measure to Parliament.

172,Mr Gregory,"I do not know anytabled by this Government such an unnecessarily heavy burden has been placed upon the primary producers that it is impossible to reduce the cost of production. We cannot live by taking in each other's washing. As the prices of metals, wool, wheat and other commodities have dropped considerably, these products cannot be profitably handled until the cost of production is reduced. Mr KE.VNE -What does the honourable member want? be mado by all sections of the community. When granting concessions to one section we have no right to impose burdens upon other sections. I wish to emphasize that, irrespective of the reductions proposed to be made in our internal interest bill and other controllable expenses, there is not the slightest chance of Australia making progress unless we remove the shackles that arc hampering industry today. This country, which is capable of carrying a population of 20,000,000 people, can never become prosperous until those engaged in primary production are given an opportunity to carry on under more reasonable conditions than prevail to-day, and those conditions can never be realized without a drastic change in the country's policy. adjourned.
