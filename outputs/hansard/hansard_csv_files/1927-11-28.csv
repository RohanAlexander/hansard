Prime Minister A Question Concerning The Disposal Of The Australian Commonwealth Line Of Steamers; But Before Doing So I Wish To Read The Following Extract From The Sun Pictorial Of 26th November","Lord Inchcape and Lord Kylsant are reported to be making keen inquiries regarding the Commonwealth Line of Steamers which has been offered for sale. Lord Kylsant controls 41 companies and Lord Inchape 32. The latter's interests are worldwide, whereas, apparently, Lord Kylsant has left a solitary gap, the freight service to AustraliaLord Kylsant recently negotiated the purchase of the White Star Line, making the Royal Mail' Packet Coy. the largest owners of tonnage in the world. In view of this statement T. should like to know if any communication has been received from Lord Kylsant or Lord Inchcape or any person representing their interests with regard to tbe disposal of tbe Line?

2,Mr Oharlton,"I desire to ask theceived from Lord Inchcape and also one either from Lord Kylsant direct or from some person representing him.' The cablerepresentatives of tbe Commonwealtli gram from Lord Inchcape was to tbe effect that he would be prepared to dispose of tbe Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers; that be bad sold, I think, 600,000,000 tons of shipping for the British Government since the war, and would be prepared to aet for the Commonwealth Government in this regard without remuneration. The cablegram from Lord Kylsant asked, in effect, if, in tbe event of any offer being made for tbe Line, the Commonwealth Government would undertake to indemnify the purchaser against loss should industrial troubles arise. To both cables I have replied that the Commonwealth Government proposes to offer the Line by public tender, and cannot in the meantime accept any other offer. Prime Minister wns good enough to indicate that tbe Government's tariff proposals would probably be debated this week. In tbese circumstances, I should like to know wben it is proposed to table the Tariff Board's report bn timber and butter? tioned by the honourable member will be tabled to-day. what action tbe Government proposes, to take regarding the allegation that Emanuel Abrahams was permitted to break tlie law by being allowed to leave Australia before providing the bond demanded by tbe Taxation Department?

Premier of Tasmania, suggests that the .present shipping trouble may be overcome by convening a conf erenoe between and of tbe State of Tasmania. I should like to know if the attention of the Prime Minister bas been drawn to that statement, and whether it is proposed to hold such a conference; also whether the rigbt bonorable gentleman thinks that the holding of such a conference would be of any service at the present juncture? I sbould like to know, too, if, in the event of a strike occurring, the Government will take, immediate action to take over tbe sbips trading to Tasmania, and thus safeguard tbe tourist traffic for the coming season ? statement by Mr Lyons suggesting a conference between the Commonwealth and tbe State, and I certainly do not wish to prejudice tbe position in any way by making a pronouncement before any suggestion is made. As to the maintenance of the service between Tasmania and the mainland in the event of serious industrial trouble resulting from the present dispute, I can only assure the honourable member that the Government will take whatever steps it may consider necessary. I remind him that on a previous occasion when communication between the mainland and Tasmania was disrupted the Commonwealth took very definite action. the Prime Minister the following questions:--Has tbe Prime Mininster seen tbe telegraphed report from Hobart in tbe Sydney press to tbe effect that the Oommonwealth Government was seeking to compel the Tasmanian Government to take action against tbe Waterside Workers' Union in connection with the existing dispute on the waterfront? Did of Tasmania that be sbould use his infiuto end tbe dispute, and if such action proved ineffectual, the Tasmanian Government should prosecute the union. . Is",14,Australian Commonwealth

My Government has not available precise detailed information upon which it could found a prosecution, but is quite prepared to prosecute under Arbitration Act or Crimes Act if legal evidence available. Would be glad if you would inform me ou this. In reply to the concluding portion of the honourable member's question, I may say that there are provisions in the Arbitration Act under which any person or government concerned can take proceedings if thought proper. The only action suggested by the Premier of Tasmania was that the Commonwealth Government should urge the Arbitration Court to deal with the claims made by the union, notwithstanding that the union or its members Avere doing what in the opinion of the court amounted to a deliberate flouting of the court. vernment has declined, and still declines, to take any action in this direction. Full inquiries are being made into the matter, in order to see whether there is any action which the Commonwealth can usefully take. In the meantime, I suggest that if any members of this House have any influence with the union, whose apparently unjustifiable action threatens to the union to a recognition of its responsibility. "" In resations between the British Secretary of arising therefrom. to make any statement on the matter, except that the Commonwealth Government has been kept informed of the progress of those negotiations, which I think I can quite properly say-hav e been of the most satisfactory character, and I suggest that you there is every prospect that they will t f for any reason you are not result in a very definite and acceptable between Great Britain and Egypt. union or officers for offence the Arbitration Act is open to your Government or any inCRYSTAL GLASS. ter for Trade and Customs table the Tariff Board's report ou crystal glass? for Trade and Customs had his attention drawn to the statements of manufacturers with regard to deferred duties in the tariff schedule which was laid on the table of the House last week, that probably twelve months' supply of those articles which come under the deferred duties will be immediately imported into Australia, thus keeping back Australian industries for another year? Mi-. PRATTEN -My attention has The Commonwealth Gobeen drawn to those statements, but I have reason to believe that the position will not be so bad as is claimed.

I assure honourable members that the Government will take whatever steps it deems necessary to ensure that its legislative programme is put through this Parliament. Friday morning lust honourable members became involved in a tremendous argument regarding a certain ruling of the Chairman of Committees. In view of the fact that at least two of the Temporary Chairmen of Committees disagreed with that ruling, and subsequently voted with the minority on a motion to dissent from it, I ask you, Mr Speaker, the following questions:-If, in committee, tlie question, "" That the first item of the Estimates be agreed to,"" were put from the Chair, and subsequently an amendment were moved thereto, what would be the position if the closure were applied? Would the question, "" That the question be now put,"" apply only to the amendment before the Chair, or to both the amendment and the original question ? address questions to the Speaker with Committees. question, about some administrative acts of the Department of Home and Territories.

69,"Motion (By Mr Bruce ) , By Leave,","is a bill to amend the Income Tax Assess1921-22, amounted to £18,075,000, is esment Act, which authorizes the collection of the tax. of this description opens up many general method of collecting the tax, and the amount of tax required. I u his second reading speech, as well as in the budget speech, the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) announced a reduction of 10 per cent, in the rate of income tax. In addition to or an increase of about £2,500,000, notthat, this bill provides for many conceswithstanding the fact that income taxasions regarding income tax, some of which I believe are desirable, and others in my judgment, are not. whole of tliese concessions, together with bis administrative capacity; but he tbe proposed. 10 per cent, reduction, are estimated to result in a loss of revenue for the ensuing .financial year of about £1,300,000. Tbis tax was really imposed as a. war measure. It was passed in war time to help to meet the extraordinary cost of thc war, but mainly to provide the interest on tbe war debt then being incurred. We should ask ourselves whether the war oblian increase of £11,617,000. Our public gation has ended, since it is proposed to debt has grown. Indirect taxation has make such severe cuts in the revenue derived from income taxation. We read statements by outside bodies-and it is also suggested in this House-that it is time the Commonwealtli abandoned the field of income taxation. It is argued that this tax was imposed during the war for war purposes, and that now the war is over the tax should be abolished, and the Commonwealth should vacate the field. Tliere might be some merit in that argument if our war obligations had ended with thc war; but they did not. The Treasurer remarked recently that war expenditure from revenue was higher this year than in any previous period. Yet he proposes to reduce the revenue from income taxation by £1,300,000. I propose to consider thc subject, of tax concessions and reductions in the light of a few comparative figures, and I intend to be brief, because I do not desire to traverse again what was said during the budget debate. In 1921-22 the income tax yielded £16,790,000, and it is estimated that during the current financial year it will give only £9,800,000, a reduction of about £7,000,000. At the same time the interest on the war debt, which, in timated for the current year to amount to Therefore, a measure £17,822,000a reduction of only about £250,000. It must be remembered that considerations as to the our total debt increased during the period under review because of the necessity for reducing certain war debts. The total interest payable in 1921-22 was £18,976,000, and for the current year it will be £21,539,000, tion will have been reduced by £7,000,000. Of course, the Treasurer may say that The reduction of taxation is creditable to can take very little comfort from, that fact when he realizes that indirect taxation, which amounted to £49,678,000 in 1921-22, is expected to amount, in the current financial year, to £5S,550,000, an increase of approximately £9,000,000. At the same time the total expenditure from revenue has increased from £64,195,000 to £75,812,000, gone up; our war obligations are still with us: and yet it is proposed to relieve from taxation the very persons who should first be called upon to meet some of tbe obligations of the war. I direct attention to.an arresting statement of the Prime Miuister( Mr Bruce), who, when speaking at Northam, Western Australia., according to a report in the Melbourne Age of the 14th July last, saidThe time would come when the customs revenues would drop, and drop heavily, and then the Commonwealth would get a rude shock, and require a re-orientation of ideas. «1 thoroughly agree with the Prime Minister. He spoke on that occasion .in one of bis lucid moments; but his statement, does not fit in with bis policy. Many persons, both outside this House ancl within it-and I am one of thembelieve in greater protection for Australian industries, and at the same time they demand that the Commonwealth shall retire from the field of direct taxation. Yet tbey know that if effective protection were brought about, less revenue would be derived through the customs. These persons, as the Prime",23,Earle Page
70,Mr Sctjllin (Yarra) [3.33],"ThisMinister said, -vvill require a re-orientaagents and to bear the financial burden tion of ideas; they will receive a rude shock when the revenue from customs does drop heavily. Australia has had a succession of excellent seasons for over a decade. Everywhere we have had signs of prosperity; but we are facing a period that does not look so prosperous as the immediate past has been The coming financial year does not promise to be so bright from any point of view, public or private. provide increased revenue. effective as it ought to be. If it were, it would yield less revenue than in the past. Too great a desire has been shown to build up preferential trade with Great Britain rather than develop Australian industries. During recent years lavish expenditure has been indulged in both publicly and privately. In prosperous times tlie Government ought not to increase, even if it should fail to reduce, its indebtedness; because in lean years the burden of the interest bill will be more keenly felt. There should be a reversion to the policy of paying for certain works out of revenue, instead of from the Loan Fund, and direct taxation should be maintained at its present level instead of beiug reduced by £1,300,000 in respect of income tax and by a further £500,000 in respect of land tax. I again urge, as I for some years, the need for a. fuller consideration of our taxation measures. Not for a number of years have those measures been the subject of a full and proper discussion. members will review the conditions that have obtained in tlie last five or six years cult, if not impossible, to discover one conwhen amendments of our taxation law have been brought forward, they will find that frequently the discussions have taken place during all-night sittings, when honourable members have been either altogether or half asleep. That is not a commendable method of dealing has been that each succeeding year further amendments have been found essential, and the effect upon the revenue has been somewhat disastrous, because clever tax dodgers who are in a position to pay for the services of astute of litigation have been able to relieve themselves of a large measure of their responsibility, whilst others who are not similarly well placed financially, have been compelled to contribute more than their fair proportion. I admit that taxation legislation is perhaps the most difficult to grasp, and it must, therefore, be the most difficult to draft; but it should not be beyond, the genius of our draughtsmen to prepare legislation that will express the intention of Parliament, instead of being open to successful attack whenever tested. During ""the last-five or six years there has been a continual patching up of holes that have been driven in the law. We are now asked to repair another Haw. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) has referred to the case Weatherley v. Commissioner of Taxation. One of the learned judges who heard that case strongly favoured the department; but he had a majority of the court against him. If honourable members will read the arguments of counsel, and particularly the judgments of the Chief Justice, Mr Justice' Isaacs and Mr Justice Higgins, they will realize how the vague phraseology of the law lends itself to the spinning of cobwebs of legal argument, and consequent escape from taxation, and that my contention"" that there should be a more ample discussion of these measures by Parliahave done ment is amply justified. I draw the attention of honourable members to what I consider a just criticism of our methods, uttered by Mr Justice Higgins in the course of bis judgment. ThatI f honourable learned judge saidOwing to tlie patchwork character of successive amendments of the act it is very diffisistent, harmonious scheme throughout the act. The practice seems to be to stuff up every hole iu the act as it appears. I agree that that has been the practice. Before any attempt is made to reduce the amount of revenue obtained from the taxation of incomes, the Government with legislation. The result should by every means try to devise, as far as practicable equitable methods of levying taxation. Althoughi t is not possible to make the taxation law absolutely equitable, I am convinced that it can be made more equitable than it is to-day. Previous attempts to have that",24,Earle Page

When an agreement has been reached upon the policy to be adopted, aud a decision has been arrived at as to who should bear the burden, the rate for each class should will not be perfect, but it will be nearer be tbe same for all wbo fall within that class. In this bill an attempt is being made to extend the averaging principle by permitting losses to be carried forward. second-reading speech that in committee he would submit a number of averaging schemes that bad been considered by the Taxation 'Department. Honourable members can visualize what is likely to happeriod of years the taxpayer will receive pen. The numerous suggestions that the Treasurer has in his possession will be thrown on the table, perhaps in the midst of a warm and an animated discussion of principles, and no honourable member will have sumcient timo to grasp their significance. Why cannot those that have been submitted to and examined by the department, and pronounced upon by experienced officers, be placed before honourable members in memorandum form so that they may have a week, or so in which to consider them ancl arrive at an intelligent judgment of their relative merits? through exactly as it has been drafted because the rule of party, and not that of system a man with a diminishing income common sense or of justice, will apply. No person willingly pays taxation, but I beliese that the majority of people r realize that it must be imposed to enable the government of the country to be carried on. The most prolific cause of irritation is the feeling that one is payremains high, he will, at the end of the ing comparatively a greater tax than I others who earn a similar income.

It is really an averaging of rates, not of diminishing income will pay more than inconie. In addition to that, it is now proposed by the Treasurer to take a step further, and carry forward losses into the these suggestions were exhaustively examaveraging period. This, I submit, does not more than touch the fringe of the problem. No relief will be given to men 1 witb practically no income, or a very small income, in one year, and with a large income in other years.

It is said by those who favour that view that over a at least a rough measure of justice. But I have made many tests myself, and I find that although on the surface that arrangement looks fair enough, actually it is not fair. Taking actual and supposititious cases, it will be found that under the present system men with irregular incomes, averaging over a period of five years, say, £1,000, pay sometimes more and sometimes less than those with u regular income of £1,000 a year. So far as I have been able to determine from the tests whicli I have made, I believe that the system of averaging to arrive at the rate of The elause will probably go tax applicable, is further from justice than the old system.

I protest strongly against the amendcompany pays income tax. It is paid ment proposed in this bill relating to company taxation. The Treasurer, in his second-reading speech, said that it was proposed to refrain from compelling companies to pay indirectly the income tax payable by an absentee shareholder. This provision, he said, was a very wide one. I agree that it is. I consider that it is a pernicious discrimination against Britain is getting the tax both Australian shareholders. absentee shareholder will not be taxed, the Australian shareholder will be taxed. There is a reciprocal arrangement with the British Government which provides for certain rebates to avoid double taxation, but if this amendment is carried, that arrangement will be done away with, and the position will be this: that while the United Kingdom taxes Australian residents on profits made in Britain, British residents who derive intories. Our laws are not like those of the made there. tax is imposed on all profits of a company, and all profits are taxed before they are distributed, whether they are sent to British or Australiau taxpayer's.

The Treasurer put up a plea for the absentees. He said that the purpose of the bill is to attract outside capital to this country. The same argument is used to justify the Government's policy of overseas borrowing, but how far is it to go? We can have too much outside capital brought in to exploit the resources of this country.

Why not tax absentee shareholders just as we tax Australian shareholders? If the absentees are beyond the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, as is argued by the Treasurer, I submit that the company is not. We should tax in such cases at the source as Britain does. Let me pursue that argument further. Tlie Treasurer says that by treating absentees liberally, and exempting them from tax we shall attract capital here. What about the big land companies which have monopolies of large areas of Australian soil? Some of them have done good work in the development of this country; but others have done harm in blocking progress that has more than counterbalanced the good. On the same principle should not absentee land-owners be exempt from land tax? exempt at present. be exempt. The Treasurer's argument is illogical. If land-owners are to evade income tax, they should, on his reasoning, evade land tax also. The Treasurer also suggested that in respect of u company registered and controlled outside Australia, all its money is taken out of the country, and, therefore, the company cannot ba compelled to pay absentee shareholders' tax. know that that supports the argument that the exemption favours bringing capital into this country. His next statement, relates to a company that is registered and controlled in Australia, and contains the most peculiar argument that I have ever heard submitted. He saidThe Government considers that, as the absentee is generally heavily taxed in his own country, and as there arc very few absentees who are shareholders in purely Australian companies, it is good policy to exempt the absentee shareholder from the Australian tax. The Treasurer has given too many and too varied reasons. He has laboured the subject, and one argument has cancelled another. Some companies are outside the jurisdiction of Australia, and, therefore, he argues that that is a strong reason for not taxing them. Then others are within Australian jurisdiction, but because they are few in number, nnd, in any case, heavily taxed in Great Britain, they should be exempt from taxation. Further, he says that, it is good policy to attract British capital to Australia. If the last reason is sound, and it is good policy to attract outside capital, why put forward the other reasons? He says that the 'companies not outside Australian jurisdiction are few. If tbey were many would he tax them, and would he then throw aside what he thinks the sound policy of encouraging outside capital? All these reasons are given simply to buttress a case that cannot be substantiated. In justice to this country, profits earned by every company operating in Australia should be taxed, whether the shareholders are resident here or elsewhere. It is an outrageous policy to exempt absentees and to increase the tax on Australians to moke up the deficiency in revenue caused by that exemption. Mi-.

I ask honourable members behind the Government are they prepared to come out boldly and declare that they stand for absentees as against our own people. That brings me to another consideration.

There are, roughly, four classes of bonus shares that I know of, which include bonus shares issued from capital assets written up, and those issued from profits of sales of capital assets.

119,Surely There Is No Difference Mr Scullin,"I do not, think it has;I come now to another concession, which, although I agree with it, does notremove an anomaly. It violates a principle of inconie taxation, but it is neverof only £500, from a little farm. theless justified. I refer to deductions for expenditure on certain improvements such as clearing scrub, &c. Undoubtedly such improvements as wire netting and wire fencing involve capital expenditure, and Parliament exempted such expenditure from taxation some time ago. Special argument can be adduced in favour of such policy, but not in favour of that which the Treasurer has submitted. He said that such improvements would lead to increased productivity, ancl that in consequence increased income taxation would be collected. If such an argument is reasonable, should not the same consideration be extended to a person who spends capital ou the improvement of his factory, expenditure which also leads to increased productivity. Should not capital expenditure of that nature also be exempt? tioned by the honourable member, the land would probably be valueless without such improvements. capital expenditure would lead to increased productivity. everything possible to encourage settlers to put their land to its best use, instead of allowing it to remain idle. As there are millions of acres of land in Australia not being put to any use at all. I would favour the land tax on unimproved land values being increased, and the amount of exemption under our Income Tax Act also being increased in proportion to the improvements effected. I believe in penalizing those who do not use the land to the best advantage, ancl encouraging those who are doing their utmost to incr6ase the productivity of the soil. Those are the strong grounds, upon which these exemptions, can be made. The trouble with all these concessions is that they cannot be applied equitably. The big man again gets the best of things. witb a lucrative business makes a side-line of farming, or the conduct of a pastoral property, and spends £500 in clearing his block. If he had an income of £5,000, he would be allowed to deduct that £500 from his income, which would make a considerable reduction in histax. Another man might have an income He spends the whole, or nearly the whole, of that £500 in clearing off scrub and rubbish. Such a man, of course, would not have to pay any income tax, or very little; but in any case his taxation would amount only to £7 or £S. Therefore, for the same service, the big man secures au advantage of, perhaps, £50 as against the £7 or £S of advantage secured by the little man. I admit that the problem is a difficult one, ancl that a similar difficulty applies to the concessions for children and wives. culty it is necessary to have a graduated system. providing a pro. rata deduction. Then there are the exemptions for gifts, Why should the exemption be limited to gifts of £5 or more. The donor has cast on him the onus of proving that he made the donation on which he claims, and I certainly think that the concession should apply to amounts smaller than £5. I do not contend for a reductio ad absurdum. but tbe Treasurer could make We sliould do the exemption more generous by giving it to those donating small sums. Very often the person who gives £1 or 10s. is more generous than the giver of £5. 1 am glad that the minimum tax payable has been reduced from £1 to 10s. I understand that the minimum in Victoria is 5s I do not know what it is in other States. As the States now collect both taxes, why not make the minimum uniform? Certainly the £1 minimum was oppressive in some cases, and the alteration to 10s. will be a relief. To sum up my argument in a few words, the bill removes some anomalies, but it does not touch greater anomalies, and injustices, to some of which I have referred. There are proposed amendments, which are necessary to safeguard the revenue. Of such we approve. Some Suppose that a man of the concessions are reasonable. Some are not; in particular, the concession to absentee share-holder& earning profits in Australia.

123,Mr Scullin,"Exactly; a systemsome of the holes that have beeu driven into the act. Even the very measure by which we are tightening up the law will have to be examined more closely in committee. I hope that, when the bill reaches that stage, we shall have ample time to thrash out every question, because the clauses of taxation bills are not only important, but are exceedingly involved. Five years ago, or thereabouts, a consolidated income tax act was passed by this House. would be about the last amendment of t.he income tax law that would be needed for a considerable time. The bill now before the House indicates that several amendments have been found to be necessary. The Treasurer has suggested the removal of a considerable number of anomalies in the bill. Before a reduction of taxation is granted to the taxpayers of Australia, the system Applied to its incidence should be put on a more equitable basis, which, I claim, is possible. I am not sure that there should be a reduction, nor am I convinced that the reduction of the minimum from El to HOs. is justified at sucb a time as rhe present. One very reasonable and proper alteration is proposed in the bill, the absence of which has caused much heartburning in the past. When a sheep is shorn it takes about twelve months for the wool to grow again on its back. If a person buys a sheep off the shears be buys merely the sheep, not the wool. If he buys the sheep twelve months later, just before it is shorn, he buys the sheep in the wool, so that the price paid is practically double that paid for the same sheep off tbe shears. Hitherto the Taxation Department has merely considered the amount paid for the sheep, and has not considered the sale of the wool on its back. that. Now, under the amendment, if a person buys the wool on a sheep's back it is treated similarly to the wool bought in the bale, which I consider to be very proper. I am glad that the Treasurer recognizes that a sheep in the wool and one off the shears are in different categories. bullocks. fatten that bullock. sheep. it more cheaply than when in the wool. able member discriminate between that and the buying of a store bullock? store bullock and afterwards sells it as a fat bullock the transaction is similar to It was then said that that buying a sheep off the shears and selling in the wool. He merely<costs it up at the low }H'ice paid, but the analogy of the bullock and the disposal of the wool is different. In the one case you may have a fat sheep with a f u ll fleece of wool. It is the wool that counts. A nearer analogy would be the purchase of laud with timber on it. It may be the value of the timber that counts. As the landis depleted of timber the asset depreciates. I do not agree with the Treasurer that the Income Tax Act at present provides for the minimum in administration costs except where the Federal and State departments have been brought practically uncier the one roof and administered by the same 3taff. Clause 13, which was referred to by the honourable member for yarra ( Mr Scullin), and which deals with the averaging system, would, if admitted, permit of great saving in administration being effected. I have prepared certain tables illustrating many cases in which injustice has .been done, and demonstrating how my proposed amendment could work, and give equity within five years. I cannot understand the statement in the report of the royal commission referring to extreme injustice being caused by earmarking or watertighting the income of This bill proposes to alter one year, apart from the preceding and succeeding yeai-s. The graduating of rates was agreed upon by this House, and no doubt injustices occurred wliere people received irregular incomes. In 1921, on a motion for adjournment moved by the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay), this House considered the advisability of a five-years' averaging of income, and agreed to the scheme.

That does not, seem just. Husband and wife may have separate rights in landed properties, and such rights should not be disregarded in this legislation. 1 allow deductions in respect of improvements to property, such as clearing and vermin-proof fencing. J. do not imagine that these deductions w ill seriously affect the Treasury, because it takes some years for a settler to earn a taxable inconie. However, there are cases in which they will benefit settlers, and, therefore, I welcome the provision. Some time ago we amended the then existing legislation to provide that money spent in verinin-proofiug a property would be an allowable deduction. Strangely enough, taxpayers were then already entitled to that deduction. where the State legislation does not provide for such a deduction, oue taxpayer, Mr Lindsay, M.L.A., when submitting his returns, deducted expenditure in connection with vermin-proof fencing. The deduction was disallowed by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation iu that State, but when Mr Lindsay took the matter before the court the Chief Justice of Western Australia ruled that the commissioner was wrong in disallowing it . standing that decision, the taxation authorities refused to allow me a similar deduction in respect of a partnership in which I was interested. It even went so far as to refuse Mr Lindsay a re-assessment of his income previous to the year in which he appealed. He, however, again applied to the court, and was successful case.

A decision which ordinary citizens would recognize should be accepted by a my intention to move in committee that a frequently a wife who new clause be inserted after clause 6. will be realized that this is largely a committee bill. I desire, in tbe first place, to express my appreciation of thc thorough manner in which the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) has analysed the subject with which it deals. He has evidently given much consideration to it , and his speech has been of considerable assistance to honourable members. I endorse his remarks questioning the desirability of the proposed reduction agree with the proposal to of direct taxation. I have no objection to any reduction that is warranted; but we cannot justify at the present time the reduction of those taxes that were specially imposed to meet war expenditure. The honourable member reminded the committee that,-although the war debt has been reduced, the interest bill has grown, and we are now paying £2,500,000 more for interest than we did in 1923. We cannot justify the removal of taxes imposed to meet war expenditure, since we have increased the burden of in direct taxation on the great mass of the In Western Australia, people. Tlie chief point to consider in the present bill is the proposed exemption of absentee taxpayers. Oue finds it difficult to understand why special provision is made to exempt, company shareholders who happen to live outside Australia. If any persons should be held liable for the payment ©f income tax, they are those who take wealth from this country and yet do not live in it . Why should they Notwithbe exempt from taxation in Australia, while our own citizens, who may be shareholdei ""s in the same companies, are taxed? I do not think that the proposal can be justified from the point of view of equity. The honourable member for Yarra showed that it could not be urged on the ground that reciprocal legislation between GreatB rita in and the dominions",33,Earle Page
138,And Rightly Mr Charlton (Hunter) [4.55],"I twas desirable. If we lay down tbe principle that persons taking wealth from this country and living abroad can escape payment of their share of the taxes, we shall be offering an inducement to capitalists, whose money is invested in Australia, to live elsewhere. That it should be proposed to exempt them from taxation .seems to me to be inexplicable. I should like to hear the Treasurer further on the matter. I agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Yarra about the necessity for averaging incomes over a period of five years, in order to ascertain the rate of tax. That would be a much fairer arrangement than the present method. A taxpayer might have been receiving a fairly good income for a few years; but his earnings might suddenly decline, and he might be reduced to such a financial position in a particular year that no tax would be payable. If his income were averaged over a period of five years, no injustice would be done. Clause 14 of the bill deals with a situation that has arisen in connection with the New Guinea gold-fields. I recently .asked a question in this chamber on this said that he would have the act amended so as to prevent hardship being suffered by gold-seekers in New GuineaMany persons are engaged in searching for gold there, and, as on all new fields, the miners, generally speaking, work for themselves. Usually they have not a great deal of capital behind them, and they depend upon the proceeds from sales of their gold to pay their way. The men who trade in gold make greater profit, as a rule, than do the miners themselves. From my considerable experience of gold-fields, I should say that the conditions in New Guinea are not different from those in other fields that have come into prominence in the past. The buyers ascertain the value of the gold, aud pay the miners a price much below it, in order to secure for themselves a substantial commission. They also take care that the price paid to the miners enables them to meet the tax that is charged on gold shipped to Australia. They have been paying the tax levied in accordance with the value of the gold, and it is said by the Treasurer that au adjustment must be made by returning to the persons who Mr Charlton. bring the gold, into Australia the amount to which they are entitled. That will not get over the difficulty, because the present law permits the buyers to "" fleece"" the men supplying the gold. The buyers can tell the producers that they are paying, by way of tax, more than they are actually charged, and they can thereby obtain a double advantage at the expense of the miners. The matter is causing a good deal of discontent on the New Guinea fields, as the following press telegram indicates A public meeting, held at Salamoa yesterday, unanimously passed the following resolution :"" That we, the members of this meeting, all being interested in the production of gold' in this territory, hereby advise all miners to hold their gold, and not ship same to Australia until Australia realizes the injustice of the imposed tax on gold shipped to Australia; and further we consider that such action by the Australian Government must force us to make arrangements to ship our gold to other countries than Australia.""

On the other hand, however, I uphold tbe contention of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) that a great deal of first-class land in every part of Australia is not being put to its best use. Steps should be taken to compel the owners of that land to utilize it to the fullest possible extent, or pay a greater amount of taxation. The Prime Minister, of course, believes that it is a fallacy TO argue that big estates ought to be expressed the view that certain lands cannot be used for other than grazing purposes, and that if men were put on small areas they could not hope to work them successfully. It is difficult, to estimate the extent to which we can reduce direct tinues on the up grade. A stocktaking will have to be held sooner or later. WhilstI take little exception generally to the proposals that are contained in the bill, I consider that this House ought not to allow absentees to be exempt from taxation.

Although it has been slow in gaining the approval of honourable members, it appears to be fair and just to the taxpayer, whose welfare is our main consideration. The other matter to which I wish to refer is the proposal in Clausei 20 to amend section 51 of the principal act, so as to alter the procedure before the Board of .Review. As honourable members are aware, appeals by taxpayers against decisions of the commissioner, are now dealt with without cost to the taxpayer. arise upon the hearing of such appeals. It is alleged that legal decisions have been given which have knocked holes into our taxation law. We cannot, on that account, quarrel with those decisions. It is only by obtaining the legal interpretation of any law that we are able to secure sound legislation. If the decision of the court shows that a law is contrary to the wish and the intention of this House, it is necessary for us to amend that law. There bave been before the Appeal Board several very important cases, one of the most recent being the Thorogood case, which has had a very wide bearing upon income tax payments. In four recent cases the interpretation of the law which was given by the board was upheld by the High Court upon a reference to it by the Commissioner of Taxation. Tbat is an indication that, generally speaking, the legal judgment of the board is sound, and that taxpayers receive protection from it even on points of law without considerable and unnecessary expense. I feel sure that honourable members would like to see that object generally effected. If clause 20 is agreed to, the procedure will be entirely altered. It statesTho' hoard shall, ii|ion thu ro<|iiest of the ment will not persist with its proposal. commissioner or a taxpayer, refer to the High (.'ourt any question of law arising before the board, and the decision of the High Court thereon shall be final and conclusive. If a point of law should be raised during the hearing of an appeal, it will be open to the commissioner to say, "" This matter is beyond the jurisdiction of the board,"" and to have it referred forthwith to the High Court. The subsequent legal proceedings will delay tbe bearing of the Mr Mann. appeal, and involve the taxpayer in heavy expenses. In view of the successful manner in which the board has so far operated, it is unnecessary to make the proposed alteration. The Government, through the commissioner, will be given a distinctly unfair advantage. It sliould be our aim to relieve these proceedings of expense, as far as that is possible. The amendment proposed will enable tbe Government to involve the taxpayer iu the expense of an appeal to the High Court. If the board is competent to handle these matters, why should the present practice be departed from? Should the GovernPoints of law occasionally ment be dissatisfied with any of its decisions, it can appeal in the ordinary way to the High Court. Surely it is more just for the Government than for tbe taxpayer to be put to the expense of a reference to the High Court! I wish it to be understood that I have no desire to give a taxpayer an opportunity to escape from taxation. The Board of Review at present has the power to call upon a taxpayer to pay the expenses of an appeal if it considers that the appeal is frivolous or has been made on insufficient or unjustifiable grounds. I presume that the High Court, also, would award expenses against u taxpayer in the event of a decision being given against him. The existing procedure is smooth, expeditious, and in every way satisfactory to the taxpayer. Under this proposal the powers of the board will be emasculated, and it will be deprived of a very important part of its functions, which, up to the present, it has shown itself fully capable of performing. There are on the board gentlemen who have bad legal training, and the support and approval of the High Court has been accorded to tlieir interpretation of the law. In committee I shall ask honourable members to decide whether the present practice shall continue, and I hope that the Govern.1 think the time has arrived when, instead of making reductions of £9.000,000 or £11,000,000 in the income taxation for the year, tliere should be a. substantial reduction in the indirect taxation.

During the war, income taxation was increased considerably, but reductions have taken place since. I contend, not that the income tax should be further reduced; but that more consideration should be given to the poorer classes. I suggest that even the exemption might be increased. In the proposed bill are one or two anomalies, one in particular being the proposal to exempt from income taxation absentee shareholders in companies operating in Australia. It is hopeless to expect the Government to alter its attitude, because in levying taxation it unpopular with the taxpayer than the must show consideration for its wealthy supporters, and, in particular, for vested interests. [5.45] -Although there will apparently be a long discussion ou the bill in committee, ' I prefer to speak on the second reading. The Leader of tbe Opposition ( Mr Charlton) referred to both large land-owners and small land-owners. 1 have beard iu this House much criticism, most of it unjust, of the large land-owner. I know something about land, and I venture to say that in some of the States, at any rate, if, wheu motoring through the countryside, one comes across a well-kept place, adequately improved, it will be found almost invariably that it is owned either by a-large land-owner or by someone who is becoming a large land-owner. Eor that lie should not receive any great credit. It dependent upon the opinion, belief or state of is perfectly natural that he should expend his money on his land, and that he should be able to improve to a larger degree than can the smaller land-owner. I am .not here to defend all large land-owners, or to criticize small land-owners; but large land-owner does not get anything like fair criticism, particularly from honourable members opposite. The large landowner, whatever his merits or demerits may be, has contributed very substantially to the development of the greatest industry of Australia, that in which we lead the world. Both the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), and the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) referred to a matter on which I myself have spoken previously. simplicity, as far as it can be achieved, in our enactments, so that be wbo runs-and I suppose the taxpayer generally does run, if he can-ma y read. The bill contains provisions some of -which sbould be useful and some which, although they may have no harmful effect, will nevertheless make our income tax assessment laws even more complicated than they are at present Tbe difficulty with our taxation measures is that it is almost an impossibility for the the ordinary mau to understand tbem, and for that reason our Commonwealth taxation department has always been more State department. This unpopularity is' due, not so much to a desire to escape tax, as to the feeling of hopelessness that tbe taxpayer experiences when attempting to grapple with the provisions of taxation measures. Let me give an instance. Under tbe bill there is to be appointed an assistant commissioner. That provision may be desirable, but the Treasurer has neither extolled nor explained it. vides for an alteration in the title of Mr Templeton, who is at present acting as assistant commissioner.

152,Mr Duncan,"HUGHES -The prodilTerent ruling on a similar point raised in another State, yet according to the bill the opinion, belief or state of mind of the two of tbem is assumed to be identical. The provision relating to deductions for loss in any of the four years preceding that in wbich tbe income was derived may be beneficial, but it will throw more work on the department, which very often has my sympathy in carrying out its duties under our legislation. It will also increase the body of taxation experts, many of whom have been through the department itself, and to whom it is almost, essential that the taxpayer should refer for advice and assistance. Under another provision wool and sheep are to be assessed as distinct from each otber, and for that the Treasurer gave no explanation. Tbe commissioner is to assess on the market value of "" similar sheep off shears."" It is not easy to find similar sheep. Few breeders will admit that their sheep are similar to other breeders' sheep, aud it is hard to ascertain member for Yarra approaches this matter exactly wben tbe sheep were off shears, because shearing takes place at different periods. I suggest that these provisions will, cause tbe taxation office greater labour than it bas at present, and the taxpayers will probably bave to furnish' more details. With reference to income tax deductions in respect of gifts, I agree with tbe Treasurer that a £5 limitation is not too high. The honourable member for Yarra suggested a smaller amount. It is obvious that the poor man who gives 2s. 6d. may be. paying relatively more than the wealthy man who gives £10; but it is impracticable to keep count of small amounts. duces a receipt should be allowed a deduction. something to be said for that, but usually receipts are uot given for small amounts. a hospital would receive a receipt for it. amounts are contributed to such funds for which receipts are not obtained. payer to prove that he has contributed.

I have no desire to see small contributors embarrassed whilst those contributing larger sums benefit. It was my intention to deal with the subject of absentees, and I had in advance noted some of thc points raised by tbe honourable member for Yarra (M.r. Scullin). I do not think it at all logical of the Treasurer to claim on one hand that the absentees should bring tbeirmoney into Australia, because it needs additional capital to assist the effective and speedy development of the Commonwealth, and at the same time to sponsor a bill uuder which absentees are not allowed any concessions or exemptions in tbe matter of land tax. Tbe bonorable from a different direction; but I am sure that we agree on the point that it is illogical to claim that it is desirable to encourage the investment of capital in Australia, and to discourage absentees who want to invest money in land here. It could be claimed that the absentee wbo invests his capital in land is likely to be of more use to; a7id take a greater interest in, Australia than oue who invests his money in a company. I understand that tbere is a retrospective provision in the bill which I have been unable to locate. I understood the Treasurer to say, however, that owing to the Weatherley case, a clause to be retrospective to 1924 had been inserted. The Treasurer said that absolute equity in a taxation measure is not economically obtainable, and that we may all admit; but it is desirable that we sbould get as close as we can to equity. I have mentioned before the disadvantages of retrospective legislation, and bave receiver] support from other members in m j contention that it is most inequitable to establish retrospectively a state of affairs which it is claimed shoulc have been established three years ago This is grossly unfair.

160,Mr Duncan,"HUGHES-That may have put in notices of objection or appeals, ancl who under the present law should be relieved. surprising that the Treasurer should say that the result of the Weatherley case is so contrary to tbe intention of Parliament, ancl "" has such far-reaching effects upon the reveuue"" that the Government has taken the earliest opportunity to "" re-express "" the original intention of Parliament. fact that the law was not effective shows that it was not properly expressed, and unless one can use the word "" re-express "" as meaning to express differently, tbe word is quite inappropriate. Presumably, if it had uot had such a far-reaching effect upon the revenue, such retrospective legislation would not have been introduced. I do not wish to weary honourable members on this point, because I have bill in these modern times, when income expressed my views upon it on previous occasions: but I maintain that the whole principle of retro-active legislation is most dangerous. With it, a taxpayer or citizen can never know to what extent be may subsequently be made liable for an aet whicli under the law at the time tliat he committed it was quite legal. AV hen the Income Tax Assessment Ace of 1924 was drafted, the Government had, I presume, the assistance of the Attorney-General and file Crown law officers, and what Parliament endeavoured to enact -was, apparently, not enacted. The only fair thing is to amend tbe law now and not to make it retrospective. It is not right or reasonable for the Government to say that it meant to enact a certain law but failed to do so. The Commonwealth has been defeated in the courts, and now endeavours to override decisions of the court by retrospective believe in the principle, and have spoken and voted against it on many occasions. It is seldom that an inconie tax measure is introduced into this chamber unless some method of defeating the law has been found. Tbat is not right. If the taxpayers can legally defeat the departmeut-I word "" defeat*' in any unpleasant senseby going to the courts tbey are entitled fo do so. By overriding a decision of the High Court of Australia and Supreme Court of Victoria the Government is defeating the law just as much as the taxpayer. -A t this juncture I wish to say only a few words concerning the bill. I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) and tbe Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), who spoke subsequently, that its provisions can be more effectively debated in committee. The There are, however, one or two points raised by those speakers which are, I think, worthy of emphasis before the second reading is agreed to. The measure seems t.o be good iu parts, particularly in so far as it provides for certain concessions to primary producers. member fully understand its clauses? taxation is based upon graduation and progression, mnst necessarily be complex and very difficult for laymen' to understand. Any attempt to simplify an income tax measure is likely to reduce its equity or the possibility of its provisions applying justly to everybody. The deductions to be allowed to primary producers are fully justified, as agriculturalists and other rural workers are entitled to all the consideration they can receive at the hands of any government, particularly to the extent of being allowed to make the' deductions provided in the bill, as well as tlie application of u system under which they can really average their incomes for taxation purposes. The averaging proposals in the bill, bowever, are not so effective as those outlined by tbe honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), and elaborated by the honourable member legislation. I do not for Eorrest( Mr Prowse). If tbe proposals of the honourable member for Forrest are more satisfactory, tbey should be incorporated in the bill. Tbere is also every justification why other. persons such as traders whose income is irregular sbould receive tbe same privilege. do not use the is done under the existing system. arrangement does not embody a real averaging system, and is particularly hard upou the man on the land whose income is necessarily irregular.

The bill makes more concessions and exemptions to a particular class of absentee income earners than are contained in the present law. These further concessions are undoubtedly a blot on it. I do not know how the Treasurer can hope to justify the clause relating to the exemption of absentee shareholders, which is a'discrimination of a most pernicious character. It provides special treatment for person's who do not reside in tbe country, but draw their incomes from it. As this country protects the interests of investing absentees whose income tax is their only contribution towards the cost of government, there are no good grounds upon which the Government can justify such a provision as that embodied in the bill. read very carefully the Treasurer's explanation of this clause, and it strikes sue that he eitlier does not understand the principles of taxation, or that he has attempted to mislead the House. Groom) -Order! he has' submitted information to the House that does not place the situation in its true light. I do not wish to do the Treasurer an injustice. He dealt with three cases. The first of these was that of a company established and registered nnd controlled outside Australia a foreign company-and deriving income from Australian sources, but taking the income outside Australia and there declaring dividends. In that case tbe Treasurer contends the Commonwealth cannot cause the company to pay the shareholder's tax out of his dividends because the company does not hold any money in Australia on account of the absentee. It is puerile to say that the Government cannot compel a company to sentee shareholder because the income Australia before a dividend was declared. Some, if not all, of the States collect taxation in similar circumstances, under a most effectual system. It is true that presentatives of the companies, who have recouped. Tbe second case was that of a company established and registered outside Australia, but controlled by directors in Australia and deriving income from Australian sources, retaining the income of tbe shareholder, and declaring dividends here. Such shares as might be on the ex-Australian register of tbe company would not be taxable, because of a recent decision by an English court, under which, if the Commonwealtli forced the company to pay the shareholders' tax, it could not recover from tbe shareholder. One can understand that position; but the States have coped, with a similar difficulty-and the Commonwealth could do likewise-by levying against tbe company and allowing the company to find its own remedy against the shareI have holder. Such companies might have to alter their articles or memorandum of association, and a shareholder would have to submit to the company making a deduction with respect to the portion, of the profits earned in Australia payable as dividends to absentees. In tbe third class of cases are companies established, registered and controlled in Australia, and having absentee shareholders deriving incomes from Australian sources. In that case the Government considers that, as the absentee shareholder is generally fairly heavily taxed iu bis own country in respect of his full dividend, and as there are very few absentees who are shareholders in purely Australian companies, it is good policy to exempt the absentee shareholders from the Australian tax. In none of those cases has the Treasurer justified the proposal to exempt absentee shareholders. In some cases, there is a possibility of inflicting hardship on a company, by causing it to pay a tax on behalf of. an absentee shareholder wheu it has no opportunity of reimbursing itself. I submit that such difficulties have been overcome in pay on behalf of an abthe past, where companies were so registered that they were subject to has been removed from both State and Commonwealth taxation.

If the Commonwealth makes these proposals law, a great many shareholders in Anglo-Australian or purely Australian companies resident abroad, who are not at present entitled to the concessions offered by the amendment, will seek to enjoy its advantages, and, therefore, will insist on an alteration, either in the registration of their companies or in tbe method of paying dividends, to bring them within the ambit of the concessions, and so obtain income tux exemption.

We should do our best to ensure that the taxation will fall equitably on all sections of the community. Primary producers deserve special consideration, for they may lose in one bad year more than their total profits in a preceding good year. The returns of some ordinary business men fluctuate a good deal, but not so greatly as do those of primary producers. 1 wish now to discuss a new phase of the subject. There has been a good deal of discussion in Australia lately as to whether shareholders in limited companies who live outside of the Commonwealth should be compelled to pay taxation on the incomes they derive from companies which operate in Australia. As a member of the Motion Picture Industry .Royal Commission, I have been somewhat perturbed at tbe methods adopted by the American film-producing companies to escape taxation from the profits they make iu Australia. They form subsidiarycompanies in Australia to which they allow an average of 35 per cent, of their gross proceeds to meet all expenses. The other 65 per cent, is sent to the United States of America as rent, which it undoubtedly is; but it is also profits, and is not taxable here. been considering whether it could make & recommendation to Parliament to ensure that this money shall be taxed. But in my investigations I have come across something that needs far more urgent attention than this. If there is one thing that Australia needs more than another, it is capital to develop the country. Everything that we can do to encourage capital to come here should be done, ancl we should do nothing that will have tbe eifect of driving capital away. I have been reading in the last report of the Melencouragement to tliese people to invest bourne Stock Exchange a good deal about the operations of various tin companies whose stocks are quoted on the exchange. The greater proportion of the capital invested in tliese companies is Australiau. Huge profits bave been made recently in various tin-mining ventures in the Malay States and elsewhere in the East.

If we find that we have made a mistake in any particular year, let us correct it as soon as we get an opportunity to do so; but do not let us penalize peopio because of it. In conclusion, I again urge tbe Government to do its best to simplify the wording of our taxation legislation. It is not ""right that we should bave taxation experts earning large incomes for simply preparing returns* for taxpayers. The law should be so clearly expressed that ordinary producers and business men could complete their returns without expert assistance. designed to make income taxation more equitable than it has been in the past, and to remove anomalies ancl hardships; but I confess that I am lukewarm in my endorsement of the reduction of the income tax by 10 per cent. As I see it, it will eventually confer no benefit on income taxpayers-certainl y none on industry-and , since it, will be replaced by indirect taxation, it will inflict great economic injury. If this were a straight out reduction of income or any other but it is merely shifting from direct to indirect 'taxation. I do not know that I could illustrate more aptly the difference between these two forms qf taxation, where a heavy tax is to he raised, than by reference to the of the bill. I have listened to one honourable member after another endeavouring to suggest amendments to make income taxation more equitable, and, as far as possible, to remove the anomalies and hardships. One gathers from the debate and from tbe bill itself that direct taxation, and especially income taxation, has been reduced to a science; but, when one considers the great, load of indirect taxation that is borne by the people, one finds that science and system are impossible of application. Indirect taxation is flung without discrimination upon consumption goods. .Direct taxation is scientific; it represents a sincere endeavour to tax according to ability to pay. This subject is of first class economic importance to Australia, and at the risk of wearying honourable members 1. shall summarize tbe various aspects of direct taxation. We may begin with the . principle of the exemption from taxation of those earning low wages. Exemption is not given as a political sop to voters, but as a recognition of thc principle that it is uneconomic and hurtful to tax a subsistence wage, because cither the tax is passed on, or moral",44,Eakle Pace Afte R The Words Taxation While Indirect Taxation Con

While we have this hideous system in operation, we are at the same time flirtin g with childhood endowment. should like to contrast Australia's position and economic conditions with those of Canada. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for Canada's easier economic and more prosperous manufacturing and general industrial position is that she does uot tax the necessaries of life as heavily as we do in Australia. Canada, with a population of 9,400,000, raises nearly £37,000,000 per annum through customs tralia, with a population of 6,000,000, raises' £44,800,000. In otber words, Canada's per capita taxation through customs and excise is £3 18s, while ours is £7 3s. 9d. Australia's indirect tax on the necessaries of life at the bottom rung of tbe industrial ladder is 91 per cent, higher than that of Canada. I tion in regard to manufactures is due entirely to that; but it is in the main, and so long as Australia continues to tax tbe necessaries of l if e as heavily as it now does our industrial position will be bad. Australia is practically unable to export a single manufactured article. I think that our total exports include only 2 or 3 per cent, of manufactured goods, while Then we have to Canada's exports in 1924 included 40 per cent, of manufactured goods. She does it, possibly, to some extent, by reason of higher efficiency on the part of employers, Let us take and, possibly, to some extent by longer working hours and more piece-work; but she does it also largely because ber taxation of the necessaries of l if e is substanI tially lower than ours. We are told by tbe Minister power. is factor in the cost of manufacture, but it is Under inconie taxarelatively a nominal percentage. Canada's position is worthy of the consideration of the Government and the House. Much has been said on the subject of our adverse trade balance. Honourable members may be interested to know that, during the four years ended 1926-27, Canada had an average annual balance of exports A man with a wife and five over imports to the value of £44,000,000 v In other words, her economic position is incomparably better than ours, and I largely put it down to the fact that she does not commit the fatal mistake of placing an excessive, and, as I see it , un1 necessary tax upon tbe commodities necessary to life. I shall endeavour to-explain how this indirect taxation as compared with direct taxation falls. I shall take the position of tbe farmer, because, as I have said before, although I represent a city constituency, I regard tbe primary producer as the economic sheet anchor of the country. From tbe peak year in income tax-1920-21 up to and including 1926-27, a farmer and excise, while Auson a net taxable income of £500 1 per annum was relieved, by successive reductions of income tax to the extent of £5 2s. 10d. During that period, however, the indirect taxation through customs and excise has been increased by £1 6s. per capita, so that a farmer with a wife and three or four children is paying more taxation to-day than when we commenced these reductions of inconie tax. do not say that Canada's posiHe is paying on the average £6 10s. more, by way of indirect taxation, than he bad to pay in 1920-21. actual increase in customs revenue. that the man on the basic wage, inasmuch as his wage is based on tbe cost of living,",45,Eakle Pace Afte R The Words Taxation While Indirect Taxation Con

191,Mr Mann,T h a t is based only on the,46,Eakle Pace Afte R The Words Taxation While Indirect Taxation Con
192,Mr Gullett,"Yes ; but we knowescapes most of the indirect taxation, and the farmer therefore bears his own share of the load as well as the shares of others. If tbere is one class of taxpayer that does not escape, it is tlie primary producer. He has no means of passing on the increased cost of living. I have no hesitation in saying tliat although the average farmer, with a wife and family of four, who is in receipt of £500 per annum, has had his income tax reduced by £5 2s. lOd. since 3 920-21, he has had bis total taxation increased during those years by not less than £20. In this inatter I am not concerned witb either the rich or the poor taxpayer. I am considering only the economic life of Australia as a whole. I should like to indicate to the House how, under the system of income-tax reduction, very wealthy people, who are surely entitled to no relief at all, are escaping from the payment of large -amounts of taxation. I shall give an extreme illustration of that, and to me it is very interesting as well as most unsatisfactory. In 1920-21-the peak period in income taxation-ther e were 23 individuals in Australia who paid tax on individual incomes of £100,000 a year and upwards, and they paid in the aggregate £626,000. Nobody will say that it was a hardship for them to pay a stiff income tax; but, owing to the successive reductions up to 1926-27, they have since been relieved of taxation to the extent of £172,000 a year. That would be right enough, if that large sum had not been taken from the top and put in the form of indirect taxation into the cogs of the machinery at the bottom. As I said in emphasis of this point, in dealing with the budget, tbe persons receiving these nominal reductions of income taxation, are getting no relief at all in the long run, because, the increased cost of necessities, due to revenue duties, raises the cost of living, and, in turn, the basic wage. That puts up the manufacturing costs, and raises the price of commodities. That limits tbe turnover, and the profits to capital. Therefore, what looks like relief is not relief at all, even to the individual taxpayer, and does great economic hurt to the whole of industrial Australia. It is claimed that these revenue duties are not placed upon the necessaries of life, but more or less upon commodities that we. do not purchase unless we wish, and that may, therefore, be. regarded as luxuries. That is an exceedingly difficult proposition to establish. Let us consider the duties that are imposed on motor chassis.

I am endeavouring to show that indirect, taxation is the greater evil of the two. honourable member should not go too deeply into details. stated that motor cars are luxuries. My answer to that is that practically everything which is consumed in the average Australian household to-day is transported at some stage on chassis that are propelled by petrol. It is exceedingly difficult to prove that in other than a few lines .excessive revenue duties do not influence tbe cost of living and of production. I realize that I am speaking more or less to deaf ears on this question ; but I have the satisfaction of knowing that my opinions are supported by the greatest economists and practical financiers in tbe leading countries of the world. So far as I bave been able to ascertain, the foremost financial and economic brains in every country are applying themselves to this question of taxation, and its increasing magnitude has raised it to a position of infinitely -greater importance than it has ever previously held. If I am a pioneer in this matter in this House, I claim to be pioneering along the track of truth. There is no greater obstacle in the path of those industries, for the benefit of which we impose protective duties, there is not greater' handicap to the great policy of protection to which we all subscribe, than the evil effect which excessive revenue duties have upon the cost of manufacture and production generally. able member is now distinctly out of order. say.",46,Eakle Pace Afte R The Words Taxation While Indirect Taxation Con

Ix is a, moral certainty that no man wbo bas benefited from the reduction would care to see that taxation re-imposed. It.must be beneficial; otherwise the people would not clamour for it. If any honourable member wishes to be satisfied on that, point let him ask the graziers, particularly those who hold areas in the back country that I represent, whether tbey appreciate the reductions which have been made. At the present time direct taxation is only 8 per cent, greater than when it was first imposed. We have been told that there has been a. corresponding increase in indirect taxation. Honourable members opposite would do well not to stress that aspect, because those whom they claim to represent obtain from the Arbitration Court increases in wages that counterbalance anything additional they are called upon to pay by way of indirect taxation. reduced direct taxation, the Government is not now collecting as mucb revenue as it was formerly from that source, because it does not require it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) stated that tbe loss of revenue as a result of this amendment of the act would amount in the case of income tax to £1,300,000. revenue; it certainly cannot be termed a loss. revenue than we require, we shall commit a crime if we continue that practice. to reduce its indebtedness. been reduced to the extent of £36,000,000 -and particularly tbe latter-tak e We have increased our indebtedness in other directions, but the total at 30th June last was only £2,000,000 greater than it was four years ago, and is all accounted for by fixed assets such as teleWhen a man makes money, he does phone and other postal works. Honourable members opposite say we should not reduce tbe taxation but hold it for use, though money in the bands of the people is always put to better use than money in the hands of the Government. Let us consider what was the position when taxation was at its peak. The highest Commonwealth rate was then Ss. 6d. in the £1, and the highestEvery person State rate about 4s. 3d. in tbe £1, a total of 12s. 9d. in the £1. If the Commonwealth had set out to give effect to its financial arrangements with the States, and. to make provision for increased old age pensions payments out of direct taxation, the revenue from that source would have bad to be increased by 50 per cent., bringing the total to 16s. 9d. in the £1. If any person were to assert that industry could bear such a burden, he would not be believed. The Government reduced direct taxation because the people clamoured for it, and it was necessary that industry should be given that relief. During the regime of the Denham Government in Queensland, members of tbe Labour party argued that finance was the test of government, and that taxation should be reduced because' the man who paid it passed it on. If that is so, it follows that any reduction in direct taxation must confer great benefit. Country people are not able to Having consistently pass on taxation. Therefore, they are benefitted by any reduction, because tbey then have a greater amount to spend on developmental works. When taxation is high, less money is available for expenditure on those works, and consequently there are fewer opportunities for giving employment. If bonorable members were to That is a. giving up of travel through the back country of Queensland at the present time, they If we are collecting a greater would find that on account of high taxation tbe development is not as great as it sbould be, in regard to not only stock but also improvements.

211,Mr Yates [8.50],"When the subjectmembers that there were no wartime profits. It took Parliament six weeks in Melbourne to decide whether tbere were any wartime profits, and whether there was anything that should be taxed. We heard a great deal at that time about those who were raking in illicit gains during the war, and from other sources we heard pitiful tales about thosu who were not able to make any profits at all owing to tbe uncertainty of trade consequent upon the war. Everything that could possibly be said was brought forward to protect those who were bleeding the Empire during tbe most crucial period of its history. It took Parliament six weeks to find out that there were any war profits to tax. Eventually Parliament did act, and tbe Commonwealth Government, in a munificent mood, said to thc war-time profiteers, whom it was proposed to tax, "" Give up 75 per eent. of your war-time profits, and you can keep the other 25 per cent."" Looking back over the war period it can now be seen how well these traders did out of the war. It was on that occasion that the present Postmaster-General said that you could put a cannon at the top of Flinders Lane, and shoot all the profiteers in Australia. During the war there came the income tax proposals. to this the then honourable member for Oxley( Mr Sharpe) had advocated seriously, as a measure of equity, that bachelors should be taxed. He was laughed out of court for having suggested anything of the kind. Tbe peculiar thing was, however, tn that when the income tax proposals were put into force there actually was a bachelor tax embodied in them. Tbere was a minimum tax of £1 imposed, and in some cases that amounted to 100 per cent, of tbe taxable income of a single man. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has used a number of specious arguments on the subject of taxation. Every argument that can be advanced is brought forward for the purpose of showing that customs taxation does not fall more heavily on working class families than on those of other classes. But everybody knows that indirect taxation falls most heavily 1 ou family. That has always been true, [78] and it is true to-day. The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter) says that tbe working man does not pay the'tax; he goes to the Arbitration Court and gets an increased wage. As a matter of fact, he goes to the Arbitration Court to maintain that standard of living to which he is entitled, which is based on the lowest amount that will fit him to continue as a unit in industry. Personally, I am not satisfied with the Arbitration Court, because, while it fixes the reward that the person on one side in industry receivesthat is, the wages of the workerit does not fix the profits which the employer may receive. It never asks how much profit the employer is making out of the minimum wage which the court fixes. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) speaking in this House on 22nd July, 1915, s a i d There is an indiscernible process of filtration in taxation which eventually works down to bedrock, whicli is the working man; and the working man whether he be a primary producer, or in a secondary industry, earns the wherewithal for the taxpayer who pays the tax.

The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) did not let the cat out of the bag when be said that the war, in which so many of the flower of Australia's manhood died, was fought to protect the interests of the wealthy. Every one knew that already. To use a phrase which was applied during the war to those who opposed conscription, "" We are stabbing our soldiers in the back,"" for every penny taken off the wartime taxes. Mr Hughes is reported in Hansard of 18th August, 1915, as sayingThis bill, of course, is frankly a war measure designed to meet present circumstances . . . . our present circumstances are such as to justify, and more than justify, the tax. When he was speaking thus, on the subject of income tax he was not w i th the party to which he now belongs, and he voiced his opinion of the then Opposition without restriction. He said:There are some who suggest that all war expenditure should be met out of loans. have no doubt whatever that this is the ideal of those gentlemen who speak so loudly to-day of economy. What they mean is that tliere should be imposed on the poorer classes of the country an economy which would reduce them below a fair ancl reasonable subsistence level, and that all expenditure should be provided out of loans. To-night we have heard exactly the same sentiments as Mr Hughes then coninterest borrowed for war purposes and a demned. It is proposed that the war as sbould be paid for out of loans.

On the same day, the righ t honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) voiced a reduction of this taxathis opinionwill ever receive my supWe know that it is hard to draw the teeth, by direct taxation, of tbe ordinary rich or middle-class man, and at the same time to avoid his squealing. I hope honourable members opposite do not think that this tax wilt achieve tlie end in view without that squealing. I represent, perhaps more by accident than design, one of the wealthiest communities in Australia, but I say, as the representativeof the people in that constituency, that it isup to them to pay whatever this Parliament deliberately decides they should pay as fresh taxation. I should like to hear the right honourable member for Balaclava speak on this subject to-day. It is just as well that we have some record, of these opinions of taxation imposed to meet war commitments, portion of which the Treasurer now proposes to abandon in order to give relief to the wealthy class. Honourable members supporting the Government know that this remission of taxation w ill be made without the squealing referred to by the honourable member for Balaclava. He did not hesitate to throw upon his constituents their portion of tbe burden of war commitments. Until the war debt bas been met, we have no r i g h t to reduce direct taxation. On the 31st I statedAs the Leader of the Opposition has properly said, it is perhaps, under existing conditions, apart from otlier forms of taxation, the best war tax we can adopt.

""We have expended £8,000,000 on the Federal Capital City, and no adequate return from it will be received for perhaps the next 50 years. Who is to be burdened with the extra taxation required to meet not only that expenditure, but our loan and other commitments? Certainly not the wealthy class, since, to some extent, under this legislation, it is to be . relieved of direct taxation. Many honourable members now supporting the Government were among the Opposition iii 1915. You, Mr Speaker, at that time said, in regard to income taxThe House readily recognizes the necessity for raising money to prosecute the war to a successful end. This is one form of taxation best suited for raising money at the present juncture for that purpose. You, Mr Speaker, were in favour of the tax, although sitting among the Opposition. The late Lord Forrest was not so candid, and I presume that he was one of those to whom the honourable member for Balaclava referred when he said that there would be some squealing, because the late Lord Forrest was loud in bis protests when any legislation was distasteful to him. At that time be saidTn conclusion, all that I have to say is that an income tax is not necessary this year, that it is unduly high, and that any Federal land tax or income tax imposed without consultation with the States must be the prelude to the destruction of federation. He was the only member of that Parliament who did not approve of the imposition of income tax to meet war commitments. The honourable member for Lang( Sir Elliot Johnson) is a single-taxer, but cannot get any one in his party to support his creed. A land-tax is anathema to some, and yet as a means of meeting the cost of government and interest on loans for developmental purposes I consider it perhaps the most -equitable form of taxation that can be evolved. That honourable member saidA temporary tax on iucomes to meet a -special emergency may be excusable for war purposes; but generally I do not favour the imposition of a tax on incomes derived from productive enterprises. Even that honourable gentleman approved of the imposition of income taxation to meet war commitments. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) referred to our war indebtedness. At present we receive in direct taxation the following amounts:-£11,126,278 ; income taxation, £1,362,315 estate duties; and a further sum of £366,159 from the entertainments tax, totalling £12,854,752. According to the budget statement of receipts and expenditure, the expenditure for 1926-1927 wasWar pensions, £7,477,096; expenses in connection with payment of war gratuities, £592; loan redemptions and conversions, £43,706; interest on loans for war purposes, £13,503,956$ interest on Australia's war indebtedness to the Government of the United Kingdom, £4,255,775; and War Gratuity Act, £2,578; the total interest payments being £17,762,309. That figure does not include expenditure on repatriation department and in other directions. To meet an interest payment of £17,762,309 we collect only £12,854,752 in direct taxation, and yet the Government is now proposing to reduce the income tax by 10 per cent. This will constitute one of the most diabolical acts ever committed against the interests of the general community. It is especially opposed to the interests of our returned soldiers who are now assimulated in the community, because tlieir burden of tbe war debt will become heavier in consequence of increased revenue duties to counterbalance the reduction in direct taxation. If this House passes the bill I say shame to it. am fully conscious of my limitations as an authority upon taxation measures; but I take this opportunity to give to the House the layman's opinion of this bill. I certainly protest against any remission of direct taxation while our war obligations remain unfulfilled. My main reason for speaking this evening is to reply to a statement of the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter). He endeavoured to make it appear that as our war indebtedness had been reduced, direct taxation should also be reduced. I wish to place on record the position as I see it, and to again quote some figures submitted this afternoon by the honourable memThe ber for Yarra( Mr Scullin). During the years 1921-27 our war expenditure was",51,Eakle Pace Afte R The Words Taxation While Indirect Taxation Con
218,Mr Makin (Hindmarsh) [9.13],"Ireduced, but tbe reduction is insignificaut when compared witb tbe increase in our total indebtedness. In 1921 the interest on war expenditure £18,075,000, whereas in 1927 it was £17,820^00, showing a slight decrease. Our total interest bill, however, has increased during the same period v by £2,500,000, so that whilst we may bave reduced one account, we have increased another to an even greater extent. ""While that is so we bave no right to reduce this tax. ""We should regard it as unbusinesslike for a commercial man to place money to his credit in tbe bank or offer gratuities while long-standing accounts were still owing, and we sliould also regard tbe same principle as unsound for a nation. Maranoa( Mr Hunter) wishes us to believe that as there has been a reduction in the war debt the Government is justified in reducing taxation; but whilst our commitments in Australia have been reduced to the extent of £27,000,000 our indebtedness overseas bas increased by £37,000*000. . As the result of remissions since 19.S1 to the present year, for wbicb we have only an estimate, income or direct £7,000,000, but our indirect taxation has increased am anxious to relieve my children, and those wbo will be concerned with the financial position of Australia in their day, of auy obligations incurred whilst I have bad an opportunity of assisting in tbe control of public affairs. Is it not most unfair to burden future with a financial obligation that sbould be met by the present generation? If the expenditure on which we are paying such heavy interest had been incurred on reproductive works to assist in tbe progress and development of Australia, posterity should perhaps bear its share; but when the interest is on war expenditure for which we have no tangible asset, the present generation should endeavour to meet the bill. Tbe Treasurer should not remit direct taxation, as is now proposed, to the extent of £1,300,000 in the interest of the wealthy section of the community, and place upon .men with small incomes., and heavy family obligations the>i^resporisib'ility of meeting liabilities which should be borne by Mr Makin. those in receipt of large incomes. I was startled to find, as mentioned by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) amounted to that absentees who derive income from interests in Australia are to ^ be further relieved of certain taxa' tion, whilst others who are assisting in this country's development have still to pay. The House sbould seriously consider the very unfair nature of the Government's taxation concessions, under which tbe wealthy section of the community will be relieved of their-proper share of taxation, which should be collected to assist in liquidating our war debt instead of leaving that debt to be paid by future generations. surer) [9.25] -It is not my intention to deal with the points raised during . the debate on the second reading, as many matters of detail connected with the Government's taxation proposals can be more effectively considered in committee. I desire, however, to take this opportunity to reply to certain general observations made by bonorable members. In the first place, I should like to say a few words concerning the reductaxation has decreased by tion of taxation, and the position of our war indebtedness, which was mentioned by £9,000,000. I by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin). Having regard to statements made during debates in this House during the last two or three weeks, it is refreshing to hear the unanimous expression of opinion on tbe part of tbe Opposition that the Government is saddled with generations a tremendous war expenditure, which, the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) declares, has increased and not decreased, and that consequently there is need for the high taxation which has been levied. The point I wish to make, in reply to tbe honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) and others is that, as compared with last year, there has been this year a reduction in taxation. If one compares the direct and indirect taxation figures, it will be seen that last year we raised £63,368,000, and this year we estimate to raise £62,725,000, or £643,000 less, despite the fact that £500,000 is beiug raised as a special roads tax. Allowing for that . amount raised for a special purpose^ there has really been a reduction of £1,143,000.",52,Eakle Pace Afte R The Words Taxation While Indirect Taxation Con
219,The Honourable Member For Dr. Eable Page (Cowper,"TreaIt pressed by some bonorable members wbo bave spoken, that tbey bave suddenly become protagonists of * direct taxation as opposed to indirect taxation. why they bave taken upon themselves this role, particularly as during the last few years they have repeatedly put themselves forward as defenders of State rights? Throughout the length and breadth of Australia there is practically a unanimous demand by the States for the Commonwealth Government to vacate the field of direct taxation in every form , at the earliest, possible moment. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) w ill remember that in 1923 be submitted a. proposal at a. conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, in favour of the Commonwealth retiring from the field of income taxation. When tbe honourable member spoke on that occasion, he was very alarmed, and saidWc could discuss the matter all day, but if ment had determined to raise from in the Prime Minister stands by his ' principle that he cannot accept that proposition that the Commonwealth should retire entirely from the field of income taxation, we are only wasting time. . . . I think the Commonwealth Government ought to consider the queseffect that that would have had on in tion of adopting the suggestions of the States dustry. No one knows better than the that they should retire from the field of income taxation and enter into an agreement with the States for them to recoup, or partially recoup, the Commonwealth for the loss of revenue from that source. That would be the only possible and satisfactory way of removing the irritation and annoyance which now exists as a result of double taxation. When tbe Government introduces proposals in the direction of giving effect to a scheme of vacating the field of direct taxation, which the honourable member once so strongly advocated, we are told by h i m and others of bis party that we should continue to re-impose di""«ct taxation in order to meet our war commitments. What would have happened supposing this Government bad adopted the suggestion made by honourable members opposite, that it should continue in the field of direct taxation, and without any increase in indirect taxation, it had attempted to carry on the Government of this Commonwealth and meet those expenditures which honourable members opposite have> as loudly as any one else, asked for . They have demanded an in appears from the opinion excrease of the old-age pensions, which now cost some £4,000,000 more than in 1921-22, and tbey have also asked for better consideration to the States, in respect of which we are now paying over In these circumstances, I ask £4,000,000 more than in 1921-22. In respect of those two items alone we have an increase of over £8,000,000. Had this Government kept on as in 1921-22 with its customs revenue, it would have been necessary for it to increase the income tax, which was then £17,000,000 per annum, by 50 per cent., to enable it to meet the additional commitments to which it is now involved. In that year the rate of income tax ran up to 8s. 6d. in the £1. A 50 per cent, increase would have meant another 4s. 3d. in the £ 1 . Western Australia had a rate of 4s. 7d. ou incomes of £4,000, and there was also a very high rate in Queensland, so that the heavily taxed individual would have had to find about 17s. in the £ 1 as State and federal income tax if the Governcome tax sources the additional revenue that it required. No one knows better than the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), the honourable member that this Government would have had to keep the exemption just where it was in 1921-22, which was £100 for a single man. Since then that exemption has been twice raised, once in 1922, and again in 1924on the last occasion to £300. To enable industry to stagger along under those impositions it would have been necessary to distribute the income tax, as is done"" in many of the States, very much more over the ""lower-paid wage earners^ It is absurd for anybody to think that the enormous amount required in connection with our war expenditure can be raised in Australia without its being spread over the community at large, whether by direct or indirect taxation. Eveni f the Government raised the direct taxation to a higher level, we have the proof afforded by the action of the honourable member for Dalley, in Queensland, that that would re-act on the working man. The1 various attempts' 6f this Government to alter the incidence of direct taxation were carried out always with the knowledge that indirect taxation presses heavily on the men earning small wages. When this Government raised the exemption to £300 in 1924, it gave as a deliberate reason for so doing the fact that there was a very difficult position ahead of all those on low wages, because they had connection with his system of averaging. to stand a greater portion of indirect taxation than had those earning more money. Yarra( Mr Scullin) said that the frequent introduction of amending income tax assessment bills was entirely due to the manner in which these measures were rushed through this House. Actually, not only do these measures continue in force for many years, quite scathless and Avithout any one finding fault with tbe manner in which they were drafted, but even High Court judges and lawyers differ as to their meaning. In the circumstances it is no wonder that honourable, members are not always a.ble to anticipate that the wording of the various taxation acts will not convey what it is intended to convey. An instance of that is in connection wtih the very system of averaging, with which this House intends to deal. clause, was put into the act it was found, as the result of departmental investigation, and legal examination, that it did not mean what was intended when it was inserted. There was not haste in dealing with that provision. The difficulty was due to the way in which it was drafted. It must also be remembered that the Parliament itself frequently changes the wording of provisions in an amending bill which has been framed as the result of careful collaboration between the Commissioner of Taxation and the Crown Law omcers. Is it any wonder, then, that subsequently that wording is found to need amendment. Regarding tbe statements of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), which apparently evoked a certain amount of applause from honourable members opposite, that profits derived outside of Australia should be taxed within Australia, I would point out that our taxation legislation was originally introduced by a Labour Government, some ten years ago, and it was based on the definite tended to eliminate double taxation as idea that only profit's inside Australia Dr. Earle Page. should be taxed. If it is the general desire that that should be changed, the proposal must be very carefully examinea, us it strikes at the very root of the whole structure of our income taxation. The honourable member for Eorrest( Mr Prowse) raised a few matters in We must all appreciate the immense amount of work performed by the honorThe honourable member for able member in drafting and perfecting his scheme, and in placing examples before us. Later on, in committee, we shall be able to deal at some length with the scheme. The honourable member was kind enough to give me his amendment, which my department has been able to examine. My officers have prepared a memorandum placing on record the views of tbe Taxation Commissioner and the department on the proposal, which they have had printed, and are now ready for distribution. Copies will be made available to honourable members immediately, so that they may have the opportunity to read it at their leisure. I admit that tbe memorandum is a very complicated one, which needs to be discussed very thorFive years after the oughly to be understood. The difficulties connected with the suggested scheme are practically insuperable. Instances are shown in whicli. the scheme does not work out as desired by the honourable member for Forrest. The honourable member seeks to establish a scheme in which the taxpayer who has an irregular inconie will always pay the same amount of tax as the man witb a steady income. Examples are given which show that the man with an irregular income may pay many times the tax paid by the man on the regular income. An examination of tbe memorandum will disclose that insuperable difficulties are encountered with every change in the rate of taxation, and with every alteration of the exemptiondifficulties which will add enormously to the work and expense of the department. The officers of the department state that if they .had to administer such a scheme at least double the present staff would be needed. Again, it would be impossible to work it in conjunction with the existing sections of the act, which, are inbetween the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. It would involve fundaassistant commissioner. The amendment mental alterations of the Income Tas will place this matter on a sound basis. Assessment Act which would need to be Sub-section 2 of the clause deals with remodelled. For these reasons I ask honthose operations of the law which depend orable members to preserve'an open mind upon certain precedent conditions existing, on. the subject until we go into comnamely, that the commissioner is of the mittee, and to examine the proposition certain opinion, or belief, or has reason very searchingly.

Section 13 of tbe act provides that income tax shall be levied upon incomes derived from any source in Australia. Australia is defined in the act as including Papua, but not as including New Guinea, and the act does noftax income derived in New Guinea from any source at all. Under the Oommonwealth legislation, whatever \the local legislation may be, no tax .is payable or will be payable if this amendment is accepted, upon income derived in New Guinea, whether from the working of the mine or from any otber source. But a difficult question arises where income is derived as the result of a number of operations. The leading case on the subject deals with the BrokenH ill mines, where ore is mined in New South Wales, treated at Port Pirie, and sold and turned into money in Great Britain. That was so, at least, in 1900, I think, when the case arose, and the question had to be determined as to what proportion of income was derived in New South Wales, what was derived in South Australia, and what was derived in Great Britain. Honourable members will see that it is a rather complicated problem. In the case of the working of a mine, is the income derived when the gold is in a partially or fully refined state, or when the gold is turned into money?

249,Mr Latham (Attorney,"Generalquestion, or only a legal one? tion, and it is one on which the present difficulty has arisen. Up to the present time, the proportion of the income attributable to operations in New Guinea has never been taxed in Australia, nor has an attempt been made to tax it ; but in so far dealt with by paragraph (la). The only as a proportion of the income is properly attributable to the merchandising of the product in Australia-and it is a very small proportion-that proportion is income derived in Australia, and it is very difficult to ascertain the exact proportion. The object of the amendment to paragraph la is to exclude from Australian income taxation any income derived from the working of a mining property, even though it be in the Territory of New Guinea, the process of obtaining income being regarded as a process beginning from tbe mining of the ore and extending to the realization of the proceeds. thc output of gold shall not be less than 40 per cent, of tbe total value of tbe output of the mine ? used to restrict the exemption to genuine gold miners; but I have not gone into that aspect of the matter. The particular point that I am endeavouring to make clear is that this section is intended to remove the only Australian taxation which now exists upon the realization of New Guinea gold in Australia. signed to Australia, and if the person to Avhom it is consigned sells it in Australia, will he pay tax on whatever profit he makes on the transaction ? the position of an ordinary Australian merchant. If he buys tbe gold for £100, nnd sells it for £101, he makes a profit of £1, which is part of the income derived from his business subject to tbe deduction of the cost of carrying on the business. Papuan company registered in Rabaul may send its gold to its agents in Sydney. pay income tax on the income of the agency business, whether it is derived from dealing in gold or any other commodity. As to paragraph n some misunderstanding has perhaps arisen through its being printed out to the margin in the memorandum. It ought to have been printed immediately under paragraphs la and m. The proviso to paragraph n covers only the provisions of that paragraph; it does not apply to the others. Tbe gold position is specially object of the Government is to make the intention clear. If it is not .clear, I am confident that the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) will consider any proposal to make it so. honourable gentleman to say he did uot know why the limit of 40 per cent, was imposed ? it is tbe intention to limit the 40 per cent, exemption to what may properly be regarded as gold-mining. The gold position being covered by paragraph (la) it is not necessary to deal with it in paragraph n. That paragraph will not apply to New Guinea gold, but it will apply to tbe entrepot trade of Australia from the islands. In the case of sucb commodities as copra, that are produced in the islands and sent to Australia to be sold, a proportion of the income is derived in Australia. The earning of the income is a continuous operation from the beginning of the growth up to the point of sale. A proportion of the income is earned in the island and a proportion in Australia from the operation of sale.

To give effect to the first object, it has been necessary to re-arrange the paragraphs and sub-paragraphs of the existing provisions in the law. The re-arrangement has involved some verbal alterations, but the former provisions of the law are retained without alteration of prinyear in which the income was ciple. The principal verbal re-arrangement is in the new sub-paragraph 3 on page 7 of the bill. The wording of that paragraph has been revised in consequence of consideration of the judgment of Mr Justice Higgins in the case of George Hudson and Company Limited v. The Commissioner of Taxation on the operation of condition 2 in paragraph i i of sub-section e of section 23 (1) of tbe principal act. That condition aimed at the same result as new subparagraph 3.

The (i) such sum as the Commissioner second sentence states the intention of the last part of condition 2 in tbe printhe diminution in cipal act, and adequately provides for that intention in more precise terms than those"" contained in tbe principal act. The implements, utensils, and articles (inre-arrangement mentioned will now cause conditions 4 and 5 in the clause to be applicable in all cases irrespective of whether the annual deduction on account of depreciation is calculated on the diminishing value basis, or oiLthe prime cost basis.

Thc reason why in some cases a part only of the sale price is required to improvements on tbe land be brought to account is the necessity to by the taxpayer for the exclude from income any profit which might be made in such a sale.

Timber cannot be said to be subject to wear and tear. hoves us to be extremely careful in matters of this kind, otherwise a court of law may place an interpretation upon a section which we never contemplated. Take for example the case in whicli the timber was cleared from laud twenty years ago. The clearing of that timber constituted an improvement at that time, but it may not be regarded as an improvement now. because the value of the timber cleared might be greater now than the cost of clearing. It might be successfully argued that land was not improved because the timber was cleared from it ; in might, in fact, be 'held.that the land had depreciated i u value because the timber had been taken away. It does not follow that at all periods in 7 the life of a block of land the clearing of timber would be regarded as an improvement.

I suggest that the words "" other improvements not'elsewhere provided for "" be inserted in the clause. agree with the contention of the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter). It would be unwise to unduly restrict this provision, which liberalizes the deductions allowed to agriculturists and primary producers. If , under a later clause, there is a likelihood of a taxpayer claiming more than one deduction for an improvement, we can deal with it when it comes up for discussion. is reasonably safe,, because the commissioner has a discretion and would certainly not allow two deductions for one improvement.",62,Eakle Pace Afte R The Words Taxation While Indirect Taxation Con

304,Mr Bruce,"I think that the clausethis stage I think it would be safer to allow the provision to remain as it is. Would thc commissioner have discretion to do more than merely give what in his opinion is a reasonable allowance for improvements regardless of what had been done before? If a man ploughs his land and sows lucerne, that would be a capital improvement, and would be exempt under a later clause, which provides for the ploughing and grassing of lands for grazing purposes. duction for ploughing. ing lucerne for grazing purposes, would the commissioner be bound to give a reasonable allowance for tbe disappearance of lucerne, wbich takes place after ten or twelve years? in putting in a lucerne crop, a deduction for that should never be questioned ber misunderstands me. -clause a man would get an exemption for putting in a lucerne crop which is a capital improvement.

A person may purchase swump land. There is an exemption allowed for the draining of swamp l a n d ; surely if a man drained his land in the first year of possession, that work would be a capital improvement. If be sold it in tbe next year he would be in a position similar to that of a man who bought a piece of land, built a honse on itand then sold it . The intention of the -clause is good, but there would be an anomaly in the case bf a man who used his capital in that way and claimed an -exemption. There is no difference between the position of a man who clears :Scrub or grubs trees in order .to cultivate l is land and that of a man who drains a :swamp for cultivation. If an exemption is to be given to one surely it should he given to the other. given in both instances. have no objection to tbe clause. deduction for improvement on land would certainly be of assistance, and would encourage settlers to develop their land and thus provide additional revenue.
