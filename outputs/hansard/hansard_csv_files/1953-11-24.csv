MB. SrKAKEK (Hon. Archie Cameron) took the. chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. House that I have, this day, issued the writ in connection with the by-election for Gwydir electoral division, and that the dates fixed were those announced to the House on the 18th November. Prime MinisterI direct a question to the Treasurer which relates to a matter of general concern. I refer to the extent of the export from Australia to Japan of scrap iron and copper. Will the Treasurer endeavour to obtain for the House a statement of the extent of the export of these materials, which has now heen brought under control by quotas, and the estimated change, in the quantity exported as the result of the imposition of quotas? The adverse effects of these exports on Australian industries have recently been referred tq by the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Anstralia. Will the right honorahle gentleman also state, as far as he is able to do so, whether these materials are being used in Japan for ship-building purposes, and if so whether for the construction of merchant ships or naval vessels? take into account the observations made by the right honourable gentleman with a view to presenting him with the information that he desires. for Labour and National Service been informed that the Sydney Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board has fallen behind its work schedule hecause it cannot find enough labour? Is the Minister aware that the board is advertising for workers and that, due to, the lahour shortage, it has been unahle to spend approximately £500,000 of its annual works estimates? Does not this fact reflect a healthy trend in the unemployment situation ? Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board has been experiencing some difficulty in securing all the labour it requires. Officers from that body have, been working in conjunction with those of the Commonwealth Employment Service and the board has been advertising extensively in order to obtain the required labour, I know that their requirements have not yet been fully met; and that fact indicates thc tightenof tlie lahour situation that' is developing throughout Australia. I am unable to say whether the board is behind schedule for this year. I have no information on that point. But it is interesting to note that, according to the latest figures, only 12,600 persons are at present drawing unemployment benofits. That is the lowest figure for this year, whilst, at the same time, 37,600 work vacancies exist, that is, an average of three vacancies to each person drawing unemployment benefit. That is a considerable improvement upon the position that existed earlier this year. Labour and National Service aware that within the next month it is expected that four meat works in Queensland will close down, involving the dismissal of a large number of workers, and that every sugar mill in Queensland will be closed before the end of this year? Has he taken this into consideration? are aware, a seasonal movement of labour from north Queensland occurs every year. At the height of the sugar and* meat seasons in that State, employment reaches its peak, and, as the honourable meniber for Leichhardt has pointed out, it tapers off towards the end of the season. It has been traditional for casual workers to go to North Queensland during the meat and sugar seasons, and return to the sonth as the seasonal demand for labour in the southern States, approaches its peak. If the honourable member has in mind specific instances of men who have been employed on casual work in the north being now unable to obtain employment, I should be glad if he will inform",7,Commonwealthelectoralact 1953 Actno 79 Of 1953

Minister for Social Services recognize every child in an institution. As the the importance of making a statement to Menzies Government £1 has depreciated the Parliament witb respect to the agreein value until it is worth only half as ment with the United Kingdom for remuch as the 1949 £1, will the Treasurer ciprocity in the provision of social serconsider doubling the amount so paid, vices ? If so, will he find a way of making in order that the children concerned such a statement and refuse to be easily will not suffer as a result of the niggardly discouraged from doing so? Will he policy of this Government? arrange for copies of the agreement to be made available to honourable members? tion asked by tbe honourable member Also, will an opportunity be provided to touches upon a matter of policy. the House to discuss this important agreement? honourable member that some months ago I attempted to make a statement on the Supply whether certain valuable equipsubject that he has raised, but I was ment which was on the secret list Has been refused leave to do so. It was one of stolen at tbe Long-Range Weapons Estabthose occasions when there was a little unlishment at Woomera? If so, has he any neighbourliness on both sides, and I information to give to the House on this happened to be No. 3 in the argument ancl matter? was refused leave by the Opposition as a result. Incidentally, I believe that tbe was directed to an incident which honourable member for East Sydney occurred, not a Woomera but at Emu figured in that incident. It will be Eield, where the recent atomic tests took' somewhat difficult to arrange for an place. What happened was that when opportunity to be given to tbe House to tbe British scientists and other officials debate that statement at this late stage left that area, they left a certain amount in the session. I shall be pleased, of equipment for which they had no to discuss that matter with the Vicefurther use. This was not known by the President of the Executive Council. I Australian officials when they took over sball also see what can be done to make that equipment. It is alleged that tincopies of the agreement available to English officials had told the troops that honourable members. directed to the Minister for Social Sertbe troops, acting on that intimation, sent vices.

15,Mr Beale,"Last week, my attentionwould not have located them; he would bave liad some fellow in his office looking after them. But we bave located them, and appropriate action is being taken. addressed to the Minister for Social Services, who administers the War Service Homes Division. In view of the fact that tbe Campbelltown Council in South Australia may declare as unfit for habitation certain war service homes built at Hectorville, which have proved to be of faulty construction, will tbe Minister visit South Australia in an attempt, not only to solve the serious problem concerning those homes, but also to restore confidence to the many other ex-service men and women who are awaiting tbe allocation of homes by the division and are now afraid that they may be allocated homes of similar construction to those at Hectorville? cult for me to give a comprehensive reply, at question time, to the matter raised by the honourable member for Kingston. The homes at East Payneham, to wbich he has referred, are built on a peculiar kind of soil, which is also found in quite a number of other places in South Australia. I understand that some 10,000 homes in parts of Adelaide are similarly .iffected. I point out to the House that de War Service Homes Division has discharged every obligation that it has to ex-servicemen. However, the division, feeling that it has, in addition, some degree of moral obligation in this matter, has gone tbe "" second mile "", as it were, and made certain offers to the purchasers of the cottages. For example, the division has announced that it will make a further advance to the ex-servicemen in order to enable them to have the defects made good. I explain, in passing, that the defects are cracks which have occurred in the houses as the result of the subsidence of the soil, due to heat and moisture and there is no known remedy for this condition. The division has said that it will willingly repurchase the dwellings from dissatisfied ex-servicemen, grant them further financial assistance, and allow them to apply any credits to the purchase of a new home. The division will also allow the occupants of the houses to carry on as tenants, and will later if they so desire, provide them with homes in another area. The division has also informed the 'persons concerned that, subject to their approval, it question is will take two of tbe bouses for experimental purposes, and put either a bitumenemulsion or a concrete path round each of the dwellings, because it is suggested such treatment may overcome the trouble. If that treatment proves satisfactory, the division will then grant an extra loan to the other owners for similar work. In the meantime, certain ex-servicemen have taken the opportunity to sell tbeir homes at a substantial profit. In twelve cases that I examined, tbe profits ranged from £993 to £1,680. One bouse was sold, with the furniture, at a profit to the ex-serviceman vendor of £2,760. So, obviously, ex-servicemen still have a reasonable equity in the cottages. The South Australian branch of the Eeturned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia has invited me to visit that State with a view to making an inspection of the houses, and I have replied that I shall go there as soon as convenient. I am not an expert architect or builder, but our own divisional architects have inspected those properties, and architects and builders outside the Public Service have been invited to express an opinion about tbem, and each has said that he has found no evidence whatsoever of constructional defects. They all agree with the statements and recommendations of the officers of the division. Postmaster-General arises from the negotiations that has been in progress for a number of years for tbe installation of an automatic exchange at Mackay. Following numerous representations by me, the Postmaster-General informed me on the l l t h May last that a requisition was about to be placed with the Department of Works for the purchase and erection of a -prefabricated building to house the automatic equipment. So far, there is no evidence that the work is about to begin. Will tbe Postmaster-General advise",12,Establishment

20,Mr Davidson,"My question to therue when the commencement of the actual work of installation can be expected? installation of automatic equipment at Mackay should have a high priority. As the honourable member for Dawson has mentioned, arrangements were put in hand some time ago for the erection of a prefabricated building. Components of the prefabricated building are now being manufactured aud it is hoped that very early next year tbe manufacturing will be sufficiently advanced for the Department of Works to let the contract, and that the building will be ready for tbe transfer of the mail-room activities at Mackay towards the latter part of 1954. Work will then proceed on the necessary alterations to the Mackay post office for the installation of the automatic equipment. migration aware that amongst immigrants from the East who landed in Australia last week-end were a number of people who had been refused permission even to leave the ship while it was in port in tbe Philippines because of their Communist activities in the East? What is the reason for importing these Communists into Australia? Does the Government not consider that tbere are already enough Communists here without importing others? t.he latter part of the honourable member's question, and I sbould welcome a little more activity on the part of the honourable member himself and of his colleagues in checking the activities of Communists inside Australia iustead of worrying about the activities of Communists outside Australia. Nominated immigrants arriving in Australia from the East would only be close relatives of people wbo are already settled in Australia and would have been subject to suitable security inquiries by the authorities both in Australia and in thc East where there is British representation or where we have our own representation as in Hong Kong. They would be European immigrants who had been checked beforehand. I have not heard any other complaints on the lines of that mentioned by the honourable member, but I sball examine his statements. migration given consideration to the report recently issued wbich shows that there has been a sharp and steady decline in the rate of immigration over the last twelve months, and particularly during the quarter ended the 30th September, wben the excess of arrivals over departures was only 6,400? Can the decline bc attributed to tbe reluctance of people from other countries to settle here because of the housing shortage, or is it because Government agents overseas are no longer seeking large numbers of potential settlers? occasions in this House, there has been a decline in tbe flow of immigrants during the last twelve months. That has been partly a consequence of Government policy, and partly a result of factors operating both in European countries and in Australia which have had some effect on inducement to move from Europe and from the United Kingdom to Australia. An improvement of the economic situation in Europe, a lessening of fear of a third world war, and brighter prospects in the United Kingdom and on tbe Continent bave affected the situation. The reduction of the number of work opportunities in Australia at that time also had some effect. However, circumstances in Australia now are stimulating the flow of immigrants again and we are confident that we shall be able to attract a considerably larger number of new settlers to Australia in the immediate future. I have no fears on the score of housing, because about 220,000 houses have been constructed during the last three years under this. Government compared with about 120,000 houses during the last three years of Labour's term of office. directed to the Minister for Immigration, is in relation to the naturalization ceremonies that were conducted recently by the Department of Immigration in several municipalities in Melbourne.

A departmental submission in relation to this matter was placed before me recently. The problem is not as simple as it may seem, because senators also are entitled to be considered. The department does not desire that these naturalization ceremonies shall be made an occasion for a lot of speech-making. If federal members were invited. State members might think that they should be invited too. I remind the bonorable gentleman that the matter is not free from difficulty, but I can assure him that I am sympathetically disposed towards having local members and senators present on such occasions. In fact, I welcome the interest of local members and of senators. If satisfactory arrangements can be made with the local authorities which assist in the conduct of these ceremonies, I shall see that they are made. Labour and National Service inform the House whether there is any substantial accumulation of sugar stocks at mills or on wharfs in Queensland? Will the Minister also inform the House, in the light of the Labour position on the wharfs, what plans are in hand for the handling of more sugar in Queensland ports? examination in recent days of tbe position at northern ports and whilst I do not claim that the handling rates are as satissteadily increasing confidence in the Ausfactory as I should desire, I . assure the honourable member that the movement of sugar cargoes has been proceeding according to the original estimate and at the rate worked out by the Government with the representatives of sugar interests. Provided there is no interruption through industrial causes between now and the end of the season, not only should we be able to move cargoes at the planned rate, but also we should have a smaller carry over than was originally thought. We are watching the matter closely, and at present there is no cause for special action beyond that already taken. question which I address to the Treasurer by referring to the method of advertising Commonwealth loans and the practice of advising the public that the first of the outstanding advantages of such loans to the lender is that the loan offers absolute security, the bonds being backed by the whole assets of the Commonwealtb, and repayment of the full face value of tbe bond on maturity being guaranteed. Whilst that statement is factual, as far as it goes, it has led many unsuspecting citizens to believe that, if need be, tbey would have no difficulty in readily turning tbeir bonds into cash at their full face value whereas this is not the case. Will the Treasurer, therefore, stress in. all future advertising of Commonwealth loans that the Government will not undertake in any circumstances to redeem its own bonds at their face value before the date of maturity and that, due to a deterioration in national affairs since it took office, many borrowers who have been forced to dispose of tbeir bonds on the open market, have lost a considerable amount of money, in many instances. £13 in every £100? Sir ABTH UB FADDEN --The question of the honourable member is based on wrong premises and political desire and. for that reason, will not be answered. Treasurer give the House any information about the recent loan to Australia by a group of Swiss banking interests? Is the negotiation of this loan evidence of tralian financial structure and economy? Sir AETH UE FADDEN -Obviously , the people who bave underwritten this loan have extreme confidence in the stability of Australia's economy. The loan would not have been underwritten otherwise. I think that this Government can take credit for the fact that the loan has been underwritten by tbe Swiss Corporation of Bankers, which controls tbe hardest currency in the hard-currency world. inform the House whether the proceed? of the £6,000,000 loan recently floated in Switzerland will be expended on tbe",14,Immigration

If the money is not to be so spent, can the right honourable gentleman state the reason for which tbe loan was negotiated? Sir answer to the first part of the honourable member's'question is "" No "" . Tbe reply to the second part is that the proceeds of the loan will become part of the resources of the Australian Government. inform the House what resources of government he expects to buy for £6,000,000 in Switzerland? intended that the resources of government should be bought wholly in Switzerland. The loan is not a tied loan. The £6,000,000 will contribute towards the general financial resources of the Commonwealth. for Labour and National Service been informed of the proceedings of tbe third annual congress of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, a world-wide international organization of non-Communist trade unions, wbich was held at Stockholm a few months ago? Was Australia represented at it, and was tbe Australian delegation truly representative of the Australian industrial movement ? Is it correct that the congress affirmed the principles of free trade unionism and adopted the following resolution:A. fundamental human right is the right of General Secretary of tbe Queensland workers to organize freely in trade unions, national unions and confederations of their choice without interference from governments, sory unionism had been a plank of the employers or other non-trade union forces. Did the Australian delegation support this resolution, and does it reoresent the views of the industrial movement throughout Australia? If so, is it correct to conclude that the present activity of the. New South Wales Government in trying to enforce compulsory unionism has nothing to do with the industrial movement but has its origin solely in politics? resolution along tbe lines indicated by the honourable member was adopted at tbe conference that he has mentioned, but I shall check the exact text of the statement to see whether I can give him more information on the subject. I understand that Australia was fully represented at sentatives of the trade union movement of this country, and the spirit of the resolution would appear to be directly in line with the terms of resolutions that were carried by a previous conference of the International Labour Organization, at which the Australian trade union movement was also represented. It certainly would appear from the text of the resolution, and its spirit, that it is utterly inconsistent with the line of policy now being followed by some Labour governments in this country. Labour and National Service forward a copy of the question that was asked by the honourable member for Evans, and the Minister's answer thereto, to the Queensland Liberal party, the platform of which contains the principle of compulsory unionism? witb leading members of the Queensland Liberal party at the annual conference of the federal council of the Liberal party of Australia, that was held recently in Canberra. At that conference the Queensland representatives were party to a unanimous resolution which condemned compulsory unionism as inimical to the interests of the trade union movement. Labour and National Service seen a statement which has been attributed to the Liberal party to the effect that compulplatform of the State Liberal party since it was formed ten years ago ? statement based on a newspaper report? statement was made over the air. The Secretary of the Queensland Liberal party added that the party did not intend to make any move for the deletion of this plank from its platform.

41,Mr Daly,"As far as I know, thisSecretary of tlie Queensland Liberal party was a member of a delegation wbich interviewed him recently and whether members of the Liberal party in this House are unanimously against compulsory unionism in view of the fact that the Queensland Liberal party subscribes to tbe principle of compulsory unionism? the details of the approach of the Queensside worker has the benefit of a conland liberal party to this subject. I do not understand the honourable member's apparent attempt to link the policy of the Queensland Liberal party witb that of the Labour party in New South Wales, which has not adopted various aspects of the trade union policy of tbe Queensland Liberal party. For example, I understand that the Queensland Liberal party is opposed to tbe use of trade union funds for political purposes and that it is in favour of a public audit being made of trade union funds. I have yet to learn that those items of policy have been adopted by the Labour party. any case, whatever may have been the plank of the platform of tbe State division of tbe Liberal party, I can only repeat for the information of everybody that the supreme policymaking body of the Liberal party, wbich is representative of all the States of the Commonwealtb, has recently unanimously adopted the resolution that I previously referred to. I have no doubt of the attitude of the members of the Liberal party in this House. They are opposed to the undemocratic and totalitarian approach which has characterized the attitude of Labour governments in this country in respect of this matter. It is an aspect of policy which even members of the Labour party on the opposite side of this House have cause to regret. However, there is one important distinction between the Liberal party and the Labour party. Having stated our platform and policy, we .attempt to give effect to tbem. That attitude is in marked contrast to the attibility for the development of deposits rest tude of the Labour party towards its printed platform. for Labour and National Service whether it is not a fact that during the whole course of his political and ministerial career he has never disputed the right of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia to impose a system of compulsory unionism on the waterfront? Has that been his attitude despite the fact that the union not only requires persons who are employed on the waterfront to be members of the union, but also requires persons to be members before tbey are able to obtain work on the waterfront? Moreover, is.it not a fact that no waterscientious objection safeguard or anything of that sort. be needed to deal adequately with thc position on the waterfront as distinct from other work sections of the community. The Waterside Workers Eederation of Australia, in connection with waterfront work, functions under legislation that has been passed by this Parliament which imposes upon the union certain obligations in return for the registration of its members. The waterside worker, in effect, enters into a contracIn tual relationship whereby in consideration, for binding himself to be available for work during certain periods he receives a preference in relation to work on the waterfront. Neither this Government, nor the previous Labour Government has ever excluded by legislation the possibility of non-union labour being employed on the waterfront. Indeed, in some parts of Australia, at the present time, non-union labour is employed on the waterfront, during seasonal periods, and that practice is not inconsistent witb our general approach to the whole matter of waterfront employment.

46,Mr Beale,"Although no informaTlie honourable member iias asked whether responsibility to exploit any deposits of uranium found in Queensland would rest on the Government of that State. I emphasize what I have said previously in connection with deposits of uranium in other States, that is, that it is primarily the responsibility of the Government of the State in which uranium is located to develop the deposits. Indeed, by the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act that was passed last year, it was made clear that the Commonwealth expected and hoped that the States would themselves undertake prospecting for uranium and the exploitation of any deposits found. That hope and expectation applies to Queensland equally with the other States. South Australia has provided a noteworthy example of what can be done by a Statu. There is no reason to suppose that what has been done by the Soutb Australian Government could not, also, be done by both the New South Wales and Queeiisland Governments. The Commonwealth hopes that, in thc event of uranium being discovered iii New South Wales mid Queensland, those States will follow Soutb Commonwealth will continue to assist the States as much as possible iu connection with the search for uranium. Indeed, discussions have already taken place between the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government with a view to the Commonwealth assisting Queensland to undertake a scintillometer survey in. that State. to an Australian who became an American citizen and now intends to re-enter Australia with his wife and family, and to make bis permanent home here.

I bad referred to what was attributed to tbe Queensland branch of the Liberal party. The honourable gentleman has introduced a red herring in order to distract us from the scent of what, after all, is the real issue involved in this matter. The supporters of the Australian Labour party are doing a lot of shuffling on this issue, and none more so than those who sit behind the right honourable gentleman opposite. If they are prepared to come out wholeheartedly in support of the printed platform which has appeared as a part of Australian Labour party policy for many years, let them get up in this House and say so. As it is, they are trying to make tbe best of both worlds by allowing tbe New South Wales Government to follow its avowed course and at the same time washing their hands of the business in this House. The Australian Country party and the Liberal party know where they are going in relation to this issue, if the gentleman missed the aeroplane connection Australian Labour party does not. tbe Minister for External Affairs a question concerning the possibility of international discussion at Bermuda or elsewhere of the problems of the Government of Indonesia in controlling Communist-inspired disorder in that country. In view of the frequent statements by certain Indonesian politicians that there is a relationship between that country's internal security and its claims to Dutch New Guinea, will the Minister ensure that the imperative interests of Australia in the maintenance of the existing status of Dutch New Guinea are put with clarity and force in any international discussion of Indonesian affairs? bonorable gentleman appreciates the difficulty in my giving a public reply to a question concerning the relationship between the deterioration of internal security in Indonesia and the claims of that country to Dutch New Guinea.

That, without prejudice, to the generality of paragraph 1 of these Proposals, the Governor General may, from time to time by Proclamation declare that, from a time and date specified infcheProclamation, the Intermediate Tariff shall apply to such goods specified in the Proclamation as are the produce or manufacture of any British or foreign country specified in the Proclamation. 3. That on and after the time and date specified in a Proclamation issued in accordance with the lost preceding paragraph, the Intermediate Tariff shall apply to such goods specified in the Proclamation as are tlie produce or manufacture of a British or foreign country specified in that Proclamation. 4. That any Proclamation issued in accordance with paragraph 2 of these Proposals may, from time to time, be revoked or varied by a further Proclamation, and upon the revocation or variation of the Proclamation, tlie Intermediate Tariff shall cease to apply to the goods specified in the Proclamation so revoked, or, as the case may be, the application of the Intermediate Tariff to the goods specified in theProclamation so varied, shall be varied accordingly. Cabinet. I hope that a decision will be reached in tbe near future. Tbe honourable member for the Northern Territory was with me when I visitedthe Harts Ranges some months ago and he will be conversant with some of the difficulties! that confront the industry. In an endeavour to resolve them, the Government has been considering carefully the whole matter including the winning of mica and, more important still, its sale. In that connection, the Government has instituted various inquiries abroad. I hope that some experts from England will be able to visit Australian soon and advise the Government upon the production of mica and its grading and classification. Those matters have been, closely associated with Australia's difficulty in to assist tbe industry.

Afr. Erie J. Harrison. (TSO. 1.)] The Customs Tariif proposals which I lave just introduced are a consolidation .and re-introduction of two Customs Tariff proposals which were introduced in the Parliament on the Sth March, and the 9th September, last. This consolidation will facilitate discussion by honourable members when the proposals are being debated during the present parliamentary session. In addition these proposals contain several new amendments as the result of further inquiries by the Tariff Board. These new amendments -cover engine cleaning waste, metal working lathes, files and rasps, valve spring removers for internal combustion engines, elastics, aiid polyethylene plastics. At a later stage I shall avail myself of the opportunity to table the relevant Tariff Board reports. The new duties will operate as from 9 a.m. on the 25th November. Attached to the proposals is a "" Summary of Alterations"" which sets out in convenient form a comparison between the proposed duties and those provided for in the Customs Tariff 19331952. The Excise Tariff proposals and the Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) proposals are merely re-introductions of the proposals introduced earlier this year and they contain no new amendments. accorded full opportunity at a later stage in the present session to discuss these proposals.

The honourable member may discuss only the proposed allotment of time. ment of time is reasonable. Obviously, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) has raised purely a technical objection. During the prolonged debate on the motion for the second reading of the measure honourable members opposite had ample opportunity to debate the bill, but at that stage they advanced only a series of barren arguments. of the second-reading debate has nothing to do with the motion now before the Chair. thc second reading the Opposition had ample opportunity to indicate its objection to the measure, but jt made signally little use of that opportunity. It tant bill, and it is peculiarly a measure is obvious, therefore, that honourable members opposite do not require a longer period to consider the measure at this stage. The nature of the amendments they submitted on the second reading indicate clearly that they are put forward for tactical reasons only, and the allot-ent of time now proposed for the committee stage is quite adequate. Honourable members opposite are being merely technical in this matter. able member must confine his remarks to him as a gangster. the motion before the Chair. able members opposite were given "" gagster "". the opportunity to accept additional time for consideration of. the measure in committee, and such . provision involved the extension of the current' sessional period, it is perfectly clear what their decision would be.

The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has raised a purely technical objection. It is clear that he and his colleagues are anxious that the consideration of the measure should be concluded a3 soon as possible because the debate on it so far has been wholly discreditable to them. application of the ""guillotine"" on this occasion indicates the outrageous nature of the Government's approach to legislation. First, with a flourish of trumpets, the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) declares that this measure is the most important bill of the century. Then the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) goes for a private tour, and his deputy gag.= the committee. Prime Minister's actions are not under discussion. for consideration in committee. Therefore, the proposal to limit that consideration to one and a half days is altogether wrong.

I hope that the Minister will agree, upon further examining the provision, that the omission of those important words has not improved the measure but rather has injured it. The words should be restored so that there may be a proper limit on the .Minister's powers of delegation. for Health) [4.8] -This change was suggested by the States in order that we may be able to delegate power not only to Commonwealth health officers, but also to the State health authorities. The need for the delegation of power to the States is obvious. A great variety of matters included in this bill will have io be dealt with by State health authorities and not by Commonwealth authorities, and our intention is that the States should be adequately covered. Hr. DALY (Grayndler) [4.9] I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Eraser). In spite of the explanation given by the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) I believe that the words referred to by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro should be inserted in the clause. As the honourable member for Eden-Monaro_ has said, almost unlimited powers will be conferred upon the Minister unless the clause is amended. There is always a danger in conferring unlimited power upon a .Minister, no matter who may agree to the proposal, and the amendment would provide adequate protection against the ruthless misuse of such power by the Minister for Health, who for the present happens to be the right honourable member for Cowper. I understood the right honourable gentleman to say that the State governments agreed to the proposal embodied in this clause. It is strange to hear of the Minister taking any notice of thc State authorities, because his usual line of conduct when dealing with the States in health matters is to adopt a stand-over role, as happened when he refused to give the States money for hospitals unless they submitted to his "" Order! There is no occasion to reflect domination. Such incidents suggest that on honourable members. Get on with thethe Minister should not have unlimited clause. l No J2 4 2 9 powers. There should be safeguards against any abuse of power. ' Although the States may have agreed to the Government's proposal, and although the Minister may think that he will not exercise the proposed power wrongly, it would be wiser to adopt the amendment and place his capacity to do so beyond doubt. The proposal by the Opposition should not be viewed iu a party political spirit. It is constructive and is intended to assist fhe Minister. I know that the right honourable gentleman is a genial kind of fellow and may not abuse his power, but in some matters he has already indicated that he is prepared to go to the limit in the exercise of powers that have been conferred upon him. I have mentioned one example already. In the circumstances, especially as the national health scheme is of vital importance to all Australians, I am not willing to allow the clause to remain in its present form. The Minister should not be given authority to do exactly as he wishes in this matter without being subject to any restraining influence. The amendment is clear and concise and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has explained it in simple terms. The Minister, therefore, must understand its purpose. He should accept it at once if he wishes to protect the interests of the people against the possibility of any misuse of power in the future. At least he should agree to consider it with a view to meeting the wishes of the Opposition. If he proposes to force the bill through the Parliament and to reject all proposed amendments, we might as well forget our constructive suggestions and make no further attempt to debate the terms of the bill. There is no justification for. forcing an important measure of this character through the Parliament without regard for the considered proposals of the Opposition. It is obvious from the way in which Government supporters sit behind the Minister and listen to his words without comment that they are not prepared to accept our suggestions or to consider the merits of our amendments.",37,Allotment Oe Time

I know that Government supporters would like the Opposition to withdraw the amendment to this clause. They know that, if it were accepted, it would probably cause a great deal of inconvenience to the Minister and to those who draft the Government's legislation. However, that is a minor matter and should not affect the issue in any way. The important fact is that the amendment has been designed for the purpose of safeguarding the people against the ruthless misuse of power by the Minister. Therefore, it should be embodied in the clause.

When the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) explained tlie clause to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Eraser), who moved the amendment, I understood the honourable member to nod his head to indicate his agreement with the Minister. Apparently the honourable gentleman accepted the Minister's explanation. The clause provides for the delegation of powers and functions in connection with the approval of doctors, the approval of hospitals, supervision of the operation of the health scheme, and so forth. These are largely matters of concern to the States. The Minister has explained that the clause has been discussed with the State governments and that they are in agreement with its provisions. We can have every confidence in the Minister's assurance. It is no argument to talk, as the honourable member for Grayndler talked, of the Minister being a standover merchant. Such expressions are mere propaganda, not argument. The question at issue is whether or not the terms of the clause, in relation to the delegation of Order! The honourable member for Reid powers, give effect to the wishes of both the Commonwealth and the States. T'he Minister has assured the committee that he has discussed this matter with the States, and that both the Commonwealth and the States desire the clause to be retained in its present form so that they both may exercise their respective functions. It did little credit to the honourable meniber for Grayndler for him to say, in the face of the Minister's posiother specialists should he made availtive declaration, that he did not believe 1 that the States have heard of it. There can be no real discussion of th-3 clause on that basis. The wording of the relevant clause of the first bill was altered in order to meet the wishes of those who will have to administer the scheme.

It is obvious that the Minister received instructions from the Federal Council of the British Medical Association in connection with the preparation of his second bill. It was announced in the press soon after the Government was returned to office that a national health scheme would not be introduced into the Parliament until after a British medical congress had been held in Brisbane.

The Minister for Health, Sir Earle Page, visited the Pederal Council on Friday, August 22, 1952, and discussed with them during the -greater part of the day matters relating to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act and the Pensioner Medical Service. A free interchange of views took place, and then the Minister left the .meeting. The following paragraph also appeared in that issue of the Medical Journal of Australia:Tiie Federal Council had before it a statement issued by the Commonwealth Department nf Health in reference to thc proposed sclieme for the provision of medical benefits under a national health service, and also a copy of the proposed subsidies for minimum and optional services. This gave rise to a good deal of -discussion .adopted a resolution, based on the lines of the Victorian Branch letter, that the profession in Australia should refuse its co-operation in a scheme of Government-subsidized medical benefits undor the National Health Service Act, HMS. It urged the repeal of that legislation -and its substitution by an Act acceptable to the profession. After the Federal Council had heard the views of the Minister, and bad received his assurance that a National Health Act would be brought down by the Government early in 1953, it offered its continued CO; -operation in the preparation of the medical benefits scheme. lit is significant that the clause provides that diagnostic and therapeutic may be provided exclusively, for medical practitioners British and New Zealand health schemes -envisage the establishment centres at which diagnostic and therapeutic services will be provided. ently the Minister considers that such clinics should be attached hospitals -out that it is undesirable sons who wish to obtain diagnostic advice to have to go to public hospitals, the atmosphere is not always They have to state the nature of their business to gatekeepers or inquiry -and tliere . is generally sphere -electorate at which were registered last year. I consider that sufferers diseases should be able to seek radiological -and X-ray services in a relaxed ilfr. Morgan. sphere. There is no reason why diagnostic and therapeutic services should be provided exclusively for the benefit of medical practitioners and hospitals. This aspect of the matter should be elucidated by the Minister. I am reminded of an experiment that was conducted at the Massachusetts General. Hospital in America. An autopsy that was conducted on 3,000 persons who died in that institution revealed that medical diagnosis had been eorrect in only 52 per cent, of the eases. The trend in modern medicine is set out in the following article that appeared in the Medical Journal of Australia in its issue of the 20th September, 1952 :.MEDICINE ASD HUMANITY. . . . the Federal Council By Morris C.

Disturbance of this balance from elements entirely outside of the indiatmovidual constitutes as real a cause of disease as does pathological change. In the health centres established under the British national health scheme, which the former British Minister for Health described, as the key to that scheme, provision is made for trained social workers to be attached to the centres to consider various factors that affect a patient's condition. An illness may be due to social environment or industrial conditions, which are very important in this industrial era, when many men work with chemicals and gases that may affect their health. Social environment, industrial conditions, and domestic and financial problems must be considered. Those matters are outside the ordinary province of a medical practitioner and call for the services of trained social workers, psychologists and the like. workers, psychologists, physiotherapists, dentists and dieticians should be in attendance at health centres.

Services of that type would completely destroy the doctor-patient relationship that exists to-day. The words "" for medical practitioners and hospitals"" have been written into the eiause with the. object of preventing the nationalization of medicine. Under the clause in its present form, public health and tropical medicine services could be established, as well as centres for X-ray examinations and radium treatment.

If the words "" for medical practitioners and hospitals"" were omitted, medical practitioners and hospitals would be denied the facilities of such laboratories. The words will not limit the use of the services exclusively to medical practitioners and hospitals. They have been inserted in order that medical practitioners and hospitals will be able to use the services in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. The words do not preclude the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) from establishing diagnostic centres for other purposes, but they make it plain that, when services of this nature are required, the Minister has power to establish them and to make them available for use by medical practitioners, in the interests of people generally. If the words were omitted, the Minister would not have such, power. Therefore, it is obvious that they must remain in the clause.

I cannot understand why the Opposition has suggested that the words be omitted. During the eight years that the Labour party was in power before this Government came into office, institutions of this kind worked in conjunction with medical practitioners and hospitals. The present Government parties established many diagnostic and therapeutic centres before World War II . If 1 am not misinformed, the Labour party established one at Wollongong during the period it was in office, and possibly another elsewhere.' In every case, I tliink, the centre has been established in association with hospitals. The centre at Launceston is associated with a hospital, are those at Lismore and Tamworth. It is impossible to make the centres function satisfactorily and comparatively inexpensively if we do not utilize the facilities that are available in hospitals.

The amendment is most important. Its effect would be to remove the necessity for a person to belong to a private fund or a friendly society. It woulcl ensure that every person who otherwise would be entitled to a Commonwealth benefit would receive that benefit by right, as a citizen and as a taxpayer, without any obligation to belong to a private society. If this amendment is carried, as I hope that it will be, it will be necessary to make many consequential alterations to the bill.

173,Sir Earle Page (Cowper,Minister,43,General Medical Services
174,Mr Allan Eraser (Eden,"Monaro)The objection to this clause is that it unduly restricts the number of Australian citizens who are entitled to medical benefits. Under this clause, instead of being a national scheme embracing tlie whole of the people of Australia, the Government's scheme becomes a partial scheme embracing only those who belong to particular societies. That, the Opposition contends, is entirely wrong. The adoption of the amendment that I have moved would enable all those who suffer from a chronic illness and elderly people to obtain the Commonwealth benefit in respect of medical attention. As has already been mentioned, many of the private funds to which people are now required to contribute as a condition of .obtaining the Commonwealth benefit have a very high level of expense. I have already cited, the case of the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia which collected £401,000 in contributionsduring the year ended the 30th June, 1953, and paid, only £166,000 in benefits in the same period. At that time. I pointed out that the general expenses of that fund totalled £53,000 during that year, but in doing so I omitted to state that, in addition to that amount, the sum of £40,000 was shown as expenses in the appropriation account of the fund. Whilst that fund paid out £166,000 in benefits during the financial year, it also paid about £100,000 in management expenses in the same period. Nobody should be required to belong to such a society as that as a condition of obtaining a benefit for which he has already paid in the form of taxation at the appropriate rate. The purpose of the amendment is to remove that restriction and give to all the people of Australia, by right, the medical benefits that the Commonwealth provides. support the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser). think that the scheme that is outlined 'by the bill is a. preposterous proposition to put forward in a democratic community. Sub-clause (1.) of clause 14, of the bill reads as follows:Where a contributor incurs medical expenses in respect of a professional service specified in tbe first schedule of this Act and fits that will accrue to them if the amendunder the rules of the registered medical benement is accepted. The people who fits organization to the medical benefits fund of which the contributor pays contributions the contributor is entitled to' a fund benefit equal to or greater than the amount specified in that schedule in relation to that service, Commonwealth benefits of the amount so specified is payable su'bject to and in accordance with the provisions of this Part. In this clause, the mau who has paid £45 a year into the National Welfare Fund is denied the right to receive a benefit in respect of medical services that he may require. This clause is a denial of democratic justice and the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) should have no hesitation in accepting the proposed amendment. The clause -constitutes a denial of the rights of people suffering from chronic illnesses such as asthma, blood pressures, hernia and arthritis. For many years the trade union movement spent much time and had much trouble in establishing that men suffered from certain diseases due to their employment in certain industries. Now, the Government proposes to deny people their just dues in connection with medical benefits. I appeal to the Minister for Health to accept the amendment because when the people of Australia feel the impact of clauses such as this they will wonder why the Government has inserted them in the bill. Have they been inserted at the behest of the governing body of the medical profession, the British Medical Association, or have they been inserted as a result of an oversight on the part of the Minister? I speak for my constituents in supporting the amendment. I do not know how the Government can justify its action in denying the people the right to benefit from the National Welfare Fund into which they have paid £160,000,000. I doubt whether this clause is constitutional. If it were challenged in the courts I do not think that it would hold water. I believe that in such a. case the I courts would have no compunction in preventing the Government from carrying out its intention. I support the amendment, and I hope that the Minister for Health will give full consideration to the submissions of the Opposition, and will not deny the people of Australia the bene-",43,General Medical Services

Therefore, it should be closely examined, and the reasons why we shall not accept it should be fuUy stated. It has been said that, under the Government system, the expenditure of the friendly societies w ill be very heavy. The position is, and the honourable mem-' ber for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) can support me in this, that only 8 per cent, or 10 per .cent, of the revenue of friendly societies will be Usedi n their part of the administration of the scheme. Indeed, organizations w i ll not be approved by the Government unless they show that tbey can keep their expenses below at least 15 per cent. The American authorities have faced the same problems as we are now facing, and they have discovered that many big American organizations that arc participating in the health scheme have reduced their expenses to 4 per cent, or 5 per cent., and that the average is S per cent. That system is a very satisfactory alternative to the creation of a l uge bureaucratic organization, the cost of which might we'll run into millions of po :nds. Lord Beveridge has stated that the cardinal error made by the United Kingdomi n its health scheme was the rejection of two proposals that friendly societies should be used to -administer the scheme. Lord Beveridge, in a book written in 1948, statedIn rejecting two important proposals in tlic Eeport, for the use of friendly societies to administer State benefits .for sickness and allied purposes to tlieir members . . . the Act commits thc State to setting up a centralized bureaucratic machine. Whether any such machine can grapple with the fundamental problem of sickness benefit, of reconciling sound scheme 'because they know that it w ill finance with sympathy and intimate local handling is uncertain. The Government of 1911 sought the maximum of co-operation between the State and voluntary agencies in the field of social insurance. The Government of 194G has divorced the two completely. The greatest danger of the present situation is not on the side of the friendly societies. They will survive; if they do not do so, their place would be taken by now forms ofvolun tary organization. The real danger-it is great as well as real-is on the other' side of the divorce. Will the State be able to create a machine capable of doing what the 'affiliated orders did in the most difficult of all forms of social insurance, of combining soundness with sympathy in administration of cash benefits to the sick? Will the State be able to avoid the evil alternatives of extravagance and of harshness? The present rulers of the State have lightheartedly taken on a tsisk without as yet having shown understanding of its nature. Now let us cousider what thc position of the patients would have been if Labour's scheme had been adopted. The last Labour Government introduced a scheme which provided that where a person consulted a doctor and the consultation fee was 10s. 6d., the Government would pay 5s. 3d. and the patient would be required"" to pay '5s. 3d. Under this Government's scheme the Government, together w it h the insurance organization, w ill pay 12s. or 13?. 6d. of a. consultation fee of 15s., leaving the patient to pay only ls . 6d. If a person has a major operation that costs £25 under this scheme the Government and the insurance organization w ill pay £2,2 10s. and ithe patient £2 10s. Under Labour's scheme the patient was required to pay £12 10s., while the Labour Government proposed to pay -only £12 10s. Mr PoLT.Au.rj -But under tlie Labour Government's scheme the .patient would also have received his friendly society's benefit. honourable member for Lalor( Mr. Pollard) now wants two schemes. He wants a huge bureaucratic organization, and a scheme embracing the friendly societies as well. In other words, he wants o i l and water to mix. I suggest that that is merely stupid nonsense which will not affect the greatest supporters of this scheme, which are the friendly societies themselves. They support the allow them to continue w it h , . and even greatly to expand their beneficent work. In New Zealand a person gets 7s. 0d. in respect of a consultation with a doctor, and a fiat-rate payment at the rate of 7s. 6d. a visit towards a midwifery fee. The rest he pays himself.",44,General Medical Services

178,Mr Allan Fraser (Eden,"Monaro)he must produce necessarily and obviously include accounts and the receipts from doctors, but the bill before the committee does not impose any obligation upon a doctor to supply such documents. That is, therefore, an obvious omission from the legislation. The clause which I have proposed will remedy that position. Its inclusion will not harm the legislation. Instead, it will tend to make the scheme introduced by the Minister more workable. I have no doubt that the right honourable gentleman wil] agree that if a doctor renders a service to a patient, receives payment from the patient and refuses to supply a statement of the service rendered or a receipt for the money paid, the patient will be thereby, deprived of the right and opportunity to obtain the benent for which he paid his contribution to an approved society. In addition, he will be prevented from receiving the Commonwealth benefit which the Minister intends him to receive. Throughout this bill it is notable that the Minister has been most tender of the susceptibilities of members of the medical profession. Nowhere in the bill, as far as I am able to see, has he placed the slightest obligation on members of that profession. At the moment, I am not quarrelling with his failure to impose obligations on them in relation to other provisions of the measure, but surely this is an obvious obligation which he .must impose upon them if his own scheme is to be made workable. The position is, first, that the doctor may refuse or omit to provide any receipt or statement to the patient. The patient then would be debarred from obtaining the refund that is provided by this bill and he would be completely debarred from obtaining from the friendly society the benefit for which he had paid a contribution to that society. Secondly, the doctor may provide a statement in such a general form that it would be unacceptable to the society and unacceptable to the Department of Health as evidence of the serviee that had been rendered. That is happening throughout wealth. Patients are experiencing very great difficulty and delay in obtaining from the Commonwealth and from the societies the benefits for which they have subscribed. I do not think that it is a Mr Allan Fraser. common occurrence for a doctor to refuse to provide a statement of account or a receipt. payment if he does not provide it? cases he is paid without providing a statement or receipt because he simply takes the cash and puts it in his pocket. fault. that it happens frequently. I should think that the occasions on which a doctor would refuse to provide a statement of account or a written receipt would be infrequent, but I think the honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hulme) would agree that doctors frequently fail to provide statements in the form that is acceptable to the society and to the Com mon weal th. until he does. able member says that the doctor should uot be paid until he does.

At Present, The Doctor","order to ascertain which operation was performed so that the society would know the amount that had to be refunded to the patient. The doctor replied that it was nothing to do with the lodge officer but rested between himself and the patient. The patient had to be asked to obtain the information from the doctor so that the friendly society could recognize the account and pay the amount that was due. The Government does not pay anything until after the approved society has paid the amount for which it is responsible. The society has to apply tb the Government for its share of the amount and unless the form shows the relevant details, the society cannot get the money. The fault does not lie with the patient. case, the doctor has to submit an account Often he cannot get the information unless he is prepared to argue with the doctor or the person who makes out the doctor's account. The purpose of the amendment is to require the doctor to set out information when the patient asks for it so that the treatment can be identified and the society can pay the patient and apply to the Government for the amount. The Opposition is not trying to put anything over the doctors in. advancing this amendment. The facts that I have placed before the committee are not hearsay. I have seen, numerous accounts showing only that the bill is for services rendered. Sometimes it shows that the service has extended from one date to another but many accounts do not state thc number df visits paid by the doctor to the patient. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Bird) stated in this chamber last week that sometimes there was a delay of seven or eight weeks in the payment of amounts clue. Those delays occur for the reasons that I have stated. Approved societies are unable to determine from the accounts the amount that they must pay. If they pay too much, they cannot get it back and they withhold payment until they get the requisite information from the patient or the doctor. The doctor does not want to make out an account twice. If a person is not entitled to a refund, it does, not matter. He simply pays the bill and that is the end of it. But if the patient is entitled to a refund, he must have evidence on his ilr. Thompson. account to show the treatment for which he paid the. doctor.. The amendment does not interfere with the proposals that are contained in. the bill. It is merely intended to simplify payment and obviate delays. [5.23] -The matter that has been raised by the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) presents a real problem. The honourable member has drawn attention to an aspect of the matter to which the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) might well be asked to give consideration. It is not a simple matter to include this proposal in the desired form. Eirst, I propose to refeT to the submission of accounts. In any if the patient is to get any benefit under the provisions of the bill. The amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Allan Eraser) dealing with that matter does not appear to me to have much force because the process has to be initiated by the doctor's account. I cannot see any point in putting anything about the account into this bill. Unless the doctor renders the account, no action under this measure can ensue. There is a problem, however, in the. question of certification becanse obviously an approved society must know for what, it has to pay. The British Medical Association has been most insistent upon this point and has done its best to impress upon doctors that they must: give an approved organization the infoi-mation that it requires on the form that it supplies.' At present that is done more or iess by agreement. Obviously it must be' done. But the doctor is in a dilemma when he tries to determine how much he should disclose. A great many patients object to having a full' diagnosis of their ailment and details of the treatment displayed upon a certificate. It is not sufficient to state in the amendment that, the information must be supplied on request by the person concerned, because sometimes a patient asks for a diagnosis or a certificate about an illness when the doctor does not feel justified in giving it. The doctor may adopt that attitude because he thinks the",48,Pairs
193,Dr. Donald Cameeon (Oxley),"patient is not sufficiently responsible, or the patient's family may object. There may he other reasons. The patient may bc a minor and the family may ask for a certificate. Later, when the patient is no longer a minor, he may object to the information having been given. So the question of certification is not easy. Afr. THOMPSON -An indication must IK> given of the type of the operation. There is much force in thc statements that have been made by the honourable member for Port Adelaide as to quoting the number in the schedule. If the Minister will examine that aspect to determine whether the difficulty of supplying the information could be overcome, T rlo aot believe that the medical profession vvould consider that it was heing asked to do something improper. The approved societies must have the information so that they can make payments without undue delay. Accordingly I a3k the Minister whether he will give some consideration to certification under eiause L'fi of the bill. T suggest that action might be taken along the lines that have been suggested by the honorahle member for Port Adelaide and that a number in. the schedule might be quoted rather than, the technical details of the operation, the diagnosis or the treatment. The difficulty in connection with the number of visits could be overcome easily, but the particulars in the schedules are a more difncult matter. | ->.27'\ -In stating that the matter under long ( Mr Cramer) asked by interjection discussion presents a problem, the honourable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald -Cameron) has made an admission that is of some value.

That is particularly the case when patients are in private wards and the doctors visit them periodically during their hospital visits. Unless there is a clear stipulation that the visits must be listed, the patients will virtually have to keep an account of the number of visits that they receive from the doctors. There is agreement between the Opposition and the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) upon some aspects of this measure, and one of them is that the system should not be allowed to run wild. I believe that tlie doctors should stipulate clearlythe number of visits that they pay to. patients. If that is left to the patients,, extra visits might be added to the list for the purpose of collecting 6s. or 12s. for each of them. would have to pay an additional amount. if, in fact, the visits were made by a doctor to a private ward in which the patient was accommodated. That aspect of the scheme must be taken care of. ""We suggest that it will be taken care of if the proposed new clause be accepted. When the honourable member for Bennehow a patient would know the number of visits made to him by a member of the medical profession he stressed the need for this amendment. Let us reach agreement on the suggestion that the number of visits and the schedule number under which the benefit is listed must be included on statements of professional service rendered by -doctors.

AD obligation should be imposed on them to supply to their patients statements in writing giving particulars of professional services rendered and the charges made there for. In most instances no dispute will arise on that point, but the legislation should be made specific. The Minister has stressed the need for maintaining a proper balance in the relations between the patient and his doctor. The more clearly these matters are defined in the bill, the more scope there will be for the maintenance of that proper balance in the relations between the doctor and his patient that the Minister so desires. A doctor must provide information required by a registered organization before it authorizes payment of a claim. ""We cannot leave it to the patient to advise the organization of the number of visits by the doctor. If that were done the scheme would be subject to all sorts of abuses. There must be a proper check between the patient and the doctor in relation to the amount paid by the organization from its own funds and those paid by it on behalf of the Government. Unless that is done the revenue cannot be properly protected. I am afraid that, in order to overcome some of the difliculties which have been referred to during this debate, we might be inclined to enmesh members of the medical profession in a lot of unnecessary red-tape. We must do everything possible to avoid that. Claims made upon a registered organization are vetted by the organization before the payment is made to the patient from its own funds and on behalf of the Government. Virtually a double check is imposed by the organization, first when it pays money from its own funds and on behalf of the Government and, later, when it renders monthly accounts to the Director-General and furnishes full information covering the payments made. That check is outside the provisions of this bill. My principal concern is that we should not so enmesh the scheme in red-tape that it will become obnoxious to those who are concerned in its functioning. Doctors, who are so busy these days, believe that their time should not be wasted by unnecessary provisions. Their responsibilities should be stated in the simplest possible form consistent with safety, with the realization that a double check will be imposed on all payments made by registered organizations. I do not know how the Minister views the amendment. While I oppose it, he may share the view expressed by the honourable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron) that there is some virtue in it. I believe that the bill, as drafted, provides sufficient protection to the revenue, having regard to the double check imposed by registered organizations to which 1 have referred. The scheme is based on co-operation. The registered organizations play an important part in it, in respect of not only benefits provided from their own funds, but also the government benefits. Legislation of this kind is always subject to regulations and conditions which are not necessarily stated in the legislation itself. I urge the Minister to be careful not to hinder the medical fraternity by making the scheme so cumbersome as to detract from the services rendered to the community by the members of the medical profession. to the Minister to accept the amendment. I differ very strongly from the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer), who has contended that if the amendment is accepted the members of the medical profession will be enmeshed in red tape. The majority of the members of the medical profession already furnish statements of the kind which the amendment, proposes shall be furnished by them. A minority of doctors in Melbourne have so far not given effect to the wishes of the majority of the members of the British Medical Association and do not furnish statements that are satisfactory to the registered organizations. A. controversy has been raging in the Melbourne metropolitan press in regard to the length of time taken by the Hospital Benefits Association of Victoria to pay claims lodged with it.'

The accounts' should also show the date oi consultation and the number of visits. Many that had been rendered. Furthermore, doctors are already doing this.

205,Mr Townley (Denison,"Ministe rsuggested, a compromise could be worked out whereby an approved society could be adequately informed of the professional service rendered to a patient and, at the same time, the doctor-patient relationship could be wholly preserved. As the honourable member for Batman( Mr because his doctor has not had time, or Bird) has said, very few doctors have failed so far to supply satisfactory statements of accounts. The British Medical Association, which represents the great majority of doctors in this country, has .advised its members that they must supply satisfactory statements to approved -societies. We must remember that the scheme has been in operation for only a few months. Difficulties are bound to *rise, but I am confident that they will be ironed out in due course. So far. a considerable measure of agreement has been achieved between the doctors and the approved societies, and I believe that those doctors who are not supplying statements of accounts in a satisfactory form will come into line with their colleagues. fail to comprehend why the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) will not accept the amendment. Apparently, some Government supporters are in favour of it. Its object is not only to protect the patient but also the doctor himself by enabling approved organizations to adhere to the letter of the law. I do not agree that acceptance of the amendment would encourage red tape or place an undue amountof work upon the doctors. Doctors are able to obtain clerical assistance. favourably placed financially under this scheme and thus are better able to obtain such assistance than they have been hitherto. insert in the measure the following ° provision:A medical practitioner who has rendered a professional service for a. person shall on a benefit from a friendly society or request by that person supply to him a statement ' in writing giving particulars of the professional service and of the charges made there for.. What is wrong with such a provision? I , personally, know of a number of instances in Sydney, involving friendly societies particularly, in which undue delay has occurred, in dealing with claims for benefit. The Government requires persons to join approved societies in order to qualify for benefit. Consequently, when a person incurs expense in obtaining medical treatment payment of benefit should not be delayed' merely simply refuses, to furnish to the society a statement giving the requisite details. Undoubtedly, many medical practitioners are most obliging, but a few do not go out of their way to render a simple service to their patients. I suspect something clandestine about the whole bill. Perhaps the Minister has to run to the British Medical Association to get his instructions. It is time that this Government acted as a responsible government acts, and made provision for the correct procedure to be followed, in the interests of the people whom it is supposed to represent here. This bill will affect the lives of many people who are entitled to receive justice. I cannot understand why the Minister quibbles over this simple proposal. The honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer) made heavy weather of his attempt to justify the Government's attitude, and I thought that he secretly approved of the amendment, but was not "" game "" to support it with word and vote. I appeal to the Minister to be fair-minded in this matter. I hope that he is not acting on the instructions of the British Medical Association. The amendment, if it is adopted, may slightly improve a bad bill. I have been, in turn, a member, a grand,lodge officer, and a grand master Indeed, they are more of a friendly society in New South Wales, and quite a number of persons have informed me that the whole position is almost impossible for members of The amendment seeks to approved organizations. A doctor should supply the simple particulars of professional service for which a patient asks in order that he may recover, without delay, approved organization. The last thing the Minister should do is quibble over this matter. His hostility to the amendment causes me to believe that he is acting in a clandestine manner in an effort to protect the British Medical Association. Let him treat the people fairly by accepting this simple reform.",52,Pairs
206,Mr Geeentjp (Dalley) [5.47],"I[5.541 I merely wish to say two things about the. amendment. to. remind the Opposition that personal attacks upon the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) are no argument, one way or the other. The second is that some constitutional difficulty may complicate the carrying out of this amendment. If such a difficulty exists, the committee may well be made aware of it and proceed, in the knowledge of it, to some other conclusion. But I feel sure that, if there is a constitutional difficulty, the Minister would be quite willing to accept any reasonable arrangement which would put into practice the wishes of every one in this matter. patient is seen by a doctor, the process whereby he ultimately recovers from his society the fees that he pays to the medical practitioner, shall be expedited. No honourable member wishes the payment hy the friendly society or approved organization to the patient to be delayed. The last person who would wish it to be delayed is the Minister himself. No one on the other side of the chamber need have any apprehension that the Minister is wilfully obstructing sensible arrangements, because such a conception would not be based on reality. In spite of remarks that have been made about the British Medical Association this afternoon, the facts are that the asociation has done everything in its power to ensure that these arrangements shall work smoothly, and that the relevant information shall be supplied by its members to the societies. Indeed, the British Medical Association has circularized its members, requesting them to use every endeavour to give the societies the necessary informaby all the medical practitioners who partion, as rapidly as possible. More than that the British Medical Association cannot do. To put the matter on no higher plane than mere self-interest, it is obviously in the interests of all doctors that these arrangements should work smoothly. But quite apart from that, what the committee wants is a sensible working arrangement, and if there is no constitutional barrier to it, I feel sure no honourable member on either side of the chamber will be glued to some form of words. If we can get a reasonable and satisfactory form of words which will ensure the objective that we all desire to attain, no one need have any apprehension, that tbe The first is Minister or any honourable member on this si.de of the chamber will stand in the way of it. honourable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron) has really "" put it up "" to the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page), and we shall soon know whether he takes notice of the wishes of this chamber, or bows to instructions or directions from an outside authority. the sort. I referred to constitutional difficulties. ber is a practising doctor, and he knows that no big difliculties are in the way of the adoption of the amendment. He has referred to the possibility of the existence of constitutional difficulties. What could they possibly be ? This is purely a matter between doctor and patient. It is the patient's privilege. Medical practitioners have frequently claimed in a court of law professional privilege as a reason for a refusal to disclose information about a patient. That claim has not been upheld, and it does not arise again now. A patient should be able to obtain from his doctor the information that is required by an approved organization. The amendment, if it is accepted, will not affect in any way the proper functioning of the scheme. The British Medical Association has always taken a consistent stand on this matter. Under the McKenna plan, the procedure was simple, and the vital principle of the need for the preservation of secrecy was recognized. Fewer than 9,000 returns were to be made ticipated in the scheme. Under the present proposal, millions of returns will be submitted in respect of millions, of patients. Again, under the McKenna plan, the kind of service performed was to be indicated by a sign or symbol, and the information was to be sent direct to the Department of Health.

As a practising doctor, I know that the furnishing to a patient of a statement setting out what he is suffering from may have a bad psychological effect on him. Furthermore, it is 'bad in ""principle for other people to know fhe details of his complaint. That is a They are 'personal matter between the doctor and his patient. The ""bill requires only a minimum of information to be furnished to enable an account to be paid. The : Government believes that the insertion of an element of compulsion would destroy the validity of the clause, and possibly the bill as a whole. The doctors themselves, for about three and a half years, have extended to the Government .the maximum degree of cordial co-operation. During 'the last six months we have been -successful in obtaining a degree of uniformity between fhe various insurance organizations. They ""have formed a federal council, which is in constant communication not only with the Government but also with the doctors and chemists' associations. Many anomalies 'have been overcome, and bars to insurance have been removed. They are prepared to straighten out these things provided that other organizations will not obtain an advantage as a result of restrictions that they place upon themselves. T'he Government rejects ""the amendment, on the ground that it is desirable to retain that cordial relationship. Opposition has .moved for the insertion -of a new clause, to readA medical practitioner who 'has -rendered .a . professional .service for :a person shall, on request by that person, supply to him a statement in writing giving .particulars of the professional service and of the charge -made there for. That is a very sensible and reasonable proposition. The honourable member for Oxley '(Dr. ""Donald'Cameron), .himself a practising doctor, has supported the contention by -honourable members on this :s'ide of -the chamber. He said (ihat he",57,Pairs
219,Mr Daly (Grayndler) [8.22],"Th econsidered the proposition was one that the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) should reasonably consider. I have no hesitation in informing the Minister that the explanation that he has given to the committee on behalf of the British Medical Association is not acceptable to t.he Opposition. The case that has been put for the organization by the Minister, who is the agent of the association ( in this House, completely disregards the opinions of average laymen in the community. I am not criticizing the doctors, as individuals, but the representatives of the British Medical Association, who have always had their way with the Minister. The right honourable gentleman has stated that he rejects the amendment because he does not wish to insert a compulsory clause which could result in the legislation being .declared invalid. Every member of this Parliament, and indeed every person in the community, knows that this measure contains a vicious form of compulsion. The members of the community are required to join an organization in order to become eligible for the governmeut subsidy, despite the fact that an average of £45 a head is paid by them each year as social services contributions. The Minister is certainly pitting the British Medical Association against the Parliament. Why should not the doctors put down in writing particulars of the treatment that they have given to their patients in order that the provisions of the schedule can be applied? The Minister should have taken notice of the contention of a supporter of the Government, who is a practising doctor-possibl y a much better medical man than the Minister himselfinstead of reading to the committee documents that he had kept secret until he was forced to disclose them to-night. Instead of presenting the case on behalf of the British Medical Association as his gospel and his policy the Minister should have presented the case for the average person in the community in order to ensure that the Government's health scheme would be national rather than sectional in nature. I come now to the question of agreeturtle and sink their principles in ments that have been entered into between order to please the Minister, I should the Government and the British Medical like to see the agreements that have been Association, which are referred to in Mr Onlil. clauses 31, 32 and 33. Although it is vital for every member of the committee to know the terms of the agreements, they are not set out in the bill. The effect of the amendment to clause 31 that has been foreshadowed by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Eraser) will be to force the Minister to table agreements in relation to the pensioner medical service. Why should they be kept secret between the Minister and the British Medical Association ? The Opposition is entitled to be informed of the terms of the agreements to which the Minister has committed the country. We are asked to endorse a proposal without being informed of the agreements thai have been entered into. The Minister should explain the details of the agreements to the Parliament. Clause 32 deals with agreements with the British Medical Association and clause 33 deals, with agreements with the medical profession in relation to the pensioner medical service. We should be informed of the terms and provisions of the existing agreements. Who signed them on behalf of the Government, and to what are we committed? As the honourable member for Eden-Monaro pointed out in an excellent speech on Friday last, the agreements exist only in letters that have passed between the Minister and the representatives of the association. No details have been given to the Parliament. The Minister has ignored repeated requests by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator McKenna) to table full details of them. I should like to know the details of the agreement that the Minister has entered into with .the British Medical Association, particularly the arrangements that the Minister has made with Dr. Hunter, who, when Lahour was in office, refused to permit the members of the British Medical Association to fill in government forms, because he contended that would be contrary to the ethics of the medical profession. However, the doctors are now filling in forms without demur. As those who run the British Medical AssociationI criticize only the individuals-hav e been prepared to turn entered into. I accept the proposals of the Minister with a great deal of reservaments with, and proposals by, the British tion because I believe that, broadly speaking, they will be carried out in accordance with the wishes of the bosses of the British Medical Association, irrespective of their effect on the individual doctors and the members of the public generally. The point I want to make is that the Minister who is in charge of our national health scheme is under thc control of an organization which has, so to speak, given him this measure on its terms and conditions. He has not taken into consideration the anomalies that are being pointed out during this debate. When the Minister replies to the submissions that we make and the amendments that we move, I do not want him to read another long letter from the British Medical Association stating why what we propose should be done cannot bc done. The only question is whether a proposal is right or wrong. If it is right, effect should be given to it by the would state on their bills the nature of the Parliament, notwithstanding that it will offend some outside organization. The Government has a responsibility to ensure that any health legislation introduced into the Parliament will give the people complete cover. They should not be ?iven partial cover at great expense merely because complete cover does not suit some organizations. I suggest that if individual members of the medical proMedical Association in Victoria in which fession, whom I respect highly, were given an opportunity to vote on many of the proposals put forward by the British Medical Association as the policy of that organization, the proposals would be rejected because they do not reflect modern trends in medicine or the opinions of the vast majority of our medical pracment of the professional services rendered titioners. I reiterate my contention that the Minister should place before the Parliapartially ignorant of the things that must ment f u l l details of the agreements entered into with the medical profession and the commitments associated with them. I do not wish to be told by the Minister that the measure does not provide for any form of compulsion and that no agreements embodying compulsion havo been entered into. The statements made by the right honourable gentleman with regard to compulsion, and agreeMedical Association will not withstand investigation. The CHAIEMAN Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired. Opposition proposes that a new clause be inserted in the bill. It is as follows:A medical practitioner who has rendered a professional service for a person shall, on request by that person, supply to him a statement in writing giving particulars of the professional service and of the charge made there for. The Opposition has stated that the proposed new clause is designed to expedite payments made by hospital and medical benefits associations. On the surface, there appears to be much that could be said in support of the amendment but, on close examination, a different position is revealed. I endorse the remarks made by the Opposition that payments could be expedited if medical practitioners professional services rendered. The secretary of a hospital benefits association in Yictoria has told me on several occasions that payments could be expedited if that were done, because the association would be able immediately to calculate the payments that should be made to the contributors concerned. I remember reading a letter from the secretary of the British it was stated that medical practitioners could easily give the required particulars. But the amendment proposes that such particulars shall be given only on request by a contributor to an organization. Most of the people who are being treated by doctors now do not realize that a stateto them by their doctors is necessary. The scheme is a new one, and they are be done to get expeditious payment of their claims. TJnder the proposed new clause, a doctor .would not be compelled to give particulars of the professional services he had rendered to a patient. It is probable that at least 75 per cent, of the people being treated by doctors do not realize that it is necessary to ask the doctors to state on their bills the nature",58,Pairs
220,Mr Hawokth (Isaacs) [8.32],"Th eof the services, they have rendered. A doctor would readily give such a statement if he were asked to do so. Almost daily, medical practitioners are giving certificates of various kinds in which they specify the nature of the illnesses from which people are suffering and the reasons why, for instance, absence from work is necessary. In my opinion, the proposed new clause would not do what the Opposition wishesto be done. A patient would have to ask his doctor for a statement of professional services rendered and, as I have said, in many cases the patient would not realize that such a statement was required and would leave the doctor's consulting rooms without asking for it. Therefore, I believe that the amendment should not be accepted by the Minister. I think it would be better, by administrative action, to make it more or less compulsory for a medical practitioner to specify on his bill the services he has rendered to a patient. That could be done quite easily. Clause 32 reads as follows:(1.) The Minister may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, enter into an agreement with the Federal Council of the British Medical Association in Australia for and in respect of the provision by medical practitioners of medical services for pensioners and their dependants (-2.) Without limiting the generality of the matters upon which agreement may be entered into under the last preceding sub-section, the agreement shall'' (a) define the scope of the medical services and the Government but we ask that to be rendered by medical practitioners; and (6)' set out the terms and conditions of an agreement that the Director General may enter into with a medical practitioner for and in respect of his rendering of those services at such fees and allowances wealth, should know what is in such as are prescribed. (3.) An agreement entered into under this section may be varied or terminated by agreement with, the parties. I support everything that the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) has said about this clause. It is astounding that, at this stage of our legislative history, agreements can be concluded between associations outside the Parliament and a Minister of the Crown without the representatives of the people in the Parliament, having any knowledge of those agreements. That is a dangerous departure from the practice of democratic countries, especially when the agreements are made with an association consisting of thousands of medical practitioners. At a later stage, the Opposition will move an amendment to the clause. We think it is a legitimate and democratic amendment. We shall move that a new subclause be inserted. It reads as follows:An agreement entered into under this section shall, as soon as practicable, be tabled in the Parliament. honourable member is aware that the committee, before it can deal with the amendment he has foreshadowed, must dispose of the amendment now before the Chair. We shall ask that any agreement entered into under the terms of clause 32 be tabled in the Parliament as soon as practicable, because we believe that any agreement that involves expenditure of money by the Commonwealth should be so tabled. No association in this country has a [8.37] right to receive special treatment from the Government. But the British Medical Association, one of the large associations in this country, is entering into agreements with a Minister of the Crown, and those agreements are not being tabled in the Parliament. Why should the Government single out the British Medical Association for special treatment? The Opposition realizes that agreements have to be made between the British Medical Association such agreements be tabled so that they will not be kept secret. These agreements will affect the lives of thousands of people and involve millions of pounds of the taxpayers' money. We, as the legislative authority of the Commonagreements. The action of the Minister in defying this Parliament is unprecedented. I earnestly request the Minister to give a little more consideration to this proposed amendment than he has given to other amendments. He should not ride roughshod over it as though it had been put up in a spirit of irresponsibility. The Minister seems to me to have given far more consider a.tion to the pro? ppsals of Dr. Hunter than he. has given",60,Pairs

222,The Chairman,Doubtless the,61,Pairs
223,Mr Duthie,"I am aware of that.those of the Opposition. Perhaps the reason that the Minister cannot accept -the proposed amendment is that he has not a doctor in the House whom he can -consult concerning it. It is a wonder that the Minister has not had a special -communication system installed in the -chamber for the purpose of contacting the heads of the British Medical Association whilst this bill is being debated. I put it to the Minister that the amendment that the Opposition has proposed is reasonable, rational, sensible and -democratic. seems to me that members of the Opposition must have remarkable faith and -confidence in the medical profession. One would have thought that the insults that they have heaped upon the medical profession in the course of the debate on this mation necessary to substantiate it? bill would have created some vestige of feeling in their minds that they might suffer some personal repercussions on the first occasion that they visited a doctor. But apparently honourable senators opposite are confident that, no matter what they say against the medical profession, when they consult members of that profession they will be treated honestly and fairly. Otherwise they would not have .gone to the lengths that they have to insult that fine profession. Therefore, seeing that they have such faith in the medical profession, surely honourable members opposite should feel confident that doctors will handle their side of the 'Government's scheme in a reasonable way. The honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) proposed that a medical practitioner, at the request -of a patient, could be compelled to give that patient particulars of the ailment for which he was receiving treatment. The committee should consider the serious -disruption that such a requirement might cause to the normal relationship between doctor and patient. In the first place, it might not be advisable for psychological reasons for the practitioner to communicate the particulars of the ailment to tlie patient. In other cases, it may be inadvisable to give such information to the patient although it could be given to the members of his family. If the doctor were compelled to supply that information to the patient a dangerous situation might be created. If there were any need for compulsion we might take the bad -with the good ih a good cause. But there is no. necessity for compulsion. Under the provisions of the Government's scheme, the doctor must provide information concerning the ailment to the appropriate body in order to secure payment of his account a.*speedily as possible. In order to understand the effect of the proposed amendment we must examine the machinery of the measure which is provided for in clause 23. That clause provides that the Government shall come in direct contacr with the medical organization which must claim from the Government a refund of the money that it has paid to, or on behalf of, a contributor, and musi supply to the Government the inforclaim. The Government has no direct contact with the patient. The organization, in order to supply the necessary information to the Goverament, mu3i obtain that information from the doctor. The doctor, in turn, in order to obtain payment from the organization, must, supply the necessary information. Clause 23 provides that the benefit will be paid by the Government to the organization and that the organization will pay the benefit either to the patient or the doctor. This is an important provision because a doctor often considers it inadvisable to give information to a patient regarding an illness. In such a case, the doctor can furnish particulars of the illness to the organization which will then pay his account. Imagine what the position would be if it were dangerous for the doctor to give the patient particulars Of his illness and the law compelled him to reveal that information to the patieut! Obviously, cases would arise in which the doctor would have to inform the patient that he would either have to renounce his claim to medical benefits or go to somebody else for treatment. That is possible because the doctor might not be prepared to reveal to the patient the nature of the illness that he had treated. It is a normal administrative arrangement and could be dealt with in the relationship between the organization and the doctor. ""If then the.",61,Pairs
224,"Mr Leslie (Moore)"" [8.43]","I tdoctor delays in submitting tbe necessary information, he himself will have to wait for payment. had better read the bill again. some honourable members opposite are able to read ordinary English, and understand the terms of the measure. The bill provides that an organization shall make the payment, and does not say when or how or anything else. If I receive a doctor's bill for £10, and I am entitled to £6 benefit, I pay the doctor £4 and tell him to get the other £6 from the Government. That may be done according to this measure, and in fact it is being done at present. It is quite obvious that honourable members opposite are reading mountainous difficulties into this legislation purely for party political purposes, in order to discredit the bill and build up the prestige of the Labour party. Clause 23 reads, inter aliaCommoTiwealth benefit is payable to the registered medical benefits organization to the medifiu] benefits fund of which the contributor pays his contribution . . . In the light of that clause the amendment moved by the honourable member for Eden Monaro is quite unnecessary, and if agreed to it would place a restriction on the operation of the scheme which could adversely affect patients, and tend to prevent that co-operation between the organizations and the medical profession upon which the whole scheme rests. Doctors normally present bills to their patients showing why their visits have been necessary. The CHAIEMAN honourable member's time has expired. I rise to support the proposals of the honourable member for Eeid( Mr nominees of the British Medical AssociaMorgan). The honourable member foreshadowed an amendment to clause 37 of the bill to provide that in any appeals from committees of inquiry to a supreme court, there should be provision for the supreme court, not only, to have regard to the evidence before the committee, and the report of the committee, but also to demand further evidence either oral, upon affidavit or otherwise, and to permit the examination and appeal)-admi t further evidence, either orally cross-examination of witnesses. This part of the bill provides for an agreement between the British Medical Association and the Government relating to medical services for pensioners. If it is found that a medical practitioner who is operating under that clandestine agreement has overcharged or falsely charged for services to patients, the committee of inquiry may investigate his conduct and report to the Minister. The Minister may then, under clause 35, reprimand the practitioner or terminate his agreement. If he terminates the agreement the doctor shall not be a party to any further agreement for a certain period. The CHAIEMAN -Order! The only amendment before the committee is that moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser). The honourable member is dealing with a suggested amendment which is not at present before the committee. The honourable member should direct his remarks to clauses 26 to 37. on the suggestion made by the honourable member for Eeid relating to clause 37. If a medical practitioner is dissatisfied with the Minister's decision, he can appeal to a supreme court. Upon that appeal the court shall have regard .to the evidence before the committee of inquiry, and the report of the committee, but that is all that it can have regard to. Clause 121 states that a committee is not bound by legal rules of evidence, but may inform itself on a matter referred to it "" in such manner as it thinks fit""; that is, by hearsay, prejudice or anything else. One Order! The has only to look at the membership of these committees of inquiry-that is, the Director-General of Health, or his deputy, and four members selected from six tion-to see that there is plenty of ground for injustice occurring in an inquiry by one of these committees.

When a supreme court is determining an appeal from a body which has heard evidence, it is loath to overrule the opinion of the body that has seen the witnesses and formed its opinion of their veracity from their demeanour. If the appeal to the supreme court is to be anything more than a form , the court, which consists of impartial and trained persons, should liave the advantage of any evidence that it sees St to call according to the rules of House made a decision in this matter. law, and should have witnesses examined and cross-examined before it in the publicity which attends court proceedings. I'.n making these suggestions the Opposition is doing no more than referring to the original proposal of the Minister. This is not a controversial matter, and the suggested amendment has been put foward in an endeavour to ensure that a medical practitioner, whose reputation and part of whose livelihood may be at stake, should have the ordinary right possessed by everybody else whose reputation or livelihood is at stake. Certain amendments to this measure have been suggested, but I do not believe honourable members have been supplied with copies of the amendments and suggestions. I for one have not seen them, and it is unfortunate that they have not been made available. The honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) made an attack medical practitioners, and tried in . every possible way to discredit them. He spoke of an alleged agreement between the Minister and the British Medical Association. This matter has been e x p i r e d by the Minister, and everybody knows that no formal agreement at all has heen made, but that the terms and conditions in relation to the treatment of pensioners are covered by the provisions of the bill, and by letters which have passed between the doctors and the Minister. There is no formal agreement between the Minister and the British Medical Association. The agreement between the Government and the doctors relates to the medical services to pensioners, and is based on a surgery fee, a fee for attendance at the pensioners' homes, and certain mileage charges.

238,Mr Allaneraser,"If there hadThe group of clauses uow under review bring before the eommittee the. whole, question of hospitalization. I -express my amazement at statements that have been made by the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page), not only in this chamber, but also throughout Australia. The right honourable gentleman has said that all the problems that were associated with inability to obtain beds in hospitals disappeared after the introduction of the present hospital benefits scheme. He has stated also that the scheme had placed the finances of hosa public ward. The scheme introduced pitals on a much firmer foundation. That is quite understandable, because, before tbe scheme was introduced, people probably could not pay to hospitals the money that is now paid to them. I should' like the Minister to indicate to honourable members those features of the .hospital benefits scheme that so suddenly have resulted in such a tremendous -difference in the running of hospitals and vvhich have been responsible for the provision of so many more beds. I suggest that, the Minister's statements in relation otherwise it would not receive any to that matter are consistent with his attitude during the whole history of the hospital benefits scheme. The right honorreferred to this matter at great length. able gentleman has taken a long time to present a tangible scheme to this comCourier-Mail that will support my committee and to the country, and he has adopted some extraordinary methods in doing so. I desire to apologize if I seem to be parochial, because I think that this chamber is not the place where the barrows of the States should be wheeled. I think, however, that as a Queenslander, I should be failing in my duty if before the conclusion of this debate I did not make some reference to the statements that, have been made by at least one other honourable member from Queensland since the introduction of the presenthospital benefits scheme. Nobody would know better than you, Mr Chairman, that the statements I shall now make are true. Whether you admit it is another matter. In spite of anything that might be said in relation to the present hospitalization system in Australia, for a long time Queensland and Tasmania were the only Statesthat had free hospitalization systems. The Queensland. Government was determined that nothing that the Minister for -Health or that the Menzies Government or that any other government might do would destroy the Queensland system. The federal Minister for Heaitn was determined that the position should bc exactly the opposite. The Queensland. Government was very happywith the Chifley Government's health scheme-o r the McKenna health scheme, as it has been described in this chamber-becaus e that scheme provided very clearly that no payment would be made to a hospital if a charge were made on a patient in by the present Minister for Health provided exactly the opposite, because it provided very clearly that no payment would be made unless a charge were made upon the patient. In spite of anything that might be said by the Minister or by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Pearce) about the position in Queensland, the Minister was determined that the Queensland Government should submit to his authority, assistance. The honourable member for Brisbane( Mr George Lawson) has I have here an editorial of the ments in relation to the Minister's attitude towards the position in Queensland. Mr Moore, the Queensland Minister for Health, deservesthe greatest possible credit for the fact that he resisted the right honourable gentleman, who was forced to make a complete capitulation. If evidence in support of my statement!-: is required it may be found in this editorial. I am sure that the honourable member for Capricornia would not at CUSP the Courier-Mail of having any sympathy with the Chifley Government or towards any other Labour government. The Courier-Mail stated in its editorialThe State Government is completely justified in refusing to abandon its free public hospital system in favour of .the Commonwealth paid scheme. Queensland's free public hospital's are splendid institutions and are an example to every other State in Australia.

239,Mr Ebmonds (Herbert) [9.13],"State Government has rejected this proposal and has decided to continue itspolicy of free treatment. As a result of this decision, the Commonwealth subsidy ceased from last Saturday, ancl the State will have to find another £1,000,000 a year to maintain its free public hospital*. The pressure tactics and the dog-in-the-manger attitude adopted by the Commonwealth are difficult to understand. While the Commonwealth will give no help to public hospitals in this State in future, it will continue to pay 12s. a day towards costs in private hospitals. As Mr Moore points out, it is farcical when the Commonwealth will pay £4 4s. a week to help people who can afford a private hospital but refuses to assist those who are compelled to use the public hospitals. Queenslanders have to pay the same taxes as thc people in other States and the Commonwealth seems to be committing a grave injustice in withdrawing the public hospital subsidy from this State because it prefers to continue its own system. Surely the fair and right thing to do would be to make the same allowance to all States and let them conduct their own hospital service in their own way. The Queensland Government did that precisely in spite of the attitude of the Minister for Health. The policy and the slogan of the Queensland Government in connection with its hospitals has been, in effect, "" There shall be beds for all who wish to use them and they shall be free "". J'f the Minister had had his way, those beds would not be free, but they are free and it is to the everlasting credit of the Queensland Government and the State Minister for Healthi n particular, that that position still exists in Queensland. honourable member's time has expired. for Health) [ 9 . 2 3 ] co the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds). There has been no agreement w i th any State which interferes with the right of that State to have free hospital beds. Every Statei n Australia can have free beds if it wants to do so. The Australian Government pays 8s. a day for every free bed in all States. That is a complete answer to the honourable member for Herbert. I invite honourable members to consider the position in Queensland and the views upon this matter of those who have been conducting Queensland's affairs f p r years. Mr Hanlon was Minister for Healthi n Queensland for eight years. For seven years he was Premier of Queensland, and a good one. He made this statement at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in 1945 about the scheme that the Chifley Government had wished on to QueenslandI maintain that tlie Commonwealth's scheme is fundamentally unsound. It provides for tlie payment of so -much by the Commonwealth for each patient but no contribution is to be' made towards the cost of those services whicli prevent people from going to hospital. Under the proposed scheme there will be nn influx into public wards of people who otherwise would be treated at home. Mr Hanlon had more to say at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in 1949 when Mr Chifley was trying to force the rotten scheme applying to mental institutions down the throats of the States. Unfortunately he succeeded and that scheme has gone from bad to worse. Mr Hanlon said at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in 1949J. do not suppose that any of the Premiers thinks hc can get it both ways. If the Commonwealth's hospital contribution is increased, that fact will be taken into consideration in lixing the general Commonwealth allocation to the States. There is a catch in this hospital benefits scheme and the States were foolish to enter thc agreement in its present form. Those are the words of Mr Hanlon. He, though dead, still speaks and his words should warn the honourable member for Herbert. Those comments are taken from the official record of the proceedings of the conferences. If the honourable member cares to read the official Order! The correspondence that passed between the Queensland Government and the present Australian Government, he w ill discover I give the lie direct that there was no attempt at compulsion at all. The Queensland Government was told at all times that if it would provide beds for all insured persons in Queensland an agreement would be signed and it could do as it liked about fees. It could charge the patients or not as it pleased. What did the Queensland Government do? It made a definite compact w i th the Australian Government to make available immediately many beds in country hospitals to enable insured persons lo occupy them. It also stated that so soon as the nurses' home in the Brisbane General Hospital was evacuated, it would be made available for paying patients. Further, the Queensland Government stated that it would give us 200 beds in",66,Pairs

241,Sir Earle Page (Cowper,"Ministe rthe South Brisbane Auxiliary Hospital which is being expanded at present. Every month, the Queensland Government is trying further to carry out its obligation to the Australian Government. That is based upon the understanding that if a man is willing to pay for service in hospital and makes provision for it while he is well, he should not have to compete with others to get a bed. In New South Wales, a realistic attibourne Hospital had a staff of 411 for tude was adopted and every hospital in New South Wales is showing a credit balance. For the first time in its history, ployed at the hospital, the ratio was then the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital has 3hown a credit balance. Instead of having to close 300 beds as it feared eighteen months ago it would have to do, it has been able to keep them open and equip them more adequately. The finances of the Sydney hospital have improved. The experience has been the same in Victoria and other places. I have recently visited various countries in otlier parts of the world. New hospitals are being built only where voluntary insurance schemes operate. That is the, experience in Switzerland, Holland and Belgium. In England the authorities are spending tremendous sums of money and they hoped to build hospitals, hut they have not been able to start one because of the huge cost of maintaining their health scheme which is financed from taxation, f n discussions that took place in 1944, 1945, 1949 and 1951 the States said that they required ISs. a day for each bed to enable them to break even financially. Under this scheme New South Wales is getting 24s., Western Australia 21s., Tasmania 21s. and Victoria ISs. Because they are getting that amount their finances have been placed upon a proper basis. We must not push the poor man out in order to let the wealthy man in. On the contrary we must give a fair deal to every person in the community. The statement made by the Minister for out-patients' sections and modern medical Health( Sir Earle Page) brings up the equipment which most hospitals do not question of rising medical costs. That possess. But that tendency is true the is a matter which this committee must world over. It was estimated by Lord consider, especially as it is discussing Beveridge that a scheme such as the group of clauses which relate to hosAneurin Bevan established in Great pital benefits. The rising cost of hosBritain would cost £170,000,000, but pitalization invalidates the Government's the actual cost has reached £400,000,000. administrative method of financing hospital benefits. There is an extremely interesting article by Dr. Byrne in the issue of the Medical Journal of Australia of the 7th March last, in which he gives comparative figures relative to the cost of hospitalization at the lioyal Melbourne Hospital and a picture of what is happening in hospitals everywhere. He pointed out that in 1925 the lioyal Mel397 beds. Including gardeners, kitchen attendants, and all other persons em103 staff to 100 beds. In 1952, the staff was 1,31S and the number of 'beds was 528. So, there is now a staff of 250 persons for every 100 beds. Dr. Byrne pointed out that there is a growing body of technicians, highly paid and in strong organizations, to maintain the new equipment at the hospital. There are now outpatient clinics, physiotherapists and all sorts of diverse medical personnel the like of which did not exist 27 years before, in 1925. A staff of 250 persons for every 100 beds involves a very much higher overhead cost than did a staff of 103 persons for every 100 beds. The development of medical service with its new techniques, is bringing into being armies of new technicians.' What is the effect of all of this on the ordinary income-earner? Here again, Dr. Byrne has given us some very illuminating figures. In 1925 the bed-cost at the Royal Melbourne Hospital was £3 17s. 2d. a week, and the basic wage was £4 17s. 6d. a. week. In other words, the weekly bed-cost was considerably less than the basic wage. Last year, the weekly bedcost at the Royal Melbourne Hospital was £25 9s. 2d., and the -basic wage was £11 Ss. In other words, as things stand at present, a person would have to pay more than two weeks' earnings at the basic wage in order to meet the cost of liis bed at that hospital. The Royal Melbourne Hospital, no doubt, has large",67,Pairs
242,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [9.30],"Dr. Byrne, in his article, rather deplores the suggestion, advanced for the purposes of propaganda, that this high cost is, somehow or other, due to socialist medicine in Great Britain which was extremely expensive, when he points out that a great rise has taken place in the cost of medical services, whether conducted privately or by governments. The fact that the cost of a bed in an Australian hospital is equal to two weeks' earnings of the basic wage shows really that the subsidies of Ss. and 12s. a day that we envisage in this Parliament do not form a major contribution to the cost of maintaining hospital beds. If Dr. Byrne's figures are correct-£2 5 9s. 2d. a bed a week in the Royal Melbourne Hospitalour subsidies of Ss. and 12s. a day make no tremendous contribution towards the cost. All the evidence appears to indicate rhat these costs will continue to rise. The Government would act wisely if it did everything possible to cut these administrative costs. As time goes on one of the greatest embarrassments we shall have to face in connection with this scheme will result from the tremendous number of administrations in the form of benefit societies, each maintaining separate staffs and all duplicating the work. Much as I respect the Government's attitude towards friendly societies, I"" believe that if we had a centralized financial system, more money would be available to meet the rising costs of hospitals. There is only one other matter that I should like to mention. It relates to clauses 39 and 44 (2.), in which mental patients are excluded from the purview of this bill. There are two subjects that the Commonwealth, throughout its 50 years of existence, has avoided like the plague. One is marriage and divorce, and the other is mental hospital treatment. I do not think that we can avoid them for ever. We are hiding behind the fact that the enactment of lunacy laws and the general treatment of the insane were vested in the States at the point of federation. I have met psychiatrists from overseas-som e of them have come here to take over our mental institutions -wh o have said that the treatment of the insane in Australia is years behind tliat of overseas countries. They have ifr. Beasley. said that whereas our general hospitals have kept pace with developments overseas, it is not true to say that our treatment of the mentally ill has done so.. The States are not in a position to meet' the cost involved. I do not condemn the Government for not having entered thefield because no Australian government has done so. But unfair burdens are cast upon families a member of which becomes mentally ill and has to be placed in one of these -institutions. Such persons have been generally debarred from social services benefits for a long period. Gradually thesebenefits are now being extended to them, but the Government in this measure still continues to stand out from making contributions to their welfare and recovery. Mental illness is likeany other illness. We should not continue to maintain a differentiation between the physically ill and the mentally ill. The Oommonwealth should enter the field and assist the families of mentally ill persons and help those institutions which deal with the insane. [9.39] -If there is any matter upon, which the Government deserves to be congratulated it is upon the provision of medical and hospital benefits. Such criticism as has 'been levelled at Queensland in this regard is not worthy of consideration. When the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) took over his portfolio the hospitals of Australia were"" in the red"" to an amount of £20,000,000, the public hospitals of Australia were overcrowded and wealthypersons occupied hospital beds while unfortunate sick people who did not have the means to pay for a bed frequently had' to wait for weeks for admission. Thepresent Government propounded a schemewhich has already remedied the desperate position of the great city hospitalsand has enabled them to augment their nursing and other staffs and' install thc most modern appliancesin public wards and private wards alike. This scheme will enable hospitals to extend their accommodation! and provide greater services for the people. In Queensland we are fortunate, because years ago the people-",68,Pairs
243,Mr Beenaed Coesee (Wide Bay),"built great hospitals in most of tbe cities and provincial towns. Public hospital facilities have not been increased -in areas in which the population has not increased. However, neither Queensland nor any other State could have provided its public hospital facilities but for the contribution that has been made available to it by the Australian Government in respect of each occupied bed. Only during the last week on the public platform, political opponents of this Government have claimed tliat it has refused to make assistance available to the Queensland Government because the latter refused to enter into an agreement with it. The Minister for Health has absolutely denied tliat claim. The Queensland Government is now receiving more revenue annually in the form of income tax reimbursement than it could jmssibly collect direct from taxation sources in that State. Incidentally, that is why that Labour Government is opposed to the return of the income tax power to the States. The Queensland Government was reluctant to become a party to the hospital benefits scheme because, primarily for. party propaganda purposes, the Government of that State contended that under that scheme it would have been compelled to vacate the public hospital field. That is contradicted by the fact that the scheme is now operating and the State public hospitals receive Ss. a day for each occupied bed. Under the new agreement, the Australian Government has .made available a total amount of £1,235,000 to Queensland in respect of occupied beds in public hospitals. The State is being helped to improve facilities in public hospitals because this Government has relieved it of the cost of hospitalization for age and invalid pensioners who are the most deserving section of the community. In addition, this Government provides free medical and pharmaceutical services for those pensioners. It pays to the hospitals in the State a subsidy of 12s. in respect of each bed that is occupied by a pensioner or his dependants. In view of those facts, a great blessing has been conferred upon the community. The provision by this Government of a subsidy at the rate of Ss. for each bed in public wards that is occupied by other classes of patients has already had the effect of relieving the congestion that previously prevailed in those wards. Consumptives who were a menace to mothers and infants in maternity wards and to other patients in public wards are now looked after in special institutions whose provision has beenfinancedby the Australian Government, which is also financing the major cost incurred in caring for those unfortunate sufferers. Under that scheme it is hoped that the dread disease of consumption will 'be obliterated within a few generations. Despite this assistance, the Queensland Government has constantly claimed for party propaganda purposes that it has been unjustly treated by the Australian Government, which has conferred a benefit to the sick people of Australia through this scheme of health insurance. That claim is belied by the enthusiasm with which the Australian people as a whole have co-operated in this scheme. To-day, over 5,000,000 persona in this country are eligible to receive benefit under the scheme. Tn return for a payment of a few shillings a week a man can insure himself, his wife and his children for all the benefits that are being provided under this scheme. At the same time, insured patients being members of approved societies are completely free to choose their own doctor. If necessary, they can be given medical attention in their own homes ancl the Australian Government subsidizes the transport costs of the doctors. As a result of that provision, the congestion that previously existed in public hospitals throughout Australia has been substantially relieved. I note with pleasure that the Labour Government in New South ""Wales has realized its responsibility in that respect and has taken action to comb out of public wards persons who have adequate means to pay a few pence in insurance premiums for hospital treatment. Under the New South Wales Labour Government scheme wealthy go-getters in the community are obliged to vacate beds in public wards. Thus, more beds are being made available for persons in the lower ranges of income, many of whom have been unable for years to obtain admission to public hospitals because of the congestion in public wards. Long before Labour governments came into power in the States, modern hospitals, containing public, intermediate and private wards, had been financed by public subscriptions. It is significant that since the present scheme was inaugurated, the Labour Government in Queensland will be able to extend facilities in private wards. That is one result of the financial assistance that this Government has made available to the States generally. Other remarkable results that it has produced include the provision of more skilful and extensive nursing staffs, greater and better facilities in hospitals generally and more skilful medical attention under improved conditions. Therefore, it cannot be said that the Queensland Government has been victimized in any way under this scheme. The citizens of that State will continue to share in the Australian Government's payment of 8s. a day whilst they are in hospital and those who wish may insure to have treatment in private wards or private hospitals. Nothing could be more calculated to produce a cynical reaction to this measure on the part of members of the Opposition than the statement made by the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) that under the bill the Government is doing something to help the poor. The fact is that under this scheme the difficulties of that section of the community have been increased immeasurably. Part V. of the bill is entitled ""Hospital benefits"", but it could be more appropriately entitled "" Hospital difliculties"". Eor the purposes of this scheme the Government haa entered into an agreement with the States, but it has refused to incorporate that agreement in this measure. If thai, were done every one would know whether or not a subsidy at the rate of 12s. is being provided in respect of every bed that is occupied by age and invalid pensioners in public institutions. The fact is. of course, that under sub-clause (2.) of clause 39 that benefit is denied to pensioners in certain instances. Consequently, the difficulties of those who are endeavouring to help that very worthy section of the community have been increased. The whole clause should be redrafted in order that adequate relief may be given to elderly persons in hospital. I consider that sub-clause (2.) should be deleted. It reads as follows:For tlie purposes of this Part, a convalescent home, benevolent home, home for the aged or orphanage or a part of such a home or of an orphanage which does not provide hospital treatment shall be deemed not to be a publie hospital or a private hospital. The definition of hospital treatment in sub-clause (1.) does not include the excellent treatment which is provided for elderly persons by many benevolent homes. I have a knowledge of this matter, because I have closely observed the Queen Elizabeth Benevolent Home in Ballarat, which has more than 600 inmates. Under the present plan, that institution is required to maintain a sick patient, who is completely unable to look after himself, for Ss. a day, which is £2 16s. a week. The operation of this scheme means that an aged person, as soon as he is moved into the infirmary of the home, loses £2 5s. 6d. of his pension of £3 10s. a week, which is retained by the Commonwealth. In its place a hospital benefit of £2 16s. a week, or Ss. a day, is paid to the institution. This minute extra payment of ls. 6d. a day is expected to cover all the expenses of hospitalization, which involve nursing expenses at the rate of 7s. 6d. a day, and various other expenses incurred in respect of persons who are virtually helpless. The Victorian Government is in a difficult position. It has commendably encouraged the removal of old. people to suitable homes in order to make proper use of hospital space. If no home for old people is available, the aged sick have to be cared for in public hospitals. That involves the use of valuable and wellequipped hospital space for people who, in point of fact, do not require it. The Canberra Community Hospital receive? the full Commonwealth payment of 12s. a day, or £4 4s. a week, and a pensioner who is an inmate also receives the full pension of £3 10s. a week, so that the hospital gets £7 14s. a week. However, the Queen Elizabeth .Benevolent Home, and similar institutions are required to provide the same kind of service for £2 16s. a week. The State induces the",69,Pairs
244,Mr Joshua (Ballarat) |'9.4s],"committees of benevolent homes to provide accommodation for the aged sick, and thereby reduces the pressure placed upon normal hospital facilities, but at the same time, it is called upon to bear an undue portion of the cost of treating such patients. The Victorian Minister for Health has asked the Commonwealth Minister whether he will support a proposal that infirmary wards of benevolent homes be deemed to be public hospitals, and that patients therein shall receive the full pension and the State shall get the full hospital benefit rate of 12s. a day, where the patient would qualify for it if he were in the ward of a public hospital. The Victorian Minister advised in 1952 that the Queen Elizabeth Benevolent Home and similar institutions had been approved a3 public hospitals for the purpose of receiving a payment of 8s. a day until a new agreement was negotiated. No new agreement has yet been made, and the benevolent homes are now experiencing great difliculties. A new agreement .should be negotiated, because the Victorian Government,, for one, certainly does not agree with the existing agreement. I can only point out, in the short time at my disposal, that the difficulties of homes of this kind are increasing year by year, and will not be eased by this bill. Tlie Queen Elizabeth Benevolent Home hacl a surplus of £3,914 in 1951, and deficits of £15,380 and £13,063 respectively in the two succeeding financial years. How can the Minister claim, with justification, the he has assisted such instito pay its way. I think that the Royal tutions when a surplus in 1951 is converted into deficits in 1952 and 1953? Obviously, he should make a new agreement with the States, and this bill should not be passed while clause 39 appears in its present form. This bill will increase the difficulties of wonderful organizations that are rendering a great service to the community, because they are relieving the general hospital system, and providing good hospitals for those who need them, and accommodation and every kind of comfort for elderly folk. The Labour party opposes this clause. An amendment has not been moved, because the clause should be redrafted. No honourable member should vote for this part of the bill in its present form. I hope that the Minister will carefully examine my statements, and prepare suitable amendments for insertion in the bill in the Senate. I know of no other way by which the interests of the aged people can be served. [9.55] -This amendment is not very substantial. The purpose is to provide that some pro forma shall be inserted in the bill in which the hospital agreement is contained. I merely point out that such a method was not adopted in the act of 1951, and that it was not called into question, or criticized, on that occasion. The purpose of this bill is to deal with principles, and once the agreement was inserted in the bill, amending legislation would be required whenever the agreement was to be varied. Surely no honourable member wishes to go to all that trouble. I now desire to say something about the provision of hospital services, and 1 shall deal first with the quite substantial points made by the honourable member for Eremantle ( Mr Beazley). I , too. had the advantage of reading the article by Dr. Byrne. It is a fact that hospital costs have risen tremendously for the reasons outlined by the honourable member for Fremantle, which include additional staff and technicians, costly equipment, and rising wages. Nonetheless, it is also a fact that since this agreement has been in operation, the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital has moved from a condition of insolvency to a state of being able Prince Alfred Hospital is even larger than the Royal Melbourne Hospital. The honourable member for Fremantle also suggested that a central organization should be established to handle finances, instead of allowing them to be handled by friendly societies and similar bodies. I confess that the idea of reducing costs by the establishment of a government department is certainly novel to me. It is unlikely that costs will be reduced in that way, but I admit that the final answer to the hospital problem has not yet been found in Australia or elsewhere. The problem is certainly big, and mental hospitals, convalescent homes, homes for the aged, and provision for orphans are a part of it.",71,Pairs
245,Dr. Donald Cameeon (Oxley),"Thait bringsme. toj the. remarks of the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr wealth in precisely the same terms, as Joshua), who-ha* said that this bill will aot help the poor. I believe that honors able members would do well to. disabuse their minds of such an idea. This bill, provides substantially more money for the hospital system, and thereby makes more beds available. Poor persons in every State are not required, to pay for hospitalization if they cannot afford to do so, and, therefore,, the scheme will assist them. More beds will be made available to the public hospital system, because more money is to be provided for public hospitals. The scheme makes it easier for private hospitals to carry on, because many people who would otherwise occupy beds in public, hospitals will be attracted, to private hospitals. accommodation will be available to people in poor circumstances. Therefore, it. is perfect nonsense to say that the bill does nothing to help the poor. The idea that all hospital beds sbould be provided free of charge everywhere should receivecareful attention. There is no such thing as the provision of a service free, of charge.; If the State is to "" Free hospital beds for a l l "" , but it.= provide hospital beds free of charge to the public, it must meet the costs hy the imposition, of taxation... Therefore, when honourable members opposite say that there should be no insurance scheme, and that everything should be free, what tliey really mean is that taxes should be increased. This scheme does not proceed on that basis. It proceeds on the basis of insurance,, and in so doing it inflicts uo hardship on those who cannot provide money for insurance. In fact, it assists them.. I remind the House that it is not possible to do everything at -once. Let no one imagine that it is possible to bring public hospitals, mental hospitals, convalescent homes, orphanages snd private hospitals into line in one great, scheme immediately. ThatI would characterize as precipitancy and, of course, precipitancy is the promise of the quack. It is not the principle upon which responsible parliamentarians or responsible governments can or should proceed. In conclusion I wish to say a few words, about free hospitals in Queensland. Queensland was given an opportunity to Dr. Donald Oameron. make an agreementwith the Commonthose offered to the other States-.. It. w,as at. all stages within the power of the Queensland Government either to charge for beds or not to charge for them. Thi} other States decided that a charge would be made, and Queensland decided that hospitals would be free. Adelaide. is so. it adds weight to my argument. The States had power to make their own decisions. It is pure kite-flying for the Queensland Government or any of it* supporters in this chamber to say that. Queensland was forced to do anything. So, increased Queensland was not forced any more than was South Australia which, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide has pointed out, has adopted a course similar to that pursued by Queensland. The display of histrionics given by the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds) to-night was sheer nonsense. He claimed that the Queensland Government had a grandiloquent slogan, something like real aim is to keep all the money it get? from the Commonwealth Governmentit does not raise its own taxes-and then claim credit for providing free hospital beds which, in fact, it does not do. wish to .bring to the notice of the committee certain aspects of clause 39 and] to associate myself with the remarks of the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua). Sub-clause (2.) of clause 39 prohibits convalescent homes, benevolent homes, homes for the aged and orphanages from being deemed to be public hospitals. I wish to make a strong appeal to the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) for more generous treatment of the infirmary sections, of benevolent homes and homes for the aged. As the honourable member for Ballarat has pointed out, the Gommonwealth at present pays to the Sta.tes 12s. a day in respect of occupied beds in public hospitals. However, the payment in respect of infirmaries or benevolent homes and homes for the aged is only 8s. a day. That means, of course, that in respect of each patient, such",72,Pairs

248,Mr Clarey (Bendigo)' [10.4],".1 .institutions are 4s. a day or f l 8s. a week worse off than are public hospitals. Apparently the regulations as they ---tard to-day are administered in accordance with an agreement with the States in which provision is made for different payments. It will be agreed by all honourable members. I am sure that inmates of benevolent homes and homes for the aged are usually people who, through force of circumstances, have not been able to contribute to insurance schemes. They are old and infirm. Most of them are pensioners. Whilst an inmate is able to walk about, the home, I understand, receives £2 5s. 6d. of his pension, but immediately a pensioner goes into the infirmary, although the cost of caring for him increases tremendously, his pension ceases and the payment to the home is increased by only 10s. a week. I hope that the Minister will examine this matter to see what can be done. Surely when a patient enters an infirmary of a home the Commonwealth's subsidy should not be less than that payable in respect of patients in public hospitals. In the course of several statements, the overcrowded. According to the last VicMinister has made it clear that as a consequence of the Government's national health scheme, the financial position of public hospitals has been substantially improved. That is not true of benevolent homes or homes for the aged. There are two benevolent homes in my electorate. One is in Bendigo itself and the other at Castlemaine. In both of those homes are many people who, because of age and illness, are confined to the infirmaries, sometimes for long periods. This, of course, enables public hospitals which otherwise would have to care for those people to provide more accommodation for patients suffering from acute illnesses ancl for accident cases. Therefore, the benevolent homes are relieving the strain on our public hospitals. I regret to point out to the Minister that both the benevolent homes in my electorate are in the same position as that to which the honourable member for Ballarat referred. In view of the service that such homes are rendering, it seems to me most desirable that they should be placed on the same basis as public hospitals in regard to the Commonwealth's subsidy. This is very hard to deal with in an amendment If. -[18 ] because the problem can be handled better by agreement with the States than by legislative action. However, I assure the Minister that he can greatly improve the situation of benevolent homes and homes for the aged, particularly in relation to their infirmaries. I hope that he will give serious consideration to my representations on this subject. In the brief period still available to me I support the remarks of tlie honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) on the exclusion of mental hygiene establishments from the provisions of the bill. It is unfortunate and regrettable that neither State legislation nor Commonwealth legislation acknowledges the importance of the need for adequate finance for such institutions. Modern scientific thought on the subject of mental illnesses is based on the conclusion that four beds in mental hospitals are needed for every 1,000 persons in the community. The reports that have been published by New South. Wales and Victorian mental hygiene authorities indicate clearly that every one of our mental hospitals is torian report, the number of beds in mental hospitals in that State represents one for every 3S1 persons in the community. All reports disclose gross over-' crowding and inability to provide the sort of surgical and medical attention that the patients need. Existing buildings cannot be used to the best curative advantage, and, generally speaking, the latest healing methods cannot be employed because of the lack of medical staff, equipment and accommodation. The last Victorian report also mentioned the important fact that a young person who becomes an inmate of a mental institution and is not cured costs the community, over his lifetime, as much as £25,000. honourable member's time has expired. for Health) [10.13] -The situation of convalescent homes, homes for the aged, and other institutions to which the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua) and the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) have referred stems from the legislation that was passed in 1946. in",73,Pairs

Unfortunately, we could not do anything about them until we had extricated the ordinary hospitals from their mess. The remarks made by the honourable member for Bendigo on the subject of mental hospitals were absolutely right. The real trouble is the terrible overcrowding in such institutions, which arises from the lack of adequate capital finance for the construction of proper buildings. That is one reason why, during the last four years, I have tried to persuade the State governments to jettison existing agreements and undertake long-range plans. I shall continue to give my attention to this problem. Unfortunately, when I spoke earlier on the subject of the hospital services in Queensland, I forgot to deal with the amendment moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser). Agreements with the States were made under the hospital benefits legislation of 11945, which provided power for the Government, by executive act, to make such agreements. That power was continued by the 1951 legislation. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro will notice that eiause 40 provides(J.) The Commonwealtli may enter into an agreement with a State for ond in relation to the provision of hospital benefits, at such rates, and subject to such conditions, as are specified in the agreement, in respect of persons fully resisted the Government's proposals who are qualified patients in public hospitals iu that State. (2.) An agreement under the.last preceding section docs not have effect unless and until it has been approved hy the Parliament. That will be the position in the future, ancl the position that has existed since 1946 will, be corrected. My law officers have advised me that the effect of the amendment, if adopted, would be to wipe fiir Marie Page. ov.t the present agreements with the Slates. The sub-clauses of clause 3S arc really saving provisions to hold existing agreements in force. Nothing would be gained by adopting the amendment. The agreements woulcl merely be abolished. They have been in force for as long as two and a half years in some instances. There would be no advantage in inserting in this bill agreements that would become ineffective under its terms in the adequately. Government stands condemned for the deterioration in thefinancesof public hospitals throughout Australia. It stood by in idle incompetence while uncontrolled inflation forced the cost of hospital administration to disastrous levels. It refused to increase the Commonwealth hospital benefit rate of Ss. a day for each patient in public wards, which was fixed by the Chifley Labour Government in 194S and was payable subject to the condition that there should be no charge to the patient. This Government obstinately held to that rate throughout the Three highly inflationary years that succeeded its accession to office. Late in 1952 it offered an additional payment of 4s. a day for each patient in public wards, subject to tbe conditions that the hospital should charge the patient not less than ISs. a day and that the patient should he privately insured at his own expense for a benefit of at least 6s. a day. This Government, which professed to be eager to abolish the means test, thus enforced its re-introduction in public hospitals. State governments, restricted in their finances, were coerced, despite their protests, into accepting the niggardly and inadequate additional benefit of 4s. a day. Only the Labour Government of Queensland, which had some financial reserves upon which to draw, successto force the re-introduction of the iniquitous means test in its public hospitals. The Menzies Government, which withheld from Queensland for months even the original benefit of Ss. a day for each patient, was forced finally to give way and to restore that paltry benefit. As every honourable member knows, the Queensland Government, which formerly",74,Pairs
251,Mr Fuller (Hume) [10.17],"Thisprovided treatment in public hospitals in that State free of a means test, has been denied by the present calamitous Australian Government the additional benefit of 4s. a day in relation to patients in those hospitals. That is a gross injustice to the Queensland Government. The present Government coerced the State governments into re-introducing the means test in connection with treatment in public wards, and it has exerted pressure on the State governments to compel members of the community to insure against hospital charges. This Governnient has made only an insignificant and conditional contribution to the finances of public hospitals. In doing so, it has rereminding the committee that this Gomoved the financial burden of serious illness from the Government, where it properly belongs, on to the backs of the unfortunate sick people themselves. A l though the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) has repeatedly denied that this Governnient forced the State governments to re-introduce the means test in connection with treatment provided in the public wards of public hospitals, one has only to read regulation No. 41 of the Public Hospital Benefit Begulations, issued by the Minister in August, 1952, in order to realize the falsity of his denials. That regulation makes the payment of the additional benefit of 4s. a day conditional on the hospitals charging their in-patients at least 18s. a day. Many complaints have been made against the operation of the regulation by persons of moderate means throughout Australia who are unable to pay large public hospital accounts that they have incurred through prolonged illnesses. I assure the people of this country that a future Labour government will take early steps to relieve the sick members of the community from charges for treatment in public wards of public hospitals and that, subject to efficient bospital administration, adequate contributions will be made to the public hospitals to enable them to defray the cost'of providing such services. At the same time, however, a future Labour government will encourage the people of this country to effect hospital insurance in order to offset additional financial strain should their normal incomes cease due to illness. This Government deserves severe censure for the present financial position of the public hospitals of this country. It .stands condemned for its inadequate provision of social services. I am sure that the result of the forthcoming by-election in the Division of Gwydir will show clearly that the Government no longer possesses the confidence of the people of this country. The Australian Labour party looks forward with confidence to the result of that by-election. lionorable member should confine his remarks to the clause. further to add to my remarks, beyond vernment destroyed the excellent hospital benefits scheme that was introduced by the previous Labour Government. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) stated that the contributions that are made by this Government to hospital finances are insufficient to defray their running expenses. Apparently the Opposition has lost sight of the fact that it is necessary that every part of d national health plan must be sound for the scheme as a whole to be successful. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which was introduced by tliis Government, has been of considerable benefit to both the hospitals and their patients. It has resulted in a vast increase of hospital income, and a considerable saving in hospital beds. Hospital managements throughout Australia have expressed their appreciation of these benefits. Many of them have stated that, for the first time in their history, they have been able to'meet their running expenses from income. According to a recent press report, there are now, for the first time, empty beds in tuberculosis sanatoriums in Victoria. This is evidence of the success of the scheme. Important results have made themselves manifest already. The scheme has been accepted by the people of this country. allotted for the consideration of clauses 3S to 45 has expired.
