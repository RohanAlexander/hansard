2,Mr Poynton,"Last ThursdayIfche Postal department are not being carried on, but the Minister for Home Affairs assured me, and afterwards proved to my satisfaction, that they had been sanctioned, and that he knew of no cause for delay. I have since ascertained, however, that although the works have been appro\ed of, no money is available for carrying them out. I wish now to ask the Minister if he will see that the money is forthcoming. member spoke to me the other day about this matter, and gave me a list of some works in South Australia which had not been carried out. Next day I showed him a letter which had been written on the 2nd December, addressed to the Works department of South Australia, approving of the carrying out of these works, and asking that they be put in hand. The money is available, and if the department will carry out the works it will be paid the moment the amounts are due. Previously, the money spent upon such works was paid only at the head office of the Treasury in Melbourne, but under the new arrangement it will be paid in South -Australia by the officers who are appointed for that purpose undernewregulations which have been issued. It is nonsense to say that there is no money. I should not approve of tlie carrying out of the work, and send a letter to the department asking them to carry it out, unless I was prepared at the time to obtain the money from the Treasury. from the Minister representing the Postmaster-General if money is available for connecting certain persons in the country with the telephone system. I have received communications from persons desiring to be so connected, stating that they had been informed from head-quarters that the connexions cannot be made because no funds are available. where persons have paid for the accommodation the honourable member speaks of, authorized the necessary expenditure to be made out of the Treasurer's advance vote, pending the passing of the Estimates. Without knowing the particulars of the know if the attention of the Prime Minister cases to which the honourable member refers, has been drawn to a report that five I cannot give him any further information coloured men deserted from the steam-ship at the present time, but if he will furnish me with such particulars I will look into the matter.

Minister for Defence if he can make arrangements, such as have been previously made by the Victorian Government, to ' allow men wishing to volunteer for service in South Africa to be examined .and provisionally passed at certain centres in the country, and thus save them the expense of coming to Melbourne. A t the present time all applicants for enrolment are notified that they must attend at the Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, and as most of the volunteers come from the country, this arrangement is frequently a source of great hardship, because men come to town, and may then be rejected. provide railway fares for thein. pressed by the honourable member is much in accord with that which I hold myself. I think that in an enrolment such as is going on throughout Australia at the present time, every facility should be given to those who desire to present themselves for examination to do so at the least I wish to know possible expense, and I gave instructions to that effect long ago. In Victoria, however, owing to its circumscribed area, or for some other reason, the system of centralization seems to have found great favour. I shall take carethat the wish expressed by the honourable member is given effect to. My opinion is that the best way to obtain the class of men we require for South Africa is to give every facility to persons living in the country districts to enrol without expense to themselves.

Afterwards, however, it was thought by the military authorities and the Mayor of Adelaide. approved of the action of the GovernMr Cohen, that it would not, perhaps, be proper for such proceedings to take place. Accordingly, ment What the House did was something the Minister for Defence was telegraphed to for quite different. AlthoughI have no fault instructions. Colonel Stuart, chief staff officer, has received the follo\ying telegram from Sir John Forrest:A'e meeting convened by mayor, approve of contingent, officers, and men of local forces parading and marching to Townhall, take part demonstration. PleaseI have no information inform mayor. A t the present moment I do not know how far that telegram is authentic and conveys the exact directions of the Minister. Whatever our feelings may be in regard to the conduct Â©f the war in South Africa, or as lain on behalf of the British Government, we must admit that it is in the highest degree reprehensible that members of the militaiy forces as such should be directed by the Minister for Defence to attend a public meeting of the character of that to be held in Adelaide to-night. I think that the right honourable gentleman has allowed his feelings in this matter to outrun his discretion. It is reminiscent of the time of Cromwell aindfcheLong Parliament to hear of the military being marched into a meeting to give tone and colour to its proceedings. Whetheri t fee popular I take this action or unpopular, I emphatically protest against the authority of the Government being invoked for the attendance of the military at political meetings, except for the purpose of preserving order. No one would urge the slightest objection to the members of the military forces attending the meeting as individual members of the community, but that the Minister should use his power to direct their attendance in force, and to a certain extent give a colour to the proceedings which they might not otherwise have, is, to my mind, altogether improper. does the otherwise have ""1 action is likely to be taken ^ in this the despatch of the contingent.

17,Mr Watson,"The House has not to find with the action of the Government in that regard, we have a right to allow the utmost freedom in the expression of opinions concerning that action, of the war in South Africa. It ill becomes us, who claim liberty in the fullest degree, and who affirm that we have regard for the honestly-held opinions of others, to attempt to force our own views down their throats. What reason can be urged for the action of the Minister except that he wishes to give colour to the proceedings of this political meeting t If this were a meeting to raise fuads for widows and orphans left destitute by the war, I should not raise my voice against the authorization of the attendance of troops at it , and I think that every honourable member would say that anything that would add eclat to the proceedings of such a meeting would be justifiable.

Doubtless he will pretend to know something about it after his inexcusable action in sending these men to the meeting tonight, but at present he knows nothing about it . about it . misunderstood in this matter. I do not care if tlie people of South Australia are unanimous to a man-that does not affect the principle I am protesting against to-day. I desire to keep clear of all controversy as far as the war itself is concerned, and even as to the duty of the Government in respect of the despatch of the contingent. All that I consider is beside the question at issue, which really amounts to this : whether the Government of the day, or any Government, 27 A z have a right to interfere with the proceedings of the military, from a political standpoint; whether they are to compel thenattendance afc meetings the proceedings of amd concerning the conduct which are, to say the least of them, always a matter of opinion. ADy one must admit that it is a matter of opinion whether Mr Chamberlain has conducted the war in the best possible way. It is a matter of opinion whether the people of Australia, as a whole, approve of the attitude of the present Ministry in that regard. That has to be argued out in the ordinary course of political affairs. But I contend that the Ministeifor Defence, or any other gentleman occupying his position, is false to the trust reposed in him if he uses that position to prejudicethe feeling offchepeople of South Australia.

The honourable member seems to think that I have of my own initiative gone out of my way to order the military forces of South Australia to attend some demonstration. As a matter of fact that is very far away from the mark. ThePremier of South Australia, and the Mayor of Adelaide, have both been in communication with the Government with regard to the loyal demonstration which they propose to make to-night; and they desired that the members of the contingent who are in camp at the present time, and who havevolunteered fco go to the war in SouthI do not wish to be Africa-wh o have, in fact, pledged thenlives to the service of their country-shoul d be permitted to take part in the demonstration.

MrM c DONALD statement under the circumstances. But when any persons attack me in a similar manner I shall not be docile, and shall give it to them back as well as I can. The action of the Ministeri n this case has done a good deal to damage the Government in the estimation of all right-thinking men. The men who form the contingent which it is intended to despatch to South Africa, now that they are enrolled, belong to the Imperial forces, and one of the strongest points of discipline in the army is, that those belonging to it shall abstain from taking part in political meetings. The Minister for Defence ought to know that what I say is correct, and if he had allowed his mature judgment instead of his personal feeling to rule in this matter, and had realized the position in which these men were placed, and his duty, I make bold to say that he would not have allowed them to take part in the political meeting to-night. Whatever the right honourable gentleman may think, or whatever other people may think, has nothing to do with the matter. We know that over a third of the members of the House of Commons were returned as opponents of the policy of the British Government in connection with the conduct of the war. We know, further, that a large number of people in Australia are also opposed to the conduct of the war, and these facts in themselves should have been sufficient to deter any Government from allowing the military forces to take part in a political meeting. A t one time it was not safe for any man who held an opinion adverse to the carrying on of the war to walk down the street; and here we have the Government practically urging certain soldiers to take part in a meeting where airy one who had sufficient courage to speak against the terms of the motions would probably meet with violent treatment, and the soldiers would probably assist in the riot that would ensue. That is practically the position of the Government in the matter. If there should be any trouble at this meeting, the soldiers would be just as much at liberty as any one else to take part in any riot, and any unfortunate victims whom they might happen to fall foul of would have no redress whatever. Have we not seen many instances of that during the war, when have a military force at all, it should be I shall withdraw my kept entirely free from party politics. As I have said before, I have no feeling against any one who differs in opinion from me, because that is his business. I hold my own opinion, and no one has any right to coerce me into saying or doing what I do not regard as right. A number of those who are opposed to us, unfortunately, do not take up the same attitude ; but they are trying to secure the attendance of the soldiers at this meeting, and thus to give it a colour which would otherwise not attach to it. Isi t not the fact that several of the men who are to take part in thismeeting will be seeking parliamentary honours in the course of a month or two, and that the whole meeting has been organized to assist certain people to secure a place in political life 1 I am informed On very good authority that it is a well-known fact. has the honourable member for making that statement ?

Probably the Minister for Defence may find similar instances in his political career before it closes. , them up to the present time. MrM c DONALD right honourable gentleman has fooled the electors of Western Australia fairly well. I believe that in tliis case the Government have committed a grave blunder, and that upon more mature consideration they would not have allowed the military to take part in the demonstration which is to be held to-nighb. I hope thab the action which has been taken in this House will prove I a warning to the Government in the future. there is no honourable member who more thoroughly approves of the policy of the Imperial Government in Soubh Africa bhan I do. There is no one who desires more loyally bhan I do bo see the war brought to a successful conclusion. But in dealing with bhe affairs of this Commonwealth we must deal with matters by themselves. The honourable member for Bland there was a has brought a very serious question before the House. We may establish a new order of things in this Commonwealbh, bub before we do so it He mow tells us that he had is wise that we should think the matter over. In bhe old country, as we all know, bhe army was looked upon by the people of England for many centuries with the gravest suspicion. It was regarded as a sort of engine of oppression to be used by the ruling power, and it was under such circunistainees that tine life of the military power was practically limited from year to ; 1 year. This fact evidences how keen was the feeling and how great was the dread of any interference by the military in tlie free expression of public opinion. We all know that in Australia at this time of day there can be none of these substantial fears. But although we need not be so frightened, nervous, or jealous as the people in England were, and perhaps still are, I think the traditional rule which has kept bhe enrolled I admit that, to a military of Great Britain severely away from public meetings of all kinds is a salubary one which should nob be broken, and which should be esbablished without any doubt in this Commonwealth. As the honourable member for Bland has said, there can be no possible objection bo members of bhe military force attending public meetings as private citizens. But I may say bhat I know of no previous case New South Wales,. I think.

62,Mr Reid,"If this were a meeting ofto the ground absolutely, because that would not be a political gathering. Surely some difference exists between a meeting which is called to do honour to the soldiers of the country on their return from a war, or prior to their proceeding to a war, and a demonstration at which men are to be allowed to say ""Yes"" or "" No "" to declarations of public confidence in a certain policj'. Surely we are not going to fall so low in dealing with these matters as not to draw a distinction between the two things. A meeting convened to do honour to volunteer soldiers before they depart for South Africa is one which, in my opinion, is absolutely devoid of any political significance. I do not care how many patriotic meetings are held similar to that which I am glad to see is about to be held in Adelaide. But I have too just a sense of bhe value of an expression of opinion by a public meeting in a British community to think thab bhe parading of an armed force bo abbend that meeting will add to the weight of the decisions at which it arrives. The more we keep a body which marches at bhe word of command away from the free ventilation of public opinion the better will it be for all parties. We all know that in the case of elections the authorities are so keenly anxious to keep the military element out of sight thab bhey are always confined bo barracks upon an election day. Ab least that has been the practice followed in every town of which I have any knowledge. These -are wise rules which promote the security, comfort, and stability of our great British communities. . We honour our soldiers; we are ready to attend any number of meetings to. admire them and wish them God-speed; bubif bhose gatherings are to partake of a political character, and if a test of the opinion of the community is bo be baken by means of resolutions, I say that a parade of soldiers at such gatherings is a grave mistakea gross blunder. We all know that the Minister for Defence is incapable of making any mistake save one of judgment. Buti t now appears that the action which has been sanctioned has risen to the importance of a Cabinet decision upon the subject, and I feel some difficulty in dealing with it in the absence of precise information. StillI do not suppose that a military officer has fabricated a telegram bo bhe aubhoribies in Adelaide. mitted to be true. practically admits what the honourable member for Bland has said, namely, that the contingent is to be inarched to the meeting as a military body. nob say bhab. I quite appreciate in matters of this sort the inconvenience of dealing with them upon mere ex pa/rte statements or communications which we have no fair chance bf weighing or testing. Under the circumstances I do not at present propose to say anything more than that if it is proved after investigation that the statements made are accurate, I shall consider that a serious error has been committed, and it will be necessary in some way or other to provide against its repetition. I think it is of vital importance that our public meetings shall always be free from the colour of military force in any shape or form. which I expressed in this House a little while ago with regard to the war in South Africa will, I dare say, acquit me of any lack of patriotism in connection with this matter. I am well aware bhat bhe parby to' which I belong is usually accused of a lack of patriotism. But that is altogether apart from bhe quesbion. We have no business ab the present time to consider whether the war is right or wrong. It does not concernus whether the majority of the people of Adelaide, or the whole of the people of that city, are in favour of the suggestion' which has been acted upon, by the Minister for Defence. What we have to consider is whether the Government are justified in permitting an organized milibary force to attend a political meeting. I think the Government would look in vain bo bhe old country for any precedent in this connection. In spite of the very pronounced feeling of the people of the mother-land in regard to the present war, I feel sure thab no such attempt as that which is under discussion would ever have been seriously considered. I am convinced that Mr Chamberlain himself would be the very last man to tolerate a departure from what has always been recognised as a necessary condition of political freedom.

MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). I read with some considerable interest the telegrams from the military authorities in Adelaide, and the replies of the Minister for Defence. AlthoughI do not any pro-Boer utterances in the past, or of anything else than a thoroughly patriotic attitude throughout my political career, I am of opinion that a grave error of judgment has been committed by the Minister for Defence in sanctioning the parade of the contingent, or of military forces, in South Australia on such an occasion. An expression of opinion by the citizens of Adelaide, or those who lead them, in refer*ence to the slanders on the British troops, and those matters which have been so ably alluded to in the House by the Prime Minister with the hearty approval of honormean % able members, requires no military pageant. Those who suggested such an exhibition in South Australia were very ill advised, as was shown by the fact that the military authorities there deemed it necessary, to appeal to the Minister for Defence for his approval or disapproval -That showed there was a grave doubt, and very rightly so, in the minds of the military authorities. doubtful. MrV . L . SOLOMON -No doubt the Mayor was doubtful.' Sir JOH N PORREST -The Mayor say so ; he was very anxious that the troops troduce the question of parties, or be led should attend. MrV . L . SOLOMON -No doubt all those concerned were somewhat troubled as to whether it was proper to introduce the military contingent on an occasion when a mere expression of opinion was to be given by the citizens. The expression of opinion follows on the sentiments which were expressed so abty in the resolutions submitted to this House and afterwards transmitted by cable to England, conveying our disapproval of the slanders of the continental press, and our absolute approval of what had been done by all branches of the British army. It is quite sufficient for the people in Adelaide, Melbourne, or any other city of the States, to-take action similar to that of this House. We did not want the troops to parade here before we passed the resolutions, and I do not see why such a parade is necessary in South Australia. The members of the contingent are picked and sworn as soldiers of the Empire, and are not supposed to take part in any party politics or have any opinion on questions of this kind, which are for the consideration of others. ber call these party political resolutions t MrV . L . SOLOMON-They are resolutions of such a character that no branch of the British army in England would be paraded to assist in passing them at a public meeting. ber call them party political resolutions? Mr V. L. SOLOMON -What does the honourable member mean by "" party political resolutions % "" MrV . L . SOLOMON -Thes e are' undoubtedly political resolutions, inasmuch as public opinion is not absolutely unanimous in Australia on this question. Much as some of us may pride ourselves on our patriotic feeling, there are sections of the community throughout the length and breadth of Australia who have gauged all these questions raised by the South African war, and who are not so absolutely patriotic and unanimous as we are. Their opinions are entitled to a certain amount of respect. honourable member belong 1 lid not MrV . L . SOLOMON I shall not in' astray b}' the honourable member into such a controversy. WhatI say is that even in Australia there are sections of the community who consider that there are two sides to the question of the South African war, while other sections consider there is only one, namely, the patriotic side. I belong to the latter section ; but, at the same time, I do not desire to belittle tliose on the other side. The further we keep military demonstrations of this kind away from expressions of opinion by the citizens of any State, or city in any State of the Commonwealth, the better it will be for us.",21,Forrest I Withdraw Mr Feeling Has Run Most High I F We Are To

The Government know that on all questions of patriotic sentiment I am as absolutely with them as is any honourable member who sits behind the Ministry. I do not wish this to be made in any way a party question, but with all humility and sincerity I suggest to the Government that a mistake has been made, and that it is expedient and wise that these men, who have been sworn in as soldiers of the Empire to serve their King and country, should not be allowed to enter into political affairs, for, after all, this is a political expression of opinion, if a patriotic expression, whatever the honourable member for Laanecoorie may say. We do not want our soldiers, whether belonging to the volunteers or to the contingents, to be mixed up in questions of this kind. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Not as soldiers. We do not want our contingents marched up to give eclat to a demonstration, although those concerned in the latter may be as perfectly sincere as we were in this House when dealing with the same question. able member would object to the parade on Mafeking day t MrV . L . SOLOMON Does the honourable member for Melbourne wish to drag such a question into this debate? All I have done has"" been to suggest that the Ministry have made a mistake, but a mistake which can be rectified. The demonstration is to take place to-night, and within ' half-an-hour the reconsidered opinion of the Cabinet might, as already suggested, be sent to Adelaide, indicating that it is inadvisable that the contingent, which, under such peculiar circumstances, has been dragged into the matter, should take any part in it . I think the bulk of honourable members on both sides, utterly irrespective of whether they are Opposition or Government supporters, agree that we do not want to make this a party question. A mistake has been made which we are perfectly willing to treat as a mere error of judgment, and if the Government act wisely as their friends on both sides of the House would wish, tliey will rectify the mistake by cancelling their approval, and thus prevent any friction in the future in regard to such questions. I have hitherto been a Government supporter, and I should be very sorry if any political capital were made by the Opposition out of any blunder of Ministers in connection with this question. political capital out of this; we would rather do it some other way. gard to the fact that the leader of the Opposition has seemed to many anxious to pose before the country as even more eager than are the Government to press on the policy of extermination or submission, against the Boers. To my mind, it is interesting to observe the dispute amongst the advocates of the war as to which of them should get the kudos for interfering. As regards the motion that has been introduced by the honourable member for Bland, his contention is absolutely correct. I have before me the King's Regulations for 1893, section 6, clause 11, and I have also before me the Victorian regulations, clause 9 of part 9, which I suppose are pretty much the same as in the other States. In the King's Regulations the words are thesehonorOfficers, wan-ant officers, non-commissioned officers, and private soldiers are forbidden to institute or take part in any meetings, demonstrations, or processions for party or political purposes in barracks, quarters, or camps, or their vicinity. Under no circumstances, whatever, will they attend any such meeting, wherever held, in uniform. That is perfectly explicit. Fortunately the people in Australia have no experience of the dangers which attend military demonstrations and military appearances. Mr O'MALLEY -They have in America. selves to Australia, which is quite enough at this time. Suppose, for instance, there were a meeting held in Adelaide of the scandalous nature of the meeting in Birmingham a few weeks ago, when a man was killed, and a Member of Parliament was attacked physical^. If , at that meeting, there were certain troops present under the orders of the Minister of Defence, how could these troops, brought there with a view to help the demonstration on one side, be expected to act properly and fairly in keeping the peace afterwards 1 The Victorian regulation is as follows :Members of the force are not individually or collectively to attend political nicotine's or join in",22,Forrest I Withdraw Mr Feeling Has Run Most High I F We Are To

AVe, in Australia, happily, do not know what militarism is, and I take it that we ought at least to see that we surround our troops with precautions equal to those which surround the troops in the old country, where the experience of centuries has taught what should be done. If there is anything this House should be careful to guard against, it is that no party, no clique, no body of men, shall use our soldiers for their own purposes and advancement. AVe must keep the military absolutely above -and beyond all party political purposes. I heard this afternoon, for the first time, that there is political capital sought to be made by some men prominent in connection with this meeting. right honourable gentleman would not have lent himself to the movement if he had thought so. I do not believe that he would have lent himself in the slightest degree to help the career of any party, or even of any political supporter, in this way, if he had known that he was doing so. But the mere fact that it has been suggested that he did shows tlie danger which arises out of such action. There is nothing about which we should be more careful than the avoidance of even the appearance of evil in these matters. The right honourable gentleman has his honest and genuine opinions upon the war, and would like to do all in his power to promote it . But, on the other hand, there are many people-and he would be surprised if he knew how many-who , rightly or wrongly, are against the war. I appeal to him not to allow his high power in connection with the military forces of Australia to be made use of in this way. As I understand the matter, he has been asked to allow the South Australian members of the contingent which has volunteered for service in South Africa, and also members of the permanent forces, to parade at a public meeting in Adelaide. His instructions that they may do so practically amount to the coercion of every man in the force who does not wish to be present. out, because we know how great would be the moral pressure that would be put upon them if they tried to absent themselves. I should like a specific statement from the Prime Minister that there has been an inadvertent inattention to the King's Regulations, and to the duties of the military forces, and' that this thing, is not to happen. I think it would not be too much to ask that a telegram be sent at once intimating that the permission for the troops to attend has been recalled. This is a meeting for a political purpose, becaiuse it is a party question whether the conservatives or the liberals in the old country are right, and whether it is or is not advisable to persist in killing the Boers who refuse to surrender. question, even if the whole Empire were unanimous. is quite right; but in that case it would be a political question merely in a theoretical sense, whereas now it is a practical political question.

External Affairs) I think that the meanest thing the Government could do would be to say that they have taken this action through inadvertence, and I do not mean to say anything of the kind. They did what they have done upon consideration, and are ready to accept any consequences that may attach to their action. that, so long as I have an opportunity to state my own views on the subject. Every one is entitled to his own opinion; but, when it is suggested to us that we should say that we have done a thing, by inadvertence which we have done upon consideration, I decline to take such a course. worse. worse to my honourable and learned friend, but that again is a matter of opinion.

In the first place, we cannot admit that we have acted by inadvertence without telling a lie, and I am not going to do that. The position was this: The Premier of South Australia, representing that State so far as the Commonwealth isconcerned for the purpose of any such negotiation or suggestion as tins, told usto use his own words-that On Wednesduj' uext ic is proposed to hold public meeting support British Government policy in South Africa. And he asked us whether we wouldKindly instruct the Commandant here to (permit) all officers of military who desire to parade streets and attend, also members of Commonwealth contingent, as we propose taking that opportunity to bid them farewell. So that this is a meeting to declare adhesion to the British Government policy in South Africa, and to bid farewell to the members of the contingent who are going to South Africa, and to whom farewell could not be hidden unless they were present. the British Government policy a political matter ? can make all they like out of that fact. The meeting has been called for the two purposes which I have stated. As to the question whether it is to be in a true sense a political meeting, we must look at the matter from the practical side. How much politics is there left in this question in Australia ? There is not one of the States which has not declared in a voice which there can be no mistaking that it is in accord with the British Government policy in South Africa. The States have declared that opinion by majorities to which no exception can be taken, and in most coses unanimously. House of Representatives and the Senate have passed resolutions resenting tlie aspersions cast upon our troops in South Africa, and offering whatever aid may be requisite to finish the war. The first resolution was passed unanimously in both Houses, and the second was passed unanimously in the Senate, and was passed in the House of Representatives against the opposition of members who numbered only one-fifteenth of the membership of the House. sent voted against the resolution. a precise confii-mation of the'policy in favour of which a pronouncement had been made by every Statei n Australia. To support the British policy in South Africa is the policy of Australia, and that fact appears upon official records. The present case has nothing whatever in common with the case put by the leader of the Opposition in regard to a pending election which would decide the issues of the country. The policy of the country in this matter has been decided, not by the ascendancy of one party or another after a general election, but there has been a practically unanimous pronouncement in each of the States, capped by a pronouncement by this Legislature respecting the people of the States. Honoitaible members may talk of this matter as being a matter of politics, but it is no longer a matter of practical politics, because we are positively agreed upon it . When we come to a stage such as tliis, it is almost idle to talk of there being any principle involved in allowing soldiers who are to be taken leave of to attend' a meeting to support resolutions, in which if they did not believe they would not have volunteered to serve the King. There can be no coercion of these men, since they would not have put their names down for enrolment unless they believed in this policy. Surelyi t is beside the question to talk of the action of the Government in this matter as coercion, or to speak of the question at issue as a political matter. to the meeting as troops. has-referred to the matter as one of opinion. There is nothing in the world that is not a matter of opinion ; but if his opinion is accerjted, no question ceases to be a question of party politics so long as you can find one Further than that, the man to object. That is not politics, and it is not common sense. We have been told that these men belong now to the Imperial forces. They are going to serve the Empire, as every man who may hereafter fight in Austmlia will serve the Empire; but does it not occur to the honourable and learned member who raised that point that, until they land in South Africa, or at any rate until they embark for South Africa, they",24,Forrest I Withdraw Mr Feeling Has Run Most High I F We Are To

It may be argued that they are under no control whatever, and are merely a rabble, but I do not think that even a pro-Boer could be found outside who would uphold that position. Therefore they are under local control, which means the control of the Commonwealth. Although this question may in England be of the dimensions of a political question, because of there being a substantial division of parties therealthough there is a majority of three to one in favour of the war-it has ceased to be one here, because both the States and the Commonwealth have decided over and over again in favour of the British Government policy. The matter could go no further than that, unless we passed an Act of Parliament to declare what are our opinions, and that is not necessary. If we decide by resolution of both Houses that certain things are as they are, and give endorsement to the British policy, surely the question whether we are to go on and finish the war and contribute towards that end in men and money is a question which has been settled without the possibility of reversal. Therefore it is not in the category of pressing approval of the action of the those questions in regard to which there could be an attempt to influence opinion by the presence of a few soldiers. The men have been asked to attend the meeting so that farewell may be said to them. farewell in the resolutions, andnothing is said about it in the advertisement. telegram which t have read. We submit that this is a storm in a tea-cup, and the Government feel that they must stand by the action which they have taken. Mr F. E. M c LEAN (Lang) I am not at all surprised, after the statement of the Prime Minister, that the Government have blundered in this matter, because he seems wholly incapable of distinguishing between the duty of peoplewho wish to manifest their loyalty by passingresohas been the slightest element of discussion lutions at a public meeting, and the dut\'of the Government, which, so far as the military are concerned, is to maintain an absolutely impartial attitude in regard to all political questions. It is nonsense for the right honourable gentleman to argue that, because a very considerable majority of the people of this country are in favour of the policy of the British Government, and have so expressed themselves, therefore that is not within the category of political questions. Any question that touches the policy of a Government, whether it be the Government of the Commonwealth or the Imperial Government, is a political question, and the military should be prevented from taking any part in the decision of such a question. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that another resolution were added to those already suggested for submission to the meeting in Adelaidea resolution commending the right honourable gentleman and his Government very highly for their great loyalty in despatching troops. I suppose this would introduce the political element, and that the right honourable gentleman would admit that the meeting was of a political character. Cani t be argued seriously that a meeting which is to have submitted to it resolutions declaring that it approves of the policy of the British Government in regard to the. South African war, or any other matter, is not a political meeting 1 It seems to me that there was one little difficulty in the way of the Government. The promoters of the meeting were clever enough to bracket together two objects, namely, that of exBritish Government, and the farewelling of the soldiers. I have a recollection of a large number of patriotic meetings in my own native city during the last fifteen or twenty years, and I can call to mind no instance where any attempt at military display was made at a meeting where resolutions of a political character were submitted. WeI t is mentioned in the have had great patriotic meetings to organize funds for the relief of the widows and orphans of soldiers and to provide for those who were wounded on the field or for the dependents of those who were killed, and such occasions have been availed of to arrange for something like a military display, but I have no recollection of any gathering at which political resolutions were submitted, being attended by the military. I regret very much that there introduced in regard to the merits of the war or in regard to the . policy of the British Government. It is a thousand pities that these matters should be brought in, even as side issues. If I disapproved of tlie policy of the British Government, which",25,Forrest I Withdraw Mr Feeling Has Run Most High I F We Are To

I can understand a man disapproving of Mr Chamberlain's policy, and at the same time as a Briton and as a citizen of the Empire being prepared to do his share either as a soldier or in assisting to send soldiers to uphold the Empire. Once the war is entered upon, I can understand the position of the man who says he is prepared to fight for the flag of the Empire, utterly regardless of whether the policy of the Government is right or wrong. That is the position we should all take up in these matters. The soldier knows no policy. It does not matter offering his services from Australia, or an enlisted soldier in the United Kingdom. He knows nothing about the policy of the Government. opinions-and most soldiers have them, I suppose-h e may possibly differ from the Government for the time being, but as an enlisted soldier he is bound to serve the Empire under all conditions, and that is why the King's Regulations wisely provide that soldiers are not to participate in polithink that the Minister for Defence would tical movements of any kind. The Government would have acted wisely, on seeing that political resolutions were to be submitted to the meeting in Adelaide, if they had pointed out that whilst the Government and the Parliament were largely in sympathy with the object of the meeting it would be against all precedent and contrary to the' traditions of the British Army to allow soldiers to participate. I do not think the right honourable gentleman has risen to the occasion. We give the Government the utmost credit for their patriotism and the way they have acted in this matter, but that does not now enter into the discussion of tlie .question raised by the honornot sanctioning the attendance of any able member for Bland. The people of Australia can give expression to their feelings in public meetings without calling ir> the military. I remember a most important patriotic meeting that was held in Sydney, after there had been some attempt to revive a latent republican feeling, and, if I remember rightly, even the honour of the late Queen was at stake. themselves were able then to vindicate the loyalty and honour of the city of Sydney without calling upon the military to assist them, and the loyalty of the people of the British Empire can find its truest expresAnd the two sion in old-fashioned public meetings, where resolutions are carried on the voices, and with applause, without the assistance of either military uniforms or arms. I am afraid we are embarking on a wrong career, as the precedent established in this case may be followed, unless some very strong and vigorous protest is entered against the action of the Government. The Minister for Defence takes the ful l responsibility of his action, and states that it was not due to any want of knowledge of the character of the meeting. If the meeting had been organized for the purpose of farewelling the soldiers, no honourable member would have objected to the presence of the soldiers, or whether he is a volunteer if it had been called with a view to establish a patriotic fund for the assistance of the widows and orphans or dependents of soldiers, not one honourable member would If he has any political have raised his voice against the suggestion that the military should be allowed to attend. But, apart from that aspect of the question, if the meeting had been a purely political gathering, with a view to passing the resolutions which have been quoted by the honourable member for Bland, I do not have countenanced the attendance of the soldiers. The Government themselves have been rather led into a trap by the cleverness of those who organized the meeting in bracketing the two objects together. mentioned in the advertisement. Mr F. E. McLEAN -Probably not, but I think the Government have taken as their guide the communication made to them, and one of the objects of the meeting was stated to be to farewell the soldiers'. I think that under anj circumstances the fact that T resolutions of a political character were to be submitted afforded sufficient reason for military forces. I do not agree with the Prime Minister that,because onlyasmallminority in this community or in Great Britain are opposed to the war, it has therefore ceased to be what may be called a political question. Any question that touches the policy of the Government, and which can be argued by citizens, is apolitical question, and The citizens comes within the four corners of the King's Regulations, and if it is good for soldiers in the King's service here and at home to be bound down by these regulations, they",26,Forrest I Withdraw Mr Feeling Has Run Most High I F We Are To
99,Mr Watson,"The two objects were notshould not be compelled by any orders from head-quarters to attend and give something like dignity or tone to a purely political gathering. I make no objection to what has been done from any want of sympathy with the patriotic objects of the people who are organizing the meeting in Adelaide, but the object of that meeting would be better served, and the patriotric instincts of the people of South Australia and of the whole of Australia would be more forcibly and emphatically expressed, if there were no military display. much surprised to hear the Prime Minister state that the object of the meeting in Adelaide was not political, because we were all agreed upon it . About six weeks ago the Prime Minister certainly thought that it was an important political question, because he at that time promised the honourable member for Kennedy that he would not permit the sending away of another Australian contingent to South Africa without first obtaining the consent of Parliament. Because he has changed his opinion since that time, he can hardly expect everybody else to follow immediately and change their views with him. Possibly we know tlie reason of his sudden changeperhaps it was because the Opposition happened to side with him in offering the last contingent. Minister contend that the position has changed in six. weeks to such an extent as to remove the South African war from the category of political questions? There is not a imagine ^ the taking strong exception to the military being present at a meeting of .this sort. Supposing that an opponent of the movement were to send away a report, he would have a fair opportunity for representing that the military had to be called in, and appeared in great force at the meeting, in order to insure the passing of the resolutions desired. What a false position the citizens of Adelaide would be placed in with regard to the passing of resolutions AlthoughI am one who, if present at the with which we may assume the majority of public meeting to be held in Adelaide this them agree. laide desired the troops, and it was at his of the Government in allowing any part of request that they were sent. Defence practically says"" I will take very good care to see that this meeting passes the resolutions,"" and correspondents might consider themselves justified in saying that a large number of soldiers had to be sent to the meeting in order to guard against the carrying of am adverse resolutiom. What a humiliating position the citizens of Adelaide would be placed in under such circumstances ! The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has very clearly pointed out that the King's Regulations distinctly forbid the attendance of soldiers at political meetings. The Victorian regulations contain a similar provision, and, doubtless, the regulations of the other States are framed in the same way. In view of this, what right have the Ministry to break the regulations' governing the military forces in the various States1 I have mot the faintest doubt that when this Parliament is called upon to deal with the military regulations, it will make provision that the military are never to be seen at political meetings. If there is to be the slightest appearance of coercion at political meetings, or meetings of the kind now about to be held, the effect will be to limit discussion, and to lessen bhe value to be attached to any resolutions passed. I was astonished to find that the Prime Minister was unable to distinguish between resolutions passed at a meeting of this kind with the military How can the Prime forces present, and a resolution passed at an assemblage of citizens in the ordinary way. I regret the position taken up by the Government. From the first telegram sent by the Premier of South Australia we can the slightest doubt that it is understand how a mistake occurred, but now political question. I can quite that we have fuller information before us, Mayor of Adelaide the Minister himself must see that the position and circumstances are entirely changed, and I trust that he will see that the meeting is not subjected to even the appearance of intimidation, but that the resolutions will be passed by the citizens in the exereise of their own free will, and after that discussion which alone lends value to the resolutions of any deliberative body. evening, would endorse the resolutions to be submitted to that gathering, I feel impelled the military force, as an organized body, to",27,Forrest I Withdraw Mr Feeling Has Run Most High I F We Are To

I do not believe , there is the smallest desire to injure any one. taken. But the honourable and learned member will admit that the wording of the resolutions leads one to assume that the object aimed at is to hammer those who have expressed themselves as adverse to the war. If the resolutions have been carelessly worded as a result of inadvertence, it is an inadvertence with which .1 should not have credited the promoters of the meeting. I again ask the Minister for Defence if, under the changed circumstances which have -arisen, he does not think he could, without anj' loss of dignity, declare that the troops shall not attend the meeting in question -as a military body. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) I am, and have ever been, in thorough accord with the view that the military forces which usually constitute the standing army of a country should be kept as free from politics as possible. In England that view is emphasized by the withholding of the franchise* from the army. But I would point out that there is a considerable difference between the position of men belonging to the British Army and of troops who have not volunteered to enlist as permanent soldiers, but have volunteered forfcheexpress purpose of serving in South Africa for the duration of the present campaign, in order to endeavour by every means in their power to bring it to a close. Many of these men, at very considerable personal sacrifice, have severed themselves from avocations in which they were engaged, in order to show their sympathy with the Empirei n tlie present struggle, and their earnest desire for its -speedy termination. All these men enjoy the franchise, and I do not believe that any considerable number of them-if anyintend to follow the life of a soldier at the conclusion of the campaign. King's Regulations make it improper for them to attend .this public meeting. MrA . McLEAN -They are enrolled for a year, or for the duration of the war, if that be a shorter period. The leader of the Opposition will see that there is a considerable difference between the two positions. We all know that every man amongst them is a patriot, and is in sympathy with the cause in which he is engaged. Otherwise he would not have enlisted. attended by the permanent forces, as well as by the volunteers for South Africa. MrA . McLEAN -There is no one who admires the ability, courage, consistency, and honesty of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne more than I do, although upon this question we are as widely separated as are the Poles. I was very sorry indeed to hear the honourable and learned member lecture fche leader of fche Opposition, because the latter endeavoured to go further than the Government in his desirefcocarry on the war to the extremity of extermination or submission. I would ask my honourable friend what is the alternative to either of these courses? Would the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne ask for submission on the part of the Imperial troops ? Would he ask the British to submit to the few Boers who are carrying on the present guerilla, warfare ? Is there any other possible alternative ? I can see none. It is a matter for profound regret that the maudlin sympathy of well-meaning, good-natured people in high places throughout the Empire has found such frequent expression, because I believe that that expression of opinion, to a greater extent than anything else, has been responsible for the prolongation of this unfortunate war. If there had been one ""feeling only exhibited from the commencement of the struggle I believe that the war would have terminated long ago. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne went a great deal further, in speaking upon this matter, than he will be prepared upon calmer consideration to support. He said that it was a question between tlie conservatives and liberals of England. question, and no one can deny it. MrA . M c LEAN But the honourable and learned member said it was a question If they are enrolled, fche as to whether the conservatives or liberals were right. I am sure my honourable friend will not argue for one moment that any considerable section of the great liberal party of England are out of sympathy with the policy of the Empire in the prosecution of the present war.",29,Forrest I Withdraw Mr Feeling Has Run Most High I F We Are To

M c LEAN times of profound peace, when the army is a burden of the taxpayers of the country, that feeling does prevail. But how different is the feeling in time of war, when it is ..known by the people that their lives, their liberties, their hearths and homes are in the keeping of the army. That different feeling is very well expressed by Kipling, when he saysFor it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' "" Chuck him out, the brute f"" But it's "" Saviour of'is country,"" when the guns begin to shoot; An' it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an anything you please; An' Tommy ain't a bloomin' fool-yo u bet that Tommy sees !

He blames the British Government for the Anglophobia which exists on the continent, contending that it is the unpopularity of the Government which has given rise to that feeling. There is a difference of opinion even in the old country on this question, and if any part of the British Empire calls a public meeting to approve of the policy and the modus operandi of the war, and allows the military to attend, that is a I said that was so in years breach of British liberty, and an attempt to intimidate people into saying what the I admit that in majority are saying. It is opposed to the liberty of public meeting. That is why I am a Quaker, and ever will be. In time of war public opinion is crushed and freedom of speech is put down. If a man dares to express an opinion adverse to the war, even though he may be in a place where he is required of conscience to do so, he is greeted by opprobrious terms. In this instance such persons are termed "" pro-Boers.""

123,Mr Ronald,"Thes e words, of course,A clear distinction is there drawn between the two. There could be no necessity for a farewell to the permanent forces of Adelaide. If it were desired to' farewell only the members of the contingent, tlie permission of the Government was not necessary, because the commanding officers can and always have given permission to the soldiers to go to these farewell meetings. That suggestion about farewell was put forward only as a cover. a farewell in the advertisement. telegram, and in this respect the Minister for Defence has been gulled and tricked into putting his imprimatur on a military display at a public political meeting. Now that the right honourable gentleman's eyes are opened, I sincerely hope that he will have courage to step down, and that the Government will say as gracefully as they can "" We have been deceived in this matter, and we insist on the Mayor of Adelaide and the Premier of South Australia carrying out our intention and not theirs; our intention being to hold a meeting to farewell the Commonwealth contingent, and not a public meeting at which the military are to be present to support resolutions on what are debatable questions throughout the length and breadth of the Empire."" It will be a bad day when the matter of peace or war is not a debatable question in this and every country. I am very sorry that the Ministry have been led into this trap, because I have no hesitation in saying that it is a trap. I am glad the honourable member for Bland has raised the question, and I hope the Government will have the courage to say"" Humanum est e/rrwre. We were wrong, and we will cancel what has been done."" It will be a bad precedent if militarism is introduced into our political and social life, and I enter my protest, and will certainly do what I can to prevent the attendance of the military at such meeting3. MrO ' MALL EY (Tasmania) I wish it distinctly understood that I look on this proposed gathering as a political meeting, organized for the purpose of advancing the interests of certain gentlemen at the coming State elections, which will take place either in March or April. MrO ' MALLEY having been unwell for some time, I went home, and the next day I was challenged in the newspapers with being a pro-Boer. But I am prepared now to say that during the time men were being sent to South AfricaI put my hand into my pocket deeper than the majority of those who now cry out "" pro-Boer."" I can give statistics to support that statement, obtained from the American Consul, in connection with the Lady Randolph Churchill Fund and other funds. I do not, however, wish to deal with this question from a pro-Boer or pro-British aspect. On one occasion an English lord invited his shopkeeper to dinner, But there is in the and thelatterwas soover-awedin thepresence of so mighty a man, that he acquiesced in everything that was said by the host. At length, his lordship said"" For heaven's sake, sa)' 'no,' so that there may be two of us here!"" It is not fair, because some men do not believe in war, to call them pro-Boers. I do not believe in war at a l l ; I have seen too much of it in America. There are only the honourable member for Maranoa and myself in this House who have had. any actual fighting on the battle-field, and. we oppose war because we know what it means. PerhapsI ought not to say that the honourable member for Maranoa opposes war, but at any rate, I do. The position I take is that if any number of men, as anation or a State, collectively have the right and power to shoot men down, I have the same right individually. There is no rightin a collective nation that the individual does not possess, and the great founder of Christianity did not declare that war was just. I am opposed to war, because it is a relic of savagery. Reasoning men ought to come together and discuss questions, and not be forced into war by popular clamour, or by extraordinary leading articles in the newspapers, when the public are excited. Statesmen meet and discuss matters, and settle them by reason,, investigation, and observation. But if it comes to a question of pro-Boer or proBritish, I am pro-British and not pro-Boer, and any man who says the contrary is a falsifier, and the truth is not in him. 1 am prepared to meet all who say to the contrary outside this House. I am not here as a coward or a cringing crawler, but hereto say what I think and why I think it .

Long before there was revolution in America., the British officers were allowed to do as they liked in the colonial days, and one officer in Boston told a citizen that he would force the Stamp Act down his throat with the sword's pointr Wherever the military have power they exercise it . Are we to allow the military to rule the Commonwealth of Australia? If anybody does not agree with me on this point, let him come to the west coast of Tasmania and face me at the general election. Let us put the loyalty of these people to the test. I remember a man in Western America who was always telling his w if e "" I love you, I love you, I love you."" I said to him"" For Heaven's sake, why are you always telling your wife that you love her ?"" and he replied-"" I do not love her, but if I do not'keep on telling her that I do she will find me out."" It is a bad sign to hear people always declaring their loyalty; they can be loyal without faces. I cannot expect the Government to withdraw their sanction in this case. But they can telegraph that if the conditions are as they understood them to be -that it is to be a farewell meeting--the military may go in uniform ; but that if it is to be a political meeting they must not break the King's Regulations. I do not believe in military mania, and that is what the country is coming to. The man on horseback with a Winchester rifle, or a Mauser, is the principal personage nowadays. But what we want is not an army of soldiers, but an army of workers. We do not want to let the military power be used for the purpose of deciding opinions on public questions. ' God pity this country when it comes about that we have only one set of opinions here. If we want to make ours a grand people we must allow a diversity of ideas and opinions to flourish. If there were a deplorable sameness of opinions it would not be worthwhile having a Parliament, because there would be nothing for members to do, and the Ministry could very well pass the laws themselves. I want this democracy to travel straight towards the temple of justice, as the children of Israel journeyed across the desert from the Red Sea to the Promised Land. MrE . SOLOMON (Fremantle) I do not satisfy honourable members, and meet with . think that any one will accuse me of being the approval of the whole community. 27 B 2 disloyal to the British Empire, and I feel that I have as much loyalty in my composition as has any other subject of the Empire. I have before me the advertisement of the public meeting to which reference has been made. It invites all citizens of SouthA nstralia to be present to express their opinion upon the policy which is now being carried out by the British Government in respect to the war in South AfricaThat, to my mind, is a political question. The expediency of that policy is one upon which every citizen has a right to express his opinion. Consequently, I think that if the Government had looked upon this meeting as they should have done, as a public meeting, and not as a farewell meeting to the South Australian members of the Commonwealth contingent, they would have acted accordingly, and would not have coerced the military into attending. It would be a bad precedent if at the commencement of our histoiy we allowed a meeting of public citizens to be attended by soldiers in uniform. Although these men are volunteers, yet, having enlisted for active continually stamping it on their service in South Africa, they must be looked upon as soldiers of the Empire. Public servants are not allo\yed to take part in public meetings of this character, and is it not still more opposed to the public interests that those who wear His Majesty's uniform should be coerced to attend, and by their appearance, though they may not have been sent there with that object, perhaps affect the resolutions that are come to. It seems to me that the Government have been misled through not having had sufficient time to consider this matter. It is not usual for the Minister for Defence to give himself away as he has done in this instance. of the meeting was not to say farewell to the contingent, we have been misled. that the Government have been tricked into giving their approval to the attendance of the military by the words in the telegram referring to a farewell to the contingent. I speak in no spirit of ill-feeling towards the Government, but I hope that they will reconsider their action.

128,Mr E. Solomqn,"I venture to thinkstand the deep concern of honourable members to protect the right of public meetings and fche exercise of the privilege of freedom of speech. I can understand the members of the labour party fighting to uphold those rights. The honorable member for South Austraiia, Mr Batchelor, who is a member of the labour party in this House, says that the Government were wrong in allowing the military to attend this meeting, because the advertisement of the meeting says that it is to be held for what is really a party purpose. have been misled, and placed in an unfortunate position by the wording of a telegram which they received from the Premier of South Australia. Both the honourable lor, and his colleague, MrV . L . Solomon, must be considered as well seized of the state of politics in South Australia, and as they agree that this meeting has been called for a political object, the Commonwealth Government should gracefully recede from the position which they have taken up. secure support to a party at a coming election, the Government are wrong in allowing the military to attend it. We are accustomed to' the exercise of the privilege of freedom of speech in Australia, probably more than Others elsewhere are accustomed to it . and although we may dislike those who differ from us, we are not willing to take from them the right of public utterance of their opinions. I believe, however, that too much has been made of the action of the Government in this matter. The telegram received from the Premier of South Australia shows that they have been led astray. It is as follows :On Wednesday next it is proposed to hold public meeting support British policy in South Africa. Will you kindly instruct the Commandunt here to allow all officers of military who desire to parade streets and attend, also members of Commonwealth Contingent, as we propose taking that opportunity to bid them farewell. To that telegram the following reply was sent, addressed to the Military Commandant at Adelaidew lie public meeting Wednesday next, supporting South African policy British Government, Minister directs that you should Confer with Premier South Australia and co-operate with him in every way so aa to assist the object in view. If there has been any error, I take it that it has been caused by the Government, understanding the reference to the British, policy in South Africa to mean the passing of the ordinary patriotic resolutions, such as the members of the labour party supported a fortnight ago. when they were proposed in this House. the right of public meeting ? been allowed to attend this meeting if they desire to do so. They have not been compelled or directed to attend, Mr F. E. McLEAN -The Minister made If that is so, the Government a mistake in saying that he sent a telegram directing them to attend. like other honourable gentlemen, was misled by the statement of the Minister for Defence; but the telegram itself shows that he made a mistake. rized the attendance of the military in a body. ment thought that the intention was merely to carry the ordinary patriotic resolutions, If the meeting is to be a meeting to and if they had asked for a copy of them to be sent, they would have been on safer ground. If the resolutions had merely wished success to the arms of the Empire, without referring to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the meeting would have had no political character, and I should like the members of the labour party to consider that view of the matter. Another question I should like them to consider is this: Upon the departure of t'he various contingents from the States the military and volunteer forces have been on each occasion paraded at the expense of the taxpayer to bid them a farewell. We heard no objection taken to that action on the part of the Governments, althoughfcheexpense had fco be shared by those who do not believe in the war as well as by those who do. If it be wrong fco command the volunteers to attend a public meeting, why should it not . be wrong to command them to attend at a send-off"" of troops ? To my mind, the fact that in one case the demonstration is in a building and in the other it was out of doors makes very little difference. If , however, instead of being a send-off -to the contingents, the South Australian meeting is to be a meeting for political purposes, the Ministry have no other course open to them than to withdraw the instructions which they have given.",33,Forrest I Withdraw Mr Feeling Has Run Most High I F We Are To

I do not see any special, danger such as the honourable member for Bland thinks is likely to arise from the presence of troops at this meeting. The appearance of men in uniform at such a meeting will be no menace to our right of free speech. ber aware that the British regulations forbid that sort of thing 1 attendance of troops at political meetings is forbidden, except with the permission of the. Commandant. The Commandant obtains his authority from the Minister for .Defence, and in this case the necessary permission has been obtained, and the local Commandant is carrying out the instructions of the Minister. The Government are now called upon to weigh the information they have received. If they think that the meeting is being held for local political purposes, or for the purpose of bolstering up Mr Chamberlain as Mr Chamberlain, they should reconsider the position, and if necessary cancel the order which has gone forth. But if they can secure an undertaking from the Premier of South Australia that the intention is to pass resolutions of a strictly patriotic character, I think tliey will be justified in allowing the troops to attend. This is not an occasion on which the rights of public meeting and of free speech, which were won hundreds of years ago, are likely to be submerged or lost. This is a special occasion, and I hope I shall not be accused of ultra jingoistic sentiments if I express my approval of the heartiest'demonstration being made in support of the Empire, and of the troops being sent away in the way they deserve.

This is not a deliberate attempt, of course, but it is an attempt, however unfortunate or inadvertent, to interfere with the right of public meeting, and it is likely to afford a precedent for further action of a similar character. In spite of what has been stated by the honourable member for Dalley, I am aware that the there is a clear distinction between allowing volunteers or regular troops to parade in the streets in order to make a farewell demonstration in connection with the departure of troops for South Africa, and permitting them to parade at a public meeting-attendanc e at which is a privilege which has been reserved from time im-' memorial for private citizens alone. I never remember an instance where soldiers were permitted to attend public meetings. A l though it may be true, as the honourable member for Dalley says, that soldiers may be permitted by their commandant to attend public meetings, there never was a Minister in England-eve n during the frenzy of patriotism aroused in connection with the war against Napoleon-who . dared to give such permission. The Minister for Defence has given permission to our troops to do certain things which he would never have countenanced if he had been fully seized of the circumstances. I have taken up an attitude in regard to this war different in some respects from that assumed by some of my colleagues. I did not believe in the -war at the start, but since then I have been rather too enthusiastically in favour of the country to which I belong.

139,Mr Hughes (West Sydney),"Whatof politics, but it is not a question of politics only because practically we are all of the one opinion. How often will people ever dare to be other than of one opinion, when a military force stands behind as a -dominant power ? If a day should come when it suits some party in power to crush -down a dangerous minority, they could draft their troops into every public meeting iu -order to do so, but they would quickly arouse the people to a sense of their danger. We have hitherto conducted all our meetings and all our public proceedings free from any such terrorism, and we are not now going to allow the nvlitary forces to dominate us. MrV . L . SOLOMON -We did not allow our civil servants to take part in political meetings for some time. cisely the same reason-les t the Government, having the power, should wield it for purposes other than those which would operate for the good of the Empire. It appears to me quite clear that the men who have volunteered for South Africa have a perfect right to go there, and I thoroughly believe that they take with them the very good wishes of a large proportion of the people of this Commonwealth. A t the same time, they have no more right than have a regiment of Prussian dragoons to go into one of our meetings, and by their mere, presence crush down any person and prevent him from expressing an opinion contrary to theirs. I agree that the political side of the matter does not obtrude itself very much in this particular case, it has been admitted that Mr Chamberlain, in the height of his power, would never have dared to do that which the Minister for Defence has now done. It is very proper that Englishmen should never allow the great sentiment which underlies the freedom of speech, and the right of public meeting, to slumber ; and I defy any man fco show me an instance, from the time of CharlesI . down to the present day, where the military have not been under the complete dominance of the civil power as represented by Parliament. There is nothing in the action of the Ministry in this particular matter that exposes us to imminent danger; but it may set up a bad precedent. As to the local aspects of the case, I do not know anything. I know nothing of any intention to influence local elections, but the principle involved in the presence of soldiers at a political meeting is a very important one, and if actions such as tliose for which the Minister for Defence is responsible are allowed to pass unchallenged they will end in the crushing down of our civil supremacy and in the power of the ballot-box being overwhelmed. bane) -The Prime Minister has very properly described this discussion as a "" storm in a tea cup."" Queensland was the first to send soldiers to South Africa, and before we sent our first contingent away, we invited the men into the largest hall in Brisbane and banqueted them. We also passed the most loyal resolutions in the presence of the soldiers. The last speaker indicated, forsooth, that these soldiers are practically political banditti, who intend forcing themselves into the hall against the will of those who wish to carry these resolutions. speech ? body here knows anything about Ricardo, and I do not think that the honourable member for Maranoa should interrupt with these paltry parochial side-issues which do not affect fche Commonwealth policy of sending contingents to South Africa.

I was surprised to heaasuch an erudite scholar as Therefore, whilst the last speaker referring to CharlesI . What have we to do with that monarch or his times? To my mind, every honourable member ought to be glad that the departing soldiers are to be accorded a loyal, farewell at the meeting which is to be held in Adelaide tonight.

144,"Mr Watson (Bland), In Reply","I regretTlie honourable and learned member for Brisbane seems to think that this protest is levelled against a send-off to the departing troops for South Africa. It is nothing of the sort. In introducing the matter, I distinctly stated that if the meeting was convened for the purpose of according a farewell to those troops, or of raising funds to assist the widows and orphans of men who had fallen in the war, no possible exception could be taken to the presence of the military. But what I do object to is that soldiers as such should be present at a public meeting under the orders of their chief. It is not a question of patriotism that is involved. It is not a question of whether we agree or disagree with the conduct of the war. The Prime Minister has said that the war has ceased to be a political question. I deny that, and in this connection I would point out that even in Englandi t has not ceased to be a political question. For example, even Lord Rosebery, who is at one with the Government so far as the end to be achieved is concerned, and who because of his desire is supporting them very strongly, would not subscribe to the resolutions which are to be submitted at the meeting in Adelaide to-night. He could not do so, because those resolutions ask for an expression of confidence in the whole of the administration of Mr Chamberlain in connection with the war in South Africa. I say distinctly that the Prime Minister is wrong in stating that the war has ceased to be a political question. As soon as the struggle is over, and the British have established their supremacy in South Africa, he will see whether it is or is not a political question. He will then witness a repetition of what occurred at the conclusion of the Crimean war. The idea that the people of England are afraid to express an opinion upon the conduct of the war is a delusion. I agree, however, that we should not debate that matter in tlie meantime. We should present a solid front to the outside nations. Further, I would like to point out that the inference to be drawn from the Prime Minister's argument is one which cannot fail to be viewed with alarm. He implied that because the war had ceased to be a political question the Government were justified in sending troops to a public meeting. however, that so long as the question involved is one affecting the Government of a countn', we should take care that no military force, as such, is present at a meeting to consider that question. I merely wish to reiterate what has been clearly expressed by one or two honourable members, that though a portion of the ground for the request made to the Government in the telegram of 23rd inst., was a proposal to give the departing troops for South Africa a send-off, no such suggestion is contained in the advertisement which appears in the Adelaide papers of the 27th inst. The advertisement merely states that the following resolutions will be submitted :1. That in the opinion of this 'meeting the policy of the British Government in their conduct of the war in South Africa meets with the approval of all loyal South Australians. 2. That this meeting desires to express to the Right Hon. Joseph Chamberlain its admiration ana appreciation of the ability displayed by him in his administration of the Government policy in South Africa. In any case the proposal to give the men a send-off was not sufficient to warrant the Government in agreeing to the presence of a military force at a public meeting, called for the purpose of considering and approving of the Imperial policy in South Africa. That is distinctly a debatable question, and one which the Ministry should see is kept free from any intimidation which the presence of troops might involve. The honourable member for Dalley said that because a great majority of the members of the labour party voted for the patriotic resolutions, which were carried only a week ago, they should make no complaint against the action of the Government in sending troops to back up a similar resolution in South Australia. Surely the honourable member ought to understand that a man may be thoroughly in agreement with what is proposed to be done at a public meeting, whilst entertaining very strong objections as to the manner in which it is proposed to be done. The real question at issue in the present instance is-whethe r we .should allow the populace to be coerced in a certain direction, irrespective of whether it be in the direction which we favour or not. That principle should be dearer to us, as liberty-loving citizens of Britain, than any temporary advantage which the carrying of resolutions might insure. I do not It seems to me, think there is any necessity to go to a division upon this matter. I feel that the Government can sufficiently gauge the feelings of honourable members by the tone of the debate, and the remarkable silence of those behind the Ministerial benches should them that, in this instance, they have made an error. Even the one or two speakers who have endeavoured to defend their action have been hard pressed to find a reasonable excuse upon which to hang their arguments. The object which I had in view has been well served by the ventilation of the subject, and it is not likely that the action of the Government will be repeated. Question resolved in the negative. Trade and Customs, upon noticeWhether it is his intention to supply' the several Custom-houses throughout the Commonwealth with the various forms necessary for the passing of entries, <fcc, which forms shall be issued to the public free of cost, so bringing the Customs department into line with other Federal and State departments. honourable member's question is as follows:The Government are not satisfied that there is any necessity or general desire for the course suggested. It has not beenfchepractice in New South Wales, Victoria, or South Australia. The cost would be very considerable. Further, importers often prefer to supply their own forms. If upon further investigation I find any reason to modify the opinion which I have now expressed I will not fail to acquaint the House with the fact. In Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from 28th January (vide page 9321)Division VI -Metals and machinery. Special Exemptions. with which we now propose to deal is one of considerable importance, and has already occasioned a long discussion. It has reference to tlie question of exemptions in connection with mining machinery. We asked honourable members to be good enough to furnish us with suggestions as to the articles which, in their opinion, should be exempted, in order that we might make inquiries and ascertain how far we could meet their wishes. A number of suggestions have been made to us, but we are accepting only a small number. We desire to propose the exemptions to which we are able to agree; and then honourable members, who have further sugbe sufficient to convince gestions, can bring forward arguments in favour of their proposals. We shall be glad to listen to those arguments and see whether there is such further information as to induce us to change the opinions we have formed up to the present time, and whether we can advise the committee to agree to further exemptions. honourable members should be asked to make suggestions, and that the Government should move that they be embo'died in the schedule of exemptions ? desire to submit the amendment if it is thought that such a course is not fair to honourable members. I am perfectly prepared to allow honourable members to submit their own amendments, but I thought it wise to lay before the committee the exemptions to which we agree. I have no desire to take away from honourable members the credit of moving exemptions. ment issued a list 1 only articles which, on our present information, we can consent to add to the exemptions, are automatic stokers, briquetting machinery; roll shells, manganese steel parts, and blowers for smelting. The suggestions are made principally by the honourable member for Kooyong, and these I have mentioned we are satisfied are not made here, and are not likety to be made here. In regard to the other articles which it is suggested should be placed on the free list in connection with mining machinery, we find that either they are being made here, or that they come very strongly into competition with other articleswhich are regarded as being as good for the particular purpose. It appears to the Government that there is one great fallacy underlying many of the proposals which the honourable member for Kooyong has brought forward, and I mention it now in order that he may have an opportunity of discussing the matter. It would be very unwise to pick out any particular piece of machinery, and say that that article is to come in free. Suggestions are made in regard to Blanton's patent cam fastenings, and Brown's roasting furnaces and drills of a particular pattern, and various articles",36,Forrest I Withdraw Mr Feeling Has Run Most High I F We Are To

151,Sir George Turner,"No. Theof that kind. not admit such a principle as the picking out of particular articles of a particular maker. fairly with other makers who might be manufacturing as good a machine, under some other patent or under some other name. If a particular piece of machinery is to be exempted, the whole class ought to be exempted in fairness to all parties. It would be very unfair if one importer were able to import free the patent for which he is agent while other importers had to pay 20 per cent, on articles which come into competition, and which may be as good, better, or perhaps not as good. It would be unfair from an importer's point of view, and, to a considerable extent, unfair from a manufacturer's point of view. That is one reason why we ask the committee not to pick out particular patents for the free list. If the article itself is thought of such importance that it ought to be made free, and it is shown that it is not in unfair competition with articles which are being made here, and do the same class of work, then it is for the committee to consider whether it should be placed amongst the exemptions. I shall not submit any .amendment now as there seems to be an objection to the Government taking that course, but the items I have mentioned are the only items to which the Government can agree. Mr ""KNOX (Kooyong) 1 at once acknowledge that the Treasurer very frankly told me yesterday the position he intended to take in regard to these suggestions, and indicated specifically the particular importations which he was prepared to agree should be placed on the free list. I have already indicated to the committee my perfect concurrence with the view expressed by the Treasurer to-day that there will be interminable difficulty in ascertaining how justice is to be done in excluding some patents from, and placing others on, the free list. beyond those special classes of machinery used for special purposes, there ought to be some contributing rate all round which would prevent a lot of difficulty, and to which the importers, so far as they understand the question, have no particular objection, provided the impost is not excessive. In asking the committee to place the articles I have suggested on the exempt list, I am not departing from my conviction that it would be better if all Wo feel that we canthese importations bore a moderate duty, instead of the high duty which is forced on the acceptance of the committee. A f t e r That would be competing unthe action of the Treasurer yesterday in stating what particular patents he intended to admit, I have taken the opportunity,, which he courteously gave me, of getting information in regard to one or two of my suggestions. I am very anxious that it should be distinctly understood by the committee that the list is submitted at tlie invitation of the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Treasurer, and not from any desire of my own. I have given the Treasurer the names of various patents, butthat is solely due to the fact that I can speak with knowledge in regard to them, expecting that honourable members, who alsohave to do with mining machinery, would themselves submit other lists. I entirely concurwith the view whichfcheTreasurer has stated,, that it is an inconvenient, unworkable, and undesirable method to give special exemptions to special patents byname. The idea, and object of the exemption list is simply, that inasmuch as the committee havedecided-althoug h I hope they will subsequently reverse thatdecision-fchafcthereshal l be the large impost of 20 per cent, on the machinery necessary to this great primary industry, we are compelled to ask the Government to give us a complete free list. I have only suggested those articles which of my own knowledge I know cannot be made in this country as satisfactorily and as effectively as to results as fchey can be abroad ; and I shall endeavour to give an explanation of individual items vhen fchey are before the committee. I understood the Treasurer to say yesterday that we were to consider each one of these items, and, if that be so, I shall give my reasons for believing that the mining industry will be advantaged and benefited by puttingthese articles on the free list. I am strongly of opinion that that course should be taken,, Tor that reason I urge that and at the proper moment will move accordingly, if preferred. Before an amendment is submitted, I should like to suggest that we take a testvote on the question whether mining and agricultural machinery shall not be treated in the same way as the machinery used by manufacturers, and placed on the free list, whether it can or cannot be made within the Commonwealth. There has not been a test vote on that point yet, and I intend",38,Tariff

My recollection is that that was distinctly disposed of, and if so, it would be out of order to test the feeling of the committee upon precisely the same question again. The honourable member for Macquarie can put himself in order by confining himself to mining machinery. We had a very prolonged debate in connection with mining machinery on the item, engines and boilers n.e.i., which embraces all engines and machinery, and it will be quite competent for the honourable member should exempt some particular kind of machinery. It would not be in order for I think that there the honourable member to propose to make all engines free, but he is now jn'oposing to make the machinery used in one particular industry free of duty, and is really pursuing the same course as was followed by Ministers yesterday in exempting tools W it h reference to of trade used in a great variety of industries. If the Government could add these tools to the list of exemptions there is nothing to prevent my honourable friend from placing mining tools on the free list. I quite agree that this is not a matter that should be discussed at any great length, because we have already thoroughly thrashed it out. I do not think my honourable friend has any idea of abusing the patience of the committee. for Macquarie is within his rights so far as I represent more mining machinery is concerned, but as recided that it shall be subject to a duty.

170,Mr Kingston,"On the point of orderorder raised by the honourable member for Moira, I find that as far as agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural machinery and implements, including mould-boards, i c , are concerned, a division was taken on the 12th ""December, on the motion of the honourable member for Wentworth, that the whole of these articles should be placed on the free list. The committee rejected the proposal, and affirmed that they should remain on tine dutiable list. I find no mention of any decision with regard to mining machinery, and therefore I rule that the amendment of the honourable member for Macquarie is in order in respect to mining machinery only. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). I would ask the honourable member for Macquarie to include in his amendment the machinery used in the preparation of foods. to keep that class of machinery distinct from mining machinery ? Mr G. B. EDWARDS prepared to do that, but I desire to point out that the importance of this class of machinery is hardly understood. We have heard a great deal about the importance of agricultural machinery, but the best machinery we can bring to bear upon our agricultural and pastoral products is that v.'hich is used for converting them into food. ' These operations entail the employment of more costly machinery than that used in the primary industries, and we are rather apt to belittle the importance of the operations which are connected with the preparation of foods throughout the whole of the Commonwealth in contrast with those of mining or agriculture. the duty on mining machinery was being considered, several honourable members voted in favour of it, on the understanding that a list of exemptions would afterwards be submitted to the committee. This list has not been forthcoming, and honourable members find themselves in a somewhat difficult position in consequence. Several honourable members are prepared to vote for a duty upon mining machinery, which can be satisfactorily made within the Commonwealth, but they would like to have exempted such machinery as cannot be made here. I have seen the list which has just been submitted by the Government, but that includes only three or four small items On the point of which do not touch the operations of mining in the real sense. I question whether the machines referred to are used underground. mining machinery can be made here. not mean anything of the kind. I am prepared to place a duty upon any machinery that can be made here, but not to harass the mining industry by requiring that duty should be paid on machinery that is not manufactured local!v. when we resumed the discussion of the Tariff, that we had made the fullest inquiries with reference to the articles that could not be made here, and that out of the lists which had been submitted to us we could consent to only some five or six articles being placed on the free list. It was well within the province of the committee, however, after the other items had been discussed, to say whether they would put any I am quite of the individual lines-on the free list. That was a matter absolutely within the judgment and discretion of the committee. I said also that perhaps further information that might be given us by honourable members might induce us to agree to other items being placed on the free list. That was a fair position to take, and in accordance with the attitude we have invariably assumed. We asked honourable members to supply us with a list of the articles which they considered should be placed on the free list. not say that with regard to the machinery used in cotton and woollen mills. placed those classes of machinery on the free list because they are not being made here. not many woollen mills within 'our boundaries, and, therefore, there is not such a demand for woollen mill machinery as to induce manufacturers to put down the necessary plant for making it. In the case of mining machinery, however, there is a large demand, and that machinery is being made here largely and w e l l ; and to ask us, after all we have done, to exempt mining machinery, whether it can be made here or not, is to suggest something that I am certain the committee will not agree to.

Our officers in the various States have reported upon the matter, and their recommendations are embodied in the proposals which we have submitted to honourable members. We find-and it is to the great credit of Australian industry and skill-that as regards mining machinery generally, fully 80 or 90 per cent, of the local wants are supplied by local industry. I was speaking to a gentleman to-day who is very largely interested in matters of thissort, and he assured me that in using those figures I should not be overstating the case. Honourable members will recollect that the matter was under discussion some time back, and that we invited specifications of the machinery which it was suggested could not be made here. such specifications. Our officers have been instructed to investigate every suggestion and specification submitted for our consideration, and as a result, we propose to place four or five additional items upon the free list. As regards machinery likely to be introduced in the future, we made a proposal which was even more liberal to the free-trade idea than that which the committee in its wisdom saw fit to accept. upon other grounds. was not. Under these circumstances, instead of having exposed ourselves to the charge of want of faith, we have left no stone unturned to discharge our responsibility, and, therefore, I strongly resent, and I have a right to complain of, the use of words imputing want of good faith to us in connection with this matter. I hope that I have said sufficient to induce honourable members to believe that such a charge is in no way deserved. than I can express, the necessity of having at this period in my political career to resent the implication conveyed in the statement of the Minister for Trade and Customs that I have allowed myself to be influenced directly or indirectly as to the manner in which I have voted, by the pecuniary interests which he assumes I possess in regard to certain manufactures. I rebut the right honourable gentleman's charge, and I appeal to honourable members on both sides of the Chamber, many of whom have known me for years, if ever, in my political life, I I think that it is not have considered my personal interests in any vote which I have cast. There are honourable members who are aware that I have, on the contrary, cast three votes distinctly against my personal interests, and I invite the closest scrutiny and criticism of every vote I have given. If the circumstances were otherwise, I should have no light to occupy the honourable position which I hold in this Chamber, and I repel, with the utmost indignation, the insinuation of the Minister that, because I am nominally the agent for the great corporation of Allis, Chalmers, and Co., of New York and Chicago, I would ask honourable members to vote to place upon tlie free list certain articles which they manufacture. has not asked the committee to put these We welcome articles upon the free list. from my thoughts. I have persistently said, that there should be no free list-that there should be a uniform charge. I have stated that I felt the difficulty and inconsistency involved in moving that any item be placed upon the free list, -because I believe that a uniform duty should be placed upon allthese items. Technically, and legally, I am in a position to state that I have at present no pecuniary interest in the firm of which the company I am a member of is the agent. I do not say that it I do not wish to shelter myself behind a legal technicality, for it is sufficient forme to say that the gentleman who is my partner in other undertakings controls that undertaking and I accept equal responsibility. I call upon any honorable member to instance one case in which my vote has been influenced by personal considerations, apart from my duty to my constituents, to the people of the Commonwealth, and to that great industry for which I have done much in each of the States, by opening up some of the largest undertakings,, employing at this time very large numbers of men, and expending, as I have recently shown to the committee, enormous sums of money upon-machinery. Were there any justification for what the Minister has stated, the limited interest which I hold is as nothing compared with the other interests which I possess, and the desire I have to see a fair and legitimate duty placed upon mining machinery generally.

Both the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Treasurer know that I have tried in every way in my power to assist the Government in placing fair and reasonable duties upon all machinery used in the great industry of mining, and in other industries. To me the galling reflection is that the Treasurer, whose frankness I readily acknowledge, spoke to me on this subject yesterday evening.

The Minister for Trade and Customs challenged honourable members to come forward and furnish him with lists. If he had waited my opinion in regard to the individual items upon the list which I submitted, I should have informed him that some of the articles included could serviceably be manufactured here. It is singular that I happen to be the only member who has given him a list. I believed that many other honourable members would come here with lists. I pointed out to tlie committee that when I gave a list I should give it because I was in a position to speak with knowledge in regard to the special manufactures contained in it . adopted by the honourable member was repudiated by the leader of the Opposition long ago, and that repudiation was joined in by the Government. what the leader of the Opposition may have said on the subject. I repel the iniquitous onarge that I was not honest in my vote, because the firm of Knox, Schlapp and Co. is agent for the various .articles about which, in deference to his expressed wish, I have given the Minister all the information at my command. It is not my custom to speak at large in this chamber upon any subject of which I have not close knowledge, and upon which I am not able to impart information to other honourable members. Notwithstanding the charge that has been levelled at me, I am perfectly sure that honourable members, on both sides, and in both corners of the chamber, are not prepared to believe that I was influenced by any personal motive in affording information to the Minister. the Minister for Trade and Customs had adopted before the adjournment the same tone as lie did afterwards, there would have been no occasion for the continuance of this debate.

The discussion upon that particular point must now close. defend the honourable member for Kooyong, for I think he has sufficiently defended himself; but I desire to refer to tlie method I am not responsible for which the Ministry have adopted in framing their policy, and to their want of consistency when they abuse honourable members for falling in with that method.

I heard the Treasurer ask honourable members to furnish him with lists of specially patented machinery which could not be made in Australia. a list of patented machinery, he can supply it only from the facts within his own knowledge, and if he knew that certain machinery-for agent, or in which he might be interestedwas patented, and could not be made here, he was bound, by the terms of the Treasurer's request, to furnish information that machinery, which ought tobeonthe listof exemptions.

If it was not wrong for the Ministry to do this it was not wrong for the honourable member for Kooyong, who knew that certain machines were patented, to furnish that information to the Government.

We all recognise that the Chairman has a very difficult task to perform in listening to everything that is going on, and endeavouring to hold tlie scales of justice evenly between the contending parties. No ,one will say that he does not succeed treats me right at all. learned member for Werriwa has made a statement which will be admitted by all parliamentarians to be unparliamentary. Attention having been called to it , I think that the statement should be withdrawn. I hope that tlie honourable and learned member will bow to the decision of the Chair, and not cause the first Federal Parliament to have to resort to the extreme step of having one of its members named. is no desire on the part of the honourable and learned member for Werriwa to create any disturbance. But honourable members must recollect that the charge emanated from the other side of the House. order. I wish to know if it is in order to allow a discussion to take place after an honourable member has been named 1 able and learned member for Werriwa to withdraw statements which were certainly offensive and disorderly. He refused to do so. Had he done so, I should not have taken the course which I did. Even at this moment, if the honourable and learned member is prepared to withdraw, I have no desire to'take the extreme step indicated. not been named, I withdraw the statement. A t the same time. I do hope that the Minister for Trade and Customs will admit that he made a mistake previously. I was absent from the Chamber at the time he made the accusation, but I am sure that there would have been a very serious discussion had I been present. I hope that the Minister for Trade and Customs will express regret for the imputation which he cast upon honourable members of the Opposition. evidence has been given of the inadvisability of bandying charges of dishonour across the table. The Minister for Trade and Customs stated that charges had emanated from this side of the Chamber of votes having been influenced by the businesses in which persons were engaged. I admit that charges of which I do not approve have been made by members occupying seats upon this side of the Chamber. It is not wise that any such imputations should be cast upon the integrity of honourable members. There is a I do not think he proper course to pursue if any one is prepared to substantiate such charges. When the interruption occurred I was pointing out that the Ministry are asking us to accept certain exemptions under the heading of manufactures of metals. They give as their reason for inviting us to accept those exemptions that, upon inquiry, they find that all other articles can be manufactured within the Commonwealth. They have not, however, adopted any reasonable means for obtaining this information, and in many instances have been satisfied with the I am sure that there mere assurance of interested parties that they were making, or could make, any particular article. When the vote was taken upon the proposal to tax mining machinery at 15 per cent a proposal which was defeated by only one vote-honorabl e members understood that a very complete exemption list would subsequently be brought forward by the Government. But the exemption list which is now submitted is I asked the honora very small one indeed, consisting of only five items. Seeing that that list is unsatisfactory, I think Ministers might very well agree to re-commit the item, so as to enable honourable members to record their votes in the f u l l light of after events in accordance with their own consciences. I very much regret the delay which has occurred, but the responsibility for it must rest with the opposite side of the House.

272,Mr Isaacs,"If the honourable memberlearned member asked us if we had not the manliness and patriotism to support a proposal to assist those workers, and to enable their wages to be kept up. I say that we do not under-estimate the mining machinery industry of Australia. I quite admit that -our local manufacturers turn out some excellent machinery. We desire that they shall continue to do so. But when we have to give consideration to the question of imposing duties we must one class alone, but the whole of the industrial classes of the community. Surely we may claim some reason for our views if we say that local manufacturers can make mining machinery, and have made it . They have made it in competition with the rest of the world. pay duties upon their goods when those goods were entering the different States of the Commonwealth in competition with the world. And in an enlarged Australia. I have sufficient confidence in the firms and in the men engaged in the industry to believe that tliey will take the fullest advantage of the wider market which is now offered to them, and that they will be able, without the aid of any duty, to do better than they have done in the past. Honourable members now talk of putting a protective tax on such portions of machinery as are made in Australia, and of levying a heavy tax on an immense quantity of machinery that is not made in Australia. The latter is largely very expensive machinery, costing thousands of pounds, and is used in special processes necessaiy to enable certain mines to be worked. If these mines are not worked, what is to become of the workmen? In the past machine-makers have been able to take advantage of the opportunity even to the extent of paying duties, and competing in other States against the world; and we now say that it is time to consider the mining industry, to which we cannot give one penny of protection, and which, as the honourable member for Macquarie has said, has no natural protection such as is enjoyed by manufacturers. Under these circumstances the proposal of the honourable member for Macquarie is perfectly justifiable. Even if the amendment be defeated, I hope the Ministry will give the committee the opportunity, of which I know several honourable members think they may be deprived, of giving a straight-out vote, without any contingencies such as arose in the last vote, on the rate of duty to be charged on mining machinery. port the amendment of the honourable member for Macquarie, as I am strongly in favour of all machinery being admitted free. Buti t is only fair to say that as regards my personal relations with theMinistry on this question, they have acted towards me in a perfectly bona fide way. consider not I have seen the Minister for Trade and Customs on several occasions, and once I met him at his own office and had a very long conversation, the outcome of which was that the .Minister offered practically to accept a duty of 20 per cent, all round, and to place on the exemption list certain They have been able to machinery of which we know at present. manufactured in tlie Commonwealth. and Customs was also prepared to frame some clause in order to meet the importation of machinery, of which we do not know to-day, but which may be invented at any time. I then pleaded for a duty of 15 per cent, all round, coupled with the other two conditions, and we joined issue on the question of whether the duty should be 15 per cent, or 20 per cent. Whilst the action of the Ministry in that respect has been perfectly bona fide, I contend that their policy treats mining machinery unfairly. I do not speak of agricultural machinery now, my knowledge being more particulary of mining machinery j but when honourable members who represent agricultural districts said that protection makes agricultural machinery cheaper, I listened to them with a certain amount of interest. still doubtf dl. as to what the effect of protection is on the cost of mining machinery, and I find fault with the Government because they are not treating the mining industry in the same way as they are treating the machinery required in the boot-making, hat-making, and similar trades. not right in saying that. having its tools of trade admitted free. little time ago I read an article in the",51,Smith There Has Been For Macquarie To Now Propose That We

SomeLeather Journal boasting, if I may use the -word, of there having been spent Â£ 3 4 0 in fighting the Victorian Government, in order to obtain for the boot making industry the tools of trade free. In those industries they are extremely anxious, and rightly so, to have their tools of trade admitted free ; and the Minister has told us the reason. It is impossible, at the present time, with our foundries and appliances, to compete successfully with the larger manufactories of the world, which turn out these articles in tremendous numbers. It is not unfair to ask that the tools of trade of the mining industry should be admitted on exactly the same terms as are the tools of the other industries I have mentioned. We are running no particular t i l t against colonial industries. ' We are very glad when mining companies can see their way clear, in the open markets of the world, to buy from colonial manufacturers. I have here a statement, sent to me, at my request, by Mr Dickenson, the secretary of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company, who says, in reference to machinery, that for the last four or five years his company have spent in construction Â£100,000 per annum. Mr Dickenson goes on to say that, although he has not the exact figures before him as to how much of this machinery was imported, it may be safely stated that Â£25,000 per annum was spent on machinery from abroad. An Honorable MEMBER to see the items. ing plants alone cost Â£100,000. while later. -Â£100,000 thrown away. It would seem that some people in Victoria, where there is a barbed-wire industry to deal with, have no conception of a decent sized industry. The figures of Mr Dickenson, which may be regarded as reliable, show that out of every Â£100,000 worth of machinery constructed, Â£75,000 represented colonial manufacture. That is highly creditable to the colonial industry, because in New South Wales the manufacturers had to compete against the world. And these facts afford very clear evidence thatcolonial machinery in many respects is equal to imported machinery. -BrokenH ill machinery simply because it was colonial manufacture, seeing that the mine is conducted in order to make profits. What we say is that, whenever machinery is required, the mining companies ought to be free to go into tlie open markets of the world and get the best. Machinery is the tools of trade of the mining industry, and up-to-date machinery is absolutely necessary. The honourable member for Kooyong agrees with me that, if the BrokenH ill companies had not been able to get the most up-to-date machinery, not a single man would be employed there now.

I saw it reported in the newspaper, however, a few days ago, that tin's smelter has been shut down, and the 23 men employed in connection with it have been thrown out of work because there is not so much copper ore now coming to Port Augusta, and because without a larger plant they cannot profitably compete with the private companies. shut down because of the fall in the price of copper. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Not one of those undertakings, including the batteries, has ever paid. facturing industry employing 23 men been concerned, the Government would have tried to protect them by a duty of 10 per cent., and if that was not sufficient, they would have increased it to 15 or 20 per cent., in accordance with protectionist principles. I shall vote for the amendment, and I hope that we shall be successful in obtaining free machinery for the miners. I think that the miners should not be differently treated, under the Tariff, from other producers. The tools of trade and machinery used by manufacturers of all classes are admitted duty free, but every article that tlie miner uses, including his lamp, is taxed. If the committee decide to exempt from taxation the machinery used in mining, they will confer a great boon upon the mining industry. In certain parts of New South Wales mining is languishing at the present time, and a few days ago the people at H ill End asked that the operation of the Municipalities Act might be suspended for a time, because of the present condition of mining there. of miners throughout the Commonwealth are not only taxed upon every article that they consume, but their earnings are reduced by the duties upon the implements and machinery used in the industry. The Minister has pointed out that from SO to 90 per cent, of the implements and mining machinery used throughout the Commonwealth is locally made. In New South Wales 75 per cent, of such machinery used is made in Australia, and a large proportion of the mining machinery in use in Western Australia has been imported from the eastern States, notwithstanding the competition of foreign manufacturers, and despite the fact that there was a duty ranging from 5 to 15 per cent, upon such machinery. The mining machinery imported into the Commonwealth is very largely patented machinery, which cannot be manufactured here, because no local firm possesses the right to make it . The local manufacturers practically have command of the market, and we shall give them an opportunity to charge higher prices for their machinery than they have hitherto charged if we impose heavy protective duties. This question has already been debated on several occasions, and I hope that the Minister will now yield to tlie argument which has repeatedly been advanced, and allow mining machinery to be placed on the free list. to raise another storm by imputing motives to the Ministry with regard to their action in connection with this item, but I venture to say that the Government have, in a very peculiar manner, whittled down to microscopic proportions the original proposition by which they obtained a vote in favour of a 20 per cent. duty. There is no doubt that the narrow majority which secured that duty was obtained for reasons quite different from those given in connection with this free list. In makinÂ£; the important stipulation that nothing shall be placed upon the free list to which a specific name attaches, the Government are depriving the concession which they offer of its most valuable qualities. Every one must realize that whatever is likely to be of any particular value in the shape of newly invented machinery will have given to it as distinct a name as possible, and to preclude articles of that kind from coming in free of duty would be to deprive the concession made by Thousands the Government of any value which might otherwise attach to it . I indicated last night that very great difficulties would be experienced by the Government in differentiating between machinery which ought to be admitted free and that which ought to be dutiable, and I contend that the Government have introduced an even more vicious principle in. bringing forward their present proposition. If they intend to consider the interests of the mining industry, I do not see how they can shut out articles simply because they are named. In view of all the difficulties which the Ministry must now see for themselves, I suggest that they should recommit the item",54,Smith There Has Been For Macquarie To Now Propose That We

302,Mr Fowler (Perth),"I do not wishof machinery with a view to discovering whether the committee, after all the discussion on this question, are not willing to place the mining industry on the same footing as the agricultural industry, by imposing a uniform duty of 15 per cent. That course should commend itself to even the protectionist members of the committee, and I think I can answer for my colleagues from ""Western Australia when I say that 15 per cent duty all round would be preferable to what the Government now propose. MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia) I desire to emphasize the importance of giving every possible encouragement to an industry which is becoming of greater importance to the whole of the community every day. capabilities of Western Australia are being more largely developed daily in spite of all the difficulties with which it has had to contend. A t least one-fourth of the mining machinery used in Western Australia is patented machinery from Germany or America, which is used in the treatment of refractory ores, and which cannot be manufactured in Australia owing to its being hedged round with patent rights. Then the BrokenH ill mines which have a great effect upon the prosperity of South Australia, as well as upon the Statei n which they are situated, are now undergoing a great struggle against adverse conditions. Presh experiments are being made every day in the treatment of sulphide or lead ores, and in spite of the falling market for lead and silver the mines on the Barrier have so far been able to make both ends meet. They have not been able to pay any dividends, but they have at least been able to meet their wages sheet every month up to the present. For several years past only two or three of tlie mines have paid any dividends. thing always. MrV . L . SOLOMON I admit that, but it is the luck of the thing that we should have lead down to a little over Â£10 per ton, whereas it formerly ranged at about Â£14 per ton, and that silver should now be worth 25 per cent, less than it was three years ago. The result of all this is that every additional burden placed upon the back of the mining industry will reduce the chances of the mines keeping open, and of avoiding what would amount to almost a national disaster. I am heartily at one with the honourable member for Barrieri n desiring that mining machinery should be placed on the free list. The honourable member has put his case very ably and very clearly, and I would ask the committee not to increase the burdens upon the mining industry, which is of such vital importance, not only to the residents of the mining districts, but to the whole of the Commonwealth. What are we to gain by imposing a duty on mining machinery ? It has already been shown that the local foundries can produce machinery in competition with the world, and supply three-fourths of that which is required in the mining industry. Threefourths of the machinery used on the Barrier has been manufactured at such The gold-producing works as the Otis Engineering Works, Melbourne, Martin and Co.'s at Gawler, Thompson's at Castlemaine, and others. On the one-fourth? MrV . L . SOLOMON -Undoubtedly ; and that burden is no inconsiderable one /when it is remembered that hundreds of thousands of pounds are spent every year upon the Kalgoorlie gold-fields alone in machinery of the very latest up-to-date character, which is necessary for the treatment of ores which would otherwise be unprofitable. I should be satisfied if the present proposal were limited to the removal of all duties on mining machinery which, by reason of patent rights, could not be produced in Australia. So far as we can produce mining machinery, I am satisfied that the Australasian foundries should have the work. I have seen some of their work, and if they want any protection I am quite ready to give it them ; but I do not think they do require it . We have enough hard luck to contend with in South Australia, owing to the low prices of copper, lead, and silver, the and to the serious effect which the restriction of mining operations upon the Barrier is having upon our railway revenue. The loss to the South Australian railways for the current year, owing to the falling off in the Barrier traffic, is estimated at Â£100,000, and the low price of copper is resulting in the stoppage of the Moonta mines, which have worked uninterruptedly for the last quarter of a century. In view of these facts, we do not want to see the mining industry still further hampered.

I came here not as a rabid free-trader, but as a revenue tariffist, and I am not prepared to impose taxes on the agriculturists, the pastoralists, and the miners. Mr V. L.

What do we find upon the other side of the House1 We know that honourable members occupying seats there indulge in an} 7 amount of sentiment, and talk a great deal of what they are going to do, and what they have promised. But when big industries like the mining industry are concerned, we get very little support from them upon a division. In this connection, I would point out that this industry yields 23 per cent, of the total wealth derived by Australia from primary productions. away from that. wealth amounting to Â£20,000,000 whilst Western Australia alone produced Â£7,000,000 worth. which, in their blind support of the Government proposals, honourable members opposite are going to tax 1 millions out of it, they ought surely to pay some taxation. MrV . L .

Does he not know that every man who has invested in pastoral pursuits during the last decade has had the hardest row to hoe of any individual in Australia, because of the low price of wool and the difficulties he has had to contend with on account of the vermin ? Yet the honourable member voted for the duty upon wire netting and barbed wire.. them more cheaply. MrV . L . SOLOMON-That is the same old farcical yarn that we always hear from protectionists.

But the Government supported a 20 per cent, rate, and the free-traders went for nothing. When my free trade friends talk about various industries in the States being able to compete with certain industries abroad, they forget that the local manufacturers, prior to the advent of federation, enjoyed protection in their own States. As a result they were able to send their surplus products We cannot get into the free-trade State of New South Last year it produced Wales, just as the sewing machine firms m odd, America sent their surplus stock to England, and sold machines there for half the price at Is this the industry which they could be purchased in the home market.

We ought to realize that the strength of a chain is its weakest link, and that the honour of this House is represented by the least honourable man in it . If we brand a few members as dishonourable we shall reduce all the others to the same level.

But when the French fleet surrounded Mexico and prevented her from importing anything, the whole of her army fell like barley before a scythe. Because the people of Mexico had not a factory in which they could manufacture anything. nations for their supplies. Let us turn again to North America. Why did North America whip South America? Because the latter possessed primary industries only. It had the nigger and the cotton, and when the war broke out the Southern States were incapable of manufacturing .because they had not the genius required to produce. They had not the secondary knowledge-the y were primary producers. I am afraid that my friends have forgotten that if they close up the industries within fche Commonwealth which produce mining machinery the men who will be thus displaced will carry their swags to BrokenH ill in order to compete with those who are employed there.

I am glad that he is now somewhat restored to bis mental balance, and I wish to remind him that the imputations of personal motives which he levelled against one of the most honourable members of this committee arc deeply to be regretted. The Government invited the honourable member for Kooyong, who has a wide knowledge of mining in Before Maximilian entered Australia, with other honourable members, to submit' suggestions to assist them in the framing of a wise exemption list under the heading of mining machinery. Honourable members responded to that invitation only to be practically insulted and outraged Why? by imputations that they were influenced by mercenary motives. They depended upon foreign right honourable member will not proceed further in that strain I gave the honourable member for Kooyong the fullest opportunity of making an explanation, and with that the episode ended. ended, but the imputation remains upon the records of the House. I think that it should not appear upon our records. IE the Minister for Trade and Customs will withdraw the imputation which he levelled against the honourable member for Kooyong, it would be a generous and honourable way of closing the incident. I know that we often make statements in the heat of debate, which in our calmer moments we would not attempt to justify. The Minister for Trade and Customs must know that in the discharge of his duties he is frequently brought into contact with a number of people who are personally interested in the duties imposed by this Tariff, and who try to influence him in a multitude of ways for their own benefit. But enjoying, as he He has does, the generous confidence of the whole of the committee, in regard to his perfect integrity, I think that he might treat other It is one of the gratifying features of the Tariff all through, that although we sometimes think manufacturers have a great deal to say in what is being done, we think it is only right that their interests should be ventilated in this Chamber.

The imputation under consideration, which, I think, stands alone on our Mansard, affects a man's personal reputation ; and I hope the Minister will close the incident in the generous and proper way that no man knows better than himself to apply. I shall not say any more to aggravate matters. It will not do for the Minister, when he becomes excited, to avoid the plain issues which we put before him. The honourable gentleman, in his speech, said the reason why these tools of trade were put on the exemption list was that.tliey were not made in such numbers as to warrant the establishment of the industries in Australia. No one expects or supposes that there would be a special foundry to make each particular kind of tool; because these are tools which foundry where articles are made. rOur common-sense and intelligence to place the whole of the tools of trade of all the trades, which have been mentioned, on the free list without any reservationinventions, past, present, and future-and say that they cannot be manufactured in Australia. It is practically saying that not one of the tools of the whole of these industries can be manufactured here. If any of these articles can be manufactured here, then according to the principle on which the Government have acted, they should be put on the protected list. It is high timethat the acts of the Government should be pointed out in support of the amendment, which is to treat the miner precisely in the same way as the bootmaker and all other artisans. Macquarie uttered a very pregnant truth when he said that miners had to look to a distant market for the sale of their products, while artisans were protected at their own doors. Such a policy makes a very considerable difficulty in the way of a primary industry. The honourable member for In d i struck the true protectionist note when he said that the Government would be justified in putting under the benefit of a protective policy all things which could possibly be made in the future in Australia. That policy would never have had a beginning at all unless applied in that spirit. a beginning if everything had been taxed indiscriminately. honourable member, and I think the Victorian Tariff was in some respects very sensible. under that Tariff. miners' machinery to the broad current of intelligence.

333,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"The return which tliis honourable member got for responding to the invitation of the Government was that the Minister for Trade and Customs insulted him in the grossest way. Is that the way in which the Government expect to get their Tariff through this House? Whatever else the Minister for Trade and Customs may do about the Tariff, he cannot bully it through this Chamber. The sooner he realizes that simple fact the better it will be for the Tariff, and for his own comfort and health. The Minister prolongs debate each sitting. He should never have been appointed to take charge of the Tariff, because he is utterly unsuited for the work. He would have been much better suited with another portfolio. haps ! Minister for Trade and Customs. If he had allowed the Treasurer or some other colleague to take charge of the Tariff from time to time, it would have passed through committee by now. The right honourable member causes trouble and delay by the abusive remarks which he constantly addresses to honourable members opposite. He taunted us to-night with being the so-called friends of the mining industry. He, at any rate, can be called a friend of the manufacturing industry. dustry in particular. He looked after that industry very carefully and well. For the first time in the history of responsible Government we have had a Minister taking suggestions from his officers in regard to matters of policy. Ministers have always been in the habit of consulting their officers in order to obtain information, but I never before knew a Minister to ask his officers for suggestions as to matters of policy. Reports are obtained from officers as to whether a duty can be modified or manipulated to establish an industry, and one of the pernicious results of the Victorian system is that some oflicers now deem it to be their duty to advise the Minister from time to time that certain articles can be manufactured within the Commonwealth if protective duties are placed upon them. These are the sources of information upon which the right honourable gentleman has based his free list If he knew a little more about the industrial life of the Commonwealth, he would not be so abusive of honourable members who have devoted their whole energies to its expansion. MON ) I ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the question before the Chair. The conduct of the Minister is not now under discussion. for complaint in the tone and attitude adopted by the Ministeri n connection with the free list. If he had a spark of that manliness which he sometimes affects he would have withdrawn the remarks he made about the honourable member for Kooyong, and apologized for having made them. We are asking to-night for fair and square dealing in regard to the industrial enterprises of the continent. We say that the manufacturing industry should not be singled out for specially favorable treatment. If the tools of trade used in manufacturing are to be exempt, so should the tools of trade used by the primary producers be exempt. But instead of being .willing to exempt the miners' tools of trade, Ministers seem to go about seeking little items upon which they can increase the taxation of the miners. The safety lamps, which are used in only a few mines, are placed upon the free list, but all other miners' lamps are taxed. Not a thing that the miner uses, except forks, is on the free list, and in regard to forks And of the salt industry. the Minister might have allowed the Opposition credit for having brought the matter under his notice. I suppose, however, he will refer to that exemption as an instance of what he has done for the miners. I have long since come to the conclusion that he is a sort of political Bashi-Bazouk, and does not deal very largely in fairness as a political quality. We have a right to demand fair and equal treatment for the miners. Mr O'MALLEY -Hear, hear. member seems to think that a duty of 15 per cent, is fair treatment for the miners of the west coast of Tasmania, who have done ' so much to build up the wealth and prosperity of that country. What the Opposition desire is that the miner who endangers his life every day, and obtains no protection for his productions, but has to compete against foreign rivals, should be given the same treatment as tlie manufacturer who is protected.

It has been argued that under protection things are cheaper; but if the manufacturers really believe that statement, why do they not ask for a duty upon thentools of trade in order that they may get them more cheaply ? B ut they do not believe it . Even miners' oil is taxed. . That is an article which enters largely into the daily consumption of a miner. Then there is a tax of from 20 per cent, to 25 per cent, upon blasting material. A miner-to plagiarize a forcible statement of the honourable and learned member for Indi-ca n use nothing but taxed tools, eat nothing but taxed food, and wear nothing but taxed clothes. It is time that Ministers looked away from the State of Victoria, and took note of the surging industrial activity of the Commonwealth. If they did that, I am certain that they would considerably modify their Tariff, and would treat the mining industry more favourably than they are now disposed to do. wish to assist in the expansion of this debate, which I think has gone on rather too long. If we do not proceed at a more rapid pace, I am very much afraid that we shall not get the Tariff through until the Minister looks much older than he does now. sitting here all through the year. or two words in regard to the proposed exemption of mining machinery. I hardly think that very much is to be added to what was said by me in regard to this matter three months ago at the time of the censure debate. I reminded the Minister for Trade and Customs, who is personally very popular in Western Australia, that it is a bad way to repay the gratitude and the confidence of the people of that Statei n him to increase the duty upon mining machinery from 5 per cent, to 25 per cent., and to tax every commodity which the working miner uses. I want to show him to-night-and when I have made this observation I shall have finished-that, although he may succeed in compelling the users of mining machinery to obtain that machinery within the Commonwealth, in so doing he will be inflicting a very great wrong upon them. Especially in Western Australia, where mining machinery has to be carted sometimes for several hundred miles, its initial cost is slight compared to tlie cost of cartage and erection. What is really important is that the people who work the mines shall get the very best machinery possible, because, apart altogether from the Kalgoorlie mines-wher e the grade of ore is falling, and will continue to fall, and where the margin of profit is becoming less and less-w e have to consider the enormous area of country which is auriferous, and where the prospectors are working their own properties. If a man has to cart a battery for 200 or 300 miles, or even for 100 miles, the difference between the price of the foreign battery as compared with that of one locally manufactured is comparatively of little account, because by the time he gets his machine erected on the mine, the cost of the carriage is very much greater than the original cost of the battery. The experience in Western Australia is that these colonial batteries work very well for about twelve months, and then get out of repair. The result is that the people who use them have to spend a large sum in repairs, and are put to great inconvenience through the delay. I do not wish the Ministry to take my word on this point, but in support of my statement. I shall quote what is said by one of the best known mining men in Western Australia. it is, and I deny his statement. It is Mr whom I am referring. I thought the gans, whose experience is, I believe, much the same as Mr Hall's. Both these gentlemen know their business, and know a great deal more about mining than do the members of this committee. I quote Mr Hall because he is an acknowledged minincr authority. good man, but he is wrong on this point. speaking from his own experience, and what he says is borne out by the general experience of mining men in Western Australia. He says in effect that it is essential these miners should get the best machinery, and that can only be obtained ""from abroad.

The men who face the perils of life in the back blocks are entitled to be placed in as good a position as are the artisans of Melbourne, who have all the advantages of gardens, parks, theatres, and so on. I think it very unwise and undesirable that the Tariff should place handicaps upon the pioneers and upon the men who carry on the primary industries of Australia; and the present is not the time for us to pile upon the mining industry charges which can only have the effect of reducing employment and shutting down properties which might otherwise be profitably worked in various parts of the Commonwealth. to have been made as to the good faith of the Government in connection with the duty on mining machinery. I previously stated that the impression created in my mind was that the Government would allow all patented machinery to be placed upon the free list. I now propose to quote from llansa-rd certain statements made by the Treasurer, which, I think, will show that we have had good reason for all we have said. Subsequent to the division being taken on machinery, I understood that the Government were desirous that a list should be supplied of those articles which could not be manufactured within the Coumionwealth. I was one of those members who were particularly interested in the mining industry, and one who represented an exclusively mining constituency, but I supplied no list whatever. One honourable member, who went to a good deal of trouble to make up his list, on presenting it to the Government, met with such a reception as I think will not encourage other honourable members to follow his example. The reason I did not supply the list was that, in the first place, I considered it utterly impossible to supply a list that would be in any way complete. If we desired to supply a list of patented machinery that could not be reasonably produced within the Commonwealth, we should have to obtain particulars of all the importers' goods-thos e imported by Fraser and Chalmers, and other similar firms-and 27 D even then that list would not be complete. There is plenty of machinery which is patented at the present time, and which is not used within the Commonwealth, but which it may be necessary to introduce within a very short time. Further than this, in connection with the mines in many parts of Australia where they have to deal with refractory ores, almost every mine uses a different class of machinery, and the various articles comprised in mining machinery and appliances are endless. If we were to attempt to supply a list of patented articles which could not be manufactured within the Commonwealth, and made some omissions, which we naturally would do under the circumstances, the onus would be placed upon us of having supplied an incomplete list. I declined to be placed in such a position, and the only way out of the difficulty seems to be to treat all mining machinery alike. refer to some statements which W it h reference to the offer made by the Government, I wish to quote"" what the Treasurer stated as reported in ffa,nsard, page 8,914. The Treasurer saidWhat we propose to do is to specify as far as we can in the exemption list all those articles which should be exempted from duty, a number of which have been mentioned. No doubt honourable members who have a knowledge of what is required will give us further information. We shall be glad to investigate such information, and see whether the articles mentioned should be placed on. the Jree list. The information sought for is indicated in another sentence further on in the same speech. The Treasurer saidWe are prepared to reduce the duty on those articles which are imported, and to go the length of making patented portions, and all patented machines which cannot be made here, absolutely free. I ask honourable members whether that does not exactly convey the impression which honourable members have stated was given to them by the statement of the Treasurer, and yet when an honourable member accepts the statement of the Treasurer in good faith, he is subjected to gross insult Then the Treasurer goes on to sayThen we will call on the committee to deal with engines, boilers, and pumps. We can deal with those separately or together. It will then be competent for honourable members to suggest any other' articles that they think ought to be subjected to the lower duty.

He stated that there were other important branches of business employing patented machinery^ and the Treasurer then said that his proposal did not refer toall patented machinery. verting to the quotation which I have already made, that all patented machinery or portions thereof would be exempted, I say it is absolutely wrong of the Treasurer to urge that the statements therein contained did not influence' the committee the statement immediately prior to the division taking place. After Sir George Turner had spoken, the Minister for Trade and Customs addressed a few words to the committee, but did not refer to the question of exemptions at all. Then the division took place. Irrespective of what statements had previously been made, the Treasurer declared that he would go the length of making patented portions of machinery, and all patented machinery which cannot be manufactured locally, absolutely free. That was the last statement by a Minister, and if the Ministry vary in their statements-as frequently do-surely tliose who took part in the division would rely upon their final statement, and not upon those which had previously been made. That being so, the Minister for Trade and' Customs is entirely wrong in reflecting upon honourable members who have quoted those statements, and in declaring that they did not affect the decision of the committee. After the division in regard to the imposition of a 10 per cent, duty upon mining 27 D i machinery had taken place, and without any further statement by Ministers, a proposal was made to make the rate 15 per' cent. This was negatived on the promise given by the Ministry, which promise has not been fulfilled. Seeing that the Government have made a promise which they cannot fulfil, every opportunity ought to be am quoting from givenfcohonorable members to review their The reply of the previous decision. ha,s been called to the statement which I at all. When the made immediately before the division upon the proposal to impose a duty of 20 percent, upon mining machinery. That statement certainly went further than I thought AnotherI have told the committee that the mere fact of machinery being patented was not a reason why we should place it upon the list of exemptions. However, I am not going to have it said that anything which I stated misled honourable Admembers, and that upon the strength of my statement a vote was wrongly obtained. I mining know that the division was very close, and no doubt some honourable members were influenced by the statement which I made,.: and entertained the impression that I intended all patented mining machinery to be in their decision. It was admitted free. Under these circumstances made by the Minister there is no other course open to me but to intimate that the Government will allow, honourable members an opportunity at a later stage of re-discussing the item and taking a fresh vote upon it . that tlie Treasurer has taken the course which everyone who knows him expected him to take. But I would point out' that it is a singular misfortune that the Minister for Trade and Customs should get up to prove that the Treasurer did not make the promise which has been referred to, and that his own colleague should rise half a they minute later and admit that he had made it, and that theitem should be reconsidered. The statement of the Treasurer has disarmed every member of the committee. There will not be another word said about the matter. But I do hope that the Minister for Trade and Customs will do the right thing in reference to a certain event which occurred earlier in the evening. By withdrawing the imputation which he cast upon the honor-' able member for Kooyong, he will be doing only bare justice to himself.",64,Smith There Has Been For Macquarie To Now Propose That We

368,"Forrest, Sir J. Mr Knox","I am not prepared to say.I know, as a purchaser, that engines possessing this patent valve motion have been made at Castlemaine, and are doing most excellent work. But, at the same time, we ought to have regard to the patentee who has gone to considerable labour and expense in conducting the experiments which have brought this valve to the present state of perfection ; and it is one valve motion which is included in the pumps, compressors, and blowing engines. I shall submit my amendment with the qualification that engines of this character and possessing this valve are already made here of a very serviceable type. I have tried to estimate the relative value of the patented parts, and taking 100 as the whole, I find that the movement itself is worth 35 per cent., and, with the cases, 40 per cent. I contend, therefore, that 40 per cent, of these engines should be free, and that 60 per cent, should bear a reasonable duty in the interests of the local producer. I move That the following exemptions be added :Engines (with patented valve motions), Riedler pumps, Riedler compressors, Riedler blowing engines. The honourable member for Kooyong asks us to allow engines with a specially patented valve motion to come in free, although such engines would compete with other engines manufactured within the Commonwealth. He does not ask that the special patented part-the valve motion-shoul d be admitted free ; that would be a reasonable request. the effect of the amendment if carried. The amendment would allow all engines with patented valve motions to come in free. manufacturers of such engines a bonus of 20 per cent. think we should give a special advantage to any particular patentee. If the honourable member had proposed that tliis patent and all other patents which may compete with it should come in free, there would be some reasonableness in the request. I hope the committee will not accept the amendment. upon consideration the honourable member for Kooyong will see that the admission r which he has made proves this proposal to be either inadvisable or unworkable. He tells us that he has made a calculation which shows that the value of the patented parts of these engines is about 40 per cent, of their total value, and he proposes that that 40 per cent, shall be admitted free, and that the remaining 60 per* cent, shall be dutiable. I venture to think that such an arrangement would be unworkable. A t any rate there would be endless differences between the Customs officers and the importers. The honourable member must know that a very large proportion of imported engines have patented valve motions. Nearly every manufacturer of engines has his patents. Then there are engines manufactured within the Commonwealth whose valve motions may or may not be patented. The fact that some oi these engines have patented valve motions does not prove that they are better than engines with unpatented valve motions ; but the amendment will practically remove engines with patented valve motions from the 20 per cent, list to the free list, so that it would not be long before all imported engines had patented valve motions. I have known of patents being introduced which were rather a disadvantage than an improvement to the machine, but which were used in order to prevent imitation, and something of that kind would happen if the honourable member's amendment were carried, because what the honourable member suggests is somewhat similar to allowing a man to patent the top of his little finger, and then ask that his. whole body be admitted free. The Riedler compressors and pumps perform a function which is performed by other pumps and compressors which may or may not 'do the work equally well. The only patented machinery which we should admit free of duty is machinery to do some special work which other machinery cannot do. Patented machinery that comes into competition with other patented or locally made machinery, should not be allowed to come in free. Surely the Commonwealth maker, whose manufacture is patented, is as much entitled to protection against the foreign maker, whose manufacture is patented, as the Commonwealth maker without a patent is entitled to protection against the foreign maker without a patent. now the committee understand the exact proposal of the Treasurer, and the difficulty",66,Georg E Turner T H E Amendment T UN I T Y Which I Should Take To P U T Myself

375,Mr Knox (Kooyong),"I hope thatthat will be experienced in estimating the value of these patented parts. The speeches of the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, and the honourable and learned member for Corinella accentuate that difficulty. The particular valves which have been referred to cannot be made ii> any other State of the Commonwealth except Victoria, where through some -accident, they were not patented; and they cannot be used without risk to the companies using them. I am quite prepared to withdraw the amendment, having brought -distinctly under the attention of the committee the difficulty that will confront the -department if it attempts to make the distinction which the Minister proposes. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. has already taken the objection that it is wrong to mention the names of specific makers in connection with special manufactures, and I agree with h i m that it is not desirable. But one of the disadvantages attending this extraordinary exemption list is that it can hardly be avoided. W it h regard to my proposal to place ""Green rotary pressure blowers "" upon the free list, I find that the Treasurer has wisely provided for this by making all blowers for smelting purposes exempt. -economisers and superheaters, they are used very largely in association with Babcock -and Wilcox boilers. misers and superheaters largely manufactured in all the States? to be disrespectful to the local manufacturer whose works I want to see increase, I may say that they are not considered serviceable for the larger undertakings. The difficulty to which I have already referred is accentuated in this case, because it is unfair to the local manufacturer to say that he is not able to manufacture heat economisers and superheaters which are serviceable to the smaller class of boilers. It is absolutely impossible for the Customs department to make a list which will meet the whole of the conditions without dispute, without trouble and without ultimate loss of revenue and probable loss to our local manufacturers. One of the mining com. panies on the Mount Lyell field in Tasmania is landing superheaters and economizers which will cost Â£5,000. It is estimated that these appliances will effect such a saving in fuel that they will pay for themselves in eighteen months. Surely in the present depressed condition of mining, caused by the low price of metals, it is desirable that such enterprise should be encouraged. I think I am justified in asking that economisers and superheaters which are patented by the Babcox and Wilcocks Company of Engineers should be admitted free of duty. They have special merits, and as tliey have been only recently patented all over the world, they cannot be produced here without consent. I move That the following exemptions be added :""Economisers, superheaters."" the committee can possibly agree to place all economisers and superheaters on the free list, because it is admitted that these articles are very largely made throughout the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Kooyong appears to desire to limit the application of the exemption of these articles to those made by a particular firm. The more we look into the matter, the more we consider it to be impossible to comply with these suggestions. If we attempt to limit the exemptions to articles made by certain individuals, we may find in a few W it h regard to heat months that a better class of article is made under' some other patent. W it h regard to these articles we think we ought either to put the whole of them on the free list or make them dutiable, as otherwise we A r e not economay do great injustice all round. As the superheaters and economisers are largely made within the Commonwealth, the committee would not be justified in admitting them free of duty.
