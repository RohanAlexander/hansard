For those reasons, amongst others, we to bear with me while I read-and it has been say that people would be well advised to vote read in this debate already-the exact proposal no with respect to this proposal. It achieves that is being put forward. It is set out in the nothing and it has within it a formula for absofollowing words: lute chaos.

It is misleading to describe it as Having gone through this whole exercise about simply a Bill to provide an amendment for fourone vote one value-the importance of enshrinyear terms, because the proposal itself goes much ing it in the Constitution-and having gone further than that. It goes so far that it overturns through the whole exercise of the rhetoric of soone of the very basic principles of our federal called democratic elections, what do we find structure. We can have an argument, if we want, when we come to the third proposal? Do we about the need to have State governments and find that these great principles of one vote one parliaments. We can have an argument, if we value are to be enshrined for local government? like, about the need for a Senate. But, if we No; second best is good enough for local governagree-and I think we all agree in this Housement. Let me repeat: local government bodies, that there is merit in having a system of States, according to this Bill, are to be elected 'in acand if we want those States to continue in some cordance with the laws of the State'. The Ausharmonious relationship, we must have a House tralian Labor Party apparently believes it is all of the Parliament where the interests of the right if StateA establishes local government States are balanced. After all, that is why the bodies to be elected on a property franchise House of Representatives is elected on the basis basis, but StateB has local government bodies of having electorates of roughly equal numbers, elected on a franchise basis determined by and therefore a different number of seats or whether the voter is an owner of property, an electorates from each State, and why, in conoccupier of property or a white adult male owntrast, each State sends to Canberra the same ing property worth $100,000 or more.

That seems to me simply ancient history; it is something which is by itself to be the end of the argument.
