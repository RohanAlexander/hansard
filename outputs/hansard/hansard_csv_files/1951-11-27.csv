12,Mr Treloar,"The question that 1from the fact that extensive bush fires throughout New South Wales and Queensland have destroyed a great deal of fencing. Many landholders are worried about their ability to replace fencing because of the lack of steel posts. They believe that the supply of locally manufactured steel posts is inadequate and they have grave doubts whether there are .sufficient imported posts in the country to enable them to repair fire damage expeditiously. Will the Minister make a survey in order to ascertain whether there are sufficient posts in Australia? If the supply is not adequate, wil] he take action to have it improved? able member's questions to the Minister for National Development and will provide him with a reply as soon as possible. Minister give immediate consideration to the adoption by the Government of a proposal that was made recently by the honourable member for Watson for the granting, by the Government, of a special £10 payment to pensioners at Christmas, in order to permit tbem to have a jubilee Christmas celebration? Minister is aware of the country's debt to pioneers who are now pensioners, and I request that he tell the House, as soon as possible, that he has decided to make the suggested grant available before Christmas. and the measures under it the Government has made a very substantial increase of the payments made to pensioners. It does not propose to' add to that in the course of .this year. the Minister for Social Services whether there is quite a number of unemployable single and married persons for whom employment cannot be found by the Department of Labour and National Service. If this is a fact, is the condition of these Civil Aviation whether he will visit the people due to disease and constant illness ? Is it true that single and married persons receive £1 -5 s. and £2 5s. respectively as unemployed or sickness benefit, and that because they are not deemed to be 85 per cent, incapacitated they are ineligible to receive pensions? Will the Minister discuss with Cabinet the possibility of providing a special Christmas allowance for these people in order to enable them to enjoy Christmas dinner this year, as most other people will enjoy it? raised by the honourable member is always under consideration by my department. In spite of the fact that the Prime Minister has stated that the increase in pensions would be of greater use to pensioners than the payment to them of one sum of £10,1 had hoped that it might be possible to do something for these people at Christmas. However, I searched through the records that were kept in respect of the eight years of Labour administration and could find no precedent for such an action. whether, in view of the fact that the post office is to be removed from King's Hall to allow for greater space there, space will now be available to house those artistic pieces of sculpture, the Lion and the Unicorn, which adorned the Houso of Commons until it was unThe Prime fortunately bombed during the recent war, and which were subsequently presented to this Parliament by the Government of the United Kingdom as historic relics and as a gesture of the goodwill to Australia from the Mother Country? For the two years that I have been a member of this Parliament those relics have been lying in the courtyard and have been shifted round repeatedly. The base of one of them has now been broken.

They had anticipated making such representations at the time of the proposed dehate on the problems of the butter industry between the Minister and me. However, as the Minister at present finds himself unable to proceed with the arrangements for that debate, I ask him whether he will give the people of that area an opportunity to make those representations by making a personal visit to the area in the near future when, I can assure him, he will receive a very warm welcome ? have given me greater pleasure than to have had a debate at Bega on the subject of the dairying industry with such a doughty opponent as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. Unfortunately, the Premier of New South ""Wales ruined the projected debate by surrendering on the butter issue a day or two after the arrangements for the debate had been made. I advised the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that, in view of the New South Wales Government's decision in relation to the price of butter, I did not consider it to be worthwhile to pursue the subject. However, I promise him that in the course of the next two years or so, probably near the time of the next general election, I shall endeavour to visit Bega and shall be very pleased while I am there to answer any questions on the subject of butter or anything else. I should like to visit the honourable member's electorate during the recess if it were possible for me to do so, hut Australia is a big country and there are many places that call for the attention of Ministers. Nevertheless. I shall give consideration to the possibility of paying his electorate a visit. for Health state the benents, if any, for which bush nursing hospitals will be eligible under the new hospital benefits scheme? was raised by the honourable member for McMillan and also by the Victorian Minister for Health. We. have examined the position and it is quite obvious that the terms on which the bush nursing hospitals of Victoria are conducted are such as to permit them to enjoy the full benefits of ' the scheme. I have so informed them and advised them to apply for approval as an insurance organization. Minister for Health refers to the legislation that he proposes to introduce in order to authorize the payment of an increased subsidy for hospital patients who make contributions to an insurance organization. I remind the right honourable gentleman that an industrial subscribers' scheme was in operation on the south coast of New South Wales prior to the operation of the act, which provided for the payment for the treatment in hospital of each subscriber patient, but it ceased to exist when the subsidy was introduced. . Can the Minister inform the House whether the Commonwealth will pay the increased subsidy to the Wollongong Hospital Board, and to similar authorities, if the industrial subscribers' scheme is re-introduced? mittee, which consists of the Commonwealth Actuary ancl a senior officer of the Department of Health, has been appointed to confer with various organizations in connection with the health insurance scheme.

As soon as the Government's legal advisers inform it that it is proper to distribute these moneys legislation will be introduced without further delay and the payments will be made. recall, Mr Speaker, that some weeks ago the honourable member for Macarthur and I addressed to you certain suggestions for the more expeditious printing of Hansard.

I understand that some improvements have already taken place. One suggestion of which I heartily approve' is that the reports of the proceedings of the Senate and the House of Representatives should be published in separate volumes.

If not, why i not ? inquired into by .the honourable member does not lend itself to explanation in a simple answer to a question. The Government will deal with that matter publicly at the proper time. whether it is a fact that Australia's overseas balances are continuing their downward trend and are now below £500,000,000?

However, I doubt whether the negotiations will be at a stage that will enable me to do it . Minister for Immigration announced the appointment of a committee to examine the incidence of crime among new Australians. I now ask the Minister whether thnt committee has yet concluded its deliberations. If it has will he make its report available to honourable members? Isi t a fact that some new Australiains who have been charged with criminal offences since their arrival in this country have admitted that"" they had been convicted of crimes of violence prior to leaving their native lands? If so, will he state how this fact may be correlated with his repeated claim that the screening of immigrants is effective? Further, w ill the Minister state whether Sir John Storey, the chairman of the Immigration Planning Council, laid it down as a matter of policy that former membership of the Nazi party was not a bar to the selection of a German as an approved immigrant? If this is so, w ill he state approximately how many former Nazis have been granted permission by the Government to settle in Australia? the honourable member has referred has not yet concluded its investigations. When it does so I hope that, the report which it presents will be in a form that I can make available to honourable members. J shall ensure that as much information as can properly be made public w ill be made public. If any immigrants have committed crimes of violence after their arrival in Australia and have admitted the conimission of similar crimes prior to their coming to this country, I assume that, because they have been here sufficiently long for those things to have happened, they were selected during the term of office of my predecessor. I do not know of any specific cases of that supplies me with details of the cases that he has in mind, I shall ascertain If I am in a. position to the precise circumstances. I have not available the ful'I text of any public statement that Sir John Storey may have made about former membership of the Nazi party not necessarily being a bar to entrance to Australia"". I can say only that my understanding, which I should like my 'predecessor in office to check, is that the previous Government did not regard membership of the Nazi party as being an automatic bar to entrance to this country. I have been so advised by the head of my departdone so ment.

If no alteration of policy has been made, will the present ratio in respect of grain for export and for home consumption continue to apply? policy relative to grain sorghum has not been altered as a. result of the recent arrangement regarding wheat for stock feed, which is dependent upon the passing of legislation by the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and of the six States. The Commonwealth must await the outcome of that action. I assure the honourable member for Darling Downs and others who are interested in grain sorghum, that when that legislation has been passed, the implications of the new policy upon the granting of permits for the export of grain sorghum will be examined.

As a great deal of confusion exists regarding the responsibilities of the Australian Government in this matter, will the Treasurer make an early statement to the House to indicate the exact relationship of the Commonwealth and the States regarding local government finance Such a statement will clarify the position. ask for the leave of the House at an appropriate time this afternoon in order to make a statement on loan requirements, the general financial position of local government and other authorities, and the relationship of such organizations with the Loan Council. Later: Treasurer) -by leaveA good deal has been said in this House lately about the difficulties which are being experienced by various semi-governmental authorities and local government authorities of the States in raising loan moneys for works and other purposes. In one way or another, the Commonwealth is being blamed for those difficulties, and therefore, I wish to make a brief statement on the position. From the statements which have been made on the subject in Parliament and elsewhere, I judge that the facts are not so well known as they should be, and there seems to be .a lot of misunderstanding about who is actually responsible for the finances of the local authorities. As I have pointed out recently on another matter, the Australian Loan Council, not this Government, controls the raising of loan moneys by Commonwealth and State governments for civil purposes. The Loan Council is a constitutional body, which comprises representatives of the States and thu Commonwealth. The Loan Council decides that a certain amount of money is to be borrowed and determines the conditions as to rate of interest and terms. The Com-",19,Newspapers

53,Sir Arthur Fadden (Mcpherson,"monwealth, acting as the instrument of the Loan Council, endeavours to raise the money in its own name and then distributes the actual proceeds to the several Governments in accordance with the programmes approved by the Loan Council. The present issue, however, relates to borrowings, not by or for State governments as such, but for various public authorities within the States, such as municipal ancl shire councils, county councils, water and sewerage boards, electricity undertakings and so on. Those bodies are formed under State laws, and responsibility for them rests entirely with for itself to determine. In practice, the tlie 'States concerned. In some cases, State governments have given those bodies the power to borrow, with or without a State or government guarantee, and the bodies concerned seek to raise loans on their own account, either by public issues or from private sources. Borrowings bodies are not subject to the Financial Agreement, and, consequently, the Loan Council has no legal authority in regard to them. However, hy a voluntary arrangement which was made some years ago, the Premiers of all the States agreed to submit the programmes of those bodies each year to the Loan Council. That arrangement is known as a gentleman's agreement, and covers those semi-governmental bodies, constituted under Commonwealth or State legislation, whicli prooverall borrowing for public works in the pose to borrow in the aggregate 4'100,000 or more in any one year. Under this gentleman'sagreement, the borrowing programme of each body is submitted to the Loan Council by the Premier of the State concerned. When the programme is approved, each loan which it is proposed to raise thereunder is placed before the Loan Council for its approval of the rate of interest, and the terms. With regard to proposals for borrowing by semi-governmental bodies and local government authorities of less than £100,000 in any one year it has been the practice since the war years for the Loan Council to be informed, through the Coordinator-General of Works and the Premiers, of the total amount of such proposed borrowing in each State, and for the approval of the Loan Council of the aggregate programmes to be obtained. Sir Arthur Fadden. However, it should be clearly understood that neither the Loan Council nor the Commonwealtli has the power or tbe responsibility to arrange the raising of loans for semi-governmental bodies and local government authorities. To some extent, of course, State governments borrow money for local or other authorities, and include the amounts required for that purpose in their own governmental programmes. Whether a State does so, or whether it allows authorities within its jurisdiction to seek their own loanfinanceis entirely a matter policies of State governments in this regard vary widely. In South Australia ancl Western Australia, for example, there is comparatively little borrowing by semi-governmental or local authorities on their own account. In New South Wales and Victoria, semi-governmental borrowby semi-governmental ing programmes have reached huge totals. It is, I think, correct to say that one reason why, in the past, semi-governmental and local authorities in some States have been given borrowing powers, and have been permitted and even encouraged by the State authorities to raise their own loan moneys is that it was desired to keep their finances outside the purview of the Loan Council, ancl to increase the States. At the meeting of the Loan Council last August, the programmes of semi governmental bodies which were submitted under the gentleman's agreement by four States-Ne w South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Tasmaniatotalled £81,634,000. After the Loan Council had decided to reduce the programmes of State governments by 25 per cent., each of the four Premiers concerned undertook to use his best endeavours to ensure that the principle of a 25 per cent, reduction would be observed with regard to those semi-govemmental borrowing proposals. That undertaking it may be noted, referred to the total proposed borrowing for the respective States. It did not necessarily apply to individual proposals within the programmes. The Co-ordinator-General of Works also informed the Loan Council of programmes for borrowings by local authorities and others of amounts less than £100,000 which, in total, amounted to £13,S90,000. £12,317,000 was for authorities in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. The Loan Council approved thbse programmes as a whole, without alteration. Let me now try to re-state the position so that there may be no shadow of doubt about it. With regard to the governmental programmes which the Loan Council reduced from £300,000,000 to £225,000,000. the Commonwealth agreed that, to the extent that loan raisings during the year fell short of £225,000,000, it would arrange finance for the balance out of its own resources. With regard to the programmes of the semi-governmental bodies and local authorities, the raising of the moneys which are required is wholly the responsibility of the States and those authorities. If some semi-governmental and local authorities are now finding it difficult to raise loans, it is, I suggest, fundamentally for the same reasons that governments themselves are finding it difficult to secure the loan moneys they would like to have. That is because the demand for capital for public investment, taken with the competing demands for capital for private investment, has risen above the amount which the market will yield. I point out that this year, the approved borrowing programmes for governments and semi-governmental and local authorities, even after the reductions which have been made by the Loan Council, total £321,000.000. 'which is £86,000,000 more than actual borrowings last year and £179,000,000 more than borrowings in 1949-50. Obviously, a limit had to be reached at one time or another. The steep rise in borrowings by semi governmental and local authorities during recent years has played no small part in swelling the total demand for loan moneys. Actual raisings by such bodies are estimated to have been as follows:Yunr. 1947-48 1948-49 1949-50 1950-51 1951-52 (Programmes) 96.0 We are told now that these bodies have extensive forward commitments on contracts and similar obligations which were Of that amount, entered some time ago. If that is so, it surely reveals an extraordinary state of affairs. It means, in plain words, that those authorities went ahead to let contracts and place orders for long periods into the future without knowing whether they could, or could not, be financed when the accounts had to be met. It means also that the State governments, under whose administration those bodies come, allowed them to enter into those commitments without doing anything to cover their position. The State governments allowed those authorities to do so in spite of clear indications and strong and specific warnings from the Commonwealth that it was becoming increasingly difficult to meet the ever-increasing demand for loan money. Now that these bodies are encountering difficulties, they are trying to pass the responsibility to the Commonwealth. It is another form of the same criticism to say that the present difficulties are due to the credit policy of the Commonwealth. This, of course, could mean any one of several things. It could mean, for example, that the Commonwealth is preventing banks or insurance companies or private people from lending to local authorities. In that case, it is certainly untrue. The Commonwealth does not control lending by insurance companies, superannuation boards and the like, and the private trading banks are permitted Under the advance policy instructions issued by the Commonwealth Bank to lend to local authorities for all usual purposes. It might, again, be taken to imply that the Commonwealth Bank has been cutting down, on its lending to these bodies. There, again, it is certainly untrue. The Commonwealth Savings Bank has always invested a portion of its funds in loans to local authorities, and the Governor of the bank has informed me that the activities of the Savings Bank Department in this Amount. respect have not in any way diminished. £m. In fact, in the current financial year, that .. 21.8 department is making such loans at a .. 29.7 greater rate than ever before. The bank, .. 49.6 however, has obligations to other classes .. 69.4 of customers, including home builders, and finds it impossible to meet the demands of all these bodies which now find that, at a time when their loan requirements have been heavily increased, some of their main sources of supply have temporarily vanished. Yet again, it might be intended to mean that the Commonwealth is refusing to call upon central bank credit to finance loan programmes. In that case, it certainly is true and, what is quite as much to the point, it is going to remain true. There have been strong suggestions from a number of sources that the Commonwealth should resort to such a policy. The Government, however, looks upon that policy as a short-cut to disaster and refuses to countenance it in any circumstances. In repeating by way of conclusion that the responsibility in this matter belongs to the State governments concerned, I point out that there will be available this year for spending by the State governments and semi-governmental and local authorities the full amount of the borrowing programmes approved by the Loan Council, which is £225,000,000, together with the money that will be raised by the semi-governmental and local authorities themselves. In total, that is certain to amount to very considerably more than was available to them in 1950-51. The problem for the State governments and their instrumentalities is essentially that of making these funds go around. the table the following paper:Sugar-Protoco l relating to the International Sugar Agreement (signed in London, 3Lst August, 1951). This protocol has been signed in London by representatives of the governments of the Union of South Africa, Commonwealth of Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Dominican Bepublic, French Bepublic, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Hayti, Eepublic of the United States of Indonesia, Mexico, Netherlands, Peru, Bepublic of the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, United States of America and the Federal People's Bepublic of Yugoslavia. This protocol is similar to that which was signed on the 31st August, 1950, and extends the International Sugar Agreement, which initially operated for five years from the 1st September, 1937, for a further period of one year to the 31st August, 1952. The protocol provides that certain articles of the original agreement, particularly those which relate to export quotas, shall be inoperative. An important feature of the protocol is that countries which sign it agree that revision of the original agreement is necessaiy, and should be undertaken as soon as the time appears opportune. The original agreement is to be taken as the starting point in any discussions of such revision. Discussions have been taking place in recent months between representatives of countries interested regarding the terms of a new agreement and further meetings are scheduled for the near future.

These matters have not previously been before me, except that last week there was an attempt to move for the formal adjournment of the House, and the honourable member for East Sydney started to make a speech on the matter. To my mind the core of this question is the first sentence of the motion, and the other matters mentioned are the reasons why the honourable gentleman wishes to discuss the circumstances that he has outlined. The other matters are included inThe injury being suffered by the people of Australia, especially workers on small wages and those on fixed incomes, . . .

Mr ""WARD -The gravest charge that can be made against any government is that it has made extravagant election promises which it has no intention^ of redeeming. One of the election promises able gentleman is definitely out of order made by the Government on a number of in attempting to discuss anything that has occasions was that it intended to reverse taken place in the Senate during this the order of things and put value back session. into the £1. Of course, it has now become rather inconvenient for the Government to admit having made that promise, and I accept your ruling. The Minister for therefore it is attempting to deny it. The National Development (Senator Spooner) Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), in replying to a question directed to him by the honourable jnember for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron), denied ever having made the promise, so I shall make a brief reference to the statement he actually made in his policy-speech during the 1940 general election campaign. He saidPerhaps our greatest charge against the financial and economic policy of the present socialist Government is that whilst it has paid a good deal of attention to increasing the volume and circulation of money it has largely neglected tlie problem of what and how much that money will buy. The greatest task, therefore, is to get value back into the £1, that is, to get prices down. The Prime Minister admitted that that was the greatest task that confronted, his Government. If he fails in that greatest task-and the Government has failed in it-the n his Government deserves the I might gravest condemnation of the people. The Prime Minister cannot argue that the Government, lacks power to act in relation to inflation and high prices, because he and his party published a number of election advertisements in which they referred to the Chifley Government's "" fake excuses for high prices exposed by actual facts "". One advertisement statedThe Federal Labour Government is entirely to blame for the present extortionate cost of living and for tlie fact that prices have steadily increased since tlie Chifley Government "" controlled"" them. No faked excuse will convince Australia to the contrary. This Government possesses all the powers that the Chifley Government possessed when it went out of office in 1949. SoI say to the Government that the public will not be satisfied with any fake excuses on its part for its failure to honour its election promises. If the House wishes further evidence of whether the promises not. were actually made, I refer it to an answer to a question that was given by the Minister for Trade and Custom. 0 (Senator O'Sullivan) in the Senate Mr ""WARD -Very well, Mr Speaker,",24,Format Motion Fob Adjouknment

67,Mr Speaker,"Order! The honorhas said that the A l problem facing Australia is inflation and that defence is secondary. ""What has the Government done about inflation? I have some relevant figures on that matter. In 1949, the cost of living was certainly increasing, because at that time the Commonwealth had lost the power to control prices. Price rose in that year by 9.3 per cent. In 1950, when this anti-Labour Government was in office, the cost of living rose by 12 per cent. This year it is estimated that the cost of living will increase by 20 per cent., and I believe that that estimate will be exceeded. For the first time in the history of this country unfortunate Australian citizens are obliged to secure their Christmas dinners on a time-payment basis. The Prime Ministei"", in answer to a question to-day, spoke about the increase of pensions that the Government had given to invalid and age pensioners, and he said that the Government did not propose to do anything more this year in that direction. I venture the opinion that the Government will not do anything more for these people next year either, although the paltry increase of 10s. that it has already given did not compensate them for the rise in the cost of living that had taken place since their pensions had previously been increased. The position in this country is desperate. What does the Government propose to do? It proposes to close this Parliament up at the end of this week for some months, so that no effective protests can be made on our situation. able gentleman is out of order in discussing, under this motion, the question of when the session will end. time available to me I can deal only with some of the items that have increased in price since the last basic wage increase. 1 shall start with bread. The cost of a 2-lb. loaf of bread to-day is 10^d., and the majority of people, as I have said, depend largely on such staple items of food. It is expected that early in the new year the price of a 2-lb. loaf will rise to Is. because of the increased cost of freights in certain of the wheat-growing States and of other increasing costs. The Australian Baker which is the trade journal of bread manufacturers, saysA loaf of bread may cost 2s. Gd. within a year. Yet the Government claims that it is coping with the internal situation. Honourable members opposite claimed that the Chifley £1 had less than its face value. To-day the Menzies £1 is worth less than 8s. and is rapidly decreasing in value. Now, let us examine the position in respect to other foodstuffs. The Government has accorded relief to a section of the wheat-growers, but not on the basis that the wheat-growers are not getting the cost of production, because the cost of production is guaranteed to them as a result of the figure determined upon by a committee established for that purpose. It has given them relief on another ground. It has told the farmers that, because they may obtain 16s. l d . a bushel for wheat sold overseas under the International Wlieat, Agreement, every consumer in Australia ought to pay the same price, whether or not it is reasonable and fair and regardless of the effect that such a price will have on the cost of living. As a result of the proposal to increase the cost of stock feed wheat from 7s. lOd. to 16s. l d . a bushel, milk will rise from 2d. to 2-Jd. a gallon. According to figures which I have obtained from the office of the Commonwealth 'Statistician, for every ls. increase in the price of stock feed wheat, the price of eggs will rise by l d . a dozen. The price of these staple items is rising beyond the reach of the people. Large sections of the lower paid workers and those on small fixed incomes, such as pensioners, are facing a state of starvation. Honourable members must know of instances of such cases in their own of the limited electorates. In this meat-producing country the best steak now costs from 6s. to 7s. per lb. I will not guarantee the correctness of these figures because I secured them on Friday and the cost of living increases every day. On Friday, the best chops cost from 4s. 6d. to 5s. per lb. Tomatoes were 3s. per lb., beans 3s. 6d. per lb., and peas 3s. per lb. The price of groceries has risen proportionately. According to the Sunday Telegraph, the price of a i-lb. packet of Kraft cheese",25,Format Motion Fob Adjouknment
68,Mr Speaker,Order! The honor,26,Format Motion Fob Adjouknment
69,Mr Wabd,"Becausehas risen to ls. 10d., an increase of 5£d. a packet. As honourable members know, the price of butter has risen from 2s. 2d. per lb. to 3s. l ^ d . per lb. The price of first-quality tea is fixed at 3s. l i d . per lb. and the price of secondquality tea at 3s. 7d. per lb., but it is not possible to buy second-quality tea. The ouly tea that it is possible to buy is classed as "" first quality "". Apples were selling in Sydney on Priday at ls. 3d. each. The Government has prided itself on its scheme to improve the health of the people, yet because of high prices children are being denied an adequate supply of f r u it . The costs of recreation have also increased considerably. A few days after the last basic wage increase was announced on the 4th November to be exact, it was stated in the Sunday Telegraph thatPrice increases last week added at least 25s. to the average 'family budget. That statement was made in a newspaper which supports the Government. Economists and experts such as the honourable professor for Warringah ( Mr Bland) have admitted that the basic wage w ill increase by from £ 1 to £1 10s. in the next quarter. How can the Government permit of these sittings of the Parliament to terminate without doing, anything to relieve the desperate position of the people? the same problem exists, the cost of living has been decreased by removing duties on certain commodities. Why has this Government not introduced prices control. During the course of the policyspeech which he made in 1946 the Prime Minister said, in regard to prices controlWe shall unhesitatingly maintain it as a means of preventing inflation during the period in which production is inadequate to meet the demand for goods. Production has not met demand. D i d the Government continue the system of prices control? D i d not the Government sivpporters, when speaking on the referendum proposals that were put forward in 1948, advise the people to return this power to the States? The Prime Minister continuedLet me. speaking for the Government which introdured price control, give the lie direct to those whisperers who tell you that a itr. Ward. Liberal victory will mean an upward leap in prices. We stand for controlled prices. Xo promises will be made recklessly by the Liberal party. We Imve carefully and soberly studied Australia's problems. What we promise we shall perform. Later, after having assisted in bringing about the defeat of the referendum proposals of 194S, the Prime Minister saidThe Government is actively co-operating with the States in the maintenance of price control. A t the conference of State Ministers in charge of prices which was held in Canberrai n November of 1950 and which the Prime Minister attended it was proposed by the State Ministers that the Commonwealth should delegate a senior Minister to attend conferences of State Ministers in charge of prices control. The Prime Minister said that the Commonwealth could not agree to the proposal. Later, in this House, the Prime Minister said that the Government, intended that a high-ranking officer should maintain liaison with such State Ministers. The Government has not arranged for anybody to f u l f i l that function and the States have pressed the Commonwealth to assume control of prices. In order to illustrate the extent to In New Zealand, where which excess profits have been made in this country I have selected a few in stances at random from the newspapers. The profit of the British Standard Machinery Company Limited in 1949 was £37,700. In 1951 it was £101,500, an increase of 170 per cent, in two years. That profit was made after deducting the sum of £96,800 for taxation purposes. That was an increase of £52,600 on the preceding year and after provision had been made for a cash reserve of £75,000. Commercial and manufacturing undertakings have made such huge profits that their great problem is to hide the fact from the public. Grocery and General Merchants Limited made a net profit of £177,000 last year, an increase of £66.000 over the preceding year. That profit was made after deducting £105,000 for taxation, an increase of £59,000 in the corresponding amount for the previous year and after placing to reserve £50,000, and to cash reserves £27,000. A similar story he should have confined his remarks to can be told in relation to Tecnico the motion that is actually before the Limited. Standard Cars Limited made a House. net profit of £550,000, an increase of more than £54000 over the preceding be divided into two or three very simple year after £692,800 had been set aside sections. I shall deal logically and for taxation purposes, an increase sensibly with each section, and endeaof £197,000 on the corresponding vour to dissipate tbe illogical and unfigure for the preceding year.

Savings bank deposits have now reached tlie staggering sum of £800,000,000. Therefore, it seems that the community is not suffering nearly as much as the lionorable member for East Sydney would have us believe they are. The next section of the honourable member's submission relates that workers on small wages are suffering. I wish that the honourable member had indicated who those people are, because according to thc figures available to me, while the basic wage is £10 a week, at present the average wage of men employed in Australia is £13 a week. Goods have risen in price, but so also have wages. More significant is the fact that real wages have risen. Although the cost of living has increased, real wages have increased since 1939 by more than 7 per cent. The figures that I have been quoting have been supplied to me by the Commonwealth Statistician. The next section of tlie lionorable memthese houses. Totally and permanently ber's submission refers to people on fixed incomes, and there may be some substance in his claims in this connection. Among tliose people may be found sioners, people drawing superannuation payments and those thrifty souls who have saved a few pounds for their old age. Even if we freely admit that that section of the community is feeling the burden of rising costs more than any other, the question arises "" What has the Government done about it? "" The honourable member for East Sydney said that it had done nothing. Let us briefly review some of this Government's legislation to see how it has reacted on the people concerned. Consider first the people who draw Commonwealth payments. This Government has twice given them cost-of-living adjustments. We also raised the income tax limits so that if a person has a small income or is drawing a pension he will not have to pay income tax unless he is earning more than £234 a year. The income limit in the case of a married couple is £468 a year. This Government eased the means test so that age ancl invalid pensioners could earn, without losing any of their pensions, 30s. a week instead of 20s. a week. We raised the property limits from £500 to £1,000 and we raised the statutory exemption limits of surrender value of insurance policies held by such people. Consider now war widows. There is no more deserving group in the country than these women. Let us ascertain: what this Government has done for them r and compare it with what the Government of which the honourable member for East Sydney was a senior Minister, did for them. When this Government assumed oflice the war widows were being paid £3 a week. To-day they get £5 2s. a week. The allowance for their children, which was l is . 6d. a week under the Labour Government, is now 22s. a week. Their domestic allowance was increased to £1 12s. a week, and educational benefits may be awarded to the children of these widows up to the value of £3 5s. a week. Under the Labour Government, no war widow on a pension could obtain a war service home. To-day war widows with one or more children are eligible for incapacitated ex-servicemen received! £5 6s. a week under the Labour Government, and to-day they get £8 15s. a week, penplus other benefits. Let us deal now with age and invalid' pensioners. The honourable member forEast Sydney referred scornfully to tbeincreases given to these people by the Government. He scoffed at the 7s. 6d. a week increase that we provided last year and the 10s. a week that we have provided this year. In this little black book of mine I have a record of what has been done in this regard by previous Labour governments. Although the honourable memher for East Sydney criticized this Government for superannuation granting increases of 7s. 6d. and 10s.. a week, a. Labour government, of which he was a member, granted an increase of 6d. a week. Six times Labour governments increased these pensions by 6d. a week, and once a Labour govern-ment made a reduction of 6d. a. week. In . the light of those factshonorable menibers will be able to evaluatethe criticisms of these five and ten cent philanthropists. We have increased theage and invalid pension rate fromi",28,Format Motion Fob Adjouknment
76,Mr Town,"leu.£2 2s. 6d. to £3 a week. We have given the pensioners free medical service and free medicine; we have increased the allowance for a wife; and we have widened the property provisions, and increased the value of social services in .general until we are now paying out for social services more than 10 per cent, of -the annual national income. We have increased the allowable earnings of blind people from £5 17s. lOd. a week to £10, granted tuberculosis allowances up to £8 5s. a week and provided free life-saving drugs to the people to such the Government is allowing large quanan extent that one-third of all the medicines now prescribed by doctors are paid for by the Government. Only those people who have been attacked by serious illness know what a benefit that is. To -ease the burden of rising prices, we have subsidized all sorts of foodstuffs. Since this Government assumed office it has paid more than £30,000,000 to keep -down the price of butter,' £14,000,000 to keep down the price of tea, £2,000,000 -in wheat subsidy to keep down the price of bread and £30,000,000 to keep down -the price of clothes. Approximately £4,000,000 is to be paid to keep down the price of stock-feed and eggs. The Government, recognizing the needs of the people in the face of rising prices, is subsidizing foodstuffs to an amount of almost £100,000,000. The Government's policy for combating the scourge of inflation has been stated -often. It contains five elements. The first is that we should increase production. during the last war, it was able to make In that connection, honourable members will recall that the Government negotiated & 100,000,000-dollar loan of which .29,000,000 dollars has been expended upon the purchase of agricultural equipment to produce more food, 20,000,000 dollars upon the purchase of heavy earth-moving equipment to clear the land, 26,000,000 dollars upon the purchase of plant for the generation of electricity, and 15,000j000 dollars upon the purchase -of locomotives and other means of transport. The second element, of the Government's policy for combating inflation is. the implementation of a selective immigration scheme under which immigrants can be employed in ways that will be most useful to this country. The Government has taken positive action to achieve greater production by encouraging the importation from overseas of necessary goods and commodities. The list is impressive. It includes 685,000 tons of steel, 375,000,000 super, feet of timber and £S6,000,000 worth of machinery. The Government has also been successful in increasing the production of eoal, upon which the production of so many other things depends. In order to reduce the inflationary pressure caused by too much money chasing too few goods, tities of goods from overseas to enter the Australian market. During the current year, £900,000,000 worth of goods will be brought into this country for that purpose. Other anti-inflationary measures are the restriction of credit facilities, the re-institution of capital issues control, and a bank credit policy designed to divert capital from non-essential channels into channels in which it will be of the gi""e.ti*i>t benefit to the community. , 'fhe honourable member for East Sydney and other honourable gentlemen opposite constantly ignore the fact that, since this Government assumed office, there has been a tremendous change in world affairs and also in the domestic affairs of this country. In the middle of last year, we became involved in war. We have Air Force units in Malaya, and Navy, Army and Air Force units in Korea. The international position has forced us to increase our expenditure upon defence. When the Lahour party was in power use of the National Security Act. At that time, there was a body of nearly .1,000,000 men and women in this country in the services who worked for very long hours at very low rates of pay. Labour governments had authority to fix prices and to peg wages, and they did so. Powers of that kind are denied to this Government, which finds itself in a most anomalous position. We presented a budget that was designed to reduce the inflationary trend. Shortly afterwards, the Commonwealth Arbitration Court made an award which threw an additional £160,000,000 into the economy ter's time has expired.",29,Format Motion Fob Adjouknment
77,Mr Speaker,"Order! The MinisOpposition.) [ 4 . 0 ] I want to make it perfectly clear that the honourable member for East Sydney( MrW a r d ) , in submitting his case, spoke on behalf of the Opposition, which has carefully considered the proposals that he has made. The Ministerf or Social Service( Mr Townley) began his reply to the Opposition's case by making an attack upon the honourable member for East Sydney. He described the honourable gentleman's proposals as political humbug. Although he said fchat he would introduce into the debate an element of calm reasoning, he did not try to answer the Opposition's case. That case rests upon an undertaking that was given by the present Government parties during the 1949 general election campaign to put value back into the £ 1 . Everybody in Australia now associates that phrase with the Government. Honourable members on this side of the House have quoted press advertisement after press advertisement in which that promise was made. An unconditional undertaking was given by the Government to reduce the cost of living and thus increase the internal value of the £1. Does the Minister say that that promise has been kept? Opposition ( D r . Evatt) should read what the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) said shall not repeat it. T said that that was the Government's greatest task, and he was right. tation that I place upon, the advertisements that were published by the Government parties, as a result of which the Minister and other honourable gentlemen opposite were elected. The promise was clear, unequivocal and unconditional. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) has referred on other occasions to the advertisements that appeared in women's journals. promise was made, and it has been broken. There can be no answer to that part of the Opposition's case. The honourable member for East Sydney has cited facts and figures that show the enormous inI second the motion. crease that has occurred in the cost of living. The Minister has admitted that the cost of livin g has increased. He has said that the Government has increased pensions, but he knows perfectly well that those increases will not offset the increased cost of living. What is to be done? The honourable member for East Sydney has made positive proposals. He has suggested, for instance, that legislation should be introduced to deal with excessive profits. Does anybody suppose that profiteering has nothing to do with the increased cost of living? The honourable member for East Sydney has cited half a dozen instances of organizations that are making colossal profits. It cannot be said that those organizations are charging f a i r prices for their goods when their profits are so excessive. When the Prime Minister returned to this country from Englandi n . August last year, he made a broadcast in which he said that the problem of inflation had to be dealt with firmly, and that one of the methods that would be adopted to deal with it was the imposition of an excess profits tax. What has happened since then? The Treasurer ( Sir Arthu r Fadden), when he was asked about the matter during the budget debate of last year, said that we should Leader of the have t.o wait and see what the Government decided to do. The new year came, but no fir m announcement was made by the Government. Now, fifteen or sixteen It has been read. I months after the definite statement by the Prime Minister, we have learned from the Government that the proposal to impose an excess profits tax has heen abandoned. T h a t is not the interpreThe Opposition does not say that any one of the proposals that it has advanced would of itself constitute a remedy for inflation, but it does say that the onus is upon the Government to explain to the people of Australia the positive action that it proposes to take to deal with the economic crisis with which we are faced, and which may result in tragedy and disaster. The honourable member for That East Sydney made a positive suggestion when he referred to the necessity to reintroduce Commonwealth prices control.

82,Dr. Evatt,"immediately solve the problem of inflation. We know that it would not do so. But we say that a firm grip of the situation must be taken. I do not know of any situation in our history that was more ominous than is the present situation. The Government has secured the passage of legislation that will increase prices. That will be the inevitable effect of increases of indirect taxes. The purpose of those increases is to increase prices. Although the Government declared during two general election campaigns that it would reduce the cost of living, it is causing the cost of flow of goods to a particular State beliving to increase by increasing indirect taxation. A Government pledged to --educe the cost of living has increased sales tax by £117,000,000. The Opposition's case in this matter can be summed up in a few propositions with most of which, I believe, the Government will agree. The first of them is that there should be effective prices control on an Australia-wide basis. The Opposition claims that in an emergency period like the present, when conditions are similar to those that existed during war-time, and, in some instances, are actually worse, prices control by the Commonwealth is necessary. wage-pegging? authorities can increase wages either at the base, or in respect of marginal levels; but that limitation does not apply to the control of profits or of prices. The fact is that the Parliament through the Government, is continuing to subsidize the administration of priees control by the States. Therefore, the Parliament upholds the principle of prices control. The point at issue is whether the Commonwealth or the States should exercise that control. According to the States themselves, and according to public opinion, the States have failed to control prices. The States have done their best in that respect, hut conditions have arisen under which goods naturally flow to the State in which the highest prices are charged for them. The Postmaster General( Mr Anthony), when replying to a question without notice this afternoon, referred to the controversy that occurred over the retail price of butter. What happened in that instance? Two of the States, Queensland and New South Wales, thought that the proposed price was excessive. The merits of that argument do not concern us in this matter: but at that time a situation arose in which butter went to the States where the price of that commodity was highest. The only way in which such a situation can be dealt with effectively is by the method that the Commonwealth adopted during the war,_ which was fixation of prices on an Australia-wide basis. Under such conditions there would be no cause prices in it were higher than those for similar goods in other States. The Government should adopt that method. The States wish to give such power to the Commonwealth. I believe that they Would give complete power to thc Commonwealth to deal with the economic emergency that now threatens the community. The Government is pledged to reduce prices, but it is increasing the prices of all goods in respect of which excise duty or sales tax is levied. That is an impossible position. I believe that in the present emergency the States would give to the National Parliament for the period of the emergency all the necessary powers to pass economic regulations, including regulations in respect of prices fixation. The position to-day is that whilst inflation is increasing in some directions, the Government, at the same time, is causing hardship to certain sections of the community by restricting credit. The honourable member for East Sydney referred to those sections of the community. As the Minister has admitted, persons on fixed incomes are suffering the greatest hardship.

I shall deal first with Whereas in 193S-39 the income from State lotteries was ""£4,500,000, revenue in 1945-46 and to £11,750,000 last year. Totalisator investments in 1938-39 amounted to £6,916,000; in 1945-46 to £21,178,000; and in 1949-50 to in 1938-39 was 90,000,000 gallons but tht. I mention those matters in order to show that the expenditure upon non-essentialstwelve years. The statistics prove that lb.; in 1945-46, it totalled 123,600,000 lb. 147,600,000 1b. Opposition members made a great song during the budget debate about what they described as the action of the Government in "" taking candy from the kids "". Therefore, I shall refer to the vexed question of ice-cream. The production of that item in 1938-39 was 4,260,000 gallons. In 1945-46 it had increased to 10,700,000 gallons, and in 1950-51 to 17,190,000 gallons. All these figures disprove the contention that has been advanced by the Opposition that we live in hard times. Everybody knows that prices have increased, but the fact remains that the purchasing power of the people also has increased. If it had not increased, they could not afford to buy ever-increasing quantities of non-essential goods. I shall now refer to more stable matters. difference of opinion exists in conThe national income in 1938 was £713,000,000. B y 1950-51, it had risen to £2,900,000,000. wage for the whole of the Commonwealth in 1945-46 was £6.48 a man, yet in 1950-51 it was £10.9 a man. Does any Opposition member suggest that any person in Australia to-day is not receiving considerably more than the basic wage? We know that sueh is not the case. I refer to another important matter. The average weekly hours of labour in respect of males, excluding overtime, were 44.56 in September, 1939. B y September, 1945, the average had fallen to 43.59 hours and in June, 1951 to 39.96 hours a week. Those figures prove my contention that hours, and production per capita have decreased, while wages have increased. The present inflationary conditions are due to those factors. The houorable member for East Sydney referred to the high prices of goods and services in Sydney. I merely suggest to him that such conditions are due to the administration of the McGirr Lahour Government. able member's time has expired.

130,Mulcahy. D. Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Prim ewill not go on forever and tke number of those affected by it is diminishing. Figures may be of some interest in this connection. In 1950, the Government paid approximately £450,000 to the universities under tlie Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme. In 1951, under the same scheme, it w ill pay about £300,00U. Therefore, as honourable members can see, this form of financial assistance must ultimately come to an end. In those circumstances, the present Government has had before it the great problem of university finances. Each university in Australia is in large measure a State university because it has had to depend to an increasing degree upon grants from its State Parliament. This Government came to the conclusion that, if it were to determine an effective policy for the assistance of universities, it should institute an inquiry in order to discover the true financial position of the universities; that, having before it recommend ations from a committee, it would be in a position to determine what grant, if any, should be made by the Commonwealth and whether the money should be made available, subject to appropriate conditions, to the State Governments or direct to the universities. Therefore, in March, 1950, it appointed a committee to report on the finances of .the universities. The committee consisted of Professor Mills, the Director of the Commonwealth Office of Education as chairman, Professor Sir Douglas Copland, and MrH . J . Goodes, of the Treasury. The terms of reference given to the committee were as follows:1. To examine and report upon the finances of the universities having regard to their facilities for teaching and research, including stalf, huildings and equipment. 2. To examine and report upon the requirements of the universities in relation to the work at present undertaken and to the need for their future development. 3. To make recommendations as to whether any, and if so what, action should be taken toy the Commonwealth to assist universities. Subsequent to the establishment of those terms of reference, another question, minor in a quantitative sense, arose with respect to the residential colleges of the universities and I gave a supplementary -direction to the committee that it should pay attention to the position of resideni'noi tial colleges as a part of its consideration of the universities problem generally. A very complete preliminary report which contained a f a i r l y good conspectus of the universities' financial position was received later in 1950. That, however, was not the final report. Following the receipt of that report the Australian Government gave consideration to it , and formulated propositions, which it sent to the six State Premiers, concerning the universities themselves and, in the case of New South Wales, the new University of Technology. Naturally, as honourable members will understand, it took some time to have those proposals considered by the States, but ultimately they were agreed to. In anticipation of approval by this Parliament w.e have been, in fact, paying sums to the Statesi n respect of the universities so that in a sense this bill will r a t if y what has been done and will make provision for the future. The problem of the universities is, of course, one of immense importance. All honourable members w ill agree that the encouragement of higher education in Australia is a matter of first rate national importance and, beyond question, the universities, like other educational institutions, have been feeling over a term of years the pressure of the times. University costs have risen very steeply since 1939. I venture to offer as my own opinion that for mauy years the salaries that were paid by universities to men of distinction who occupied various chairs and lectureships, were grossly inadequate and entirely unreasonable when one considers the very high and rare qualities that we expect from men who occupy such posts. Enrolments in universities have, in many instances, doubled, if not quadrupled, since before the war. It has been an interesting feature of Australian life that since the war the number of young men and women anxious to avail themselves of university training has increased beyond all anticipation. Naturally that fact has put a great strain on universities, both in terms of capital resources and in terms of providing the necessary teaching facilities; because, as honourable members are well aware, although it is not generally realized by the public, the fees paid in respect of students at universities are a mere fraction of the overall costs of providing facilities that a university ought to provide. At the same time as these things have been going on, the Commomvealth Reconstruction Training Scheme subsidies have, of necessity, been declining very sharply, with the result that the universities have found themselves running seriously into deficit. We have not thought it a part of our duty, and I do not think that anybody in the House would suppose that it is a part of our duty, to provide the whole of the additional financial resources that are needed by the universities. The universities are not to be converted into Commonwealth universities. It is of great importance that they should retain their individuality and their local character and quality. Therefore we have conditioned this new departure accordingly-becaus e it is a new, almost a revolutionary, departure for the Commonwealth, which has neither power nor responsibility, if I may put it in that way, in the educational field, to' say that irrespective of repatriadetail. Let me put it in this way: The tion or any other matter with respect to which it has constitutional power to legislate, it will make grants to the States to assist those universities to be kept effectively operating and profitably developing. In effect, the construction of the prostudents, with an adjustment to make posal is to make grants which fall into allowance for smaller universities. For certain categories. In the first place there example, it was well established by the is the basic grant for the universities committee, and I think the point is not in and the residential colleges. Honorahle dispute, that the cost per student is greater members will be able to follow this propoin smaller universities, such as the Unisition more clearly if they refer to the versity of Tasmania, than in a largeschedule. In the first column of the university. Some allowance has been madeschedule they will find the names of the for that fact in allocatig the total sum. universities and colleges affected. the second column they will see figures expenditure only on current activities and which total £351,500. That represents not for capital expenditure. We do not the total amount of the grant for profess to be dealing in this bill with thethe second half of 1950, and, in effect, capital expenditure problem of the uniretrospectively validates what we have versities, done. The Commonwealth Reconstrucdition. tion Training Scheme subsidies and other payments for research, and so on, which were due from us in that period would that capital expenditure is defined in thehave been something like £100,000 less bill. It is defined in what I consider tothan that figure, so we have increased be a sensible way, that is, as meaningthe amount for the second half of the expenditure on the erection of a new Mr Menzies. calendar year 1950. The third column contains figures which total £803,000, whicli is the basic grant from the Commonwealth to the States for the universities and residential colleges for each of the three calendar years 1951, 1952, and 1953. I speak of calendar years because the universities work in calendar years. Then we provide for certain conditions, to which I shall refer in a moment, in relation to the basic grant. We then provide for second level grants, which honourable memhers will see in the fifth column of the schedule, which total £300,000. These second level grants are to be paid on conditions similar to those on which the sum of £803,000 is to be paid. The only point that I wish to make at the moment is that, assuming that the payments from the States and the other revenues of the universities between them satisfy the overall condition, there is provision here for a total grant of up to £1,103,000 a year for each of the three years 1951, 1952 and 1953. I shall state that in somewhat greater Commonwealth will make an initial grant, which will be the basic grant, of £803,000 a year for each of the calendar years to which I have referred. The allocation of that total amount among the various universities has been calculated according to the number of full-timeIn The basic grants are to be available for but we are seeking to bring their revenue position into a healthy conHonorable members will have observed building, and expenditure exceeding £500 -on the alteration of an existing building or for tlie purchase of, or otherwise in -connection with, a single item of equipment. Items of under £500 will be considered not to be capital items for the purposes of the bill. Before the grant will become payable in relation to a university, that university must receive in fees una State grants either three times the Commonwealth basic grant, or the notional amount of State grants plus the fees which it would require to balance its £351,500, the amount that I referred to budget for 1950, whichever is the greater. That may seem a little clouded, but the reason for it was that, when this matter was originally discussed on the basis of the report and we had our proposals before the States, we considered it necessary to provide that if we made .a payment the university's budget should at least be brought into balance, .and that therefore the States should provide an amount which, with the fees collected by the university, would balance the university's budget. Then, in order to provide a sound working formula for the future, we agreed to pay £1 for each £3 that was received by the university by way of State grants anrl fees. That means that Ave are finding a quarter of the total sum. Of the total basic grant of £803,000 an .amount of £25,000 is to bo applied to the residential colleges. In addition to that basic grant the Commonwealth will pay £1 for every £3 by which the amount of State grants plus fees received by a university exceeds the qualifying amount for the basic grant. That means that if the universities, by means of State .grants plus fees collected, put up .£2,335,000 they will be entitled to receive from the Commonwealth £803,000, or -one-third of that amount of £2,335,000. For every £3 over and above that £2,409,000 that the State grants plus fees produces we shall find another £1 with a maximum or ceiling on that item-the .second level grant-of £300,000. So, in the result, we shall find £803,000 plus £300,000 in each of the three years, -on the basis that the State grants plus university fees, & c , produce £2,335,000 plus £900,000. So we provide £1 against £3 provided by all those other sources, up to the maximum amount of £1,103,000. 1 hope that I have made that clear to honourable members because, like all figures of that kind, these are somewhat complicated. Again, the second leve*l grants are to be available for expenditure on current activities only subject to the same definition of capital -expenditure. For the last six months of the year 1950, in addition to the three years for which we are making this provision, the Commonwealth is making separate grants to a total of earlier in my remarks, and this amount is also to be apportioned among the universities on the same basis as will be applied to the basic grant. All that adds up to a very substantial provision which is being made, as honourable members w ill realize, in a field for which we have not in the past accepted any measure of financial responsibility that was not attached to the performance of some Commonweallh function like repatriation. This is not attached to any such condition. This means that, even if all Oommonwealth .Reconstruction Training Scheme obligations fade away, we are establishing for the future in favour of the universities, through the medium of a grant, this provision which amounts, as I have said, to a possible, and, I hope, probable amount in excess of £1,000,000 in each of the three years in question. It is not the desire of the Government to interfere in the internal management of the universities nor to attach conditions to the use of these moneys which would interfere with the traditional liberty of the universities to determine the courses of instructions that they wish to pursue or the character of the research that they wish to undertake. The Government has acknowledged the principle of academic freedom but has recognized that, having regard to the changing balance of financial power and authority from time to time, unless the Commonwealth is prepared to assist these great seats of learning they w ill inevitably f a l l on such hard times and be subject to such heavy pressure that they w ill have to restrict their activities. The bill may appear to be rather complex in its drafting, but I have been assured by the draftsman that the complexity was inevitable because of the fact that the bill deals partly with a period that has gone by, partly with a period that is current, and partly with a period that is still two years ahead. Consequently, having regard to our negotiations with the States, it was essential that a distinction should be made between the basic grant and the conditions that will attach to it, and the second level grant and the conditions that will attach to it in future. It gives me a feeling of very great pleasure and satisfaction to introduce this bill on behalf of the Government, and I am certain that it will enjoy the unanimous support of honourable members. provide for honourable members information as to the actual effect of the proposed grants in respect of this year and the next two years? I should like to know the amount of the grant that will be made on the basis of the fees and State grants at present received by the universities. able member will give me a note concerning information of that kind that he may desire to have, I shall endeavour to have it provided. adjourned. BILL 1951. Debate resumed from the 21st. Novomber (vide page 2405), on motion by Sir That the bill be now read a second time. The Opposition is not satisfied with the case that the Government has presented in support of the re-establishment of the long dormant Public Accounts Committee. As the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Padden) mentioned in his second-reading speech, a public accounts committee existed from 1913 to 1932. During the depression its activities were suspended. The first suggestion for their suspension was made by the late Sir Archdale Parkhill. On'the 2Sth July, 1931, during the debate on the Estimates, that gentleman made the following statement:For tlie 'Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, £1,709 and for the Joint Committee on Public Accounts, £1,401. These committees are entirely unnecessary at the present time and their operations should hesuspended. If honourable menibers opposite intend to argue that the Public Accounts Committee should never have been abolished, they should bear in mind that those who entertained political beliefs similar to their own were responsible for the suspension of its activities. On the same date as Sir Archdale Parkhill made the statement that I have just quoted, the thenPrime Minister, Mr .Scullin, said that his Government was considering reducing the number of members serving on the committee. On the 13th October, 1931, Mr Scullin introduced a bill to reduce thesize of the committee. The bill had a stormy passage in the tory-dominated Senate of the period. A series of amendments was proposed, one of which provided that two members of the committee 1 should be appointed by the Senate and five by the House of Representatives. The bill lapsed with the dissolution of the Twelfth Parliament in the following month. TheLyons Government, which was returned to office with the election of the Thirteenth Parliament, was an unlucky government for Australia. The committee has never been re-established. A number of Treasurer's could have sponsored its re-establishment had they considered that the circumstances merited such action. Those who could have moved for its re-establishment include the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Padden), the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey), Mr Spender and the late Mr J. B. Chifley. The late Mr Chifley was the Treasurer of this country for a record period of eight years, but he certainly did not wish to have the committee re-established. I am sure that if he werealive he would not take kindly to the proposal before the House. Since 1932 there has been no support for any suggestion from any quarter for the re-establishment of the Public Accounts Committee. The Government said quite recently that it intended to re-establish the committee. I have no doubt that it made that decision because of pressure by the honorable member for Warringah ( Mr Bland) and others of its supporters.",37,States Grants

133,Debate (On Motion By Dr. Evatt),,41,Abthub Padden
134,Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [5.3],"Jr. ie proposed that the duties of the new committee shall include those of the previous Public Accounts Committee and that the committee shall also be required to examine each statement and report transmitted to the Parliament by the Auditor-General in pursuance of the Audit Act. This proposal, if implemented, will result in the Gilbertian situation that when the manner in which the money voted by the Parliament has been expended has been examined by the Auditor-General, the Public Accounts Committee wili examine the Auditor-General and pass judgment on whether he had acted rightly or not. If the Auditor-General had not to be examined, that is to say, if the terms of reference of the proposed committee were the same as those contained in the original act, ten months would pass before the committee could examine the expenditure in respect of the financial year then current. Ten months after the horse had bolted the committee would close the gate. The expenditure of Commonwealth funds should not be examined in that way. There is a difference between the Publio Accounts Committee and the Public Works Committee. The Public Works Committee is authorized to examine every project referred to it before any expenditure is incurred, before plans are finally accepted, and certainly before any contracts are let. But according to the Treasurer's second reading speech, the proposed Public Accounts Committee will examine the record of the receipts and expenditure of the Commonwealth and report to both Houses of the Parliament any items in those accounts or any circumstances connected with them to which the committee considers that attention should be directed. Such action may or may not be effective. Under the bill, £5,000 is to be appropriated for the work of the committee. That money might be well spent but it is possible that the people would not receive any value for it. Some of the duties of the previous Public Accounts Committee, as stated by the Treasurer, were(c) to inquire into and report upon any question in connection with tiie public accounts which are referred to it by either House of Parliament. (d) Any other duties assigned to .the. conimittee by joint standingorders approved by both Houses, of Parliament. To my knowledge, in the nineteen years that the previous committee' existed the Parliament did not refer to it any matter that was before the Parliament at the time of reference. I am certain that no bill designed to appropriate money was ever examined by the committee before the appropriation was made: If the proposed committee were to report on matters before appropriations were made it would serve some useful purpose. Its functions would then approximate those of the appropriation committees of the Congress of the United States of America. But there will never be any deeds to match the words contained in this bill. The suggestion that matters might be referred to the committee for report by joint standing orders of both houses, is pointless. It took nearly 50 years for the Parliament to frame permanent standing orders, so I cannot see any likelihood of special-joint standing orders being devised for the purpose of referring matters to this committee. The Opposition is critical of the proposal that the committee shall consist of ten members-the e senators and seven members of the House of Representatives. Why has the Government selected this even number? Why did it not propose an odd number of members ? ber should be careful. His party was tricked on a previous occasion in relation to numbers in the Senate. honourable member for Mitchell( Mr Wheeler) will observe a repetition of history within the next couple of years. The Opposition objects to the Government having a majority of representatives of the Senate and a majority of representatives of this House on the proposed conimittee. As I said earlier when the Senate considered a similar bill introduced by Mr .Scullin in 1932 it amended it to provide that the committee should have two representatives of the Senate -on e from each side of the chamberand five representatives of this'. House. The tory-dominated Senate of the day proposed that the Government should",41,Abthub Padden

Perhaps the honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hulme) is trying to run away from the ghosts of the past. The Senate of the period to which I have referred was not very keen on the establishment of a Public Account* Committee and the honourable meniber of the Twelfth Parliament who suggested its abolition was the Warringah, a predecessor of the honourable member for Warringah who now wishes to revive it. Opposition members believe that if the committee is to be restored after its twenty years of hibernation the House of Commons practicein regard to the chairmanship of such a committee should be followed. The chairman of the committee should be a member of the Opposition. The British Act of 1861 provides that representation of the political parties on the. Public Accounts Oommittee shall be in proportion to their strength in the House of Commons; but by convention, the chairman is always a member of the Opposition. He guides the committee in its work. On this subject, I refer honourable members to volume 3, No. 3 of Parliamentary Affairs, the journal of the Hansard Society. At page 450 of this volume, under the heading "" Parliamentary Control of the Public Accounts-II."" , there is an article by Basil Chubb, Lecturer in Political Science, Trinity College, University of Dublin. We say that if the. Government wishes to have the co-operation of the Opposition on this matter it must pay due regard to the views that we express in relation to our membership on the committee. We desire that the chairman shall .be drawn from the Opposition, and that the members of the committee shall be selected in equal numbers from the Opposition party and from the Government parties. able member do if he were in power? election.

Therefore I say that I know that no Treasurer would want this committee, and I have a shrewd idea that the present Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Padden) does not want it ; although that may be a mattei for debate. 1 If we are to have a committee, it should be a worthwhile body and not one that will conduct the equivalent of a postmortem. It should not be a smother-up committee. I have an idea that if the membership of this committee allows for then honourable member for a government majority of two as well as a government chairman, nothing will come to light that will be of any value to the taxpayers. I think that the chairman of the committee would, as the chairman of another committee is said to have done, respond to pressure. I refer to Mr Aubrey Abbott, who was once chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. He drew up a report of which the then Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, did not approve, consequently the committee did not present it. Whether that story be partially or wholly true, it indicates the evil of having a member of the government parties as chairman of a Public Accounts Committee. A government party chairman must respond to pressure. I have not the slightest doubt that this proposed Public Accounts Committee will divide on party lines as does every other committee of the Parliament. Therefore its deliberations are not likely to be of much value. There may have been one occasion on which it did not happen, but that exception proves the rule. This Government is dying rapidly. Rigor mortis is about to set in, and I do not know why, at this late stage of its existence, it should wish to have a Public Accounts Committee to inquire into its financial affairs, when such a committee will not pos3:bly be able to present a they like in order to keep up their courage,",42,Abthub Padden

144,Reply To Mr Theodore,"how the Opposition feels about it. When the Broadcasting Committee of which Senator Gibson was chairman, conducted its business, it acted as a House or Library committee would have acted. When the bonorable member for Melbourne became chairman, he acted in a similar manner. Although viously acted on non party lines, as soon as the honourable member for Melbourne was elevated to ministerial rank and the committee got into the hands of his successor its decisions degenerated into a replica, of those made according to party divisions in this House. ' It completely lost significance as an institution for the enhancing of parliamentary government. It was no longer a committee that worked upon the basis of a parliamentary approach to problems. It relied entirely upon a party approach. I suppose it was for that reason that the present Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) refused to reconstitute the committee. I regret that that decision was made, because 1 should have liked the committee to continue in operation. That experience has shown what we. may expect, from thc members of the Opposition. That is why we cannot, concede the claims of the honourable member for Melbourne. I had hoped that the honourable member for Melbourne would not be quite so intransigent, as he was. and that he would say, in effect. "" We shall give this oommittee a fling, anrl sec what we can do"". Then the committee might have looked forward to the commendation of the f a it h f u l steward, and vve might have been able to commend it in the words which, through the ages, have made music in the ears of industrious nnd trustworthy oflicialsWell done, thou good and faithfu l servant; thou hast been faithfu l over a few things, I will make the ruler over many things: We might even have been able to make the committee function in the way in which the English parliamentary public accounts committee has functioned. If the Opposition adopts a policy of sabotaging the work of the committee and of refusing to collaborate with the Government in the matter, it w ill do a disservice not only to itself but also to the Parliament. The Government is not compelled to establish this committee. If it acted in accordance only with its own interests, probably it would not establish the conimittee, which will be a far mure potent instrument than the honourable, meniber for Melbourne has suggested. The Auditor-General, in his report for .1947-48, recommended to the the committee had preGovernment of which the honourable gentleman was a member, that it was desirable that the Public Accounts Committee should be reconstituted, because of the volume of public expenditure. He thought, that such a committee was necessary to enable a serious gap that had developed in our financial system to.be closed. The purpose of the proposed committee is to give to the Parliament an opportunity to discover whether there is any truth in the allegation that the resources of this country are being dissipated because there is no adequate parliamentary scrutiny of the methods that are adopted to give effect to the wishes of the Parliament. The honourable inember i'or Melbourne has said that the committee will he able to conduct only post-mortem examinations. He spoke of it as though it will be abie to conduct an inquiry only at a stage when the investigation wil] be of no value. The Auditor-General is the only protection in this connection that the Parliament has at the present time. He is the Parliament's own officer, yet, as far as I know, his criticisms have never been made a subject for discussion in the Parliament. They have been referred to from time to time in budget debates, but the Parliament has never allotted time for a special debate on them. When the Auditor-General took it upon himself to criticize some of the things that were done, ancl, in so doing, went almost into the realm of policy, members of the Labour party roared their annoyance at him for having dared to direct the attention of the Parliament to matters to which he considered it to be his duty to direct attention. The policy has always been to stifle the criticisms of tlie Auditor-General. V/e have seldom paid the slightest attention to them. Can any one imagine a body of shareholders in a private company appointing a board of directors and then not listening to a report upon how that board had conducted the affairs of the company? That is what we have done. The establishment of this committee will enable us to discover what the Public Service or the Government has been doing, with the public accounts and to decide whether what has been done is what the Parliament wanted to be done and whether the results are those that the Parliament expected. The establishment of the committee will not be an attack upon the integrity or the ability of either the Public Service or thc Government. The Public Service has two tasks. . It bas to devise methods by which the policy of the Government can be implemented, and then it has to ensure that the results will justify those methods. it will be able to obtain, as it were, a But it is always so busy performing the first of those tasks that it has no time to year. devote to the second task and to consider whether things have been done properly. That is the reason why I have constantly advocated the appointment of an authority external to the Public Service to appraise what is being done. The Auditor-General is an officer of the Parliament. He reports to the Parliament upon what is being done. The Public Accounts Committee would be required to consider what the Auditor General had said, and to examine the accounts in order to determine whether or not they were satisfactory. it would consider whether what the Government had set out to do had been done as well as it ought to have been done, and whether the country was getting value for its expenditure. During the budget debate 112 honourable members spoke. How many of them did so with any intention to ensure that £1,000,000,000 of public money should be expended to the best advantage? I should say that 90 per cent, of the members who spoke in that debate advocated that more money should be expended. They were eager, not that economy and efiiciency of administration should be achieved, but that more money should be expended. For decades,members of Parliament have been actuated by a desire to spend money rather than to save it. They spend the people's money, of which they are trustees, but they act not as trustees but as spendthrifts. All the time their concern is, not, whether Mr Bland. better results can be achieved from tbe expenditure of public money, but whether more money can be expended. During a budget debate, we talk in terms of policy and are not concerned with methods. The Public Accounts Committee will be an instrument for ensuring that the Parliament shall beable to consider not only policy but also methods, and to ascertain whether satisfactory means of implementing a policy have been adopted. The committee will be required to examine accounts afteithey have been passed b.y the Auditor-General. It is true that in the normal course of events it will be conducting a post mortem examination of the accounts for the preceding year, but preview of the accounts for the current I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne that it would be well if we went further than the establishment of a Public Accounts Committee. Perhaps one of the results of the establishment of this committee will be the establishment of an Estimates committee. If the honourable member for Melbourne wants the Parliament to have a voice in incurring expenditure at its inception, let him agree to the establishment of an Estimates conimittee. But he will not do so, because he does not believe in the ParThen liament having any control of things that really matter. He wants only a facade of parliamentary control. There is no need for me to explain the procedure that is adopted by the English parliamentary public accounts committee, because the whole story is set out on page 55 of a book entitled Parliamentary Supply Procedure, published by the English Treasury. The honourable member for Melbourne talked about the chairman of that committee being a member of the Opposition and an ex-Financial Secretary to the Treasury. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury is a member of the committee also. The honourable gentleman failed to inform the House that the task of that committee is not merely to report to the Parliament upon what is being done. Its decisions become a body of administrative case law, which the Chancellor of the Exchequer uses as a means for ensuring that government departments shall toe the line and do their job in the manner in which the of the Parliament. It w ill not make Treasury wishes it to be done. After th-j matters easier for the Government. If findings of the committee have been the Treasurer wanted an easier time, he debated in Parliament, the Treasury would not agree to the establishment of prepares minutes for circulation to other the committee, because it w ill make all government departments, upon which kinds of demands upon him. Probably they must act. The committee is the departmental oflicers w ill find that it authority that determines the form, will be much more exacting in its demands content, accuracy and integrity of public than are the Public Works Committee, accounts. Without the approval of the the House Committee, or the Library Public Accounts Commmittee no alteraCommittee. The establishment of thc tion can be made of the form in which committee w ill enable us to do what both public accounts are presented. The honourable gentleman omitted to it is essential to do. It w ill enable us mention another important fact.

If this committee is established, I hope the Auditor-General will be present at its The honourable member for Warringah meetings because his accounts w ill be dealt ( Mr Bland) has paid lip-service to the with, but I should like Treasury officials to view that, we all should be, not party men be present also. I had experience of the but the Parliament's men, but the honorNew South Wales Public Accounts Comable gentleman has been a party man mittee, but it is a body which does not every time the Government parties have amount to much! The British committee cracked the whip in this House. His is an entirely different proposition. This bill attempts to take up the authority of the Parliament, we should threads that were cut in 1932. I regret give our complete support to this bill. very much that those threads were cut, We take the opposite view. If the because the report of the Public Accounts honourable gentleman were honest in his Committee for .1932, the year in which view, he would say that every amendMr Percy Coleman was chairman conment that the Opposition has submitted tained a series of criticisms of the merited the fullest consideration by the character of our public accounts and the Government.

That would constitute is that good resides in the Government a foundation upon which we could build alone and that no good at all can come the traditions and practices of the new from the Opposition. Yet, he said that Public Accounts Committee. I conclude as I began. This committee measure because it approached it on will be a means of enhancing the prestige party lines.

OrderedThat Sir Arthur Fadden and Mr Townley do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. and read a first time. Treasurer) [8.3] I move That the bill be now read a second time. The funds that are needed for the discharge of the functions of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board are provided by a charge that is imposed on employers of waterside labour under the Stevedoring Industry Cliarge Act 1947-1949. The proceeds of the charge are credited to thu Consolidated Revenue Fund and, in accordance with the provisions of the Stevedoring Industry Act 1949, equivalent amounts are paid to the board. The charge was originally fixed at 4-Jd. a manhour of employment of waterside workers, but that rate resulted in an excessive accumulation of funds. In October, 1949, the rate was reduced to 2-Jd. a man-hour, which was designed to produce an annual deficit in the board's financial accounts and so reduce the accumulated funds over the ensuing few years. The principal items of expenditure of the board are for attendance money, the operation of waterside cafeterias, the transport of waterside workers, administrative expenses and the provision of amenities reported with, amendments; on the waterfront. Steeply rising costs y leave-adopted . have caused the board's funds to be rey leave-rea d a third time. duced more quickly than was anticipated in 1949. The purpose of this bill is to increase the charge to 4d. a man-hour of employment on and from the 4th December next. The higher charge, although still lower than the original rate, is expected to provide sufficient revenue for the board to meet its expenditure on the current scale, and retain a comparatively small reserve of working capital to meet venue from the stevedoring industry charge for the financial year 1950-51 was £420,000. It was estimated that the collections for the financial year 1951-52 at the present rate of 2^d. a man-hour of employment would yield £435,000. It is estimated that, if that rate be increased to 4d. a man-hour on and from the 4th December, 1951, a further £130,000 will be gained during the balance of the financial year, making the total yield for this year £565,000.

The first is to give to ex-servicemen, who fought in Korea and Malaya, rights under the War Service Homes Act equal to those enjoyed by ex-servieemen of World WarI . and World War II . The second purpose is to liberalize the provisions of the War Service Homes Act in order that ex-servicemen may finance the construction of dwellings more easily than is possible at present as a result of the inflationary conditions.

159,Mr Pollard (Lalor) [S.5],"Th ebe increased from £2,000 to £2,750. However, such loans will be subject to certain conditions. They will be granted oniy when the War Service Homes Division calls tenders for the construction of a house, or approves the builder who has been selected by the ex-serviceman. However, the present maximum amount of £2,000 will not be. increased if the ex-serviceman wishes to buy a house, even though it may not have been occupied, or may have been occupied by the owner for some years. I fail to see how the Government can justify such discrimination between those two classes of house acquirement. An infinitely worse situation exists in another respect. Many ex-servicemen liave been purchasing, over a number of years, the houses that they occupy. For that purpose, they have obtained advances from banks, or from trustee companies, which hold the mortgages in respect of those properties. A strange position will arise if this bill becomes law, because the Minister will have authority to determine that, in future, suoh agreements or arrangements may not be made and the mortgages will not be discharged. be applicable only in respect of old properties. Minister is placed in a most difficult positiou. He informed the House, in his second-reading speech, that the present practice under which mortgages are discharged by the War Service Homes Division will be discontinued. A few moments ago, he stated, hy way of interjection, that such a policy will be applicablr 3 only to old properties. What is an old house? A dwelling that was erected only five years ago might be old because the construction was slip-shod. Yet a house that was built 50 years ago may, because it was soundly constructed, be a worthwhile proposition for purchase. The Minister's statement in his secoud-reading speech was unequivocal. The bill shows clearly that he will have authority not onlyto instruct the Director of War Service Homes to prevent the discharge of mortgages on existing properties, but also to deprive him of the right to advance loans to finance the purchase of certain properties. The whole situation is most peculiar. The Minister ostensibly believes that this bill will enable men whofought in Korea and Malaya to finance the purchase of dwellings under the War Service Homes Act. But what are the facts? The ex-servicemen's position has become most difficult during the last few years as a result of inflation, due to such factors as higher wages, the increased cost of building materials, shorter working hours, and the failure of the Government to put back value into the £1 and to stabilize the prices of building materials. A loan of £2,000 is completely inadequate iu the present inflationary conditions to enable an ex-serviceman to negotiate the purchase of a house. On that point, I am in agreement with the Minister. The honourable gentleman proposes to increase the maximum loan to £2,750, provided the War Service Homes Division constructs the house, or approves the builder. But the maximum amount that may be advanced in respect of an existing house that has heen selected by an ex-serviceman is to remain at £2,000. The War Service Homes Division may not be able to engage a contractor to build a house for an ex-serviceman, and that unfortunate person, in desperation, may seek to purchase a soundly-constructed dwelling. He will not be eligible to receive the higher advance of £2,750. read the bill intelligently, and that I understand the Minister's second-reading speech. It is the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden), who interjected, "" Sez you "", who is in ignorance of the provisions of the bill. I remind him that the Minister, when he introduced the bill, made the following statement:For the purchase of existing properties the maximum loan w ill remain at the present amount of £2,000. The maximum loan will be £2,750 if the house is constructed by or under the supervision of the War Service Homes Division. Let us examine those two strange sets of circumstances. Of the 75,500 dwellings that have been provided since the inception of the scheme, 33,000 are new houses that have been built, am! 42,500 existing properties that hnve been purchased, or the mortgages on which have",51,Second Reading

Thirty-five thousand of them were built for the division or for ths purchasers under approved privately arranged contracts, but 42,000 of them represented purchases of existing properties aiid discharges of mortgages. Since I. 945, 11,576 houses have been built under the war service homes scheme, but 26,344 houses have been acquired by the purchase of existing properties and the discharge of mortgages. The number of existing houses purchased by applicants is steadily increasing because of the inability of the division and applicants to find contractors who will build new houses. deteriorate in 1950-51. Only 26 per cent, of the transactions financed by the division during that period related to t.he construction of houses. The remainder were for purchases of existing properties and discharges of mortgages. Every body appreciates the good intentions of the Minister, but the hand of the Treasury is evident in the terms of this bill. The Minister said in his second reading speech that the Government did not wish to encourage the practice of buying existing houses because it tended to reduce the rate of construction of new houses. I agree that we should foster thc practice of building new houses u n d c the supervision of the War Service Honies Division because every house built in that way adds to the total of new buildings erected in Australia. But an additional responsibility devolves upon this Government. Because of the unchecked spiral of rising prices, more aud more ex-servicemen are being obliged to obtain houses by purchasing existing properties and discharging mortgage*. The Government should use every mean-! nt ifc? disposal to help them. Tts only consideration should be the soundness, architecturally and iu other respect--, of each proposition. T am sure that, upon mature reflection, the Government, parties in this chamber, who claim that 7> per V {-env. of their memhers are ex-servicemen, will not attempt to defend the bill in its present form . To-day, six years after the cessation of hostilities in World WarI I . , the number of applications for financial assistance under the war service homes scheme is steadily increasing. The Government, proposes to help applicants Mi. Pullard. by increasing the permissible amount of loans to £2,750 for commission built houses. But, at the same time, it deliberately plans to place obstacles in the way of the ex-serviceman by restricting financial assistance for the purchase of existing buildings and by discontinuing the discharge of mortgagee, whicli, at the present rate, represent 7t per cent, of the total number of war service homes transactions. . The principal act now provides that the amount of deposit required from any applicant shall vary, according to t.he total amount of expenditure involved, The situation continued to from 5 per cent., to 10 per cent, at the maximum level of £2,000. Furthermore, the Director of War Service Homes is vested with discretion to fix a lower rate of deposit. But this bill will establish a flat rate of 10 per eent. for any amount above £2,000. The division is faced with almost insuperable difficulties. In the first three months of 1950-51 it was able to have 482 houses commenced by contract but, as a result of rising costs, it was able to arrange for only 302 contracts during the final quarter of the year. The position deteriorated so rapidly that it was able to arrange for only 5,000 contracts instead of the anticipated total of 6,000 during the f u l l period of twelve months. vernment decided to increase the maximum amount of loan. that provision, but the figures that I have cited have nothing to do with the permissible amount of loan. They illustrate the difliculty that arises from the inability of the War Service HoniesD i v i sion and of applicants to arrange contracts for the building of new houses. That situation, which is becoming worse every day, forces many applicants to purchase existing properties. We shall thrash out this mattei' clause by clause in the committee stage. The Minister is probably aware that the Opposition has already drafted amendments for the purpose of improving the bill and making it more workable. The purpose of one of these is to make the maximum permissible amount of loan available for the purchase of existing properties as well as",52,Second Reading

The honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua) ha? shown a great deal of foresight in suggesting an amendment of a kind that has never previously been contemplated. The honourable gentleman has in mind the interests of ex-servicemen who have heavy family responsibilities and the amendment that he has foreshadowed is designed to provide that the amount of a loan made available to an applicant with more than five dependants may be increased by £200 for each member of the family after the first five. Twenty-three thousand applicants are already on the waiting list and, according to the latest report of the division, about 50 per cent, of these are persisting applicants who are desperately in need of homes. Therefore, instead of providing only for the financial assistance of those who can arrange to have new houses built, we should endeavour to provide for words the acquisition of houses by all possible moans, including the purchase of existing able gentleman will address me. properties.

The service is provided by the before been embodied in war service Royal Victorian Institute of Architects homes and. on the date to which I bave referred, under it contained the following passage:Thousands of ex-servicemen who tliought siders that too much money is being tliey could escape thc delays of building expended on war service homes, and, through War Service Honies Division are findwhilst perfectly willin g to approve ing that Governmental red tape is not so the discharge of mortgages on a generous easily avoided.

The War Service Homes Division has fro m which I was reading a few moments ahvays offered excellent terms to the ex-serviceago continuedman homebuilder. Under a proposed amendment to thc act they will be even betteron paper. Tlie catch always was the delays. Sometimes the delays were before the loan was approved. One client of ours reports a wait of Hi mouths recently. Sometimes the worse delays were in progress payments to builders. '.I liesu are never inclined to heighten a builder's enthusiasm for any job. In repeating these old stories, no criticism of the War Service Homes Division or its officers in Melbourne is intended. It is not news to tell of the delays. People who had to work with the division accepted them as port of post-war building conditions. One architect who got to know the ropes and could nurse an application through the right channels at exactly tlie right times, claims he could get an approval in .sixweeks. The division itself was not to blame. Undoubtedly it has been tied up in turn by red tape from on high. But the terms, when they arrived, were generous, and so thousands of ex-servicemen adopted the idea of building immediately by private finance in the hope of switching the mortgage to War Service Homes Division when the building was finished. That is the point that T made. The practice of discharging inortagages will Such a provision has never legislation.

They w i ll be left holding private mortgages on much harder terms than they can afford. is partly incorrect, as the bill w ill not make it mandatory for the Minister to discontinue mortgages, but w ill give to him the power to do so. In effect, it wil l give to the Minister a power that has never before been, given, in the history of war service homes legislation in Australia, to interfere w i th the prerogatives that were formerly exercised by the Director of War Service Homes. that power before. tlie power that is to be given to h i m to interfere w i th the prerogatives of the director, the Minister sa^s that there was no need for that power previously. Now, when the division is f a i l i ng to build enough houses and with an ever increasing number of ex-servicemen buying houses, he says by implication that it is necessary to have the power to discontinue the practice of the division discharging mortgages. The article statedThe division always has the prerogative of refusing to take over the mortgage on any house which has not been built to the required standard. The Minister is taking power under this measure to destroy the prerogative of the division when he feels so inclined, the article continuedThe purpose of the amendment is not clear. The article then referred to delays and to red tape and went on to say this about the b ill If it is passed there will be a moral obligation on the Government to speed up tlie department's workings. I am not critical of the War Service Homes Division and the work that it has done. Taken' generally, it has done a magnificent job in Australia and any failure men has generally been due to governments. the failure of governments to make finance available to the then commission, and at present it is the failure of the Grovernment to halt rising prices and to the complete inability of the division to get contractors to operate withi n the allowable financial limits provided in war service homes legislation. The position in relation to war I would say that it service homes is desperate, as I know because I have investigated in my electorate certain cases of houses having been badly finished by -the contractors. I understand that a tenant or buyer has a year in which to lodge complaints and point out faults. I made personal investigations of some war service homes at Sunshine, in my electorate, and in one case climbed into the attic, and I can say that the tenant in that case was certainly within his rights in requesting that the division have the house completed according to the specifications on which the construction of it had been undertaken. But the division finds it difficult to get contractors to finish their jobs properly, and is also finding it difficult to obtain new contractors for new jobs, and so is forced into the position of being unable to adjust complaints by tenants It was not u n t i l I approached the former Ministerf o r Works and Housing( Mr Casey) that I was able to obtain satisfaction for that ex-serviceman and his house was put into proper shape. Some of the windows would not close because the woodwork was made of ramee pine, which warps badly. Plaster had cracked, and whilst the house was structurally sound the finishing work on it was a disgrace. The sill over the sink was about 3 inches out, and there was not one door that fitted at the top. It was not until great pressure had been brought to bear, which it should not have been necessary to exercise, that the job was finished properly. The contractors who build such houses finish a job, get progress payments, and go off to other jobs, and it is most difficult to get them to come back and finish the previous job properly. Shortage of labour and rising prices, particuto provide for ex-servicelarly at Sunshine, in my electorate, mean that the division is not able to have In depression times it was badly finished houses attended to. I find myself in the unfortunate position of not being able to congratulate the Minister on a bill which everybody'hoped would assist ex-servicemen both of the last war and of the Korean campaign.

173,Mr Pollard,"When I point tohope that the Minister will accept thc amendments that the ""Opposition intends to move, that some honourable members opposite will support them and that the outcome will be that the intention which I think the Minister had, of facilitating the occupancy of homes by ex-servicemen, will ultimately be achieved. service homes legislation should be entirely above party politics. I did not intend to make reference to the remarks of the honourable member for Lalor( Mr buys an area of land, subivides it, builds Pollard), but they have been so misleading and partisan that, in the interests of ex servicemen generally, I consider my1 self obliged to refer to his inaccuracies. Before doing so, I wish to remind the House of the general purposes of war service homes legislation. The War Service Homes Act was passed in 1918 and was a recognition of the fact that men who had left their homes and their country to fight in foreign lands for thc defence of Australia had thereby missed opportunities that were available to other people to build houses for their own occupancy. The act was passed with the avowed object of removing any nnanciai embarrassment to ex-servicemen who desired to acquire their own homes, and, since it was passed, has been of tremendous assistance to ex-servicemen. Altogether 75,000 ex-service men have been provided with homes tlirough the medium of this act. Of that number 33,000 were buyers of houses newly built, and 42,500 purchased houses. The honourable member for Lalor suggested that the Government had fallen down on its job. What utter humbug! I point ont that in 1948-49, which was the last completed year of a Labour government, 6,084 houses were either purchased or built. Last year, under the Mienzics Government, the houses either huilt or purchased numbered 15,165. That figure is nearly three times as large as thc 194S-49 figure. In 1948-49 an amount of £8,566,000 was expended on war service homes. Last year, under this Government, the figure was £25,000,000. Under this bill that record figure of £25,000,000 is to be increased to ber for Lalor that the maximum advance £27,000,000. So, since this Government, came into office its annual expenditure on housing for ex-servicemen has been more than three times as much as was expended in any year of Labour rule. that 15,165 houses were provided last year as against 6,000 in the previous Government's last year of office. The measure deals with four kinds of assistance to ex-servicemen. First of all there is a form of assistance in relation to group huilding, which covers cases in which the War Service Homes Division a. number of houses, and sells them upon completion to ex-servicemen, advancing finance for the purchase of them. The second kind of assistance is in relation to the individual home-building scheme, under which the ex-serviceman is entitled to build on his own account, with his own achitect or without an architect, and the War Service Homes Division will finance him in the building of it. The third kind of finance is in relation to the purchase of existing properties. The fourth kind of assistance formerly provided under the act was the discharge of existing mortfruetas. If , for example, an ex-serviceman had a. mortgage at a rate of interest that, he considered to be too high, he could have it taken over by the division. It, is in relation to that last category that the only major alteration to the act is made by the bill. The first amending clause in the bill is a recognition of the fact that building costs have increased over the last five or six years. Because of that increase the Government has seen the wisdom of increasing the maximum amount of loan available to ex-servicemen. The bill provides that in cases of houses built by the War Service Homes Division or by ex-servicemen under the supervision of tlie division, the maximum advance shall be £2,750 instead of the amount of £2,000 that operated under the previous Government. I emphasize that fact, because I am sure that a number of ex-servicemen will be otherwise misled by the statement of the honourable memwas to be £2,700. That is not correct. The amount is £2.750. The next vital amending clause recognizes the great debt of gratitude that we owe to men who",55,Second Reading

A t the present time, the men who are carrying the flag of Australia' have not had an oijoortunity to acquire houses through the ""War Services Homes Division. The bill before the House will make it possible for tliem to obtain houses. Another proposed amendment of great importance to ex-servicemen w ill reduce the deposit required on a war service home. Under this amendment the proposed deposit is 5 per cent, of the first £2,000 of a loan and 10 per cent, of the balance. Lalor( Mr Pollard) had the audacity to criticize this amendment. I remind the honourable member that while the Labour Government was in office an ex-serviceman could obtain an advance of only £2,000 and a deposit of £200 was required. Under this bill an ex-serviceman w ill be able to obtain a loan of £2,750 and a deposit of only £175 will be required. In other words, this Government proposes to provide for each ex-serviceman £750 more than Labour Government provided for him and to make that amount available on a deposit that w ill be £25 less than that required by the Labour Government. Yet the honourable inember for Lalor has stated his intention to move an amendment to this provision in the bill. Another of the proposals before the House affords me even greater than I derived from any of the amendments to which I have referred because it makes possible the fulfilment of a sacred duty of every honourable member. honourable member McLeay has continually referred in this House to the treatment of the widows of men who have made the supreme sacrifice. Up to the present time, owing to the operation of section 28 of the War Service Homes Act, a war widow has not been eligible for a loan unless she has had income apart from her pension. 2S, which has been in operation ever since the principal act was passed, provides that the Director of War Service Mom-es ::::iy, at his discretion, refuse to enter into a contract for the sale of any land, or land Mr Wilson. and dwelling house, or to make au advance to an eligible person, unless he is satisfied that that person has reasonable prospects of carrying out thc terms of the contract of sale or advance. Acting under the provisions of that section, the Director of War Service Homes and the Deputy Directors have considered that if a widow had no income but her pension she had not the ability to make the repayments required under the war service homes scheme. So when a widow has told the War Service Homes Division that she has no income outside hei pension, she has been told that it is of no use for her to proceed with her application because she has not the ability to pay The honourable member for the necessary instalments. The honourable member for Boothby has continually directed attention to this anomaly and he must feel extraordinarily proud to know that, under this bill, that barrier will be removed. The Government has increased war pensions by a greater amonnt than that by which they have ever increased before. A war widow with two children now receives £7 14s. 6d. a week and a war widow with one child receives £6 14s. 6d. a week. Consequently, the Ministerf o r the Social Services( Mr Townley) has directed that the Director shall now consider a widow with one or more children eligible for a loan and shall accept a. deposit of £50. This amendment will greatly improve the act. The honourable member for Lalor stated that during the last financial year only 26 per cent, of all moneys advanced by pleasure the War Service Homes Division were used for the construction of new houses. The purpose of this amendment is to make more money available for new conThy struction. Por war service homes this for Boothby( Mr years, £27,000,000 is available. That is £2,000,000 more than was available last year, and more than three times as much as has been expended for this purpose in any year in whicli Labour was in office. The Minister has given consideration to the manner in which this £27,000,000 could be expended in order to Section do a maximum amount of good for ex-servicemen. He asked, "" W l i o of these people, are the most important? I s ir more important that within the limits of the money available a serviceman should build on his own behalf or that he should be able to save a. little interest by paying off a mortgage on a house of which he has been in possession for the last ten year3 ? '' ex-servicemen without any architect or The answer was obvious. The man who is more entitled to assistance is the man who is building for himself. The Minister is to be admired for having recognized the facts. This is an inflationary period in which certain checks have to be put on the economy and certain limits placed on the amounts available to ex-servicemen by way of loans. The Minister has considered how, within that limit, the maximum number of ex-servicemen could be provided with the maximum benefit. He has decided that it is much more important for an ex-serviceman to obtain a house than for another ex-serviceman to save a little interest on a house that he already possesses. That class of ex-serviceman who has the courage, initiative and enterprise to build on his own behalf deserves to bo assisted more than any other. Those men have not sat back and asked when somjbody is going to do something for them. They have decided to have their financees or wives assist them to make cement bricks, put down foundations and build on Saturdays and Sundays. Having built their houses in that way they have requested the War Service Homes Division to take over their financial liability. the money-to build the house in the first place? provide the finance. If honourable members will come to my electorate, I will show them hundreds of men of initiative, courage and enterprise. Heights and Northfield, men and their wives make cement bricks, lay foundations and proceed to build their homes every Saturday afternoon and Sunday. These men and women exhibit the real pioneering spirit of this country. They do not wait for others to act for them. They are providing homes for themselves. Our ancestors came to this country when there were no buildings, roads or schools here. They pitched their tents, quarried limestone and sandstone, hewed timber, and built houses that are standing to-day. I admire those young men who arc building their own homes more than any other section of ex-servicemen. Last year 500 houses were built in South Australia by contractor. They used their own laboui' and the labour of their friends. I heartily congratulate the Minister on the tremendous volume of research that he undertook before he introduced this bill. It was a very difficult bill to construct and I consider that he arrived at a most satisfactory solution of the problems that confronted him. Reverting to the subject of those ex-servicemen who are building houses for themselves, I remind the honourable member for Darebin( Mr Andrews) that the War Service Homes Division will provide progress payments for such people as each section of the house is completed. Any trading bank will also make such advances provided that the War Service Homes Division will finance the purchase of the dwelling upon completion, I offer my whole-hearted congratulations to the Minister for having introduced a bill that will be of inestimable value to ex-servicemen. In casethere has been any misunderstanding, I wish all ex-servicemen to understand that it is still open to them to obtain a loan of up to £2,000 to pay off a mortgage, on a house that they are erecting. That is a facility of which ex-servicemen should avail themselves. I hope that subsequent speakers on the Opposition side of the House will not draw red herrings across the path but will deal with this bill on a non-party basis and will make known to ex-servicemen the great facilities that the bill will make available to them. After having heard the honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson) address himself to this subject, one could have no doubt that he appreciates both the legislation and the Minister for Social Services( Mr Townley). He certainly expressed his appreciation in full measure, and I am sure that the Minister must feel very pleased. He dwelt for a long time upon the grand old pioneers, which happens to be a good sentimental subject, and their method of procuring homes for themselves. He also traversed the ancient history of house building in this country, However, I suggest that he forgot",56,Second Reading

178,Mr Wilson,Any trading bank will,58,Second Reading
179,At Enfield Mr Andrews (Darebin) [8.59],"to mention a number of things. In the days of the pioneers there were no impediments to people building their own houses, such as modern building regulations. Those regulations are of the very greatest significance to those who are not building tradesmen but wish to build their own houses. There may be a few classes of people such as carpenters, bricklayers, plumbers, electricians, and the like who can band together and build houses for themselves, but the vast majority of the people are limited in the knowledge that they have, not only of building but also of building regulations. Therefore, a large part of the speech of the honourable member for Sturt loses its significance. Our war service homes legislation was originally designed to achieve two important objectives. The first was to help ex-servicemen of modest means to procure homes, and the second was to make some contribution to the great number of houses required in the community. Much capital has been made available by the War Service Homes Division. Last year about £25,000,000 was made available for the benefit of ex-servicemen. The Minister for Social Services( Mr Townley) claimed that the War Service Homes Division has financed 11.6 per cent, of all the new houses that, have been built recently in Australia, and that more houses have been provided by that organization than by any other housing authority in the Commonwealth. 1 have no doubt that that is quite true. But the War Service Homes Division is now experiencing serious difficulties, the greatest of which is caused by the fact that since 1949 only about 11,500 houses have been built, whilst about 36,500 houses have been procured or mortgages on houses have been discharged. Last year the position further deteriorated because only 26 per cent, of the houses procured by the War Service Homes Division were new houses and 74 per cent, were existing houses or houses upon which mortgages were discharged. The Minister said that that was not a very satisfactory contribution to the shortage of new houses in this country. The remedy suggested under this legislation is completely new to the War Service Homes Division. Mr Andrews. the division will no longer discharge mortgages. It is necessary to decide now which of the objectives that I mentioned in my opening remarks is the more important: Whether it is more important to ensure that ex-servicemen shall be provided with houses, or whether the War Service Homes Division shall build new houses and thus contribute more substantially to the provisions of the number of houses that we require. Without trying to be over sentimental, I submit that any man who has offered his life for his country has a very strong claim to be provided by one means or another with a home as soon as he needs it. At present, when houses are offered for sale at auction in any city of the Commonwealth most of them seem to be secured by foreigners or new Australians who have lived in. the country for only a few years. I suggest that no ex-serviceman would not take an old house in preference to a new one except for the simple reason that he wishes to get a roof over his head ancl establish himself and his family as a separate entity in the community. Perish the thought that any ex-serviceman may suffer as a result of such a provision in the bill now before the House. According to the information given to us by the War Service Homes Division applications continue to be made to tha division for assistance at the rate oi"" 2,000 a month. What are the prospects of those 2,000 people, as well as the backlog of applicants, being accommodated within a reasonable time? As the honoiable meniber for Lalor' ( Mr Pollard) emphasized there are long and tiresome periods of waiting which are certainly not caused by any neglect in the division. I have had occasion to call on the War Service Homes Division from time to time, and have always received very courteous atteution from its officers. They have tried to the best of their ability to help individual cases to which I have directed their attention. However, the fact is that long delays oacur before ex-servicemen can be accommodated by t.he War Service Homes Division. Those delays lead me to the conclusion that the division is very much under-staffed. A It is that method that is now being privately adopted by ex-servicemen to get houses more quickly is to buy a house through a co-operative building society and then make application to have the mortgage taken overby the War Service Homes Division. I hope that the Government can continue to take over such financial responsibility to the full amount allowable under the legislation, which is £2,750. to change the practice of discharging mortgages on new homes to the maximum -of £2,000. that assurance because I thought that tiiere was a prospect of the practice being -changed. Moreover, there has been much apprehension about the matter among exserviccmen. That practice may be of advantage to the division because it may give to it an opportunity to overtake the lag in its house construction. Because of loan restrictions on co-operative huilding societies and of the inadequacy of the War Service Homes Division allowance of £2,250, perhaps contractors will now be more eager to do work for the division than they have been hitherto. Perhaps that will have a good effect on the number of houses which the division will be able to complete in the future. "" .1 have been associated, as a director, witli three co-operative housing societies in niy own electorate. When those societies first commenced operations the majority of people seeking loans to build houses submitted"" plans for houses of from twelve to thirteen squares. Since building costs have so greatly increased there has been a tendency to reduce the size of the houses to nine and ten squares. I believe that the War Service Homes Division might he able still further to overtake the lag in construction by reducing the size of its houses. If the sizes were reduced more houses could be built. I believe that the cost per square is about £250. Thus a cottage of ten squares costs about £2,500, to which must be added.the inflated cost of the land. The smaller size would not be a great disability. In fact people could provide additional accommodation by building, a sleep-out separate from the house which could be sold after the family had grown up. If that were done there would be some advantage in the present tendency towards small buildings. I agree with the provision in the legislation that money shall not be made available for houses of an old type to any greater degree than is absolutely necessary. Buildings of older types that have been bought in the past, even on behalf of the War Service Homes Division, have not been satisfactory. If the maximum advance were granted in respect of such buildings, there is not the slightest doubt that, because of the conditions that prevail to-day, within a short time the maximum advance would become the minimum purchase price. Then either ex-servicemen or the division would be acquiring property that was almost worn out, simply in order to meet the exigencies of the moment. I believe that, generally speaking, the. War Service Homes Division has tried to do a good job for ex-servicemen. I do not intend to criticize the division when I suggest that the Minister should consider whether or not it is adequately staffed.. Many persons have complained to me of irksome delays to which they have heen subjected. I believe that the oflicers of the division are fully qualified and competent. Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that the cause of the delay must be lack of staff., Now that the Miuister has given an assurance that mortgages in respect of houses built under co-operative housing schemes will be taken over by the War Service Homes Division, much of the criticism that 1 had intended to offer has disappeared. I am sure that what the Minister has said will give great satisfaction to ex-servicemen who have secured houses under such schemes. They have been able to obtain houses of types that are most readily available, and now will have the advantage of lower rates of interest upon their mortgages. The honourable inember for Darebin( Mr Andrews), before he proceeded to make a very useful contribution to the debate, followed the traditional course of a member of the Opposition by trying to probe the weaknesses of the measure before the House.

182,Mr Wheeler (Mitchell) [9.18],"Labour party. 'It may interest the hone-ruble member for Darebin to know that of the 75,515 houses that have been constructed under this scheme since its inception in 1919, 25,46S, or approximately one-third, have been made available by this Government during the last two years. That is no mean achievement, hi terms of money, of the £S6,000,0C0 that has been made available for expenditure upon war service homes since 1919, £41,000,000 has been provided by this Government during the last two years. The best that Labour could do in a year was to make 6,084 war service homes available, but in 1950-51 this Government made 15,165 available. It is estimated that 18,000 houses will be provided under the scheme this year. I suggest to the honourable member for Darebin that the achievements of this Government in this connection will withstand any criticism. The honourable gentleman devoted some time to the matter of squares. I assure him that, at any rate during the last two years, the ""War Service Homes Division has gone to a great deal of trouble to design houses of between nine and eleven squares in which the greatest possible area of living space will be a va ilable. It has been truly said that we do not value things that are dear to us until we are in danger of losing them. Personal liberty is an intangible thing that is sometimes regarded lightly. We do not think much about it until we are in danger of losing it. Then we take positive action to safeguard it. I -was interested to hear the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) refer to-day to the time when the Labour party will again form the Government of this country. Let me remind the honourable gentleman that in 1949, and again in 1951, the people of Australia, having experienced eight years of socialism, believed that their political freedom was being threatened, and consequently took action to protect it. Tliey are not likely to forget that their political freedom was threatened. If the honourable member for Melbourne thinks that the day is near when the Labour party will .again be in power in the Commonwealth, he should think again. Before Labour can regain the. treasury bench, it will have to present to the people a Mr Wheeler. more united front than it presents now. Action to defend personal and political liberty can be taken promptly, but when a threat to our national liberty arises, action to defend that liberty is not taken precipitately, because inevitably such action would result in war. Twice since 1914 Australians have answered a call to defend their country. We have placed reliance upon the rather impractical method of, for the most part, calling for volunteers for the armed forces. Twice within my memory the nation has told men who volunteered for service in the armed forces that when they returned from defending our cause overseas, they would not be forgotten, and that the nation would express its gratitude to them in some tangible form. It is well that the nation should honour its obligations to tbose men, one of which is to provide houses for them. No thought is more consistently in the mind of a. serviceman, especially if he be serving overseas, than his return to ""civvy street"" and the security of his own home. In war-time, the number of marriages increases. War seems to spur backward suitors into making their decisions and accentuates the desire to perpetuate the race. Consequently, there are many war-time marriages, and when the war ends those couples require houses. The need is urgent, because upon the provision of houses depends to a large degree the happiness and survival of many hurried war-time marriages. In that connection, the Commonwealth has an obligation to ex-servicemen. The problem of providing houses for ex-servicemen has been tackled by both the Commonwealth and the States. It is interesting to compare the methods that have been adopted. The Commonwealth, through the War Service Homes Division, has approached the problem from the personal angle. Its object is that the ex-serviceman shall escape from the regimentation to which he was subjected during his war service, and shall he provided with a house of his own design, in which he can take pride of ownership and which will become his own. property after a .period of years. The New South Wales State Housing Commission has not approached the problem from the personal angle. It believes that it is under an obligation only to build houses that will provide shelter for individuals. This impersonal approaeh has resulted in the construction of monotonous rows of houses that look alike. Both the Commonwealth and the State authorities have encountered many difficulties. The difficulty of obtaining adequate finance is ever present. Shortages of labour and materials have to be overcome. The War Service Homes Division has adopted the reasonable and practical attitude that it will start only as many houses as it can complete, and no more, no matter how great may be the demand. The demand for houses is greater now thanO it has been for many years, but the division proposes to build only as many houses as can be built with the finance, labour and materials that are available to it. The failure of otlier instrumentalities to adhere to that principle has forced building costs to rise sky high. It is extremely wasteful for huge quantities of building materials to be tied up in uncompleted houses that cannot be occupied because one or two essential materials are not available. In New South Wales, quite frequently one sees a row of houses that cannot be completed owing to the lack of some essential material. The War Service Homes Division is to be complimented upon its policy of not proceeding with the erection of houses until it is sure that they can be completed within a reasonable time. The New South Wales State Housing become Commission has a mania for land grabState housing commissions should emulate bing. By resumption and threatened rethat example. In their case, the relationsumption, it appears to be intent upon ship between landlord and tenant, which gaining control of all suitable sites in is rarely a happy one, gives rise to many the cities and outer suburban areas of the problems. I realize that under the ComState. It has resumed so much land that monwealth and States Housing AgreeI doubt whether it will be able to use ment, thc States cannot dispose of houses the whole of it within 50 years. Two constructed under that agreement except serious results flow from that policy. It at cost or valuation. establishes an artificial market-in home sites. Many people who wish to buy building blocks are forced to pay prices to enable the States to sell such that are so high that they will be a houses at a fair present-day valuation on financial millstone round their necks for the condition that the proceeds from the rest of their lives. The policy of the such sales shall be re-invested in the conState government of grabbing homestruction of additional houses. Such an building sites in districts where the proarrangement would be deflationary in vision of public utilities has become an character and, at the same time, would urgent necessity has become a vexed problem with local government bodies who lack the requisite finance to provide such facilities. Honourable members, of course, are aware that State authorities are not liable to pay rates on land which tliey acquire for the building of houses until the houses are actually tenanted. Consequently, local government bodies are deprived of revenue in respect of large areas of valuable land. If such land were privately owned, those authorities would be able to derive suflicient revenue from it in rates to enable them to provide public facilities in the areas concerned. Recently, the New South Wales Government announced that it would make a demand-that was the term used-upo n the Commonwealth for financial assistance for its housing' commission. I do not know what the reaction of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) will be to such demands; but if they were served upon me I should know what my answer would be. First, I should suggest that State housing commissions might emulate the example of the War Service Homes Division by refraining from tying up money in the purchase of land that they will not he able to utilize for some years to come. Secondly, I should suggest that those bodies should sell some of the houses that they have already completed to the tenants that occupy them. Fortunately, the War Service Homes Division has no worries in its dealings as a landlord with its tenants, because it enables purchasers to finance the construction of war service homes and such loans self-supporting investments. That agreement should be amended provide the additional capital that the States require to expand their housing programmes. It would be much preferable to the present arrangement under which the States are always approaching the Commonwealth for more -finance for housing projects. Normally the policy of the New South Wales Housing Commission is to sell its houses to tenants who desire to purchase them, but in actual practice that policy is not being implemented. Obstacles are invariably raised to prevent such action from being taken. One cannot help thinking that the real obstacle is the Socialist principle of government ownership, the idea being that the State should be the one big landlord in tax or land tax which, if paid, would the community. That idea conforms to the dictum that brought approbrium upon the head of Mr Dedman, the late but, I hope, not lamented Minister for Defence in the Chifley Government, who said that home owners were a lot of "" little capitalists"", ownership is anathema to a large section of the Labour party. Shortage of materials is the greatest obstacle at present to the building of houses, and the War Service Homes Division has not escaped that worry. Indeed, that authority enjoys a less privileged position in that respect than the State housing authorities enjoy. The latter bodies, by virtue of arrangements that they are able to make with industry generally, either oflicially or unofficially, enjoy the great advantage of being able to obtain supplies of building materials and they frequently avail themselves of it to the detriment of private house builders. Nobody experiences the anguish of gathering materials from suppliers here and there to the same degree as the private builder does. Indeed, he is obliged to spend half his time chasing materials. It is unfair that the private builders should be placed When I first directed attention to the misat such a disadvantage. Many of them are going out of business. Some of them have suggested that a public stocktaking in respect of State housing centres, such as that at Villawood, would reveal that the State is adopting a dog in the manger attitude in respect of the distribution of building materials. In addition to the serious lack of prise. The main reason for the shortage materials, which is hampering the activiof bricks and tiles is that for some years Mr Wheeler. ties of all house builders, including the War Service Homes Division, one cannot ignore the clumsy and highly inefficient efforts of the New South Wales Government to socialize the production of building materials. It is time that State governments handed over such production completely to private enterprise. It is significant that Mr Cahill, the Minister for Works in New South Wales, recently announced with a great flourish of trumpets that the State brickworks, after they had been in operation for four years, had made a profit of £35,000 last year. He failed to point out that that undertaking did not pay income reduce that profit to less than £20,000. He also failed to point out that its operations are financed by loans from the State Government, by which it is charged interest at the rate of only 2§ per cent, Fundamentally, home per annum. That concession represents an annual subsidy of approximately £9,000 from Consolidated Eevenue. In addition, it is not liable to pay local government rates whilst, at the same time, it sells its bricks at its own price to various government departments. In view of those facts, it is a matter for wonder that the undertaking does not make a huge profit. The reason for its failure to do so is that it is operated inefficiently. On previous occasions I have directed attention to the operations of the State brick and tile works which are situated at Blacktown in my electorate. At those works, an effort is being made to prove the extrusion process. The works were originally estimated to cost £100,000, but it is now estimated by the State Auditor General that they will cost £660,000. For that outlay only a limited quantity of tiles and bricks will be produced. management of those works, the cry of the State Socialist government was, "" Give us more time "". The State government has since had suflicient time to prove whether or not the extrusion process is practical. The fact remains that that has not been done. That process has not been adopted by private enterpast, State works have absorbed manpower and materials that could have been better utilized by private enterprise. Eveni f the works at Blacktown are developed into an efficient producing u n it I hope that it w ill be so developedthe community cannot afford such a costly experiment at a time when we are desperately in need of materials. Those works bave absorbed materials that would have been sufficient for the erection of several hundreds of houses. It is useless for a State government to complain of lack of financial assistance from the Commonwealth when it, engages in such extravagant undertakings. The shortage of cement in several States is impeding the construction of houses. I doubt whether available supplies of materials are being allocated on a proper basis. For instance I should like to know what proportion of the output of cement in New South Wales is being set apart for schemes such as the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme. I do not question the value of that scheme, but when cement is in such short supply, we must consider the necessity to allocate available man-power and materials to the best possible advantage of the community as a whole. So long as the shortages of food and housing continue, long-range projects should be closely re-examined. In spite of the optimistic forecast that has been made with respect to the Snowy Mountains scheme I doubt whether we shall derive any real benefit from it within the next decade. In order to make the best possible use of available money, manpower and materials the Government should weigh the requirements of such schemes against those of the community as a whole with a view to seeing whether additional supplies cannot be diverted to housing programmes. Despite the disadvantages that arise from the lack of materials man-power, the War Service Homes Division of achievement. Naturally, its activities are limited. For instance, it is not alble to make available as much finance as it would like to be able to provide for applicants for houses. Nevertheless, its activities, under present conditions, reflect credit upon its oflicers and upon the Ministeri n charge of its operations. I regret that when the Government recently despatched a fact finding mission overseas to investigate prefabricated houses, a representative of the War Service Homes Division was not included in its personnel, because the experience that he would have gained in the course of its investigation would have been of great advantage to the division. The Government of New Zealand has undertaken extensive housing programmes. The Government should send a small fact finding mission to that dominion to investigate the methods of construction that are being applied there. One does not need to be over-patriotic to support the Government's efforts to provide houses foi ex-servicemen whom the nation farewelled on their way to the field of battle, with certain promises which, it was emphasized, would be honoured upon their return. It is as a result of the efforts of those men that we, in time of peace, are able to talk of houses and of their construction. Therefore, it is fitting that we should use every endeavour to provide dwellings for ex-servicemen. Many of them are disillusioned, and broken in health. Some have suffered physical in j u r y, whilst others have suffered from war neurosis. The best for m of rehabilitation that we can offer to them is to provide them with houses, because the home is one of the best tonics for ensuring good health. It behoves us to ensure that we shall not f a i l in our obligation to those men. having listened attentively to the honourable member for Mitchell( Mr Wheeler), I .should like to vouchsafe the opinion that he devoted three-quarters of the time that was allotted to him to confusing this bill with other issues. He gave to it his blessing for a couple of minutes at and the commencement and again at the conclusion of his speech, but devoted the rest has an enviable record of his time exclusively to a resume of thc activities of the New South Wales Housing Commission, and of various authorities in that State that deal with building materials, and he included, for good measure, some remarks about the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme. The value of his contribution to the debate",60,Second Reading
183,Mr Bird (Batman) [9.46],"Afte rwas seriously impaired because he did not deal with the subject-matter of the bill. There is a general agreement throughout the community that the War Service Homes Division has rendered signal service for the purposes for which it was constituted, namely, to provide ex-servicenien of moderate means w i th houses. The original act was passed in 1919 and, in the intervening years, various anomalies have been discovered in its provisions, ancl amending legislation has been passed in order to rectify them. The latest report of the Director of ""War Service Homes provides tangible evidence of the fact that the scheme, by and large, has been a boon to ex-servicemen. In such circumstances, it behoves every honourable member to give serious thought to any proposals that are made for the amendment of the act, because, generally, speaking, it has functioned most satisfactorily. The Ministerf o r Social Services( Mr such a decision will definitely place the Townley), in his second-reading speech, expressed some concern about the degree of assistance that has been granted to ex-servicemen to enable them to purchase existing properties. He pointed outcorrectly in my opinion-that the assistance given to them during the last two years has increased considerably compared with that given in previous years. I do not understand why such a matter should cause the Minister concern, because sound reasons may be advanced to explain why increasing numbers of ex-servicemen have sought financial assistance from the War Service Homes Division during the last two or three years in order that they might purchase existing properties. In the main, that demand has been caused by the relaxation of controls that were imposed during the last war on the sale of properties, and also by the construction of houses by ex-servicemen tliemselves. Such men, after their dwellings have been built, have asked the War Service Homes Division to grant loans on the buildings, which are classified under the act as existing properties, even though they may have been completed only two or three weeks previously. An ex-serviceman buys an existing property because he wishes to obtain a house for himself and his family as Mr Bird. quickly as possible. When he considers all the hazards and vicissitudes that are experienced by a person who wishes to buy a house at the present time, his natural impulse is to purchase an existing property if one is procurable. Existing houses are procurable to-day only in the face of fierce competition. Most of the existing properties that are placed on the market to-day are purchased by new Australians. The honourable member io? Darebin( Mr Andrews), whose electorate adjoins that of Batman, has made an authoritative reference to that aspect. New Australians are prepared to "" go to the l i m it "" in their eagerness to buy houses, with the result that an ex-serviceman who purchases a dwelling is extremely fortunate. I suggest that thc Government should reconsider its policy not to increase the present l i m it of £2,000 that may be advanced as a loan for the purchase of an existing property, because ex-serviceman at a distinct disadvantage compared with other persons who are prepared to "" go to the l i m it "" in order to obtain houses. A person who wishes to buy a dwelling to-day must be prepared to pay the existing market value. It is futil e to say that a particular house is not worth more than a certain amount. A house is worth what the vendor can obtain for it . Throughout the community, the value of existing properties as well as that of new properties has soared, and there is uo reason why the purchaser of a new dwelling should have the advantage of heing able to borrow from the War Service Homes Division an amount of £3,750. whilst the purchaser of an existing property may not be granted a loan exceeding £2,000. I have stated that an ex-serviceman who wishes to purchase an existing property encounters fierce competition, but that is not his only difficulty. Unfortunately, some real estate agents hav: become reluctant in recent years to have any business dealings with ex-servicemen who wish to purchase existing properties with the assistance of the War Service Homes Division. I have been informed on a number of occasions that some real estate agents adopt a reluctant attitude immediately prospective purchasers state that they intend to obtain a loan from the division. Those estate agents have placed all kinds of imaginary difficulties in th,?. way of the prospective purchasers, and more often than not, ex-servicemen have gone away disillusioned and disappointed, because they have not been able to buy the properties. I realize that when an ex-serviceman is negotiating for the purchase of a property, some time must elapse before the War Service Homes Division is able to complete the details of the valuation and settlement. Some real estate agents look for quick sales, and do not encourage ex-servicemen to purchase houses, because they fear that they cannot make a rapid turnover. Certain real estate agents are definitely working to the detriment of the interests of cx-servicemen. The War Service Homes Division, if it can speed up valuations and settlements, may allay the doubts that exist in the minds of many ex-servicemen about the intentions of some estate agents. A few weeks ago the Minister for Social Services informed the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) in reply to a qnestion that the War Service Homes Division required about a month in which to complete the valuation of an existing property and the details of the settlement. I believe, on the basis of facts that have been brought to my notice, that the Minister has heen misinformed, because a period of between four months and six months often elapses before an ex-serviceman is able to complete the purchase of an existing property. I have referred to the reluctance that is shown by some real estate agents to have any business dealings with the War Service Homes Division. I also point out that there is a distinct ancl evergrowing reluctance on the part of some contractors to tender for the erection of war service homes. A variety of reasons has been offered by builders to explain their lack of interest in that kind of work. Whether or not those reasons are genuine, the ex-servicemen suffer. I hope that every endeavour w ill be made to offer inducements to contractors to tender for that all-important work. It is of no use to deplore the fact that the number of dwellings that are being erected by the War Service Homes Division is dwindling, and allow the matter to rest there. We should ascertain the reasons for such a position. One reason is that contractors are not interested in tendering for contracts that are offered by the War Service Homes Division, and, possibly, their attitude is justified. The division exercises much stricter supervision over the erection of war service homes than was the case after World WarI . I recall that I saw m the electorate of Batman a number of war service homes in the course of erection in the period 1919 to 1923, and they were widely ridiculed because they were regarded as jerry-built. Doubtless the War Service Homes Division, having benefited from the mistakes that were made in the past, now, with perfect justification, exercises a much stricter form of supervision over the construction of such houses. I hope that its supervision does uot become strict to the degree that reputable builders ask, "" Why should we tender for contracts to erect war service . homes, when we are subjected to all sorts of pin-pricking by departmental inspectors? "". I have been informed by a most reputable builder that more frequently than should be the case, contractors have had to wait for unnecessarily long periods for departmental inspectors to examine the progress of the work. Such delays mean that the houses take longer to complete, and the financial returns to the contractors are correspondingly diminished. I hope that the War Service Homes Division w ill attempt to overcome such difficulties. I realize that it is easier to state problems than to suggest ways in which they can be solved, hut I suggest that the position may be improved if the division is able to complete more expeditiously than is the case at the present time the valuations and settlements in respect of existing properties. Perhaps the present staff should be increased in order to cope with that work. I also suggest that the division should not be unduly harsh towards reputable builders by demanding this, that, and the other thing in the observance of building regulations, and should not expect them to wait for unnecessarily long periods for inspectors to examine buildrepresent the general trend of thought on ings that are in the course of construction. that matter, wroteI now propose to make a few comments upon the provision for the discontinuance of the practice of taking over existing mortgages. One sentence that occurred in the Minister's second-reading speech came like a bolt from the blue to manv deserving persons. I refer to the following passage:The practice of discharging mortgages will be discontinued. No reason was given for that cardinal change of policy. It is true that proposed section 20 (S.) statesSubject to this Act and to the directions of MrN . D. Wilson, was reported in the the Minister as to matters of general policy, the Director may, upon application in writing, if the Government would not drop its promake an advance to an eligible person on the prescribed security. . . . I direct attention to the words "" to the directions of the Minister "". So far as I am able to ascertain from the statements of the Minister, the directions that he will give will be in accordance with his statement that the practice of discharging mortgages will be discontinued. We are bound to believe that the policy of the Minister will be to eliminate the practice of discharging mortgages. I have not been able to discover any reason for such an amazing amendment. Perhaps certain persons have embarked upon a "" racket"" in the purchase of houses, and the Minister wishes to frustrate them, but action taken in that respect should not penalize ex-servicemen who seek to have a mortgage discharged. In view of the urgent national need to provide houses foi the people, it is difficult to 1 understand why the Government should make a decision that will accentuate the present position. The honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson), in an ineffectual attempt to bolster the Government's weak case in this matter, said that the man who should be helped is the man who is building his own house, and tried to show that the man who builds his own cottage has nothing to fear from this proposal. But, according to the Minister, the practice of discharging mortgages will be discontinued. I have received letters from twenty ex-servicemen who express anxiety about the Minister's intention. One correspondent, whose views Mr Bird. In my particular case I built my own house with bank finance after being advised by the VVar Service Homes that they would take oveT the mortgage when I had finished the job. This way I could start with building as soon as I was ready, as the War Service Homes sometimes took up to nine months or more with paper work, &c, before the job could be started with tlieir finance from the start. That man is a builder by occupation. The organization that works constantly to protect ex-servicemen is also very perturbed. The State president of the Eeturned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia in Victoria, Melbourne Age recently to have said that, posal, it should at least hold it over until all ex-servicemen now building houses had completed the work, had it valued by the war service homes authorities and had the mortgage transferred. He went on to sayThe injustice is in the fact that ex-servicemen were more or less encouraged officially to take out short-term loans with banks and building societies and get on with tlieir building projects. This was done on the expectation of transferring the debt to the War Service Homes Division on completion of the building. Exserviceman who did this were able to have their homes completed much more quickly than if the building was done through the War Service Homes Department. The anxiety of individuals who have written to honourable members is shared by the league, which is the official mouthpiece of ex-servicemen throughout Australia. The attitude of these men is understandable. Many of them, eager to push ahead with the building of their own houses, arranged with banks and other organizations to obtain financial assistance in the belief that the War Service Homes Division would eventually take over their mortgages. They had been told by officials of the division that it would do so. Many of the loans that have heen obtained from private banks are on short terms, and they will be a source of great embarrassment to the borrowers unless the Government arranges for the War Service Homes Division to take them over. The Minister's statement must have put an end to the high hopes of many men who had planned to obtain short-term loans for the purpose of starting to build their own houses. If the Minister lives up to the words of his speech, these ex-servicemen will be forced to forgo privileges that were deliberately extended to them after ""World War II . The statistics on this subject .are of considerable interest. In 1948-49, the War Service Homes Division discharged 939 mortgages for applicants. The number rose in 1949-50 to 1,570, and in 1950-51 to 2,483. During the first three months of the current financial year, the division discharged mortgages on 943 houses. Thus, about one of every six ex-servicemen who obtain houses with the aid of the War Service Homes Division takes advantage of this system. That is a substantial proportion, and it w ill be regrettable if the Government discontinues the practice. The system has worked satisfactorily and has brought happiness to many thousands of ex-servicemen. Australians are badly in need of houses to-day and any policy that reacts to the disadvantage of persons who want to obtain houses should be discouraged. The reason why men seek to transfer mortgages to the War Service Homes Division is readily understandable. In terest is charged by the division at the rate of 3J per cent., whereas the interest rate for other loans varies from 3$ to 44 per cent. Thus, over a period of 30 years, a considerable financial saving is effected if a purchaser succeeds in having his mortgage discharged by the War Service Homes Division. Many ex-servicemen obtained private loans in their eagerness to go ahead quickly with the construction of houses. They wanted to reduce the delay that normally results from dealing directly with the War Service Homes Divisionf r o m the outset. criticize the division on account of such delays because it suffers from many disabilities. However, it would not be reasonable to expect ex-servicemen to cool their heels for months while they wait to have the preliminary arrangements completed when they can shorten the process considerably by obtaining a private loan in the first instance. What benefit will result from the Government's proposal ? made no attempt to give any explanation in his second-reading speeeh, and the two Government supporters who have since spoken have not made the slightest attempt to j u s t i fy the extraordinary change of policy. Ex-servicemen who have obtained private loans for building purposes have merely stolen a march on time. They have obtained essential building materials in advance of price rises, which occur every month under present conditions. Had they waited for eight or nine months in order to obtain the help of the War Service Homes Division, they would have been involved in a great deal of additional expenditure. By using their initiative they saved amounts of as much as £400 and, in fact, they per : formed a service to the community. This amazing policy that has been announced by the Minister will restrict house ownership to those who have sufficient financial backing to withstand the onslaught of rising costs, delays and builders' rackets. Another matter that requires attention arises fro m the payment of interest on amounts that are advanced for the purpose of making progress payments to builders. Prior to World War IL , such interest charges were of little significance because in those days a house could be built in twelve or fourteen weeks. However, under present conditions, a builder may take as long as two years to complete a house. A t that rate, interest charges on progress payments assume large proportions and impose a distinct handicap on many ex-servicemen. I hope that the Government w ill decide not to proceed with its revolutionary proposal to discontinue the discharge of mortgages, which has already caused a great deal of heart-burning and anxiety amongst ex-servicemen. I appreciate the I . do not difficulties that confront the Government, but I cannot understand this extraordinary proposal. I congratulate the Government upon its decision to increase the permissible amount of loans to £2,750. My sole comment on that provision is that it should have been introduced twelve months ago, when the members of the Opposition suggested the change. Why on earth the Government is not prepared to increase loans for ths The. Minister purchase of existing properties from £2,000 to £2,'75Q is beyond my comprehension. Perhaps it has a good reason for having made such a decision. If so, I shall be interested to hear it at the earliest opportunity. I . repeat that 1 deeply regret its decision to jettison the system for the discharge of mortgages, which has worked satisfactorily in the past. I hope that it will be able to provide an explanation that will satisfy everybody concerned, but I gravely doubt its ability to satisfy anybody on that issue. Before proceeding to discuss the bill in detail, we should consider the real purposes of the War Service Homes Act as it stands at present. Its chief purpose is to enable houses to be provided for ex-servicemen as a form of reward for the service that they gave for their country and also to enable them to make up for the opportunities that they lost when they were overseas during war-time and were unable either to acquire houses or to make effective plans for the building of houses. If we examine the bill we find that there are three main ways in which an eligible applicant can obtain a house with the assistance of the War Service Homes Division. First, he can have a house built by the division or arrange to have a house built by a contractor with the approval of the division. By using that method, he is entitled to obtain from the division a loan of £2,750. Secondly, he can purchase an existing house, for which purpose he can obtain from the division a loan of £2,000. The third method has given rise to some misunderstanding. It is unfortunate for the honourable member for Batman( Mr the division has been generous to the Bird) that he devoted at least one-half of his speech to complaints about an alleged injustice that the Government has not even contemplated. The honourable member may not be altogether at. fault for his misunderstanding of the bill. However, I say very clearly that the intention of the Government in this bill is that an ex-serviceman shall be able to build a house by obtaining financial assistance from a trading bank ov some other source and that, upon completion of the house, he shall be able to have the mortgage taken over by the War Service Homes Division. The only change of policy will be that, in future, the War Service Homes Division will require to be given advance notice of a man's intention to follow that procedure. Under the terms of this bill, the Minister will have far greater discretionary powers than he has at present. That provision is commendable, because it will tend to make the legislation flexible and will enable the Minister to apply it more humanely than is possible now. One new effect is that which will prevent the owner of a house who has lived in it for some time and has mortgaged it, from transferring the mortgage to the War Service Homes Division, except in exceptional circumstances. This proposal does not conflict with the principle that underlies the act. The main object of the act is to provide houses for ex-servicemen, not to give financial easement to men who already own houses. Perhaps this change will give rise to occasional anomalies in the future. However, we all know that the War Service Homes Division has been exceptionally generous in its treatment of ex-servicemen who have fallen into distressed circumstances, and therefore have been unable to maintain normal repayments. We know that the division is exceptionally good in that respect. We know that the widows vernment evicted hundreds of them in the depression. nonsense. The point that I am making is that in cases in which an ex-serviceman who has mortgaged his house has died, widow, in many instances allowing her to pay a nominal rent of ls. a week. Anomalies in regard to such assistance may, unfortunately, occur in the future under the Government's present policy, and we might find the widow of an ex-serviceman who was not able to transfer his mortgage to the division, in rather difficult financial circumstances and possibly in a position where she might have to sell her home. I suggest to the Minister that in future special consideration be given to cases of that kind so as to alleviate the suffering of the widows of ex-servicemen who were unable before",64,Second Reading

186,Mr Mocolm,"That is absolutetheir deaths to transfer mortgages to the division. I consider that with careful thought the possibility of such an anomaly can be removed. The policy of the Government of including war widows within the future scope of war service homes legislation is splendid, and a great deal of the credit for it must go not only to the Minister himself but also to the honourable member for pressing for that provision for a considerable time. We all know that there are bound to be shortcomings in almost any large undertaking and in almost any government department. In recent years the division has taken steps to rectify shortcomings that have been brought to its notice, but there are still some matters which it finds very difficult to rectify. There is, for instance, not only a shortage of building materials which makes building extremely difficult but also a shortage of trained technical staff such as valuers and conveyancers. That leads to some delay in the conveyancing negotiations. average person who buys a house through a trading bank can probably have the deal concluded in about ten or fourteen days. I suggest to the Minister that, if it be possible to do clo, an approach things that the Australian people have be made to some of the trading banks to see whether it would be possible to obtain the use of their staffs, naturally on the basis of a suitable payment for the service, to expedite purchase negotiations. The position in respect of the speed of such negotiations is improving, but there have been cases in which vendors have been so irked by delays in negotiations over the purchase of war service homes that they have withdrawn the houses from sale ancl ex-servicemen have lost the opportunity to buy them. It would be of inestimable advantage to ex-servicemen to have such negotiations expedited. I turn now to a point that was raised by the honourable member for Lalor( Mr their children Australians not only in Pollard). He stated that in the past only 20 per cent, of war services homes had been built through the War Service Homes Division, and that 74 per cent, had been purchased. Does he not consider that it is a good thing to encourage the building of new homes, in the [91] interest not only of ex-servicemen but also of the community generally ? I also ask him why such a comparatively small percentage of the total has been built. Apart from the shortage of materials ancl labour one of the main reasons during the last few years has been that an advance of £2,000 was not sufficient to finance the building of a house, and many ex-servicemen have thus been prevented from building the houses for themselves. The maximum advance is to be raised to £2,750 under this bill, and so an ex-serviceman will have more chance of building for himself. I venture to suggest that by virtue alone of the higher advance, the percentage of houses built in the next few years will increase. That provision will lead to an increase of the proportion of new houses and so will be of considerable value to Australia from a long-term stand-point. The honourable member for Darebin( Mr Andrews) made what I consider to be an unfortunate reference to the numWe all know that the ber of new Australians who are buying houses because they have the necessary finance, and are so depriving ex-servicemen of the opportunity to buy them. I believe that one of the most important to bear in mind is the relationship of old Australians to new Australians. Men who have fought for Australia in the past, and who in many instances will fight for it again if that should become necessary, deserve the opportunity to own the houses in which they live. However, I point out to the House that the future of our country lies to a large degree in the hands of the very new Australians to whom we often refer slightingly. Prom them will come the extra population that is needed to keep Australia Australian. I now make a plea that we be more forthright ancl willing in our efforts to help them to become assimilated. Let us use every opportunity, not to "" take a crack "" at them, but to offer to help them to make name, but also in heart, as quickly as possible. The honourable member for Lalor foreshadowed some amendments that the Opposition will submit at the committee stage. I have a fair idea of what those",69,Second Reading
187,"Boothby ( Mr Mcleay), Who Has Been","amendments will be, but I am more concerned about the motive behind them. Will the honourable member for Lalor, or whoever moves them, be motivated by a real desire to be of assistance to ex-servicemen, or will he be playing at party politics? I venture to suggest that, to judge from some of the experiences that we have had in this chamber during the present session, the motive will possibly be more party-political than otherwise. The levity displayed by the honourable member for Lalor, and the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) and the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) are sufficient to make us query the sincerity of their motives. If their motives are not sincere, then they are shameful. I should also like honourable members to bear in mind that the Minister has the full support of the considerable number of ex-servicemen on this side of the House who form the Government's ex-servicemen's committee. They are not men who are without a real thought for their fellow ex-servicemen. Government supporters who have Spoken on this measure seem to fear, for some 1 reason or other, the amendments that the honourable member for Lalor( Mr and evidently a spokesman for the War Pollard) has intimated will be moved at the committee stage. The honourable member for Mitchell( Mr Wheeler) suggested that honourable members on this side of the House should not criticize the measure. I believe that criticism of it should be welcomed by the Government, especially if such criticism may lead to an improvement of the bill. The honourable suggested that the amendments will be used for purely party political purposes. The fact is that honourable members opposite are opposed to the amendments even before they have heard them. I wonder whether the report that we read in the Sydney Morning Herald last week, to the effect that the Government intended to change its views on the matters that were dealt with in the Minister's second-reading speech, was correct. quite untrue. I regret it if it was, because I had hoped that the position would be clarified and that that clarification would assist ex-servicemen more that will the present provisions of the bill. We welcome the improvements to the act that are being made by the measure, and I am sure that the Minister has tried to do everything possible to make it suite the needs of ex-servicemen. Of course, he is only one member of a party, and he probably would not get his own way in everything. The Minister pointed out in his second-reading speech that .assistance to ex-servicemen under the measure is to be in four main groups-grou p building, which involves the purchaso of land and its development and preparation; individual home building; the purchase of existing properties: and the discharge of mortgages. The maximum advance in relation to the first two kinds of assistance is to be raised to £2,750. The maximum advance in relation to existing property is to remain at £2,000, but there seems to be some confusion ahout what is to be clased as existing property, and I believe that we can be forgiven if we are making a mistake on this issue. As I read the bill Service Homes Division in South Australia is of like mind-it will allow only £2,000 to be made available for the financing of houses built in South Australia by the South Australian Housing Trust. That trust has done magnificent work in building houses in South Australia. Last year it built approximately 800 houses and the purchase of nearly 600 of these was financed by the War Service House Division. If the men who purchased those houses had had to wait for the operation of the group scheme of the War Service Homes Division in order to erect them they would have waited for many years. These homes are soundly constructed of clay bricks and cement blocks. They are constructed so well that the Commonwealth Bank will advance the full purchase price to intending purchasers and the housing trust price is accepted as a valuation by that bank.",70,Second Reading

According to the newspapers a spokesman for the War Sorvice Homes Division has made .a statement to that effect. It has been reported that the Premier of South Australia has asked the Prime Minister to review the proposal so that the purchase of these houses by ex-servicemen may be financed to the amount of £2,750 by the War Service Homes Division. I hope that tlie Minister will clarify the position. If the Government intends that loans of £2,750 shall be made available for the purchase of these houses that fact should be clearly stated in the bill.

Honourable members opposite will then have an opportunity to show how sincere they are when they say that this matter should be settled on a non-party basis, f hope that the Minister will rectify the position, not only because of the pressure that has been exerted on him in his own party but also because of a realization of the necessity which Opposition members have shown to exist, for an adjustment of the position. One gentleman in my electorate arranged finance for the purchase of a house through a trading bank because the amount available to him through the War Service Homes Division was not sufficient. He obtained the finance from the bank on the understanding that when the house had been completed lie would arrange with the War Service Homes Division to take over the mortgage.

I hope that I am wrong in thinking that the f u l l amount of £2,750 is not to be made available for the purchase of existing houses. However, the Opposition asks that that amount be made available to all intending purchasers. If honourable members opposite were sincere in stating that this issue should be dealt with on non-party lines, tliey will support fche amendment that will be moved at the committee stage by the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard). honourable member for Kingston( Mr Galvin) was correct in stating that the purpose of this bill is to provide ex-servicemen with homes. whole purpose of the War Service Homes Aet. that honourable members should examine the circumstances that exist to-day. Tliere are three principal methods by which the act assists ex-servicemen to acquire their own houses. In the first instance, the ex-serviceman, with the assistance of an advance from the War Service Homes Division, is enabled to complete his own dwelling w i th the assistance of War Service HomesD i v i sion architects and contractors. Alternatively, he may select his own architect and his own builder ancl may receive the necessary financial assistance from the War Service Homes Divisionf or the construction of the dwelling. Two other methods are provided. The first is by transfer of mortgages on existing properties, and the second is hy purchase of an existing dwelling. I am sure that the Minister, when he replies to the debate, will make clear the position regarding mortgages. He wil l inform the House that transfers can still be made under the terms of this bill in cases of new mortgages. However, I join with the honourable member for Bowman( Mr. McColm) in suggesting that since, as the honourable member for Kingston has said, this bill is to provide ex-servicemen with homes, it is not designed to provide further assistance to ex-servicemen who already have homes,, 1 believe that the except in cases of extreme urgency or of an exceptional nature, when the Minister will still have a certain prerogative to give consideration to them. ber knew anything about this matter, he would not have made such a stupid interjection. The most important duty of the War Service Homes Division is to build homes for ex-servicemen. During last year the War Service Homes Division, dealt with 2,000 applications a month. If any one believes that that state of affairs suggests that the advancesbeing made to ex-servicemen ar-i insufficient, I ask him to explainwhy.

Previously, in order to obtain an advance of £2,000 it was necessary for an ex-serviceman to find a deposit of £200. It is provided in the measure now before the House that henceforth it will be necessary for him to find only £175 to obtain an advance of £2,750 for the erection of -> dwelling. Statistics have not proved that this increase is absolutely necessary, but it has been designed to give an impetus to the home-building project of this Government. One quoted a statement made on behalf of the Returned Servicemen's League. I suggest that he refer to the minutes of the annual congress of the league which was held a few mouths ago. he should do that he would discover that this matter was debated then, and that a Queensland delegate pointed out that £2,000 was an adequate advance. and that delegate's recommendation was carried at the meeting. Mr Harburg said that there was a l i m it to the debt which ex-servicemen should be asked to pay. It must be remembered that all advances made by the Government must be repaid. On many occasions the War Service Homes Division has valued a property at a certain figure and because the interested ex-serviceman has been so house-hungry he has paid an additional sum to the vendor on the black market. I consider that £2,000 i.s an adequate advance for the purchase of an existing dwelling, and a reference to applications made by ex-servicemen may well verify that. All my points have been amply illustrated, and honourable members opposite have only been displaying their hyprocrisy in keeping up a running fire of interjections while I have been speaking. It should be remembered that they are followers of a political -party that was responsible for appointing a conscientious objector as Minister for the Army, and which has used every endeavour to embarrass ex-servicemen. That party endeavours to use for party political affects ex-servicemen. 1 shall now deal with a matter which is not included in the bill. I have brought forward in this House previously the possibility of introducing into ex-servicemen's homes schemes a provision whereby on the death of an ex-serviceman, as a result of his war service, his home shall be transferred to his widow, and all further commitments shall be cancelled. I have put forward a scheme that I consider to be actuarially sound, and I enlarged upon it on two occasions when I spoke on the motion for the adjournment of the House. I pointed out that there had been a reserve fund of about £440,000 obtained honourable member opposite from insurance paid by ex-servicemen home purchasers which could be used to finance the scheme. I had the honour of introducing this scheme at a meeting of a branch of the Returned Servicemen's If League. It was put before the previous Government, and the then Ministerf or Repatriation gave it his consideration and referred it to the late Mr Chifley, who was then Treasurer. Nothing has since been heard of it . Again it It certainly is right, came before the Returned Servicemen's League, and by that time it had become what they termed a "" hardy annual"". The-Director of the War Service Homes Division was approached about this matter by the ex-servicemen's committee of this House, and he explained that a new policy had been adopted and instead of insurance moneys being placed into a reserve fund a rebate was made to the participants of the scheme. The report of the War Service Homes Divisionf o r last year indicated that the amount of the rebate was equivalent of 50 per cent, of the total contribution. If , instead of making that rebate, the Director of the War Service Homes Division could hold that sum in a fund, so that upon the death of ex-servicemen who owned war service homes there would be sufficient money to enable the homes to be transferred to the widows free of further charges and at no additional cost to the public it would be a fine thing. Of course, that would be done only if the ex-serviceman died from injuries or diseases contracted while on war service. I know that this scheme does not meet with the approval of the Director of the Wa.r Service HomesD i v i sion who at first said that it was not purposes legislation which actuarially sound. Wheni t was pointed",73,Second Reading
200,Mr Curtin,That is not right.,74,Second Reading
201,Mr Wight,"out that it had been proved to be actuarially sound he said that it may have been so some time ago but that it was not uow so. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Eepatriation to analyse the statistics of the War Service Homes Division. If he does so, he will find that at thc present time 15,165 new -participants have entered into the insurance contribution scheme. further analysis of the figures will indicate that only a small percentage of the participants died from war causes. The scheme is worthy of further consideration by the Minister and I urge that it be given further thought. A reference to the records of the War Service Homes Division is well worth the time it takes. Since the inception of the scheme in 1919 it has cost £86.000,000. last two years this Government has contributed"" £41,000,000 of that total, which is almost .half the amount that has been expended since 1919. That alone indicates very clearly to the Opposition, to the people and particularly to' the ex-servicemen that this Government is sincerely endeavouring to do everything in its power for the ex-servicemen. The Opposition supports this bill as far as it goes, but it is sincere in putting forward its amendments and in asking for clarification of the measure. The statement made by a number of my colleagues that t.he Minister's speech was confusing, can be very simply proved to be true by a. letter which I recently received from a young man.

I the War Service Homes Division has been point out for the benefit of honourable treated as a plaything of party politics. gentlemen opposite that the maximum of £2,000 was fixed by a Labour government, as also was the scale of deposits. The present position is that upon a loan It is proposed that in future the deposit shall be only £100. Under this clause, the deposit on the maximum loan of £2,750 w ill be £175. When the Labour party was in power, it determined that a deposit of £200 should be paid upon a loan of £2,000. This Government proposes that in future borrowers shall pay a deposit of £100 upon such loans. Andi n respect of a loan of £2,750, he will pay a deposit of only £175. Thus, whilst lie will receive £750 more he w ill pay £25 less than he did when the Opposition was in Government. I cannot accept the amendment.

However, it has been switched from Minister to Minister. Now it is heing treated as an adjunct to the extensive portfolio of Social Services. The proposals embodied in the measure will adversely affect the interests of ex-servicemen. The only benefit that they derive from this service is that it enables them eventually to obtain a cheap home. They are prepared to accept the time lag, the hazards of administration and other frustrating factors so long as they know that finally they will be able to obtain a cheap home that will be. properly constructed under the supervision of the division's architects and inspectors. Ex-servicemen will wait for as long as they can possibly wait in order to get a war service home. The deposit payable in respect of such a home is relatively small and purchasers enjoy the protection of the Government which adheres to a decided policy and code in this matter. The deposit becomes relatively high when the loan reaches a certain figure. That is what we are trying to avoid. At the same time, however, the value of money has diminished, and for that fact the Government cannot completely escape blame. 'In those circumstances, the deposit of 5 per cent, should be retained. If it is necessary to increase the amount of the maximum loan the deposit in respect of the additional accommodation should be determined on a sliding scale. I cannot see that the increase of the deposit to 10 per cent, will serve any useful purpose. On the contrary, it will frustrate ex-servicemen in their efforts to obtain war service homes. putT h a t the question he now p u t . The committee divided. (Tins CHAIKMAN-MR. C. F. ADERMANN.)

O. the loans that may be advanced by the deposits that may be required thereon. The amendments to section 19, which are complicated. The section itself is also complicated, and the amendment which in s e r t in lie u thereof thc following I have submitted on behalf of the Opposition is probably no less complicated. One purpose I have in moving the amendment is to ensure that all ex-servicemen who the supervision of the War Service Homes together Division, or existing properties, will be for Social Services( Mr Townley) stated in his second-reading a deposit of not",78,Paiks
212,Mr Pollard (Lalor) [11.30],"I embodied in this bill, are long andspeech that the present maximum of £2,000 would not be increased to £2,750 to enable an ex-serviceman to purchase an existing property. Another purpose of my amendment is to ensure that the deposit will not exceed thespecinc amounts which arc referred to therein. I point out to honourable members that section 19 of the principal act, as amended by this bill, specifically tampers with section 19 (3.)(e), which reads as follows:(e) in a case to whioh paragrapli (6) or (o) of this sub-section applies, the Director may, in special circumstances accept a deposit of less than the amount which would, but for this sub-paragraph, be required. Proposed section 19 (3.) (b) reads as follows:Section amended(6) by omitting from paragraph (c) uf that suli-scetiou the words "" in a case to see how, in the middle of a financial to which paragrapli (6) or (c) of this sub-section applies"" and inserting in their stead the words "" subject to the next succeeding sub-suction""; and . . . I do not desire to he dogmatic*, but I consider that the effect of the amendment incorporated in the bill will be to eliminate the right, which is now possessed by the director, to exercise a discretionary power to decide whether he should charge the specinc deposit of 5 per cent, to an ex-serviceman -in certain circumstances. Apparently the Minister considers that the director should not have that discretionary power. T may be wrong, but I believe that. I have correctly interpreted the position. However, I ask the Minister to clarify it. The amendment which I have moved also includes a provision which has been suggested by the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua) to meet a case in which there may be one, two, three or four dependants in addition to the husband, wife and two children. It should be obvious, even to a Government supporter who has unfairly criticized the attitude of the Opposition on this matter, that in such a case, the maximum loan will not provide adequately for those additional dependants. Therefore the director should be authorized to increase the amount which is made available by £200 for each additional dependant. My amendment also embodies a safeguard to the proposal to advance an additional £200 for each additional dependant in excess of four. I trust that the Minister will accept the amendment. Tf he finds that it is not convenient to embody it in the bill at this stage, perhaps the requisite action to do so can be taken in the Senate. I particularly want him to explain whether the discretionary power of the director in relation to deposits is to be abolished. for Social Services) [11.38] I assure the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) that the bill does not deprive thc director of his discretionary power. The amendment, which the honourable gentle1!1 of the Principal Act is man has submitted, will, if it is adopted, necessitate the provision of at least an additional £10,000,000, and it is difficult year, such an enormous sum can he provided for that single purpose. Proposed section 1.9 (4.) replaces section 18 of the principal act, which is repealed by clause 5 of the bill. The increase of the amount of the loan that may he advanced, to an ex-serviceman is necessary in order to enable building to proceed at a reasonable rate, and thereby meet the requirements of those persons who are in a position to undertake the responsibility of home ownership but who are not able to lodge large deposits. The increase has become necessary for various reasons. I should like to refer briefly to the monthly instalment rate, which becomes affected by every increase of the loan. The monthly instalment on a loan of £2,210 is £10 l is . Id., the weekly equivalent of which is £2 8s. 9d. Bates, insurance and the like amount to an additional 10s. a week. It is considered that unless an applicant is in a position to lodge any amount which is required for the bigger home that can be provided for the maximum of £2,750, he is not in a position to undertake the obligation of purchasing it. While the purchase prices of existing properties have also increased, the fact remains that, despite such increases, assistance has been given in respect of 11,143 existing proper ties during the financial year 1950-51.

Clause 8Section twenty of the Principal Act is amended by omitting from sub-section (1.) all the words from the beginning of the subsection to the end of paragraph (a) and inserting in their stead the following words:"" (1.) Subject to this Act and to the directions of the Minister as to matters of general jpolicy, the Director may, upon application in writing, make an advance to an eligible person -on the prescribed security, tor the purpose of .enabling him(a) to erect a dwelling-house on a holding of the applicant; "". -clause will deprive the Director of the .War Service Homes Division of certain rights and will place in the hands of the Minister for Social Services( Mr own initiative "". That is how the damage Townley) complete power over the future welfare of the war service homes scheme. During my second-reading speech, I pointed out that the termination of the practice of discharging mortgages would severely militate against the welfare of applicants for war service homes. The clause is as follows:Section twenty of the Principal Act is .amended by omitting from sub-section (1.) all -the words from the beginning of the subsection to the end of paragraph («,) and inserting in their stead the following words:"" (1.) Subject to this Act and to the directions of the Minister as to matters of general policy, the Director may, upon application in writing, make an advance to an eligible person on the prescribed seenrity, for the purpose of .enabling him(o) to erect a dwelling-house on a holding of the applicant; "". In order that honourable members may remainder were houses that had been fully appreciate its significance, I point selected hy the applicants and which the out that section 20 of the act provides(1.)

Therefore, the discontinuance upon application in writing, make an advance of the discharge of mortgages and the to any eligible person on the prescribed restriction on the purchasing of existing security, for the purpose of enabling him(a) to erect a dwelling-house on land owned by him, or of which he is more contractors to build new houses and the lessee under a Crown leasehold thus increase the 26 per cent, rate of new in perpetuity from a State; (fc) to purchase land and erect thereon There is no hope of that. a dwelling-house; (c) to purchase a dwelling-house, together with the land on whicli it is erected; (d) to complete a partially erected dwelling-house owned by h i m ; (e) to enlarge a dwelling-house owned by financing houses that have been built by him; or (/) to discharge any mortgage, charge, or encumbrance already existing on his holding. The point at issue arises from paragraph (/). As the act now stands, the power to discharge any mortgage is vested entirely in the director. The Government proposes that the director shall be permitted to make advances for any of the purposes specified in the paragraphs subject to the direction of the Minister on matters of general policy. Therefore, the director may say, ""We ought to discharge the mortgage on the house that Brown has purchased "", but the Minister will have the right to say, "" Cabinet has decided that it is bad policy to discharge existing mortgages"", or alternatively, "" Cabinet has decided that it is bad policy to finance the purchase of a house that bas been built by a contractor on his may be done. The Minister for Social Services stated definitely in his second reading speech that the power would be used for the purposes of restricting purchases of existing properties and of discontinuing the discharge of mortgages. That policy, if it is pursued, will throw all the funds of the war service homes scheme entirely into the business of financing houses that are erected on behalf of the division or on behalf of an applicant with the approval of the division. Expenditure on war service homes last year amounted to £25,000,000. Proposed expenditure this year is £27,000,000. But only 26 per cent, of the houses that were financed undei"" the scheme last year were built, in effect, for the division.

The rate of construction of new houses under the scheme will not be increased and the final result will probably be that only 26 per cent, of the proposed total expenditure of £27,000,000 will be expended in fact. I see the hand of the Treasury in this proposal which will be in line with the restricted credit policy of the Government, f t will also be in line with the restrictions that it is placing on any and every public activity to-day. No consideration or preference is shown to the unfortunate ex-servicemen who have been waiting foia home for a period of up to'six years, from whom the 2,000 applications a. month are being received. I admit that normally I am and have always been a supporter of the principle of the exercise of final ministerial authority, but when a Minister blandly States that advances on mortgages on war service homes arc to he discontinued I feel differently about that principle. The bill will leave the maximum advance for the purchase of an existing house at £2,000. How can anybody in there davs huy a home for £2,000? The impossibility of doing so is illustrated by the fact that the maximum amount of advance to be made by the commission under this measure is to be £2,750. When the Minister admits these things we can see exactly where we are drifting, and bow detrimentally this bill will affect unfortunate ex-servicemen and their families who are not yet installed in homes of their own. Eor that reason, I move That all words after "" by o m it t in g "" be £2,000 without us knowing anything left out with a vicw to insert in lieu thereof the following words:-""paragrap h sub-section (1) and inserting in its stead the following paragraph:' (a) to erect a dwelling-house on a holding of the applicant; Wednesday, 28 November, 1951. for Social Services) [""12.3 a.m.] -The honourable member for Lalor( Mr necessity arises, or the re-introduction ol Pollard) has voiced strong criticism which might have been sound if it were true. I consider that it is time that I made the policy of the Government in Discontinuance of relation to the proposal concerning the discharge of existing mortgages quite clear, because undoubtedly most of the Opposition comment in relation to it is based on ill-founded articles in newspapers. I could quote such articles. The honourable member for Lalor himself quoted one. I accept some measure of blame myself for not being more specific in my second-reading speech, when I spoke of the purchase of existing properties and concluded a paragrapli by sayingThe practice of discharging mortgages will be discontinued. Obviously that statement, was meant to apply to existing properties. The policy of the Government with regard to the discharge of mortgages is clear. Where a man-has borrowed money for the purposes of building a new home, and has sought short-term accommodation for that purpose, the division will, as always, take that kind of loan over. Where a man is half-way through paying a mortgage the balance will be accepted by the division. Nobody will be left out on a limb. The kind of assistance that we propose to discontinue, is the discharge of mortgages on old properties, but no ex-serviceman who has obtained short-term accommodation in the belief that it would in the end be taken over by the division, will be disappointed. We shall take over such mortgages, but there is one stipulation that we make, which is that, an arrangement must be made with the division before the applicant can expect to receive his money on the completed home. Obviously a man cannot just demand about it. I think that it is quite reason(n) of able to require that the man concerned make some prior arrangement with the division. So that there shall be no misunderstanding on the matter, I shall repeat the reasons for the amendment contained in this clause. The amendment, is necessary to enable the discontinuance of assistance of a particular type when the",82,Pairs
220,Mr Townley (Denison,"Ministe rassistance of that type without seeking an amendment to the act on each occasion. The proposal at present is to discontinue assistance for the discharge of mortgages on other than new homes, except where the division has already entered into a commitment. Homes which are under construction, or which will be completed when the bill becomes law, will be regarded as a commitment if the applicant can supplj' evidence that the building was undertaken in the expectation that a loan would be provided under the act when the home was completed. In future, where an applicant proposes to build with finance obtained from a source other than the War Service Honies Division, assistance will be given to discharge a mortgage on the home provided the applicant lodges an application before building is commenced, and the application is found to be satisfactory. These applicants will be dealt with on a priority basis, having regard to funds available. putT l m t tlie question be now put . The committee divided. ( THE CHAIRMAN-MR . C. F. ADERMANN.)

224,Mr Joshua,"It is considered byUnder the principal act they are ouly permitted to obtain one war service home. Therefore, it is necessary for them to build a home that will provide them permanently with adequate accommodation. It is impossible to purchase land and build a house for £2,750 plus a deposit of £175. A house built for that sum might accommodate a man and his wife and two or three children, but it would uot be sufficient for a larger family. A man with a large family may have an extra £200 which, if this amendment became law, would enable him to build an additional room for the extra children in his family. I think that honourable members will agree that the parents of most people are left to fend for themselves in later life. It is necessary sometimes for a son or daughter to provide a home for a father who has lost his wife, or widowed mother. That circumstance often imposes an additional responsibility on a soldier, and this amendment would afford such a man some relief and be of great benefit to him and the old people. The passing of the amendment would not involve expenditure of a great deal of money but it would assist a few families in almost every town in Australia. I cannot understand or agree with the contention of the Minister for Social Services( Mr Townley) that it would cost about £10,000,000 to give effect to my amendment. About £27,000,000 is to he spent from revenue and about £4,000,000 from loan funds this financial year in order to give effect to the provisions of the principal act. The Government should be prepared to make additional money available either from loan funds or from revenue for war service homes. growing family needs a war service home. The easy terms of the loans granted by the War Service Homes Division are particularly attractive to him and represent his one opportunity to own his own home. If the Government is sincere in professing that it wishes to assist ex-servicemen to obtain homes it would take advantage of this opportunity to do so. If it, cannot accept this amendputment now it should agree to introduce a similar provision at a future date. Not only would the passing of this amendment enable old people to live with their sons and daughters for reasons that I have mentioned but, by enabling them to leave their present home3, that aiccommodation would be made available to other young people. All this could be achieved for the expenditure of very little extra money. Honourable members of all parties agree that the War Service Homes Act should be used to provide homes for ex-servicemen, but its operation has been limited by the action of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden). The honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson), speaking of the proposal to allocate £27,000,000 for the building of war service homes, said that the Government had tackled the problem in a determined fashion. The Treasurer, he said, had asked himself, "" How can I help these people to get homes ?"" I do not believe that that was his attitude. In my opinion, he realized that not enough money was being made available, and the question he asked himself was, "" Whom can we cut out ? "" In fact, by restricting negotiations on private mortgages, a considerable number were cut out. Honourable members opposite have had a good deal to say on the theme that more war service homes have been built under the present Government than were built under the Labour Government. Every one knows that when the servicemen were discharged, their first idea was to use their deferred pay and their savings, as well as the savings of their wives, to provide homes for themselves. However, because there was a scarcity of materials and labour, they were told to wait, and in the meantime to put their money into Government bonds. They were told to The ex-serviceman with a wait until they received their war gratuity which, it was said, would be more useful to them in five years' time. That is why not so many homes were built immediately after the war. Then, when building began on a considerable scale, prices had increased so much that a loan of £2,000 was not enough.

Whenever honourable members on this side of the House have endeavoured to speak during this debate they have been gagged honourable member must not reflect on decisions of the committee. say, Mr Chairman, I believe that there should be an element of humanitarianism, even in Standing Orders, to prevent 123 honourable members of this chamber from being jackbooted out of parliamentary discussion. This Government should haul down the Union Jack and raise the fascist emblem in its place. The honourable member cannot proceed along those lines. to an analysis of clause 11. The purpose of my amendment is to prevent n recurrence of the disgraceful things that happened under the rale of a previous non-Labour government. I refer to the eviction of ex-servicemen from their homes during the depression. Thp Director empowered to make wholesale evictions and the evicted ex-servicemen were given no recourse to the courts. The \vhol° i'gly story may be found in Hansard of that period. This sincerely expressed amendment is designed to 'ensure that such evictions shall not again take place. History has recorded this black episode to the eternal discredit of a government of the same political colour as the present Government. Therefore, the Opposition believes that some safeguards are necessary in this measure. The director should not he given the intolerable responsibility of ejecting ex-servicemen and sending their families and themselves to live in "" Happy Valleys"". The director should not have to do the dirty work of the M in ister. We suggest that if depression conditions again arise-whic h to some minds appears to be inevitable-the Minister shall have to stand in tliis chamber and servicemen out of their homes. the Labour party amend the principal act along the lines suggested by the honourable member eight years ago? confident that we would never evict an ex-serviceman. No Labour government has ever evicted an ex-serviceman from his home. The National and Liberal Government which came before thc last Labour -Government evicted hundreds. Therefore, the interjection of the Minister is unworthy and stupid, and shows that he does not know what he is talking about. We press this amendment and hope that if it is carried it will prevent any recurrence of the disgraceful evictions of the past. The bill at present places the responsibility for eviction on a high public servant, but the Opposition great for any public servant to carry and that it should lie upon the Minister. putT h a t the question be now put.

The following answers to questions were overseas, but while the shortages continue circulated:BOY SCOUTS ASSOCIATION. the honourable inember for Bass( Mr Mr MI'I.CAHY asked the Minister for Kekwick) askeci the following question:In view of the fact that the Treasury has found it impracticable to allow concessional deductions from the income tax of those taxpayers who have made donations to the Boy Scouts Association, would the Prime Minister give favorable consideration to having a suitable federal grant made to this very worthy association! At the present time the Commonwealth Government contributes towards the cost of Anstralian representation at international jamborees and also assists by the loan of equipment and in other directions when special assemblies are held in Australia. The Commonwealth Government considers it preferable that assistance to the Boy Scouts Association should take this form rather than that of a grant. the honourable meniber for Cook( Mr vided an opportunity of perusing the list of Sheehan) asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development the following question:Can the Minister for National Development say whether many ex-servicemen who wore specially trained under the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme, and encouraged by governmental financial assistance to set up thoir own enterprises and who have been successfully running tliose enterprises for some time, are now in danger of losing them because of the action of the National Security Resources Board in declaring their industries to be non-essential and by denying raw materials required by those industries? In reply to the honourable member's question, I emphasize that the National Security Resources Board is an advisory body with no executive authority. It has not declared any industry to be non-essential. The many shortages of time are due mainly to the failure of world production to keep pace with the demand for materials which has expanded very rapidly. The Government is doing what it can to improve the supply position by encouraging local production and assisting importers to obtain supplies some undertakings will not be able to obtain their full requirements. immigration, wpon, notice1.

Has the Minister sanctioned Mr Elliott's departure for a conference to be held in thc Soviet sector of Berlin to further the conspiracy ? able member's questions are as follows:1. A total of nineteen persons who visited Iron Curtain countries, notwithstanding that their passports were not valid for such eoimtries, have had their passports cancelled upon their return to Australia. It has not been the practice to publish the names of persons against whom the department takes action. Tlie honourable member will be pronames, if he so wishes. 2. it is understood that Mr ElliottN presiduiit of the Administrative Bureau of the Trade Union Internationale of Seamen and Dockers (a department of the World Federation of Trade Unions). 3.

How many persons have been ordered to be deported between the l!)th December, 1049, and the 24th September, 1951, for reasons other than those given in his answer to a question on notice asked by the honourable member for Lang on the 17th October last? 2. How many of the orders have been put into effect? 3. What are the nationalities of the persons affected by such deportation orders? able member's questions are as follows:1. Seven hundred deportation orders were issued during the period the 19th December. 1949. and the 24th September, 1951, for reasons other than those given in my answer to a question on notice asked by thc honourable member for Lang on the 17th October last. In the great majority of cases ((115 out uT 700). the deportation orders were issued in respect of persons who entered the Commonwealth illegally, mainly as deserters from overseas ships. For tlie information of the lionorable member, I may explain that the greatly increasing number of dcsertior.s in Australia, caused serious concern as they upset Norwegian sailing schedules, slowed up the Iiow of migrants to this country and impeded the shipPolish ment of goods of which Australia was in short supply or Avhich other countries urgently needed. In the circumstances, my predecessor, the Honourable A. A. Calwell, decided that action should be taken under the Immigration Act for the deportation of deserters. That policy has been continued by the present Government. The action taken is to issue deportation ovders against all deserters located ancl to detain them for a period of one month in order to afford the appropriate shipping company an opportunity to arrange the deserters' re-engagement as seamen on departing overseas vessels. The adoption of this policy has heen influenced by strong representations from the TJnited Kingdom and Dutch authorities, General, upon noticeoverseas shipping interests and the British Seamen's Union. The remaining deportation tive power input allowed under departmental orders were issued against persons who regulations for amateur radio transmitters in entered illegally but who had become public charges for health reasons or who failed to comply with the conditions under which they of America? were admitted. 2.

Clerical staff 408 613 Operative staff 6,049 7,493 Thc increase in clerical staff has been due in part to thc normal development of the Engineering Branch and in part to organizational changes approved by the Public Service Board designed to strengthen the engineering planning and supervision and to relieve professional and technical officers of all possible clerical on Engineering Branch clerical staffs by procurement activities necessary under present conditions to maintain essential supplies. 2.

BAIL ber, the honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Bruce) asked a question concerning the standardization of railway gauges in Australia. The Minister for Shipping and Tranpsort has supplied the following information:The Government has been forced to take si realistic vicw of initiating major works at a time when defence preparations are already overtaxing the available resources of manpower and materials available for tlie construction of works of urgent national importance. However, the fact is stressed that certain workers are at present actually proceeding in South Anstralia under the terms of tlie Railway Standardization (South Australia) Agreement Act No. 83 passed in 1949, and further, that works are in hand concerning the provision of a standard gauge railway link between the Leigh Creek coal-field in South Australia and Port Augusta under the terms of Act No. 75 of 1950. Negotiations have also taken place with the New South Wales Government with a view to acquisition and conversion lo standard gauge of the Silverton Tramways between Broken Hill and Cockburn on the South Australian border. the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) asked the following question:I direct to the Prime Minister a question concerning the loan negotiated by Australia with the International Bank of 100,000,000 dollars at tbe 30th June. Only 9,000,000 dollars of that loan has been drawn. Australia was apparently committed to pay f per 'cent. interest on the amount undrawn. Would the Prime Minister at an early date furnish the House with information about how mucb of the loan has been drawn and how the amount drawn has been expended? I now inform the honourable member as follows:Up to Sth November, 1951, the latest date for which information is available, drawings, against the 100,000,000 dollar loan account opened for Australia by the International Bank for Eeconstruction ancl Development totalled 26,200,000 dollars. Under the loan procedures, Australia initially provides the dollars required to pa.y_ for the goods licensed for importation against the loan. Schedules of payments made for such goods, togetheiwith supporting documentation, are submitted to the International Bank from time to time and form the basis uf drawings against the loan account.
