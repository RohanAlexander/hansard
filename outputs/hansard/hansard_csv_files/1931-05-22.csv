Trade and Customs, upon noticeWhat customs revenue has been lost as a result of the tariff prohibitions and rationing of importations imposed by the present Government? A mere comparison of the revenue received on these items before and after the prohibitions and restrictions were imposed would be quite misleading in this connection, as the degree to which the importations have been affected by the lessened purchasing power of the people and the rise in the rate of exchange cannot be calculated.

I do not think that there is a more striking instance of conspiracy between the growers on the one hand and the workers on the other at the expense of the general public than in this industry. The growers have a political pull in this Parliament, and the workers have their representatives here, as well as the A r b i tration Court, to assist them.

As a comparatively new member of this House, I had very little to do with what occurred at the time of which the Minister speaks, and I am not responsible for what was done when I was not in this Parliament.

A similar policy has been adopted in connection with the production of butter, dried fruits, rice, and various other commodities. upon the area under member attack the primary producers? am not attacking that section; I am merely stating facts. If what I have to say hurts the feelings of the advocates of the primary producers, I . am not responsible. If these illegitimate increases in the cost of commodities were prevented, and trade were permitted to flow in its natural channels, I venture to suggest that the cost of living could be reduced by at least 10s. in the £, and that would have a tremendous effect in reducing the cost of production. Some honourable members claim that if our economic and financial position is to be restored, the cost of production must be reduced; but their contentions are advanced only I when the subject under discussion does not affect their electorate or any industry in which they are interested. In such cases, the cost of production is immaterial, and the public is asked to pay twice as much as would otherwise be paid.",16,Scullin

There lies no task before the Australian people more urgent than that of in some way breaking the vicious circle and of bringing down costs of production, as is being done in the other industrial countries of the world, without lowering the standard of living of the workers as measured not by money but by real wages, which are the reward of labour in the form of goods and services. about it ! honourable members consider that statement on its merits (hey must agree that it is true.

Sir Arthur Duckham also {jointed out that, owing to the elimination of competition, the efficiency of industry was being impaired. The Minister spent most of his time yesterday in trying to demonstrate that the sugar industry was being carried on efficiently, but he could not escape the fact that it costs twice as much to produce a ton of sugar in Queensland as it costs in Java, although in Queensland we have the advantage of up-to-date machinery and the superior intelligence of white men in charge of the industry. gaged in the sugar industry receive only lOd. a day. boasted efficiency of the . white man, backed by modern machinery, ought to be able to compete against the mere brawn of ignorant coloured labourers, but is evidently unable to do so. In the publication. The Australian Tariff, the authors, Professors Brigden and . Copland, and Messrs. Dyason and Wickens, write of the effect of the sugar embargo as follows:The embargo on sugar imports allows* of auy price being fixed in Australia at which be afforded to the sugar industry in areas thu consumers will continue to purchase withsouth of that line. Surely no one can preout reducing demand, aud tliat the Commonwealth Government will allow. The price fixed for Australia is £27 per ton of raw sugar, and this price is fixed at a sufficiently high only 56 per cent, of the crop was consumed in Australia, and paid for at £27 per ton. The remaining 44 per cent, was sold abroad at £11 6s. per ton. The average price received was, therefore, £19 10s. per ton. The Australian consumer paid £7 10s. more than this in order to make up the loss on exports, and the subsidy to these exports amounted to £2,175,000. In 1920-27 exports were less, and the cost was reduced to £750,000, but it doubled this figure for 1927-28. For 1928-29 the exportable surplus has again increased, with prospects of still lower prices for it , so that the cost may easily exceed £2,000,000. The r e p o r t of the sugar investigation committe e makes it clear to us j u s t w h a t the sugar in d u s t r y is costing the people of A u s t r a l i a . In the m in o r it y report, the f o l l o w in g p a r a g r a p h occurs:We can, therefore, summarize the annual cost «f the sugar industry to Australian consumers as follows:£ (a) Excess cost, including interest, of producing sufficient sugar for Australia's home requirements 3,315,076 (6) Cost of export .. 1,500,210 4,815,292 (e) Payment to growerB and millers in excess of cost of production (including 5 per cent, interest on capital value of assets) 674,760 5,490,052 That gives some idea of the burden which this industry imposes upon the struggling working man with a family to support. The Government is not justified in re-imposing the embargo. The result of this abnormal protection is to induce persons to grow sugar on land which is not suitable for it , and all sorts of artificial restrictions have to be imposed to restrict the area placed under eane. It has been said that the industry is necessary to preserve a White Australia. That is not true.

At Grafton, sugar growing is carried on side by side with dairying on rich, highly-productive land, which could be turned to other profitable uses if not devoted to sugar. Only the excessive protection granted at the expense of the public makes it possible to grow sugar successfully in those areas. I have very little confidence in the reports of the sugar investigation committee. The consumers have nothing to expect from either the minority or majority report. So far as they are concerned, it is a choice of being boiled or fried. The appointment of the committee was only a white-washing move to justify the Government in renewing the embargo. The evidence tendered to the committee was not given on oath. asked for. royal commission was asked for. appointed in order to save expense. committee was costly enough. As I have said, no evidence tendered to it was given on oath, and all but two of its members were persons either directly engaged in tbe sugar industry, or having interests in it . Despite that, we are asked to accept its report as impartial. The sugar embargo was first imposed as a war measure, along with a number of others. It was justified at the time of its imposition, but it is jam manufacturing and similar indusextraordinary that, more than a dozen years later, after all the other embargoes have long beeu lifted, the sugar embargo should be renewed. Surely the Government must realize the changes that have taken place in the meantime. Doesi t not recognize that there has been a reduction in the cost of living,, and that the sugar industry should not be specially favoured at a cost to the public of £5,500,000 a year? Are the su'gar^growera and workers in the industry to be perpetually guaranteed their present high returns at the expense of the community? Australia to be penalized for ever to the extent of over £5,000,000 a year in order to confer special benefits upon the sugar growers, and upon the aristocracy of labour engaged in the sugar industry? If members of the Labour party have to support that policy in the purlieus of Woolloomooloo, in the densely populated city of I'ootscray, or in any of our industrial areas, such as Lithgow, and many others, where the people are struggling to make a living, I do not envy them their job. It would afford me infinite pleasure to tell the electors of Bendigo, for example, the measure of sympathy which they get from the Labour party with respect to this particular commodity. There, has been, a substantial decline iu the national income, and a considerable fall in the wages paid in many industries. This agreement indicates that the sugar industry is to be entirely exempt. The reason is, of course, entirely political. These favoured sons of industrial fortunethe employees and all others connected committee was with the sugar industry-ar e to be set apart; they are not to be called upon to suffer any reduction in wages or income, and all at the cost of the general public. I advocate a tariff on sugar as on any other commodity. It has been urged in opposition to this proposal, that it would be difficult to regulate a tariff. Surely it is not beyond the wit of man to devise means for the regulation .of tariff protection on a sliding scale to meet the varying economic circumstances of the industry. This has been done in other countries, and I have not the least doubt that it could be done in Australia were there the inclination to do it. The effect of the Commonwealth sugar policy on the tries in the southern States is clearly indicated in the minority report, which states that the decline in the consumption of jam iu recent years amounts to approximately 10,000,000 lb. per annum. The report also declares in somewhat loose terms, and the statement is repeated parrot-like by those honourable members who are supporting the agreement, that this decline in the consumption of jam is due to the use by the people of other substitutes. No one has, so far, indicated exactly what are the substitutes. If the assertion were truey the figures of the Is the public of Customs Department, would reveal an increase in the importation of certain other commodities. I have asked' several.",19,Scullin

Then the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) is welcome to it. It is a fact, due largely, I believe, to the Commonwealth sugar policy, that the making of jam as a domestic industry has entirely disappeared. The housewife of to-day is not prepared to pay 4-Jd. per lb. for sugar for jam-making.

I am entirely opposed to the agreement, but the amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) is not, in my opinion, very important. Because, apparently, all honourable members are in favour of the principle contained in the amendment.

We were hoping that, I when the sugar agreement was renewed, its terms would permit us to obtain sugar at a somewhat lower price than has been ruling for some years. It is, nevertheless, a fact that the terms of reference to the committee gave the widest scope for a comolete investigation into the conditions of this industry. All interested persons were invited to appear before the comfor an inquiry into the subject was not provided by previous administrations. The people of Tasmania depend entirely for their supplies of sugar upon sea transport. If their interests are to be safeguarded in the future, it is essential that a depot should be established in Tasmania for the storage of adequate supplies. On many occasions, as the result of frequent disputes in the shipping industry during past years, Tasmanian citizens were unable to obtain adequate supplies of sugar. Under existing conditions any temporary disorganization of the steamship service between Tasmania and the mainland means danger of a shortage of sugar for the people and for several important industries in that State.

The report of the Sugar Inquiry Committee recommends more favorable treatment being given to fruit growers. Previous agreements provided for the payment of up to £205,000 per annum in the form of a home consumption rebate of £6 5s. Id. per ton on refined sugar. The committee recommends an additional £110,000, and the appointment of a fruit industry sugar concession committee to safeguard the interests of fruit growers. Previous agreements made no provision for the price to be paid to the growers. This agreement, therefore, is a step in the right direction. of world's sugar parity on the jam manufacturing industry? sentative of the largest jam manufacturing company in Hobart, has stated that, if his company could get sugar at world's parity, it would not make a difference in the price of jam of more than i d . per tin. Apparently tlie price of sugar has not been so important a factor in determining the price of jam as have been the handling charges and the profits made by the manufacturer. No one can deny that, for a number of years, the fruit growers have not been getting a fair deal from the processors. If a depot were established in Hobart we should be in the same position, as regards sugar supplies, as are people in the mainland States. Although retail grocers in Tasmania have to pay Ss. 4d. per ton more for sugar than is charged to mainland retailers, they have to retail it to their customers at the same price as that ruling on the mainland. Why should they be penalized in this way? A depot at Hobart would overcome that difficulty. Tasmania is frequently without supplies of sugar on account of the loading on the mainland being delayed through wet weather and the suspension of shipping. That State suffers many disabilities because of its isolation from the mainland, and I trust that the -Government will afford it at least some of the assistance for which we are asking. T regret that sugar will not be available at a lower price, but it is evident from the report of the committee that, in the interests of the industry, there'should be no alteration of the agreement. fair and persistent representations demand the respect of the Government, and they mil be fully considered.

The Government has, by executive act, entered into an agreement which"" affects detrimentally every citizen of Australia, and involves a direct contribution by them of £12,500,000 to the sugar industry of Queensland. Can this be said to be a deliberate Parliament when the Government, by executive act, commits the people to such an expenditure? Nobody escapes the cost of it. It is estimated that the value of the sugar produced in Australia is over £12,000,000. Surely an agreement involving that sum of money should be determined by the representatives of the people assembled in this Parliament. I oppose the agreement. Its ratification by the Government is one of the most scandalous acts that has ever been perpetrated by this Parliament or by any executive within it. It is recognized by all parties in this House that some sacrifice must be made by all sections of the community during this time of depression. Yet the sugar industry is to be regarded as sacrosanct! It is to make no contribution to the general sacrifice for the next three years at least. This Government appointed a committee to inquire into the sugar industry.

We are trying to settle people on the land and to find markets for their produce; but the sugar embargo and other prohibitions have closed markets which otherwise would have been open tp us, and, in addition, have increased the cost of our export shipping. Australia has adopted an insular policy; we expect other countries to buy from us without buying anything from them in return. By engaging in reciprocal trade with other countries we should find an outlet for our produce, and Australia, and Western Australia in particular, would make remarkable progress. If we bought our sugar and bananas from countries which can grow them easily, we could pay them back with things grown easily in this country. In that way Ausrralia would not be impoverished.

It was imposed in order to give effect to the White Australia policy. Previously, large numbers of Kanakas were brought to Australia and kept in compounds on the sugar fields in order to produce sugar cheaply. We are called upon now to consider not merely the saving of a few million pounds; but the saving of a continent. The people of the United States of America say that Australia has done well to adopt the White Australia policy. They almost fear in their country a civil war between member apply that principle to every the white and the colored races.

They cannot be accused of being lazy; on the contrary, they are hard workers. I remind honourable memcentage of Italians engaged in the industry that those Italians came here at the invitation of a Nationalist Government, and that the present Labour Government placed an embargo on their the immigration of Italians should cause the sugar industry gradually to get almost entirely into the hands of Australians.

I have had no complaint from the consumers of sugar in my electorate that the price of sugar is too high. So long as the industry keeps men in employment, they are willing to pay a higher price for their sugar. If the embargo were removed, thousands of workers would be thrown on the labour market.

The honourable member said that the sugar emhargo placed a burden on the taxpayers. I understand that he believes in a fixed price for wheat. Had the price of wheat been fixed at the rate advocated by him in this chamber some time ago, the difference between the market price of wheat and the guaranteed price would have been a charge on the taxpayers. If it is good to grant a bounty to the wheatment. growers, it is good to act similarly in the case of the sugar-growers. not received the guaranteed price, nor have they reaped the advantage of a sales tax on flour. the agreement, I think that we should take any action possible to reduce the price of sugar, and to control the foreign element in the industry. [Quorum formed.] [12.0] I am afraid that the remarks of Ibme honourable members regarding the sugar industry are dictated by State prejudices, lack of knowledge of the facts, and ignorance of the consequences of the consummation of their wishes. Our chief concern to-day is the assets of the Oommonwealth"", and, of all those assets, our now ticularly those which provide employment, production, and export. The motion before the House relates to the printing of a report containing evidence that is fuller than that in any report previously supplied regarding any industry in Australia. Those honourable members who have submitted or supported an amendment to the motion have omitted to state that the Government, in continuing the embargo, is merely following a practice that has been in operation in Australia for the last sixteen years. Recently he + Commonwealth Government, to satisfy these malcontents, who have been influenced by incorrect information, appointed a committee to inquire into, and report upon, the industry. The report submitted is most complete. There are, in fact, three reports, one of which has been signed unanimously by the members of the committee, who represent all the parties interested in the sugar industry. Therefore, their unanimous findings should be endorsed by the community generally. The committee consisted of a government officer, who is fully conversant with the whole of the details of the industry, a gentleman from North Queensland, who represented the sugar-growers, and representatives of the employers, the employees, the Australian consumers, and the Queensland GovernI n turning to the opposition that has been voiced against the agreement, one finds that some honourable members complain of the wages paid in the industry, but the conclusions of the members of the committee, so far .as the conditions of the workers in the industry are concerned, are unanimous. A number of honourable members criticized the industry because of the fact that the price of sugar lands was high, yet the committee, as a whole, defended the industry against the slur that the land values were exorbitant. No doubt it could be shown that high-priced land growing very valuable crops, and, possibly, stand-over crops has been sold at per acre. Opposition to the renewal of the agreement has been expressed on the ground, also, of alien penetration. I do not propose to deal with that phase of primary industries are the opposition in the few moments that of the greatest value, parI have at my disposal to-day, because the unanimous finding of the committee is that the alien element in the industry is well under control.

130,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"The enemies of the industry are chiefly the representatives of Western Australia, who do not possess an Australian outlook. Even in the Constitution they have signed for a united Australia. The sugar industry has opponents also in certain gentlemen who have no interest in the country's welfare, apart from small metropolitan financial interests. From their point of view they may he able to advance argument against the granting of assistance to this great industry, but we must first look at the matter from an Australian view-point. Two-fifths of this continent lies within the tropic of Capricorn, and the conditions of the people living in the tropical parts of Australia cannot at all times be considered from the point of view of the residents of the southern States. This applies particularly to the sugar industry. The growers have not been given a labour is paid, and if Australia does not dole, or anything that will cause Auswant this industry carried on under whitetralia to suffer, but merely conditions that labour conditions, the alternative is to will protect the growers and their import millions of pounds worth of stigar products against the products of blackannually from countries where it is grown labour countries.

If the sugar embargo were removed we should wipe out assets to the value of £50,000,000 that have been built up in the sugar districts in the form of roads, harbours, schools, ojc. Towns have grown up in consequence of the production of sugar, and this development has provided a considerable market for manufactured products from the southern States. The real opposition to the industry comes from the representatives of Western Australia, who describe the embargo as a dole to the sugar-growers; but Western Australia is living on a dole from the Commonwealth amounting to £330,000 a year, which Queensland helps to contribute. The sugar industry receives no dole. The minimum price at which iiis possible to produce sugar with white tralia 4s. a bushel for theis wheat? w a 8 not .dipectly Those figures showed that South Australia had received £813,292 from the wine export bounty, and that Western Australia had benefited to the extent of £37,745 as a result of concessions under different bounty acts, in addition to havand Australia furnishes a complete ing received by way of advances for wire arid wiremetting the sum of £894,048. So it will be seen that Western Australia has enjoyed advantages apart from the dole of £337,000 per annum that she is being paid at the present time. Nor must it be forgotten that millions of pounds of the Commonwealth's money to which Queensland contributed, were expended upon the construction of the east-west railway across the desert, with the object of assisting that State. No opposition was offered, to. that expenditure, and no parochialism influenced the consideration of the proposal. I have not introduced parochialism into this debate. Matters such as this should be regarded from an Australian stand-point; but I am afraid that the representatives of' Western Australia have not adopted that attitude. Are we to be deprived of the advantages which 1 this industry confers upon Australia because of the opposition of those honourable members to conditions that every government which has examined the subject has agreed should exist? Every tribunal that has investigated the industry has agreed that an embargo should be imposed upon the importation of foreigngrown sugar. The principal opponents of the industry are to be found within an organization termed the Town, and: Country Union of Australia. The honorahle membei; for Eorrest (M.v. Prowse) has claimed that the consumers, as a whole throughout Australia are protesting agaiiast the agreement. I deny that that, is so. The opposition is practically confined to cerof any suggestion that the sugar embargo has tain interests in Western Australia, and' the Town and Country Union. The views of the consumers as a whole find expression in the report, one of the signatories to which was Mrs. Morgan, who came from Western Australia.. They wereconcisely stated by Mrs.. Chapman, widow of the late SenatorChapman, when she said.:"" I believe that the Australian housewife never, objectsto paying an Australian price for Australian sugar "". The question is asked, if the wages paid in the industry are not excessive where is this £5,000,000 going? I say that the difference in regard to wages and conditions between black-labour countries answer. In the past there has been opposition to the agreement by the fruit industry. The present agreement makes provision for that industry to receive the sum of £315,000 per annum. [Quorum formed.] Every industry in Australia in which sugar is a raw material has been given assistance in some form or other. There is a rebate of £4 5s. a ton on the sugar content of products that are exported to Great Britain, and of £5 a ton when they are exported to Canada. Consequently, those manufacturers are in a better position than their competitors in other parts of the world. The statement has been made that the embargo has permitted the charging of prices that have penalized Australian industry and domestic consumers. Appendix 1: of the report of the committee sets out. the Melbourne retail prices of various commodities from 1911 to the end of December last. According to the latest figures available^ the retail price of sugar hasadvanced to a less extent than that of every household commodity with the exception of butter. Therefore, the worker in, this industry has not enjoyed special advantages at the expense of the community as a whole, and thesugar-grower has not increased' hisprice commensurately. with the increase that has occurred in the prices of other commodities. The report makes the following comment upon this aspect of the matter:These official results: appear to us to dispose penalized the public. In thas connection, tlie sugar industry like many other industries, has had to meet increased production costs due 1 to th& nationa>l policy of wage fixation and protection., Despite these tworestrictions the retail price of sugar has evidently been kept within reasonable limits from time to time. The. honourable member, for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) has argued that the advantages-in. regard to the useof machinery which are enjoyed, by. the industry in Australia should' enable it tocompete against theblack hordes of Java. The majority report says in this connexionAs to tlie third objection, viz.; that active competition with other sugar-producing countries is necessary in the interests of efficiency and reduced costs, it was established in evidence that the efficiency of the Australian sugar industry now ranks high compared with all otlicr countries, and that such efficiency first began its substantial advance iu 1921, i.e., six years after the now sixteen years' old embargo Greatly improved efficiency has in fact developed without outside competition. This is largely due to the system of payment by results adopted by Queensland in 1915. The cane-grower is paid according to the sucrose content of his cane; and that has proved to be a powerful incentive to better cultivation and selection of the best varieties of cane. Cane-cutters are emplo3'ed at piece-work rates. By these and other means, reduced costs have been brought about despite the embargo on foreign sugar. The honourable member for Warringah also stated, by way of argument, that, because the price of butter is so high, the people have had to resort to the use of peanut butter. A comparison of the prices of the two products w ill show that the price of peanut butter is out of all proportion to that of ordinary dairy butter; and, as a matter of fact, the price of the latter has in creased to a less extent than has that of any other commodity since 1911. Today butter is sold at less than the cost of production. orable member, therefore, has merely displayed that ignorance which characterizes his utterances when he is dealing with important matters, particularly those that affect the primary producing industries of this country. H is view-point may be that of a city electorate which destitution has not yet visited, and whose people move in a prosperous atmosphere. of us have to get down to realities, and endeavour to alleviate the conditions of those engaged in our primary industries, who suffer hardship to promote industry, ancl who keep the inhabitants of the large cities in existence.

The value of the land used for sugar production, the effect of the price of sugar upon associated industries, over-production, the utilization of by-products, alien penetration, and other aspects of the matter were closely examined. Evidence was taken in every capital city of the Commonwealth, and every opportunity was given to and availed of by representative interests commenced its course . . . throughout the Commonwealth. Those who decry the Australian sugar industry with a view to substituting the blackgrown product were given every encouragement to state their case. No other industry has been subjected to such a severe examination. No other committee has submitted to Parliament evidence and conclusions of such an encyclopaedic nature. The report was ably and cleverly formulated by the members of the committee, who did their duty fearlessly and well. A f t e r mature consideration of the pros and cons, the committee effectively contradicts the allegations of those who are hostile to our sugar industry. The case for the industry was not advanced by any great combine of interests, by cormorants seeking to victimize the people of Australia, but by the growers and their organizations, and. the workers. They gave their evidence so frankly aud freely that it carried weight with the unbiased members of the The honinvestigating body. The committee was not composed of the nominees of any one party, but included a nominee of the Commonwealth Government, of the Queensland Cane-growers Council, a representative of the employees in the industry, one of the Australian consumers of sugar, a representative of the Australian fruit-growers, and another of Australian manufacturers using sugar in But some their manufactures. able member's time has expired.

132,Mr White (Balaclava) [12.35],"Queensland representatives on both sides of the House appear to have been welded together to defend the sugar industry, but apparently they are not prepared to live in the present and consider -existing facts. The whole matter boils down to this: is the prevailing price for sugar fair and reasonable? I submit that the price is not reasonable. Every other industry is at present suffering from the depression. Why should the sugar industry be granted a new lease of life on war-time conditions, aud be allowed to enjoy the inflated prices of the past? Honourable members will gather from page 32 of the minority report that a reduction of the wages of sugar employees occurred in August, 1930. An application has been lodged with the Arbitration Court for a further lowering of those wages. If reductions are being made in the earnings of those employed in the cane-fields, it should folit is but logical that a reduction low that a decrease should take place in the price of sugar to the public. occurs in the wages of cane-cutters, the saving is pooled and the benefit passed on to the consumers. in pools, and prefer a straight out reductionCompetition has forced every other industry in Australia to reduce the price of its products. Whenever the Arbitration Court has decreed a reduction in the rates of wages obtaining in an industry a consequent decrease has occurred in the price of the commodities concerned. However, I shall not take up the time of the committee in elaborating such details. I have an important proposal which I urge the Minister to consider favourably. I suggest that a rebate of £3 should be allowed on the cost of sugar supplied to bakers, pastry cooks, and biscuit-makers for use in manufacturing goods for local consumption. Already a concession is given to confectionery manufacturers and to fruit canners. As pastry cooks and bakers use 75 per cent, of the dried fruits produced in Australia and use large quantities of flour, eggs and other primary products, it is but reasonable that this of living. rebate should be given to them. It would provide a definite method of passing on to the consuming public a decrease in the cost of living. The tradesmen to whom I refer consume some 27,000 tons of sugar annually, and the rebate that I advocate would reduce the great profits of the sugar-growers and manufacturers by only £81,000 per annum. should not housewives enjoy a reduction in the price of sugar? proposal would bring about a lowering of the price of foodstuffs. The rebate that I urge would counteract the effect of the sales tax that was recently placed upon meals, and certain products of bakeries. ber give an assurance that a reduction in the cost of biscuits and the other items to which he refers would follow an acceptance of his proposal? sonally am unable to do that, yet in price should follow. From 1910 to 1912 these industries enjoyed a rebate similar to that now proposed by a reduction me, which was instrumental in keeping down the cost of living. At a time like the present, when every penny saved means something to the thrifty housewife, I have no great faith and when Ave have some 300,000 unemployed, a proposal such as mine is worthy of acceptance by the Government. When the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) was speaking, I asked him whether he had any information indicating that there had been a decline in the output of home-made jams, in recent years. Apparently the honourable member considered that the high price of sugar has not deterred housewives in this matter, but I assure him that in Victoria the output of home-made jams is infinitely smaller than in previous years. [Quorum formed.] There is a possibility of large interests seeking an injunction in Melbourne against the renewal of this agreement on the terms proposed. My suggestion on the other hand, which I shall later propose as an amendment will mean a slight lowering of sugar prices and effect a definite reduction in the cost Honourable members are aware that Australia has an over-production of sugar.

I am quite -sure that if it were carried on in all the States there would uot. be to-d'ay that tragically ill-informed public opinion throughout the Commonwealth which accounts for so much of the prejudice that is displayed towards the industry. Wo country has a greater consumption per capita of sugar than Australia. The people of the TJnited States of America eat probably more sweets and sugar concoctions than we do, but they consume 10 lb. per head of sugar less than we do. Our consumption is 114 lb. of sugar per annum. Apparently this "" dreadful"" embargo about which we have heard so much, particularly from our friends in Western Australia, has not had much effect upon the consumption of sugar by the people of Australia. After all, the economic problems of the industry do not concern the average consumer of sugar to any great extent. He has had every opportunity to hear all the propaganda that has been published against the sugar agreement, and all about the governmental protection afforded to the industry. It has been pointed out to him that he should not be expected to pay 4£d. per lb. for sugar, when the people of Great Britain and New Zealand are probably not paying more than 2-Jd. per lb. He has also been led to conclude that by having to pay this added price he is being so unfairly dealt with that steps should be taken to remove this injustice. He has further been told about the very wealthy growers of sugar, and the wonderful conditions enjoyed by those who are working in the industry. The honourable member for Waralways listen with particular care-tol d the House that the people engaged in this industry were absolutely sheltered inasmuch as they had not been subjected to any reduction of wages. I am sure that the honourable member would not attempt to mislead the House, but if he had carefully read the minority report he would have found that in August and September, 1930, there were certain wage reductions in the sugar industry, and that when the report was being prepared there was a further application before the Industrial Court for a reduction. On'y to-day in the Canberra TimesI find the following:Brisbane, Thursday -The Industrial Court to-day reduced the basic wage from £3 17s. to £3 14s. for adult males, and from £1 19s. Od. to £1 10s. for adult females. Mr Justice Webb said that the reduction was nothing more than a cost of living reduction such as would occur at any time following a reduction in the cost of living. It was not due to the depression. reduce the price of sugar? those working in the industry, and whilst it cannot immediately reduce the cost of sugar it will be a contribution towards the trust account. When that account is sufficiently in credit an effective reduction, probably a half-penny per lb., will be made in the price of sugar. wages apply to piece rates as well? of last year and that mentioned in the Canberra Times to-day apply, I believe, generally to those engaged in the industry. of wages, will the price of sugar be reduced ? credited with any surplus after the growers have been allowed the cost of production. citizen upholds the White Australia policy. Upon that subject we all are agreed, and there is no need for me to enlarge upon it. The people realize also that sugar cane is being cultivated by white labour in tropical parts of the continent. I cannot agree with the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen) that the country now devoted to the cultivation of cane could be used for dairying; I believe that the greater part of it would be most unsuitable for the dairying industry. Sugar cane,'however, is being successfully cultivated under white labour conditions, and settlement in tropical areas is extending. That cannot be said of any other primary industry, in the tropical areas of the Commonwealth.

The ordinary sugar consumer appreciatesalso the fact that all our requirements of sugar can be prod.uced in Australia and that the price he pays is fixed by Government authority. He knows also that more sugar has been produced than the local market can absorb, and that the surplus has been sold overseas at an average return during the last five years of £11 5s. a ton, including the benefit of the British in the world's market render it difficult, if preference; whereas the producers' return for raw sugar sold in Australia has been £26 16s. Those facts have played a prominent part in the propaganda in opposition to the protection given to the sugar industry by this Government and its predecessors, and the consumer is led to conclude that people in other countries tained a uniformly normal price, was not are getting cheap sugar at his expense. What are the facts? Various honourable members have ably traced the history of the sugar industry from its genesis to the present time, and there is no need for me to repeat what has been said; but there is one fact which cannot be gainsaid, namely, that the people of the Commonwealth, not of Queensland and New South Wales alone, deliberately adopted a policy to encourage the establishment of the sugar industry. That policy has succeeded to such an extent that to-day the production exceeds the local requirements; and the industry gives direct employment to over 7,000 growers and 22,999 employees in Queensland and New South Wales. It also contributes substantially to the prosdustry as a white man's industry. I perity of auxiliary industries, notably shipping. All the raw sugar consumed in the Commonwealth is conveyed to the refineries in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia in Australian ships officered and manned by Australians, and no less than £750,000 is paid annually in coastal freights on raw sugar. We must remember also that over £30,000,000 of capital ""is invested in the industry', and whole communities in North Queensland are entirely dependent upon it. The honbill) said that he was not opposed to the protection of the sugar industry, but he is and' distribution at a fixed price. opposed to the embargo. Mr D. Cameron. biggest ramp ever put over. he did not mean that. Exception has often been taken to embargoes as a means of' protection. The justification for the embargo lies chiefly in the frequent and violent fluctuations in the world's price of sugar. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), when Prime Ministei', saidForeign conditions and violent fluctuations not impossible, to protect the Australian sugar industry adequately by any customs duty. In 1925 the then Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, statedThe experience of the last eighteen months had shown clearly that a tariff duty, while effective in regard to products which maincapable of scientific accuracy when applied to sugar, which fluctuated to an extent which rendered the duty at times abortive. A tariff which would give a reasonable return to the Australian producer when the world's market price was low would result in unduly large profits when the price was high. On the other hand, if the duty was based on a high tariff, the sugar industry would be seriously injured, if not entirely destroyed, during the period when low prices prevailed. Prom the time that the Commonwealth Government assumed control over the Queensland sugar industry in 1915, its whole policy has been one of expansion. During the early years of the Great War, there was a shortage of sugar in many countries, where high prices were paid, and supplies had to be rationed. During those years Australia was making a determined effort to establish the sugar inshall not weary honourable members by relating in detail the circumstances under which it first became established as a white man's industry; but it was, as I have said, prior to the war that the industry was making, a desperate attempt to become established as a white man's calling in a tropical land. Honourable members are aware that when the Commonwealth Government assumed control of the industry in 1915, it entered into an agreement with the Queensland Government to purchase the whole of the production, fixed the price of raw sugar, and also arranged for its refining As our own production at that time was",34,Parkhill Known Record With Regard To Tariff

177,Mr D. Cameron,"I am sure thatentirely inadequate, the Commonwealth imported large quantities at a high price. While consumers in overseas countries in which sugar was then being rationed were paying as much as Is. 6d. per lb., those in Australia were paying only 3^d. per lb. From 1915 onwards I do not think the price of sugar ever exceeded 6d. per lb. think it would not. proceeds were paid into Consolidated Revenue. other countries the consumers who were rationed were paying Is, 6d. per lb. In 1919 the Commonwealth was obliged to import 110,000 tons, and in 1920, 112,000 tons to meet our requirements, and a flat rate was charged for all sugar made available for local consumption. At that time production began to increase, and the total prohibition of importations was subsequently introduced. Although tariff protection was provided to the extent of £9 6s. 8d. a ton, it was never enforced. In 1920 the price of raw sugar increased from £21 to £30 6s. 8d., and by 1922 the production in Australia had increased to such an extent that only' 5,000 tons had to be imported in that year, whereas, in 1920, 112,000 tons had to be imported to meet our requirements. In 1922-23 a small surplus of 576 tons of sugar was produced. In connection with the agreement now under consideration, I quote a paragraph from an article which appears in the Australian Sugar Journal of the 9th April of this year. Although some honourable members may say that the opinions expressed in that journal are Biased, I do not think that it can be said that the following paragraph expresses views that are in any way biased:We can confidently assert tliat no other Australian industry has ever heen subjected to anything like so searching an examination The e x a m in a t i on was by the committeeand if it can be argued that the sugar industry occupies a unique position, from the nature of the protection afforded it , the reply is that this industry is not alone in the .enjoyment of an embargo, whilst, under the protectionist policy of the Government, many other industries arc working behind a tariff which practically amounts to the same thing. A consideration of the searching character of the inquiry renders it all tlie more gratifying i bat the sugar industry should have come so satisfactorily through the ordeal, and that the adoption of the embargo should have been so amply justified. We have said on former occasions that, unless the embargo can be shown to be in the interests of Australia aa a whole, its continuance cannot be entertained. That, undoubtedly, is -the aspect from which the committee viewed the position, and why it endorsed its continuance. I also wish to quote from the evidence given' by Professor J. B . Brigden, a portion of which has already been quoted by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis). The chairman of the committee, in presenting the case to Professor Brigden, saidThe point at issue seems to be whether it ie of greater eeonomic advantage to Australia to give the people sugar at a price that is a minimum, or to keep the price of sugar for home consumption at the same margin as at present and export the 40 per cent, surplus. If the latter policy be the more economic one, the question arises: How far could a nation subsidize primary industries such as sugar, butter. &c, in order to be able to sell its surplus in those industries on the world's market at world parity prices? Professor B r i g d e n ' s r e p l y is reported in this w a y Sugar was one of those things in which Australia has been rather uneconomical. It imposed a cost on the community which i i i more prosperous times it could afford to pay: but ho doubted very much if sugar, in proportion to the service it rendered to Australia was the most costly to the country. His point of view was that sugar was only one of the protected commodities. It would be most inequitable to take action ou sugar alone. A rough estimate of the excess cost of sugar to Australian consumers might be allocated as follows:-One-thir d to the cost of protection of other industries; one-third to tlie inliercul costs in the industry itself, including the cost of the standard of living, and one-third to the loss on exports. The committee might consider very carefully, not only the economif conditions, but the repercussions of political and sentimental feelings. There were serious grievances in the western State of Australia owing to the inequity of the. protectionist policy. In Queensland, sugar just about balanced the cost to Queensland of protection in the other States, and if anything serious were done to cause a loss to Queensland through the removal of the sugar protection, four"" States out of the six might be arguing violently about the national policy and whether federation was worthwhile. There was more merit in protecting industries in outlying States than in spending part of our national wealth in large congested cities. Owing to the peculiar geographical and national importance, there were special reasons",35,Parkhill Known Record With Regard To Tariff

180,Mr D. Cameron,"Yes; but infor protecting sugar. Xo take away any substantial amount of the support now being given to sugar would have very serious repercussions on Queensland and on the rest of Australia. The benefits to be derived from cheaper sugar would not be felt in the same intensity as the cost. A radical change was sometimes worse than leaving things as tbey were. On purely economic grounds the change should be as gradual as possible I entirely agree with that assertion. If any change in the present system is to be made, it should be gradual. A drastic cut in price for local consumption would shake the industry to its very foundations, and the removal of the embargo would subject it to the risk of being overwhelmed in the tide of world production. He continuesso that the shock will not come suddenly. In the present state of affairs it was imperative not to shock any industry. On various grounds he had the greatest sympathy with an industry which might have built up production on a bad basis tlu-ough no fault of those in it. The whole sugar industry had been led on by a Commonwealth policy which bring down a bill r a t if y in g the agreement was not its own affair entirely, and it would so that Parliament may endorse its be most unfair to make that industry pay for action. the mistakes of the whole of Australia.

Many honourable members of this House support the principle of an Australian price for primary products. I have heard several honourable members denounce a local price for sugar, but the same honourable gentleprice for their product. men have supported the principle of a local price for wheat. I have repeatedly voted for the institution of a local price while 45 per cent, is exported overseas. for wheat within the Commonwealth. I believe in an Australian price for wheat, butter, dried fruits and evory other priGovernment seeks to give every secondary mary commodity. The sugar industry is organized, and is entitled to the local price. I remember many years ago, when the wheat-growers approached the then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), and asked him for an Australian price for wheat and a compulsory pool, he met us with these questions: ""Are you organized; whom do you represent; and what are the numbers in your organization ?"" While we could say that we were to some extent organized, we were not, in the opinion of the right honourable member, a sufficiently close-knit body to be able to demand a local price for our products, and I think he was right. I believe in organization. A t the present time the sugar men are organized, as are the dairymen, and other sections of primary producers. If the wheat growers were organized now, they would be getting more for their wheat than a net return of 2s. a bushel. Compare that with the return of 8s. a bushel which the farmers in Germany are receiving. At the present time, sugar is being exported from Australia. In fact, the production of sugar has so increased, and the price of the exportable surplus is so low, that there has been a serious for Australian sugar. The industry is many years about 80 per cent, of the product of the dried fruits industry was conwas sent overseas. To-day, probably more than 80 per cent, is exported, and less than 20 per cent, consumed here. consumed here in large quantities. so high that the growers.are compelled to organize for the purpose of obtaining a local price for their product. Seeing that every other industry is protected, the growers of fruit for drying are justified in organizing and seeking a local Probably not more than 55 per cent, of the sugar produced in Australia is consumed locally, We have within the last few days been discussing the tariff, by means of which the industry an opportunity of securing a local price for its product, and those industries are securing that higher local price. Very little of the product of our secondary industries is exported. Those industries have availed themselves of their privileges to the full, and under the protection of the tariff, sell their goods on a sheltered Australian market. The men engaged in growing sugar are mostly in a small way. According to the report of the Sugar Investigation Committee, the areas under cane vary from 43 acres to 109 acres. Generally the growers are men with large families, and the areas are worked on a family basis; not much outside labour being employed. When the families grow up, it is necessary to find an occupation for the sons, and, as happens in the wheat-growing districts, land adjacent to the original holding is bought for them, at considerably above the true market value. That has tended to inflate the values of the sugar land.

It has already been announced that the tonnage handled this year will not exceed 50 per cent, of that processed last season, and the price for the tonnage so processed will be considerably lower than growers have ever received. fruit industry is somewhat akin to the sugar industry as an extensive employer of labour. The amount paid iii wages represents over 50 per cent, of growers' production costs, as was ascertained by the Development and Migration Commission report, and the ""total wages paid by the fruit industry, including factory processing and handling, amount to £575,000 per annum. As to the importance of the fruit-growing industry generally, here are a few facts to show that it is worth some help from the sugar industry and from the countryExpenditure to the amount of about £140,000,000 has been incurred in irrigation and closer settlement schemes, containing large fruit-growing areas. The capital value of the fruit-growing industry is stated to be £50,000,000; the area 400,000 acres, and the value of the annual crop £14,000,000, whilst exports of all classes of fruit are valued at £7,000,000. The industry employs 27,000 workers, including casuals, whilst in the canneries and jam factories a further 6,000 are employed. 33,000 workers and their dependants are vitally concerned in the saving of the fruit-growing industry. Apart altogether from wages paid by other fruit-growers, the canning and jamgrowers and their factories are paying out each year £575,000 in wages to employees. The export value of canned fruits alone can be estimated at £650,000 per annum-quite an item in providing funds overseas. favorable circumstances! It is estimated that there are about 640,000 acres of irrigable land in the Murray valley lying between the Hume dam and Echuca. The greater part of this land is suitable for fruit-growing of every description, but it is specially adapted to the growing of canning fruits. I do not mean to suggest that the area planted with soft fruits for canning can safely be increased to any extent just at, the moment'; but it would be capable of expansion to an enormous extent if the production costs in both the orchard and factory could The be brought down to a competitive basis with California, which is our most serious competitor in the British market. The assistance which is to be given under this proposal will be of immense benefit to all classes of fruit-growers, as it should now be possible to process the bulk of those fruits which are specially grown for canning. In the past, and more particularly during the last season, because of the difficulty in getting th? canners to take all canning fruit offering, much of this frui t found its way to the market, and came into competition with fresh fruit, thereby destroying prices of both classes of fruit. In addition, hundreds of tons of fruit fell from the trees. This industry probably provides more work per acre than any other industry in Australia. member does not contend that an additional £1] 0,000 is likely to l if t the canned fruits industry out of its difficulties? with the rebate of £205,000 to the growers and the processors, will be of great benefit Thus it will be seen that to the industry. a super-optimist. of those who are engaged in the industry;. and, assuming that the industry does not suffer auy further setback, this additional assistance will probably save it from disaster.

190,Mr Hill,"I am -giving the opinionThis proposal, if adopted, will give a new lease of life to all those engaged in. the industry. Personally, I hope to see the industry extended in the near future. We should aim at continuity of supplies of Australian canned goods in the world's markets. Australian canned frui t is undoubtedly equal, if not superior, to anything packed in any part of the world. It is the duty of the Governments, State and Federal, to see that the Murray waters-the conservation of which has cost this country many millions of pounds-ar e utilized to the best advantage. We are blessed with good irrigable country and a sufficiency of water, which can be easily gravitated, to provide for the employment of scores of thousands of men in the Goulburn and Murray Valleys; but, as I have said before, this can be done only when our production costs are a little lower. I appeal to the Government to remove every burden which besets this rural industry. We are thankful for this instalment of help, but with the removal of the burdens that are depressing the canning fruits industry a great future will be assured, not only to those who are at present engaged therein, but also to many thousands who will undoubtedly sooner or later take up the growing of canning fruits for our overseas trade. This is one avenue through which our growing population can find employment, provided, of course, that we can produce at a profit. The fruit industry has a special claim for relief. It is one of the best customers the sugar industry has had, but can continue to be a big buyer only if the suggested help is actually embodied in the new agreement. assistance of £110,000, as suggested on page 90 of the report, means all the difference in the world to the fruit industry. A fund of this extra amount would be of inestimable value for the next three to five years. It would, if properly handled by the committee proposed to administer it, literally save the canning and jam fruit-growers from absolute extinction. To-day, growers are getting only £5 per ton for their prime canning fruits, £4 per ton for jam apricots, and £3 per ton for jam plums. Mr Hill. Development and Migration Commission proved that an average price of £9 10s. per ton for canning fruits was needed to enable the grower to exist. How is any grower to survive another year if he gets £5 per ton for fruit which it cost him £9 10s. to grow ? Tremendous benefit will be given to the fruit-growers also, if the suggestion in the majority report to establish a full fund of £315,000 per annum, the funds to be disbursed through a committee, on which fruit growers are strongly represented, is adopted. First it would mean that the fruit-grower could bargain for a reasonable price for his fruit as no canner or jam manufacturer can claim a rebate from the fund of £315,000 unless certain fair prices are paid for fresh fruit. Secondly, when a fixed price has to be paid for fruit there will be no incentive for manufacturers or canners to cut their sale prices of fruits and jams to below cost prices. Usually these cuts are taken in some way from the "" hide"" of the growers. When this can no longer be done, reckless cutting will cease, and some reasonable stability in selling prices will be achieved. This, in turn, will give the grocer confidence to buy and sell more fruits and jams, and leave manufacturers 'with a fair margin for their work. Thirdly, with a reasonable proportion of the fund of £315,000 ear-marked for the assistance, if necessary, of the export trade in canned fruits, the annual surplus over domestic requirements should be cleared without the former serious losses to exporters and growers. It will mean a great deal to have an annual fund upon which to draw after proper investiThe extra gation. In this way up to one million cases might be exported annually overseas, and funds approximating £800,000 provided overseas. Fourthly, the committee to administer the fund could, and no doubt would, lay down a policy calculated to rectify the serious decline in the values of orchard produce and no one can deny that this is desperately needed. The grower must get more for his fruit or he will go out of existence altogether. This fund can be used to rehabilitate the grower. The manufacturer is able The report of the to look out for himself. I am pleased that the fruit-growers are to receive some consideration under this proposal. It is a rather tardy recognition of the unfair position in which the oanning and jam fruits industry has been labouring for years. £205,000, which has been rebated to this industry, has not been nearly sufficient, neither has the method of the rebates been quite satisfactory. The additional rebate of £110,000, bringing the total rebate to £315,000, means roughly a reduction of about l i d . per lb. on the sugar used. This should enable the export of canned fruits to continue under fairly reasonable conditions. I trust, therefore, that the findings as contained in the majority report will be adopted by this House. I hope that the agreement will remain in force for some years. Of all our primary industries the sugar industry is. the most efficient, and best organized. It is only by organization that the fruit industry and other primary industries of Australia will thrive. I shall vote for the adoption of the report. There are, of course, differences of opinion on this subject. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) has stated that the sugar agreement has been responsible for a loss of £7,000,000 to this country. The majority and the minority reports of the SugarI n quiry Committee state that the average loss has been £5,000,000. world's parity at £10 a ton. for sugar the freight and other charges would bring the price in Australia to £13 14s. 6d. a ton. On that basis the average loss over a period of three years would be something like £2,750,000. Those who listened to the honourable member for Echuca( Mr ship, and also at the various ports at H ill ) must realize that the sugar induswhich the vessel would call. On that basis try is of great advantage to the fruit growing industry which employs a considerable number of men both in the production and preservation of fruit. There is room for considerable development in both the dried and canned fruits industries, and it is, therefore, necessary that we should produce our own sugar. In connection with canned fruits, I have always urged that on the tin should be stamped the date on which the fruit was processed. Medical experts have shown that poisoning has sometimes resulted from inferior tinning. Modern invention [77] has greatly improved the tinning process, so that the solder which one time was a great danger may be absolutely eliminated from the tins by machinery. I Ava3 the only member of the House of The sum of Representatives who followed the Kanakas when they were returned to their homes iu the New Hebrides. That visit has some pleasant memories for me. After paying the fare of the friend whom I took with me as a companion, I offered to pay my own fare, but Burns, Philp and Company would not accept my money. I sai'd that, in that case, I would not accept a passage on their vessel. Mr Lucas, an able man, who at that time represented the company, asked me why I would not accept the invitation extended to all members of Parliament to travel free on their vessels in certain circumstances. I told him that I desired to preserve my independence, because I might find it necessary to criticize the company for its treatment of the Kanakas. I said that if I ate bread at the company's table without paying for it, my lips would be sealed. He informed me that the company welcomed any criticism which I might be called upon to make. He explained that the Government had made a fair arrangement with the company, which would act squarely in return. He invited me to criticize the company to the full, and urged me to accept a free passage. I insisted on my Taking refusal to accept a free passage, and just as firmly he refused to accept my money. But, as two sensible persons can always come to an amicable agreement, we ultimately arranged that, in return for a free passage, I should give my medical services as ship's doctor while on board I was shipped as ship's doctor at Is. a month. I still have a medal, which I value greatly. It is only a shilling, but it is embedded in gold. It was presented to me on behalf of Burns, Philp and Company by Captain Voy of the SS. Tambo with the words, ""Hard earned and hard held."" The other shilling, which was paid to me for my services, was expended in obtaining my discharge as an able bodied seaman. I went to the New Hebrides determined to criticize freely, even severely, if I had thought it necessary. As some members representing",40,Parkhill Known Record With Regard To Tariff

Honourable members probably know that the death rate among the Kanakas, when in Queensland, was very heavy when compared with the average death rate in that State. most dangerous period of human life is the early years, particularly the first twelve months and up to about the fifth year. The treatment of the Kanakas is typical of the treatment which in al] generations has been meted out by slaveowners to their slaves. Every device was employed to get the Kanakas on board the vessels in order to bring them to Australia, and when they attempted to escape, their captors sometimes did not hesitate to kill them. The death rate among the adult Kanakas was 10 per cent., compared with from 2 per cent, to 4 per cent, for the population of Queensland generally. I wish to say that Burns, Philp and Company carried out their agreement to the very letter. I found no reason to criticize the firm's treatment of the Kanakas. Just as freely as I recently criticized the firm through the press, 1 then, as I do now, praised the company for the splendid way in which it transported those Kanakas back to their homes. The blot associated with Kanaka, labour in Queensland has been removed from Australia. It is well that, honourable members should consider the position in the TJnited States of America in connection with the coloured question there. One of the most intelligent and learned Americans I have had the pleasure of meeting and calling friend, told me on his last visit here that, in his opinion, the TJnited States of America would gladly pay the war debt of the world to be freed from its "" black "" question. In the hope that the slaves, when freed, would leave their country, the people of the TJnited States of America founded a republic in South Africa for them. But they did not go; and now the black population of the United States of America is increasing more rapidly than is the white population. The negro population of that country is now upwards of 12,000,000 persons. All thinkers and writers of note wonder what will happen in the future. Happily Australia is free from such fears. Eveu if it cost many millions of pounds to keep Australia white, the expense would be well worthwhile. Were it not for the sugar industry of Queensland, large quantities The of fruit grown in different parts of Australia would rot on the ground. It does not pay the fruit-growers to send the whole of their fruit to the Sydney and Melbourne markets, because of the difficulty of obtaining a fair price for it. The existence of the sugar industry in Australia makes the processing of fruit possible. It is not always possible to judge the value of an action by the expense involved, because, at times, the indirect benefits far exceed the direct losses. Any honourable member who has studied the system of finance enunciated by Major Douglas, knows that it is based on the principle of spending money, not so much with a view to obtaining direct benefits as to benefit the country indirectly. Millions of pounds have been spent by European countries in attracting tourists. On one occasion, a government was foolish enough to tax every tourist, but that experiment was not tried for more than a year. The tourist traffic from the TJnited States of America alone is worth an enormous sum to the people of Europe. I ask leave to continue my remarks. That the debate be now adjourned, and that the honourable member have leave to continue his speech when tlie debate is resumed. The House divided. (MR. SPEAKER-HON .
