Ms HALL (Shortland) (4.00 p.m.)-I rise to continue my remarks in the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004. In a country as vast as Australia, it is imperative that we have a reliable telecommunication network. That is why it is so important that Telstra be properly staffed and resourced. A vibrant, reliable telecommunication system is essential in a modern economy. Unfortunately, the Howard government has continually under-resourced Telstra and slashed jobs. It is this ideological commitment to selling Telstra that is driving the Howard government’s telecommunication agenda and policies. That is why eight workers in the Hunter and six workers on the Central Coast have lost their jobs and that is why we are constantly having our telephone services interrupted. Sometimes the interruptions are due to an acute episode, but quite often they occur just because the government has invested too little money in maintaining the infrastructure. Wires and cables are covered by plastic bags rather than being properly maintained and repaired. The government has invested in travelling allowance for workers from outside the area rather than in jobs for workers in the area. Workers are working longer and longer hours and without having any holidays. MAIN COMMITTEE",109,Adjournment

179,Upon Which Mr Mcmullan Moved By Way Of Amendment:,"I have in the past called on the member for Dobell to come and join with me to argue for more resources for Telstra and for more workers in our area. I was extremely disappointed when last week he rose in the House in the adjournment debate and, rather than supporting me in my call for more workers and better maintenance of the network, attacked me. He waged a personal attack on me. He totally missed the ball. If he had had his eye on the ball, he would have seen that I was not talking about him but that I was asking-begging-him to support me and begging him to ensure that we on the Central Coast have the proper telecommunication service that we deserve. Unfortunately, he failed the test. He failed to come out and call for that support for the Central Coast that I asked for. Is the member for Flinders seeking to ask a question? speech the member for Dobell thanked the dedicated Telstra workers in Shortland and Dobell. For the information of the member for Dobell, the 30 workers who did the repairs came from as far away as Mudgee and Dubbo. Unfortunately, Central Coast and Hunter jobs have gone, and as a consequence our services are being affected. There are numerous items in this budget that need to be addressed; not the least of those is education. The government proposed its blueprint for education in this budget. Its blueprint for university education will mean that people like me will be denied the privilege of attending university. The policy set out by the government in this budget really means that only those people with sufficient money will be able to access university education. I was very lucky; I was able to reap the benefits of the Whitlam reforms which enabled me to get a quality education. The subsequent changes enabled my children to attend university and get a university education. But, unfortunately, if the changes that have been mooted in this budget come into being, university education will really become the prerogative of those people who have money. There will be higher university fees, more university places will be reserved for the wealthy, some degrees will cost over $100,000 per degree, and there will be massive student debts which will have an impact on the ability of young people to buy houses and plan for their future. And, of course, there is the learning limit, which means that after five years there will be a cap on the number of HECS places. This is a real travesty, because it will mean that many young Australians will be deprived of a university education. I will turn my attention to TAFE. I was visited last week by TAFE teachers from the Hunter. I do not know whether members on the other side of the House are aware of just how disappointed TAFE teachers and the TAFE sector are with this government and this budget. They are disappointed with the amount of money that has been allocated to TAFE-or should I say the amount of money that has not been allocated to TAFE. It is ludicrous when the minister stands up in the House and says, ‘I support apprenticeships, and I support the ability of people to have the choice to go to TAFE,’ because he is not giving them a choice. People already have to wait a long time to access TAFE because there is a shortage of TAFE places. The government has not allocated any additional funds for TAFE. This means that our young people are going to be deprived of the opportunity to get an education. What does that mean? MAIN COMMITTEE",111,Appropriation Bill No 1 2003 2004

183,Ms Hall,"No, Madam Deputy Speaker. It is interesting that in the conclusion of hisThat means that Australia as a nation is being deprived of the opportunity to enter the world stage with a skilled, knowledge based work force. The secret to success these days is knowledge, and if we have a country where our young people are being deprived of the right to access learning then we will suffer as a nation. It is not right that one group of people-those people with money-should be able to access education. The government must understand that it is the right of all Australians to have an equal opportunity to get an education; it is not the right of just a privileged few. In conclusion, I say that the 2003 Howard budget is a disaster for Australian families, a disaster for pensioners and a disaster for all ordinary Australians. It is a budget for the elite. It is a budget for the privileged few. It is a budget for the friends of the Howard governmentnot for all Australians. ment’s 2003 budget. In addressing that budget and in speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004, I want to proceed in three stages: firstly, to examine the underpinning philosophy, ideas and ideals which circumscribe the way in which the budget has been framed; secondly, to examine its direct implications for and impact on the people of my electorate of Flinders, which takes in the communities of Western Port, Port Phillip and the Mornington Peninsula; and, thirdly, to examine some of the national initiatives which have taken place as a result of the budget. Firstly, in turning to the question of philosophy, 18 months ago when I spoke in my maiden speech, I drew a distinction between two core values of Australian society-firstly, that of freedom and, secondly, that of equality. I noted that both major parties were committed to and paid respect to each of those values-both freedom and equality. But, interestingly, the core distinction between the two parties is that the Liberal tradition was to focus on freedom as a means of achieving equality-that it was an ordinal difference-whereas the Labor tradition, the social democrat tradition, was to focus first and foremost on equality as a means of achieving freedom. When we strip away the differences between the parties, we actually recognise that there is a noble intent on both sides, but that there is a fundamental disagreement over the means of achieving it. When you look at the history of the last century, you see an extraordinary growth in the capacity of ordinary citizens in ordinary homes throughout the Western world to care for, to feed, to clothe, and to take care of the basic provisions themselves. The basis for that has been the development of entrepreneurial society, where people have been able to engage either as owners of their own enterprises or in small enterprises or in a series of relations which break down the traditional patterns of serfdom that have been involved in all societies for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. So there is a core philosophical difference-and that difference is to a large extent replicated in this budget. There is a second difference, and that is about the question of will, because one of the key things we see is that societies progress and avoid what might be called moral hazard-the threat of negative long-term consequences if they are willing to take difficult long-term decisions. Those difficult, long-term decisions are enshrined in the budget. As an example of what occurs when a country fails to take those decisions, we see what we have in France now as a series of unresolved and almost unresolvable conflicts between different sections of society in relation to the collapse of the French pension system. The result MAIN COMMITTEE",112,Appropriation Bill No 1 2003 2004
184,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (4.08 P.m.),"I am delighted to rise in support of the federal governthere is a consequence of a government over a series of years which was unwilling to address the long-term consequences of an ageing society. That is a phenomenon experienced across the Western world. The same is occurring in Germany. Again, both of these societies have significant problems. How do you relate that to Australia? What does that mean in terms of the budget? It means that there are a series of measures which are aimed at addressing the generational challenges-not just one year, three years, even decade long challenges, but generational challenges. What we know is that in Australia we will be moving from approximately 12 per cent of the population in 2003 being over the age of 65 to approximately 20 per cent of the population in 2021 being over the age of 65. That creates a dramatic structural change in our society because two things occur. First, there is a change in the number of people who require care and, second, there is a decrease in the proportion of the population who are able to provide productive work. So the demands go up and the number of suppliers goes down. If you do not prepare for that as a society, you are involved in an act of intergenerational theft, where this generation today will be stealing from the next generation and that is truly an act of irresponsibility. So that is why there are a series of initiatives which have been proposed as part of this budget and other budgets. Firstly, the changes to the health system recognise that there will be this increasing burden on our society. So we have as a carry over from the last budget the fact that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is not being allowed to prepare for a generational challenge and that if you do not allow for a relative increase in contributions by individuals who are benefiting sometimes with up to 95 or 98 per cent of the cost of their medication, then you are simply imposing a burden which will ultimately, over 15, 20 and 25 years, crush the capacity of the system to provide for individuals. Secondly, the changes to the bulk-billing system are aimed at extending bulk-billing and also protecting those who currently do not have access to bulk-billing by ensuring that all they ever pay is the gap rather than suffer the cash flow crisis of having to pay $35 for a visit and then waiting six weeks to get the money back. Instead, someone will walk in, they will pay $10 and the game will be over and the issue solved and they will move on. This will have a significant impact on the capacity of individuals to deal with this situation. The system is also aimed at addressing long-term societal problems. Similarly, the changes relating to education, which are about expanding the number of people who have access to higher education and recognising that somebody who makes a windfall profit from their education at the expense of ordinary workers in society should be required to give back some contribution for the windfall they receive. It is in society’s interest to train people; that is absolutely the hallmark of a modern society. But where individuals benefit as a result of that training, surely it is not unreasonable that they make a contribution-but only when they begin to exceed average wages and only a proportion of those wages. This is, in fact, a philosophy embraced by the previous government which has simply been enshrined and enhanced in this situation. I want to turn briefly to my electorate of Flinders and to three specific benefits that the electorate has received as a result of the budget. Firstly, in terms of health care, perhaps the most important change is that the electorate of Flinders has now been included fully within the outer metropolitan region. This means that the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council is MAIN COMMITTEE now fully within the outer metropolitan zone for the extension of benefits to attract doctors to the area. There has been a shortage of doctors-there is no doubt about that. We are finding that this new system is assisting local areas in bringing doctors in. This new system, which now extends to Rosebud, Ryde, Dromana and Mount Martha, provides a benefit of $20,000 to every doctor who moves from the city to join an existing practice and $30,000 to every doctor who moves from the city to create a new practice. That is an outstanding development because it provides a real and genuine incentive. It has been embraced by the doctors and by the public on the Mornington Peninsula. The second area in the electorate of Flinders to benefit is the educational sector. Two specific benefits have been received recently. Firstly, from the education portfolio there has been a grant of $5,000 to the Hastings Literacy Festival to specifically train students who are weak in literacy. Hastings is a town which has done it tough in many ways. Secondly, there has been a grant of over $25,000 to Monash University to carry out the specific educational project of literacy training in three schools: Crib Point Primary, Hastings Primary and West Park Primary. In each of those schools there are children from disadvantaged backgrounds. This project is designed specifically to assist those schools, those parents and those students to address some of the challenges of the simple act of learning to read. It is a great step forward. The third area in the electorate of Flinders to benefit from funding is roads. I want to refer specifically to two projects. Firstly, $105,000 has been allocated for the upgrading and general maintenance of Jetty Road in Rosebud, including the sealing of shoulders. It is a principal access on and off the Mornington Peninsula Freeway-and I use the word ‘freeway’ rather than the word ‘tollway’-and, significantly, it provides for the protection and security of members of the Rosebud community. The second project involves Seven Mile Road, Bunyip River Road and the intersection between them at Koo Wee Rup North, which will be given a $67,000 upgrade to help realign the intersection, to construct a right turn lane and to install lighting. It is a corner I know, a corner which has considerable dangers attached to it. For the residents of Koo Wee Rup and for those passing through, it is an important upgrade. The third area I wish to address is some of the core elements of the budget over and above the general philosophy. In looking at the budget, it is important to analyse the economic outlook. At a time when the Western world has been suffering a significant economic crisiswhen there have been international security events, when Australia has had a major drought, when our trading partners have been through a crisis in Asia-what we find is that the Australian economy is still projected to grow at 3¼ per cent, that inflation will still be maintained at a level as low as approximately 2¼ per cent and that the unemployment rate will remain in the vicinity of six per cent, whilst interest rates are also likely to remain at a similar level. That is a combination which is unprecedented in over 30 years, and it comes about as a result of a series of initiatives which have been put in place over the last seven years and which this budget puts in place for forthcoming years. That is why there is a reduction in income tax. It is not an enormous reduction-and nor is it intended to be-but it enshrines the principle that, wherever possible, the government will seek to ensure that it reins in its expenditure and that it ensures that money is best used in the hands of individuals. So it provides an incentive for people to be involved in economic activity, to be involved in the process of generating income for a society, and that in turn provides the greatest growth and benefit. That is one of MAIN COMMITTEE the reasons why Australia is the only economy in the developed world to be pursuing the combination of cutting taxes, maintaining growth and cutting debt. In addition to that, the core specific changes include an increase in defence spending over five years of approximately $2.1 billion. The essence of that is $1.1 billion to assist in the development of core strategic support for ships, aircraft and land based military equipment. Beyond the defence spending, as I mentioned before, there is also an extraordinary investment in education-an additional $1½ billion over four years, growing to an extra $870 million per year thereafter to strengthen the higher education institutions. That is achieved through a serious process of reform-reform which is necessary, as I said at the outset, if we are to achieve the long-term processes of growth. I mentioned at the very beginning that there is a distinction between the two approachesboth accepted notions of freedom and equality-and there is an ordinal difference between the way in which this can be achieved. On the one hand, you have a social democratic view which says that we have to pursue equality in order to assist with freedom, but the examples of the last century show that, for the most part, that is the less effective route. On the other hand, you have a liberal democratic tradition which says that, in order to pursue a fairer and more even society, you also have to give people the chance to pursue their own lives, to avoid the problem of the poverty traps, to give them an incentive. Therefore, if you place freedom first wherever there is a conflict, you are more likely to achieve both outcomes. This budget takes those principles. It applies them in health and it applies them in education. I commend the budget and I commend the appropriation bill to the House. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004. There are a number of issues that I will raise in fairly short order. I wish to read one particular issue into the Hansard and I would also like to table some documents, so I will be seeking leave to do that later in my speech. This is a budget that technically delivers a surplus, and I believe it is the sixth time that has been achieved by this government. I was in the New South Wales parliament for 10 years and, to their credit as well, both the Labor Party and, most of the time, the Liberal coalition delivered surplus budgets. I think people do have to recognise that in a technical sense a surplus budget sends good signals to the market. It is a positive thing in terms of the money market and the way the providers of credit et cetera look at a particular government. We can all argue about how the money is being spent and how surpluses are achieved-obviously, government of different persuasions will use various pathways to achieving surpluses. The two major issues that the budget addresses that will be of some political note are the Medicare arrangements and the measures relating to higher education. I do not intend to speak at length about those two particular issues today. I will be raising them again during the consideration in detail stage of the appropriation bills. There will also be specific pieces of legislation debated in the House that will deal with both those issues. Suffice to say at this stage that there are concerns in my electorate about both those issues. As with most things, there are good bits and bad bits. I am determining the balance in the way my electorate of New England is going to look at those issues. In relation to the higher education changes, there are some concerns being expressed. I have the University of New England within my electorate. I am an ex-student of that particular university, and I am on the governing council. This bill would seem to eradicate me from MAIN COMMITTEE",113,Appropriation Bill No 1 2003 2004
185,Mr Windsor (New England) (4.24 P.m.),"I appreciate the opportunity to speak on thethat particular process. I am not certain that was why that measure was included, but I would suggest it is probably one of the throwaway items the government is prepared to lose when it gets down to the argy-bargy of Senate debate. There are issues of governance, implications with the various state governments in accepting that and the state legislation which has some import in relation to the governance of universities. Student unionism is another issue that concerns have been expressed about, particularly by students but also by others-including a number of business people in the Armidale community who, strangely in some ways, have expressed some concerns about the student unionism issues and how it could relate to the spending capacity within the community. The capacity of the flexibility arrangements for a 30 per cent increase in student fees will have an impact, particularly on the ability of regional communities to pay-not only around the University of New England but around other regional universities and communities-and compete for students. There are also concerns that this could have an impact on student loads and on the academic quality of some of their teaching professionals. Those issues are very much at the forefront of a number of people’s minds at this particular time. Obviously, there are some positive vibes concerning the regional university loading increase-and the University of New England is included in that-but, as I said, there is a lot more work to be done on that particular issue. I will be raising that issue further down the track. I mentioned earlier the proposed changes to Medicare. There are very serious issues relating to people’s access to doctors who bulk-bill and medical indemnity. I congratulate the government for its recent initiatives on medical indemnity. I am waiting for the views of a number of doctors within my electorate on that particular issue, but on the surface it looks to be positive. I also congratulate the government in relation to the ethanol issue, which is raised in the budget papers. There is an ethanol plant that is planned-which is most likely to be located in Gunnedah, in the member for Gwydir’s electorate-which encompasses quite a large part of the grain growing area of the New England region. It would have a very significant influence on the grain-growing industries of our area. The principal of the ethanol plant-and I think we are looking at $90 million investment now-happens to live within my electorate, so we are very keen to see that progress. I know there has been a lot of debate on that issue, but I would urge members to pay some attention to the way in which ethanol can have an impact not only on some of the environmental issues that a lot of people are concerned about but also on our import-export relations concerning oil products. It can also have a massive impact on agricultural production. The concept they are talking about for the plant in the Gunnedah area has recently been increased in size and could consume some 300,000 tonnes of grain-sorghum, for instance. That probably would not mean a lot to many people in this room, but it would have an incredible impact on that grain-growing area. I would encourage the government to keep going with that issue and to do what they can to help these people. I know there are people in Dalby who are looking at a similar venture. There are some other issues raised in the budget papers that I would like to mention. Road funding is obviously always very important, particularly in country areas. I notice $100 million has been returned this year to the Roads to Recovery program. The funding was down to $300 million last year and it is back up to $400 million this year. It is one of the great proMAIN COMMITTEE grams in relation to local road funding that we have seen. I know that the bureaucracy are hard at work to undermine the concept of Roads to Recovery through the AusLink plans, and I would urge members of the government not to abandon the straight line link of money between federal and local government. It is a very simple plan and it is working very effectively. Roads that would never have been looked at in the past if that program had not been put in place are now being looked at. I would urge members not to allow bureaucrats or various other ministers who do not like to see direct line funding tamper with this program, because it has been very effective. The Roads to Recovery program was allocated $1.6 billion over four years-that is, $400 million a year. That sounds like a lot of money but, if you look at the way it comes through the system, you will see that the charge per litre at the bowser is only about 1½c of the fuel excise charge, which is 38c a litre. That comes to some $13.6 billion per annum, and we are talking about $400 million being returned by way of the direct link between federal and local government. I would encourage the federal government to maintain that project. There are some specific items of expenditure in the budget papers that I am pleased to see. There is about $20 million being expended on the Devil’s Pinch and Bolivia Hill areas on the New England Highway. The Bolivia Hill area just south of Tenterfield was the scene of a bad truck accident recently; two drivers were killed. It is good to see some money being spent in that area. I would like to take advantage of this opportunity today to speak about the area of regional development. There is a lot of talk within the budget papers about regional development, regional programs, regional solutions, how the five current programs are being married into one and those sorts of things. In the community of Guyra, within my electorate, we have what is called a rabbitry, and it is an industry that is being developed by Angora City (Rabbits) Pty Ltd. The director is Mr Warwick Grave, who has put about 15 years of work into developing the concept of bringing the best rabbits in the world-in terms of their fur-into Australia. He has had enormous difficulty with AQIS, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, over many years. Currently there is a report before the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Warren Truss, in relation to this problem, with specific allegations by Mr Grave-and, having seen the documentation, I tend to believe what he is saying-that he is being treated quite differently from the way an importation of commercial rabbits that came out of America in the late nineties was treated. It was only recently-I think it was earlier this year-that around 600 rabbits were released in Guyra. They were shedded, caged rabbits which came out of quarantine. There has been an enormous expenditure to get this industry going. The employment opportunities for a small community like Guyra are huge. The opportunities it has as an industry worldwide are enormous. Mr Grave has put a massive amount of work into this industry over the years, and he has suffered the loss of a close partner who was very involved with this particular issue. I would like to read into the Hansard a letter written on 9 May 2003 that was sent to the Hon. Warren Truss. It reads: Dear Minister: Following is a brief synopsis of why I believe this importation from the US, arriving Sydney on 4 November 1998 was not legal. MAIN COMMITTEE This relates to the importation from the United States and the way that importation was treated compared with the quite unfair treatment, in my view, of Mr Grave and his particular venture. His letter continues: The six points are: 1. Conditions for Importation of Commercial Rabbits. The section on Eligibility (Item 2.1) clearly states: “Importation RESTRICTED to rabbits born in and continuously kept in approved premises”-BREACHED. 2. Import Permit #1998/07065 (valid 12 August 1998 to 12th February 1999-this is breached in many Sections-and in particular Item 2.1. If there had been any doubts by AQIS about the import, and there most certainly was, AQIS should have maintained quarantine. 3. CustomsA pet rabbit entry requires NO GST/NO Duty payable BUT a commercial consignment has Duty payable-Duty was not paid and I believe Duty was “due and payable”-it was a “commercial” shipment (more than two animals). 4. Environment Australia The document for “commercial” consignments should be signed by Customs and returned to the Canberra office-this was not done. I have the originals. The “pet” declaration was not correct. 5. NSW Department of Agriculture “License/Permit to Keep Rabbits” The last Permit (#1394 for Colo Area, NSW and dated 26 July 2000 and valid for twelve months) was written on 26 July 2000. As it was envisaged the law was to change-it was no longer essential to have a Permit from 28 September 2001. Where is the Permit, which must be issued before the Import Permit? I had a NSW Permit in 1997. 6. PAQF-The Approval of Post-Arrival Quarantine Facility at Wyong (NSW) AQIS states-“for such a short period (14 days) and such a small number of animals (i.e. nine rabbits) why wasn’t the NSW Quarantine Station at Eastern Creek used? This would have totally removed any queries about the integrity of the Wyong PAQF, and the query on procedural manuals and protocols and compliance agreements. It should be the very basis of the “Precautionary Principle” applied with a blowtorch to my company after this 1998 debacle. I am available, at any point in time, to discuss any matter with you fully and frankly. Thank you for your time in reviewing this important matter. Yours sincerely, Warwick Grave Director That letter was addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I thank the minister and particularly Mr Chris Parker, an advisor, for the work they have done already. I also call on them to conduct a parliamentary inquiry into this matter. It has been a very expensive operation for Mr Grave to set up. He believes that, because of the various machinations that AQIS have taken on-the slowness, the lack of activity and the prevarication that has occurred-it has probably cost him in the vicinity of $1 million. He is looking to the government to inquire into that particular process not only for his own business but so that the procedures are better in the future and not as expensive to operate. I seek leave to table the letter that I have read from and some other documentation concerning this particular issue. Leave granted. constituent of the Leader of the House, Mr Tony Abbott, and I believe that he met with Mr MAIN COMMITTEE",116,Appropriation Bill No 1 2003 2004
186,Mr Windsor,"I would add that Mr Grave is not a constituent of mine. He is actually aAbbott last Friday. I thank the Leader of the House for his consideration in tabling the documents. This is a serious issue that does need to be looked at. Another issue that I will touch on briefly is Roads of National Importance. There is currently a debate on this going on in another place. I was a little bit disappointed that the RONI funding, as they call it, was not actually increased. I think there is something like $200 million in this year’s budget, but I would ask the government and the other members adjoining my electorate-and I think there are three of them at a federal level-to look at the classification of the Mount Lindsay Road-Main Road 622 from Legume to Woodenbong. It is a distance of 45 kilometres. It will connect Warwick in Queensland, through to Kyogle. Neither of those places is in my electorate but they are very important to somebody else’s electorate. The upgrade would make it much safer for heavy vehicle transporters that use the road as well as domestic travellers. We believe that this particular road does have the appropriate RONI principles involved and I would encourage the minister to look very closely at including that in the Roads of National Importance criteria this year. Another issue which I will raise is Telstra. I was very disappointed to see Senator Minchin in his media release predicating the program of the government-not this budget solely but the budget strategy-where Telstra made a contribution of more than half to the budget surplus and where most of the tax cut that was given back to people came out of bracket creep. I am disappointed to see that Telstra is still factored into the government’s long-term plans. It is obvious to anybody who talks to country constituents that they would prefer Telstra to remain within the hands of the people. It is very obvious, given the principles of competition policy and economic rationalism for that matter, that those who are remote, who have distance to contend and who are small-that is, country communities-will be disadvantaged by any full privatisation of Telstra. I will be opposing that in the parliament and working with people in the Senate to oppose it, irrespective of whether that is deemed to be some sort of trigger for a double dissolution. It should not be sold. Another issue is water property rights. There are a number of issues raised in the budget papers and I will be raising this issue in the consideration in detail stage. The government have got to make up their mind about whether they are serious about this. In 1995 they signed the COAG arrangements and various competition policy rules were put in place. We have gone through a whole range of intergovernmental agreements and bilateral agreements and national action plans on water quality and salinity agreements, Natural Heritage Trust, catchment blue prints, and still there is no recognition of property rights. One of the underlying factors of the COAG arrangements back in 1995, which predicated the coming together of the states and the agreement, was that the definition of property rights was supposed to be put in place. Another issue is the gold card, and I am very disappointed that it is not included. I know the Clerk report is still being considered and I would urge the minister to look at those people who were available to fight in the Second World War but were not in the qualifying services area. They need help now. They are in their eighties and I think the government should recognise people by giving them the use of the gold card. I will raise other matters in the consideration in detail stage. (Time expired) Ms PANOPOULOS (Indi) (4.44 p.m.)-I rise to support the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004 and in doing so congratulate the Treasurer for delivering a strong and positive MAIN COMMITTEE budget framed in a somewhat difficult international and domestic climate. The Treasurer’s eighth budget once again illustrates this government’s genuine commitment to solid fiscal management through providing a surplus of $2.2 billion whilst at the same time delivering personal income tax cuts to Australian workers. The broad economic and social canvass remains strong and in some cases has been strengthened through measures in this budget. There is increased expenditure to make Medicare stronger and fairer, increased funding to strengthen our tertiary education system and the prioritisation of defence and national security to combat the twin threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism. At a time when comparable countries around the world are experiencing significant fiscal downturns, Australia’s economy continues to grow. This is a direct result of the proud economic record of the Howard government and its commitment to maintaining economic security for Australia. Other developed countries throughout the world are in deep deficit, including the United States, Britain and much of Europe. Delivering a significant surplus within the current context means that Australia is leading the way on the world economic stage. The economy is predicted to grow at 3.5 per cent, inflation remains in check and under three per cent and, importantly, employment growth remains strong. Australia has taken all the necessary steps to ensure our community is safe. The budget papers support this notion. Not only has the government invested to make our community safe; it is has also ensured that the economic future of our country is safe. We all remember very clearly the economic mismanagement during the Labor Party’s years in office at the federal level. We need not be reminded of the persistent unholy trinity of high interest rates, high unemployment and budget deficits that occurred throughout these years. But we have moved on, thankfully. Interest rates are at record low levels and we long for the day when unemployment can fall to figures closer to five per cent-perhaps achievable when the Labor Party passes the government’s unfair dismissal legislation. Budget deficits are not the accepted norm for this government, with the Treasurer having delivered the government’s sixth surplus budget. We have paid for our involvement in military action in Iraq, we have supported our farmers through a drought at a time when the farm sector has been particularly hard hit and we have announced significant new expenditure to strengthen Medicare and our tertiary education system. At the same time, the government has been able to offer nine million Australians income tax cuts. This decision to offer income tax cuts has not been met with universal praise, least of all from members of the opposition. It is a somewhat curious state of affairs when the Australian Labor Party ridicule the government’s intention of increasing the low-income tax offset for low-income earners and pour scorn on the government’s intentions to increase the income tax thresholds that currently apply to taxpayers. Members opposite seem unable to remember their own party’s jaunt with taxation relief: it came in the guise of a rollback and, like so many of the short-sighted economic policies in the party’s history, it was doomed to failure. Naturally, many people would prefer the recently announced tax cuts to be larger. However, I find the breathtaking hypocrisy displayed by so many opposition members, the member for MAIN COMMITTEE Lilley for one, a little hard to take. Back in March 2001, which was not that long ago, the member for Lilley defended a $4 tax cut. The member stated: If you are going to miss out on $4, that means a hell of a lot if you have a tight budget. He added what $4 a fortnight or $4 a week really means to someone’s living standards and criticised the Howard government, saying: … they simply do not understand what a dollar a week, $2 a week or $4 a week means to someone who is battling.’ Members opposite were quick to describe the recent tax cuts offered in this year’s budget as miserly. However, these members have incredibly short memories. When the Labor Party proposed their now famous rollback policy, which amounted to a $1 tax cut for Australians, the then leader, the member for Brand, said: There is no doubt in my mind that this will be appreciated … Yet when the Howard government offers tax cuts to nine million Australians, in some cases of up to $573 a year and a special saving for low-income earners, the Labor Party turns around and describes this measure as miserly. I am pleased to say to the member for Lilley and other opposition MPs that the Howard government does understand what tax relief means to Australian battlers. On1 July 2000, the Howard government gave Australian workers the biggest tax cut Australia has ever seen. On1 July 2003, the Howard government again gave Australian workers a tax cut. Opposition members have consistently and stridently criticised the government’s tax relief measures in this budget. But it is $573 for someone earning $65,000; for low-income earners, the tax cuts translate to a $329 saving. No-one can honestly say that these are insignificant tax cuts. A practical conclusion we might draw from this is that personal income tax cuts of between $4 and $11 a week are not acceptable when the Howard government offers them. But when the Labor Party offers $1 a week, as it did under rollback, the Australian public and political commentators are expected to commend this generosity. For those who still feel a little underwhelmed by the government’s tax cuts contained in the recent budget, I can only state this: There are many things that you would like to do, but there are not many that you can afford to do in the current circumstances ... These are not my words; they are borrowed from the member for Brand from October 2001. The fact is that, after paying for our significant military contribution in Iraq, after supporting our farmers-including the farmers in my electorate in the north-east of Victoria-through the worse drought in 100 years, and after injecting significant funds into our health and education systems, the Howard government can still balance the books, offer a surplus and return something to the taxpayer. One of the important industries in my electorate that has been supported throughout this government’s term has been tourism. The importance of tourism to local communities has been strengthened with this budget. Of particular importance to my electorate was the $56.2 million over four years set aside to establish the National Heritage List, including new measures for cultural heritage protection. The program Distinctly Australian will offer new opportunities to commemorate sites that are significant to our national identity. Prominent sites such MAIN COMMITTEE as the Ned Kelly siege site in my electorate will have the opportunity to be further commemorated through the introduction and implementation of this new program. The Howard government’s many and varied funding initiatives for rural and regional Australia have proven to be a great success for the people of my electorate. Many local community groups, local shires and enterprising businesses have been fortunate enough to receive funding through such programs as Regional Solutions, the Regional Assistance Program, rural transaction centres and the Dairy Regional Assistance Program. In this year’s budget, there is the formation of the Regional Partnerships Program which sees a number of these funding programs combined into a single master program. Funding of $277 million over four years will be available, and this includes an additional $62 million of funding. The formation of the Regional Partnerships Program will benefit those Indi businesses, community groups and local governments who until now have frequently applied for funding assistance through a number of other programs. Through the merging of these programs, there will now be a single application form which will make things easier and reduce the paperwork and the time that many organisations spend in applying for government funding. That is very warmly welcomed. The Regional Tourism Program administered by AusIndustry had its funding boosted in last year’s budget, and it has been of great benefit to the north-east. Several programs have been announced that have been of specific benefit to my electorate. The Commonwealth government boosted the RTP program in the 2002 budget with a commitment of a further $8 million over four years. The effect of the bushfires on the local tourism industry in my electorate has been extremely severe. We were very pleased that the government was very lateral in its application to solving problems. I was very pleased to announce that almost $1 million of additional special funds that had been put aside have been allocated in cash grants to small businesses, including tourist businesses, within my electorate. The Regional Assistance Program is another successful initiative in generating employment in regional, remote and metropolitan Australia by encouraging local community action to boost business growth and create sustainable jobs. It provides the seed funding for innovative quality projects of value to the community, and funding is available to fund projects nationally. Just last week, I announced federal government funding assistance for a particular local project that is very important to my electorate-that is, the North East Valley’s Food and Wine Recovery project-through a successful application to the Regional Assistance Program. The funding to this project will assist our region to overcome a significant drop in visitor numbers following the recent bushfires by encouraging people to visit our area. I commend my local entrepreneurs and those who are focused on promoting tourism, particularly after the recent devastating fires. That project will receive $71,500 in federal government assistance to develop and implement a strategy for a vibrant, well-signed food and wine experience for the north-east. ber for Franklin seeking to ask a question?

189,Mr Quick,"Yes.ber for Franklin? promote the local tourism industry with continuing funding provided in this year’s budget. But perhaps the greatest news in the budget for the electorate of Indi is the commitment of funding towards the construction of the Albury-Wodonga internal freeway. In this year’s budget, there is a specific allocation of $10 million for planning of the Victorian section of the national highway through Albury-Wodonga and a further $15 million for the New South Wales section. Total federal funding for the road is set at $346 million. This commitment represents a great relief for the border community. Over 33 years of myth making has been put to rest. Finalisation of the planning aspects of the road are still under way. However, this commitment that the border community has sought for several decades is now a reality. After over 33 years of promises, the internal freeway for Albury-Wodonga will finally become a reality. It was most unfortunate that the people of the border region had to wait over 33 years for finalisation of the highway’s route and funding. But the decision to fund the internal road and to provide a second river crossing for Albury-Wodonga will, undoubtedly, provide the greatest traffic relief that the region has seen and will service the ever growing needs of one of the fastest growing inland cities of Australia. The decision will also ensure that the ability of the region to maximise on its unique location on the Hume Highway, on its unique competitive nature and on its ability to provide additional jobs will not be stifled by inadequate infrastructure. Another important aspect of the construction of this particular road is the recognition by the RACV and the NRMA that it will reduce accidents by 80 per cent. The Commonwealth’s substantial monetary investment in this particular road development will help create employment for the region and help continue to attract investment in the region. Not only will it facilitate industry in the area; it will also assist the tourism industry. I regret the sustained campaign of misinformation that has been forthcoming from the Labor Party in relation to the significant and welcome reforms to the tertiary sector. Of particular benefit is the injection of a further $1.5 billion over the next four years into higher education. The freeing up of the sector represents a far greater flexibility in allowing universities to set fees. Far from discriminating against the smart poor, the Labor Party should listen to the comments of the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne, who recently stated that his university is considering lowering fees for poor students. Professor Alan Gilbert said the government’s reforms: … would be a means of a university like ours discharging its obligations to make sure that no student is kept from studying at the University of Melbourne by reasonable inability to pay. I particularly welcome the additional funding of $122.6 million over four years for regional tertiary institutions and campuses. This recognises the unique contribution made by regional higher education institutions and campuses not only to their local communities and students in rural and regional areas but also to families living outside metropolitan areas who would like to see their young people stay in their towns and their regions. The campuses of La Trobe University in Wodonga, Beechworth and Mount Buller will particularly benefit from this injection of funds. Unlike the member for New England, I have no reservations about the government’s plans to abolish compulsory membership of student unions.

190,The Deputy Speaker,Will the member for Indi allow the question from the mem,124,Appropriation Bill No 1 2003 2004
191,Ms Panopoulos,"No, Madam Deputy Speaker. The federal government continues tofits it claims to offer, I have faith in the ability and intelligence of university students to make that decision and voluntarily join their student union should they see fit. But it is up to them to make that decision and no-one else. I would like to say a few words on the injection of funding into Medicare. The measures announced in the budget related to the strengthening of Medicare through a $917 million injection of funding. In no way does this compromise the universality of the Medicare system, as has been claimed by some members opposite. There has been much discussion regarding the federal government’s proposed changes to Medicare, including misinformation from the other side. It is essential that people look beyond the sloganeering and negativity on the other side and see what is being offered. Under the package, doctors will be free to bulk-bill whomever they choose. However, for the first time, the government will strengthen the availability of bulk-billing for pensioners and concession card holders, particularly those of us in rural and regional areas. The package proposes a range of initiatives, including higher incentives for GPs to bulk-bill concession card holders, funding for extra nurses in work force shortage areas and a long-term commitment to improving the number of doctors in rural and remote areas. The bulk-billing initiatives for doctors to treat concession card holders could be worth up to $22,000 to GPs practising in rural and remote areas. For the first time, these incentives provide for greater equity across Australia, something that the Labor Party’s plan for Medicare does not even touch on. The critics of this package have spoken of the death of bulk-billing and the creation of a two-tiered health system. Not only is such talk irresponsible; it is also unfounded. There is nothing in this package that will lead to the doomsayers’ predictions. They think that the more often they repeat it, the greater their chance of convincing the unconvinced. Those who challenge the government’s package and promulgate these myths need to spell out a clear alternative. The Labor Party’s proposed package of pitiful reforms will do nothing to increase the level of bulk-billing, nor will it increase the number of GPs practising in rural and regional areas. The Howard government retains the universality of Medicare, as Australians will still have access to the Medicare rebate. In 1983, Senator Grimes, the Labor senator representing the Minister for Health in the Senate, stated: Under Medicare everyone will have a Medicare card and number and will qualify for the Medicare rebate. Twenty years later, these fundamental aspects of Medicare remain constant and, through this government’s package, have been strengthened. I must give comment to the Victorian state budget handed down by Treasurer John Brumby last month. This cruel state budget foisted on Victorians included massive increases in taxes and charges, including higher car registration fees, higher stamp duty, more police fines, higher land taxes and ‘new’ freeway tolls, so to speak. The Bracks government also ditched a payroll tax incentive for businesses that employ young people. The Bracks Labor government inherited a $1.8 billion surplus yet, in true Victorian Labor style, they have dwindled this away to a paltry $159 million surplus in this year’s budget, whilst at the same time increasing the tax burden on Victorians by more than $1,900 per household since 1998-99. Whilst the Commonwealth government proposes to cut taxes, the Bracks government wishes to increase them. MAIN COMMITTEE I commend and congratulate the federal Treasurer on this year’s budget. It is responsible, and it is focused on providing essential services and making them accessible to those who need them particularly. It is good news for Australia. It is good news for the north-east of Victoria. Many constituents have contacted my office in relation to a number of measures contained in this budget, and it has been very warmly greeted. It is no wonder that members on the other side do not like to hear the good news. They do not like to hear that this Prime Minister has an approval rating of 65 per cent and that this Government is not only delivering economic security for this country but providing a future for all young Australians. 2003-2004. We have had seven years of the Howard government and now we have another very uninspiring group of appropriation bills. The honourable member for Indi runs out of the chamber; she obviously has to go and do some third-rate press conference where she can get all pumped up again. I think it is rather a shame that the honourable member for Indi would not allow my friend the member for Franklin to intervene in the debate here in the Main Committee. I understand from all the government members who have been spruiking this new proposal that that is what happened. My dear friend the honourable member for Franklin wanted to obtain from the honourable member for Indi her view on what had happened with the wine equalisation tax, because she did not mention it at all in her speech. No doubt her predecessor, Mr Lieberman, the member for Indi prior to her, would have taken a much stronger line with the government, because he was a man who was very, very interested in the wine industry-as was his predecessor from the National Party. The honourable member for Indi might take note of what her predecessors said and do her best to try and promote the small wineries in her electorate. I have been a member of this place for over 20 years and in this time. I have participated in many debates on appropriation bills. I have to say that the budgets of this current government have been among the most ordinary and pedestrian that I have ever experienced. Even when at first glance it appears that there might be something interesting in a budget, closer examination shows that there is not much there. In fact, there was so little in this budget that the member for Indi had to start talking about the Victorian budget. She could not think up enough things to say about the budget that her own Treasurer bought down recently. On budget night it looked as if the Treasurer had succeeded in surprising everyone with a tax cut but, when the excitement settled down, what did we see? A tiny tax cut for individual taxpayers-barely enough for a milkshake and a sandwich, to borrow from a certain government minister’s comments about the amount of money. I noted that even when the minister was making the comments in another context-that is, she was interested in a cut in welfare payments rather than a tax cut-she was talking about a similar amount of money; the grand sum of $4 or $5. But Senator Vanstone was wrong about it being barely enough for a milkshake and a sandwich; it is barely enough for a sandwich nowadays. Obviously Senator Vanstone and those government ministers who are on the gravy train do not have to buy their own sandwiches nowadays. If you went down to the parliamentary cafeteria here, I doubt you could get a sandwich and a milkshake for $4-so you can forget about having anything left over to buy a milkshake with which to wash down the sandwich. What the government gives so generously in the form of a tax cut it is happy to describe as quite insignificant-as Senator Vanstone has done-when it chooses to take it away from certain groups. How cynical is this MAIN COMMITTEE",124,Appropriation Bill No 1 2003 2004
192,Mr Leo Mcleay (Watson) (5.04 P.m.),"I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1)government and how outrageous it is that it behaves in these ways. It is insulting to the people of Australia, particularly to those less well-off people in electorates like mine. Since the budget was announced-the dust has settled a little and everyone has had a chance to look more carefully at what was in the Treasurer’s speech and the accompanying documentation-the initial excitement about the $4 or $5 has subsided. The proposed changes to Medicare and higher education are proving to be much more important to people than a measly, insignificant tax cut. Even the tax cut was not fair: ordinary income earners got $4 or $5 but those on over $75,000 got nearly three times that much. It just goes to show where the government’s priorities are. Polls have shown recently that the majority of the people surveyed would prefer increased spending on services-that is, better health and education services-to small tax cuts for individual taxpayers. Do not get me wrong; a small tax cut is better than no tax cut. If you are on $300 or $400 a week then a small tax cut is better than none and is certainly better than an increase in taxes, which we are seeing from this government in other areas. But if we had a choice between a small tax cut on the one hand and better health and education services on the other it is pretty clear that most voters would prefer better services. It is encouraging that people have not allowed themselves to be conned by the government in this regard. The tax cut issue has not stopped people seeing the other parts of the budget for what they are. While the government has striven to put forward all its proposals in a positive way, we are now seeing that many of them are not quite what they appeared to be at first. In fact, it is a feature of this budget-aided by the mysteries of accrual accounting in many instances-that what we thought we were getting, and what the ministers responsible might have liked us to think that we were getting, is not necessarily what the government is planning to deliver. One of the things that has struck me about individual members of this government and their attitude to their fellow Australians is their hypocrisy. Many members of the governmentand, indeed, many people on my side of the House, including my friend sitting next to me, the member for Franklin, had the benefit of fee-free tertiary education and a period of a much freer health care service in the 1970s. But the government now have the cheek to not only impose extra financial costs on those who are currently struggling to obtain an education and/or maintain their health but also claim that they are improving the system and actually doing the right thing by the people of Australia. They do not even have the good grace to acknowledge the financial burden the government’s policies impose on people. The government seem to think it is an appropriate thing to do. They are shameless, Mr Deputy Speaker ScottandI must say that you are one of the shameless people with them. Mr Baird interjectinggovernment is shameless. flected upon the chair.

196,Mr Baird,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member for Watson has rehim to withdraw that reflection upon the chair. what I said. I said the government are shameless. If you want to disavow yourself as being a member of the government, that is fine. It would be easier if the government accepted the honesty and admitted that their policies were burdensome for people but were necessary for the economy and for other demonstrated and justifiable reasons. But they do not present them in this way at all. They present them as if they are a privilege for Australians to have to pay ever increasing amounts for their education and that of their children and for their health and that of their families. We on this side know that what will happen is that fewer people will have access to higher education and adequate health care as a result of this budget. In my view, access to education and health care is essential to the future of Australia. There is not much point in anything else if you are uneducated and in poor health. It does not matter much what the balance of payments is or what exports look like for Australia if your individual quality of life is poor and you have no hope of improving it. In fact, there is not much hope for Australia in any sphere if the population is undereducated and in poor health. The only way Australia will progress as a country is if we are a well-educated knowledge nation and have a healthy population to underlie all our other endeavours. I believe the government has taken a very short-term view and that that is reflected in this budget. It is not a budget that is forward looking; it is a miserable budget. While the budget has all the features of a short-term view, it will take some time for the full detrimental effects to be felt. By then Australia will be in dire straits and it will cost future governments a great deal of money to bring Australia back to the sort of society we should be able to enjoy-a society where education and good health, and equality of access to those essentials, are valued and not made more difficult to attain. It is the poorest people who are going to find it more difficult to have access to education and health because of the increased costs that are going to be imposed by this budget. Those who are rich and financially advantaged will not have a problem-indeed, they will even get a bigger tax cut-because they will always have the money to pay for these things. The poor and the less well off, the financially disadvantaged, will find it increasingly difficult to obtain a good education and decent health care. The odd scholarship offered here and there is not going to make all that much difference to the majority of those who are seeking higher education. When you look at health care, you see that the revised bulk-billing arrangements are not going to help most people and will have the effect of raising even higher the cost of health care for those who are not bulk-billed. Let us be clear about this. The government has always wanted to destroy Medicare and with this budget it is going a long way towards succeeding. Each time the government makes changes to Medicare, it dilutes the service. The great dream of universal health care-as the member for Indi quoted Senator Grimes as saying when we introduced Medicare-that is, everyone’s right regardless of ability to pay, has just about disappeared. Instead we are just increasingly complicating the system where once we had a relatively simple system, which the consumers-that is, all of us-definitely preferred.

198,Mr Leo Mcleay,"Indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker. You know and the Hansard reflectsseems to be happy: doctors, patients and private insurers all have some complaint about the system. plicity by making changes that have effectively destroyed the essence of Medicare as it was originally envisaged when introduced by our Labor government in the 1970s. Its features have been chipped away and we are now left with a messy, complicated system of health care that no-one is happy with. The members opposite say that they are happy, but they are probably happy because they want to destroy Medicare. They are probably really happy because that is what they are achieving. The member for Cook ought to be willing to go and say that to his constituents. One of the most noticeable features of this budget was the things that it did not include. Despite promising in previous years to look at simplifying superannuation, the government have not done much about it. Every now and then, the government fiddle around with aspects of superannuation but, far from simplifying it, their fiddling about has the opposite effect and makes it more complicated. What people want from superannuation is pretty simple: they are happy to invest in it but what they want in return is financial security in their retirement years. They do not want to be confused by the myriad competing schemes all vying for their investment. They do not want to be penalised for investing in superannuation by losing other benefits that those who have not invested in superannuation enjoy. They do not want to have to become financial experts in superannuation themselves in order to understand what it all means. Superannuants are mostly, by definition, among the oldest people in our community. They have considerable life experience but they are not financial experts. It has got to the stage where you need to be a financial expert these days to understand superannuation and be confident that you are not disadvantaging yourself by the decisions you are required to make. I am sure everyone would welcome simplification of superannuation. It is enlightening to look back at some of the statements the Treasurer has made about superannuation in the past. He has previously acknowledged its complicated nature. For example, in May 2000 the Treasurer said: I think it needs to be simplified. I think it’s too complicated. We’ve got too many rules, too many conflicting rules, too many different taxation treatments. I think it’s beyond the ken of most people to understand it. I can only agree with him, but it is a great pity that he has done nothing about it. Despite his own claims to the contrary, the government are the highest taxing government Australia has ever had. Families are taking on more responsibility for funding what used to be core public services such as health and education. But what are their taxes being spent on-handouts to farmers? The government do not even give handouts to farmers anymore, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, and I am sure you are pretty unhappy about that-unless of course you live in the minister for agriculture’s milk zone. You get a pretty good handout there, but it costs consumers 11c a litre on their milk. So you rob one to pay the other. It is a little bit obvious that the government just want to be the highest taxing government Australia has seen, and you do not get much back from them. There must be something wrong with a system where more is being extracted in taxes but less is being expended on services that once used to be universal.

200,Mr Leo Mcleay,"Instead of keeping it simple, the government have eroded the simOne other program I would like to mention this evening is the baby bonus. It is a good example of how the government offers everything and complicates it so you do not get anything. When the government introduced this last year, it was hyped as something that was terrific, and everyone who had a child was going to do well out of it. But it has not been the wonderful program that the government promised. Like superannuation, it is complicated and not all that helpful. That is hardly surprising: it is linked with tax, and any tax measures-even if described as tax relief-always seem to be too tricky by half. It has been a consistent feature of this government that it promises a wonderful program of assistance to particular groups and then the program, after it has been introduced, turns out to be not nearly as wonderful as it was portrayed. With this government, the devil is really in the detail. It is almost as if the government prides itself on appearing to be generous, tricking people into expecting a benefit and then not delivering because of the complicated way in which it sets up the details of the program. I am just wondering how long it will be before we hear the Minister for Finance and Administration telling us we are going to get $20 million over 20 years. Some years ago governments used to talk about providing money for a particular financial year. It used to be, for example, $3 million a year, then it became $8 million over three years, and then it became $16 million over 16 years. These days there are tricky accountancy and presentation issues in there. But, going back to the baby bonus, you would think a baby bonus would be pretty simple to administer. You have a baby and you get the bonus. That is what it sounds like, doesn’t it? My good friend from Queensland, the member for Oxley, nods his head and says, ‘Yes, it does sound like that.’ You think that if you have a baby, you can collect the bonus. Simple? Not under this government. You would think it would be simple enough for the farmers to even understand. They understand that you have a calf and you get a benefit-but not with this lot, because the program was linked to the tax system, and not everyone who applied for the bonus received it because the government used it to repay a tax or other debt. It is difficult to imagine a more complicated system. Perhaps the real idea behind the baby bonus was to create jobs in the taxation department, because the administrative workload must certainly be considerable. What could have been simple has been made complicated, and one suspects that those who could have made use of the bonus are those who probably have missed out. It has probably gone to those who do not need it, probably those who had an accountant. It has certainly not gone to many of those who are in the most need. Again, there was much fanfare about a wonderful program which, down the track, turned out to be not so wonderful at all. The defence budget is also a source of concern to me. To summarise, the government has paid for the Iraq war at the cost of Australia’s long-term defence capability. There is funding for the war but no provision for peacekeeping troops. I am profoundly glad that the war is over-or, should I say, the first phase is over-because I have never been so unhappy about Australia’s involvement in a war as I was about this particular engagement. Who is even aware now that Australia was involved, apart from the forces who were deployed there-and the Prime Minister and his colleagues, of course? The only glory we have for ourselves as a result of the whole sorry business is that we are seen as hangers-on to the USA and another target for terrorism, perhaps. We have made no new friends through our involvement, and we have probably drawn unwelcome attention to ourselves in some parts of the world. MAIN COMMITTEE But the Prime Minister decided that this was an engagement which was to have Australian involvement and off we went, and the Australian taxpayer had to bear the costs of his decision to involve Australia in a war in the Middle East. It is disgraceful that the gap between rich and poor in this country continues to widen but the Prime Minister can commit us to joining in someone else’s argument and make us pay for it as well. We are seeing now that the other part of the coalition of the willing are now asking us to pay for the bombs that we dropped for them. It is just unbelievable. I never actually thought anyone was going to apply user-pays to a war, but now that we have joined someone else’s war and used our planes to drop the bombs, after the war they have sent us a bill for millions and millions of dollars of ordnance. Talk about the world going spare! We heard all the reasons for the war and we are all wondering where the weapons of mass destruction are now. Where is Saddam Hussein? What is to be done for the people of Iraq? There remain many issues in this that need resolution. This is a budget which is disappointing. It is disappointing because of what it does to social programs. It is disappointing because the government has run down our defence forces and not refurbished them. It is disappointing because the government attempts to pretend that it is giving a tax cut when in fact it is saying, ‘We won’t even give you enough for a sandwich and a milkshake,’ to quote a senior minister in the government. This is a very, very disappointing budget and, just like those journalists who were embedded in the Gulf War program where they did not get to see much but were pretty much under control, what we are seeing embedded in this budget are aspects of the highest taxing government in Australia’s history. It is a government that taxes and taxes and taxes middleand lower-income earners, gives them a lousy $4 to $5 a week back and says, ‘You should be grateful.’ At the same time, it tells them that they are going to have to pay far more for health, far more for education and far more for those core things that governments should provide.

Mr Baird interjecting Mr Leo McLeay-Can’t answer the question, eh? once in his sad, orchestrated groupie session which had everyone calling out from the gallery. He has no idea what it is all about. I believe we should be commending the Treasurer for his responsible budget and for the wide acceptance it has received from the community. It is financially responsible. It assists Australian farmers in a time of drought. It continues our efforts against international terrorism. It also introduces new initiatives in health and education, as well as providing personal income tax cuts. It is not like the 1993 budget, which we all remember, when the then Prime Minister promised we would have tax cuts; they were l-a-w. This government actually delivers on tax cuts. As much as the opposition do not like us providing any type of tax cuts or concessions for the Australian population and the Australian community, we actually delivered. At the same time as doing that, there was a cash surplus of $2.2 billion, something the opposition did not understand as they racked up, in their reckless spending, a debt-which they left for this government-of some $84 billion. Fortunately, this government have repaid some $66 billion of that $84 billion in debt that they racked up. We are about providing surplus budgets. The surplus this year is $2.2 billion and the OECD projections show that most OECD countries are expected to record budget deficits in 2003 and 2004. We provide a different approach. That is one of the reasons why we are expecting strong growth in this country, growth of 3¼ per cent. If you look around the world you will find some of the stellar performers such as the UK, the USA and Japan have zero or very modest growth rates compared with Australia. Three and a quarter per cent in these uncertain economic times is a great achievement which has been made possible by doing the responsible thing of keeping down debt and not spending as though there is no tomorrow, as happened during the Labor years. The unemployment rate is expected to remain steady and inflation is expected to be within the target band, an amazing achievement. The government has reduced net debt by some $32 billion and is committed to maintaining low levels of net debt. The government has also, as I said before, repaid some $66 billion of the $84 billion in debt. In terms of the reaction by the media to the comments in Mr Crean’s speech, the Sydney Morning Herald editorial of 17 and 18 May was headed ‘Crean fluffs budget lines’. The editorial says: In trying to woo back the Labor disenchanted, the party must be careful not to spurn others for cheap political expediency. The Crean speech consciously eschewed business in the wishful thinking that wage-earners will be attracted by the old us-and-them divide. Of course, that is very right, because that is what Labor are about: the old rhetoric and the old class warfare-instead of saying, ‘Let’s all get together; let’s work out the way forward.’ That MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Appropriation Bill No 1 2003 2004

207,Mr Baird,"As I said, the Leader of the Opposition did not mention the word ‘economy’is not the way of the Labor Party and that is shown in the reflection of the Sydney Morning Herald in its editorial on Mr Crean’s speech. The personal tax cuts have certainly been very welcome in my electorate. There were $2.5 billion worth of tax cuts, and that of course follows the record tax cuts in July 2000-the largest tax cuts in Australia’s economic history. That is a great achievement by this government. It is a further extension, recognising factors such as bracket creep. The government has returned this amount of money to the Australian community. After having criticised us with the sandwich and milkshake approach, which was not enough, the Leader of the Opposition was given the opportunity to outline the tax cuts that he would introduce. We listened and we listened, in between the rent-a-crowd response up in the gallery, but we did not hear one word about any tax cuts that they were going to provide. So they talk the talk, but they do not know how to walk the walk. When they were in government they promised tax cuts and said that the cuts were l-a-w, but in fact we found it was all smoke and mirrors, as normal. In addition to the $12 billion the government provided in tax cuts before-which included personal tax cuts, corporate tax cuts and removing the GST from exports-in this budget we have an increase in the thresholds. Those on $35,000 a year will have a reduction of $208 per year, those earning $55,000 a year will have a reduction of $448 per year, and those earning $75,000 a year will have a reduction of $573 per year. There is also assistance for low-income earners. The member for Watson talked at length about the assistance being given to people in his electorate-that the low-income tax offset has been raised from $150 to $235 per year. This means that those eligible for the full income tax offset will not pay tax until their income exceeds $7,382 per year; it was $6,882. The phase-out rate lifts from $24,450 to $27,475again, that is significant assistance to low-income earners. I think it should be the concern of all members of this House to look after those who are less fortunate than others. Of course, there is a further benefit for senior Australians. In fact, some 18.5 per cent of my electorate of Cook are over 65 years of age, so I know that in the provisions of the budget there are some welcome changes. There will be no tax paid on annual incomes up to $20,500 for individuals, which is up from $20,000 previously, and up to $33,612 for couples-that also is a significant increase. The Medicare levy threshold will be increased to ensure that senior Australians do not pay the Medicare levy until they begin to incur an income tax liability. These are the benefits of the budget. In this budget there are $2.5 billion worth of tax cuts, in addition to the $12 billion worth of tax cuts that were provided in July 2000. They are the most generous tax cuts we have seen in the history of Australia. There is special assistance for low-income earners, and thresholds have been lifted for older Australians, for both individuals and couples, before they actually pay tax. I believe that is a very significant step forward. It is modest but, given the constraints of the war on terrorism, our participation in the war in Iraq, the problems farmers have been experiencing with the continued drought, and expenditure on education and health, I believe that modest tax cuts are welcomed by everybody. It is important to look at the key spending priorities of this government: $2.1 billion for the Australian Defence Force; and $411 million to identify and respond to security threats, in addition to the $1.4 billion that was allocated over five years following September 11-of course, the terrorism threat to Australia is an important aspect that all Australians are conMAIN COMMITTEE cerned about; the additional expenditure of $411 million in this budget is welcome-$1.5 billion for reform of higher education; $917 million over five years for the Medicare package; and $42 billion over the next several years for public hospitals. The health budget initiatives, which have been maligned by the members of the opposition, have also been misunderstood-and deliberately so, in terms of the claims of the spin masters opposite. I see in my own local paper that the state member for Miranda says that it is very unfortunate that the changes to Medicare will mean that more and more people will not be able to have the benefits of bulk-billing. Quite the reverse is true, because Medicare was established on the basis of three pillars-that there should be access to primary care providers such as GPs, public hospitals and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. In order to ensure that more people have access to doctors, $917 million is being spent in this financial year on the Medicare package. We currently spend over $8 billion a year. This will ensure that there is greater universality of Medicare and greater access to bulk-billing, with the aim that all Australians will remain eligible to be bulk-billed. In particular, incentives are provided for those who have concession cards. I think that is a question of fairness and equity in the community. Are we in favour of concession cardholders receiving these additional incentives which the government has provided? It is certainly a very big ask to provide concessions to everybody in the community. The problem with that is that there is no tomorrow in terms of the huge level of expenditure. This is targeting the expenditure on Medicare to those who are in the disadvantaged group in the community: the concession cardholders. If the doctor chooses not to bulk-bill some other patients, these patients’ upfront costs at participating practices will be reduced. An additional $295 million is provided for extra doctors and nurses. That will of course be significant, especially in rural and outer metropolitan areas. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I am sure that you, representing a rural area, will benefit from more doctors being provided with incentives to go into rural areas. There is $157 million for people’s out of hospital medical costs which relate to X-rays, ultrasounds, biopsies, radiation, oncology, and visits from doctors. All of this assistance will be provided once costs exceed $1,000. I think that will be welcomed by many people. As they are faced by increased costs in the medical area, this assistance by the government to ease the cost is very welcome. Under the current five-year Australian health care agreement, the government delivered a record $32 billion-a 28 per cent real growth-to the states and territories in public hospital funding. That is of course very welcome. The Australian health care agreements increase the amount going to free hospital treatment from $10 billion to $42 billion over the next five years. That is an unprecedented level of funding for public hospitals. Nationally, this represents a 17 per cent real increase in the Commonwealth’s commitment. The growth in public hospital funding provided by the states and territories as a whole has not kept pace with growth in the Commonwealth funding. The states’ and territories’ share in total funding decreased from 47.2 per cent in 1997-98 to 43.4 per cent in 2000-01, and the Commonwealth’s share increased from 45.2 per cent to 48.1 per cent over the same period. So we hear a lot from the state governments about the Commonwealth not paying the full amount, but here we find that the states are decreasing their amount while the Commonwealth’s percentage share goes up. There is assistance in terms of private health insurance, private hospital admissions are up by 12 per cent as a result and of course MAIN COMMITTEE our PBS assistance is $5 billion. The budget is further strengthened in terms of the focus on prevention. Then there is the question of this budget’s improvement to education standards. We are providing $15.8 billion for education, science and training which reinforces the coalition’s commitment to this sector. There is an extra $1.5 billion provided over the next four years for higher education. Over time, when the reforms are fully in place, this will represent $870 million per year being spent by the government on higher education: an extra $775 million on universities over the next four years; state schools receive $129 million, which is a 5.5 per cent increase; $210 million is provided for the standards for literacy and numeracy; and $123 million is being provided over four years towards the cost of education in regional campuses. Of most significance is the amount provided by the government under the new higher education loans program from 2005 to improve access to higher education. By reforming the system, students will be able to access loans and receive a low interest fee which will be of assistance to all of these students. Much has been heard from the members opposite about the difficulties of this. I know that I had to go to university at night because no such schemes were available. When I eventually received a Commonwealth scholarship, that became a little different. But this assistance is available right now to students to go to university on a full-time basis and not pay the fees until such time as their earning capacity is there to meet it. The HECS threshold is going to be lifted from $24,365 to $30,000 a year. This is hardly a significant impasse. tual terms, there has been a significant increase in the threshold. The figure of $30,000 a year is a point where graduates can afford it, and all these comments about how difficult it is to meet the amount that is required is just stretching the truth. This is actually only when it starts in at the most modest level. It is a scheme which does allow for many students to participate in higher education. It does lift the threshold for HECS students, it does mean that more and more people will be able to undertake tertiary studies, and it does provide for students to participate and contribute to their own education rather than simply relying totally on the taxpayer. I think it provides an excellent balance in what we want to achieve. There is $161 million provided for teachers and nurses, $162 million in scholarships and 375,000 apprenticeship places. There is also benefit for international students, generating some $5 billion. We have a responsible, balanced budget of $2½ billion. It provides significant assistance to drought affected farmers, continues the war against terrorism that provides assistance to our defence people, significantly assists those in the tertiary sector, and significantly assists the Medicare system and extends bulk-billing. It continues the strong economic performance of this government and I commend the budget to the House. Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (5.45 p.m.)-I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 20032004. I think we all recognise that we are fortunate to live in a rich and affluent country-a country that has rightly been recognised internationally as the land of a fair go. The government is lucky because, at the moment, it is presiding over one of the longest economic booms in our history. We have had 45 quarters of economic growth since 1991, averaging about 3.8 per cent economic growth per year. In such fortuitous economic times, the government’s MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Appropriation Bill No 1 2003 2004
208,Mr Ripoll,That is where it was.,135,Appropriation Bill No 1 2003 2004
209,Mr Baird,"It has gone up from this amount. Whether you measure it in real terms or acbudget should have primarily ensured that the nation’s wealth and prosperity were being fairly shared by all in our country. But that is clearly not the case. In his recent work Where to from here? Fred Argy, a well-noted economist, argues a very compelling case that the changes occurring in our society are threatening Australia’s long standing commitment to egalitarianism. His analysis shows that Australia remains a relatively unequal society, both income wise and wealth wise, compared with most other OECD countries. We have been going backwards as a nation in terms of our commitment to egalitarian ideals. Really, this budget hastens that retreat from the notion of a fair go. When I was growing up, many in similar circumstances to mine were able to succeed in life regardless of parental means or family background. Regrettably, that is not the case anymore. This budget is squeezing those families-the average Australian families who have contributed to our economic prosperity-and it is not rewarding them for their contribution and their efforts. The budget failed to ensure that prosperity was being shared equally and fairly, and I think that is shown in a number of key indicators. Structural unemployment in our country remains far too high. The distribution of employment opportunities has become more unequal and is a problem in many regions such as mine. There are far too many Australians and their children living in poverty. The divide between rich and poor is growing and, regrettably, intergenerational poverty is becoming entrenched in many areas of our nation, including in my own. This government has turned a blind eye to this growing inequality. The government’s economic agenda, as manifested in its budget, is devoid of such equity considerations. In my view, there are no constructive responses to the fundamental problems centred on this growing divide between the affluent and the poor. Fred Argy captures this divide and explains it in these terms in his work: In today’s Australia, one sees confident, job-rich, knowledge-rich and asset-rich households, often with two incomes and childless, who thrive on the challenge of uncertainty. But one also sees a large number of households with unemployed, under-employed or low-paid workers who are under-educated, asset-poor and ill-equipped to compete in a capitalist jungle. Furthermore, an increasing proportion of Australian children are to be found in these latter households. This budget demonstrates that the Howard government is blind to the needs of the disadvantaged, the poor, and lowand middle-income earners. The ambitions of many families to give their children a better future are being thwarted by an increasing lack of opportunities for them. There is little joy in this budget for the large number of families I represent in the electorate of Throsby. Almost 30 per cent of the families in Throsby-some 8,642-had a weekly income of less than $500 according to the most recent census data. The median family weekly income in Throsby is around $860 before tax. The families in my electorate are typical Australian families. The budget does little to address their needs or their priorities, nor, importantly, to relieve them of the financial pressures that they are suffering. They understand and see through the paltry and cynical gesture of a $4 tax cut, which will make no difference to themparticularly as, at the same time, the user-pays philosophy intrudes into their overall living standards by the extra pressures that will face families in medical and education costs. What is clear-and I find this in Throsby-is that for an increasing number of Australians work is no longer a protection against poverty. There are now one million Australians who have some MAIN COMMITTEE form of paid employment but not enough income to lift them above the poverty line. The government’s budget has no positive proposals to address the growth in precarious employment and job insecurity. Full-time employment is in decline everywhere and any new employment opportunities are increasingly in part-time and casual work-much of it, of course, low paid. The government is intent on pursuing its agenda of deregulating the labour market and challenging whatever protections the union movement historically has been able to provide those vulnerable workers. This government recently denied the lowest income earners in our communities the chance to have a minimum weekly wage increase of $24.60 to bring their minimum weekly wage to $456 before tax. Yet the same government turns a blind eye to the greed and excesses of the corporate sector. Not only that, but it slugs the taxpayers that I represent millions of dollars each year to pay for the golden handshakes that are bound at the top end of the market. The divide between the rich and poor in Australia is captured in the following wage comparisons that I want to bring to your attention. In 2002 the income of Australia’s top 100 CEOs grew by an average 38 per cent-in a year. Their average annual salaries increased from $1.45 million to $2 million. In other words, the average weekly income of the top 100 CEOs, $38,461, is far greater than the minimum annual wage of $25,000 that was being sought by the ACTU and vigorously opposed by this government. Almost 30 per cent of families in my electorate have to survive on less than $26,000 a year-and try raising a family on that. This budget provided no relief from the tax burdens faced by these families. The tax cut that came with the GST has long since gone but the GST is still there, day in, day out. Families are under record debt in Australia. Household debt has doubled and credit card debt has tripled. There is little incentive for families, with 860,000 of them, according to the most recent data, losing more than 60c in each additional dollar due to the combined effect of taxation and the clawback of social security and family benefits. An increasing number of families I represent are slowly sinking under the weight of an unfair tax system, unpaid or overtaxed overtime and a government induced family payments debt which is nothing short of scandalous. I will repeat that: the family debt payments that many families have been afflicted with are nothing short of scandalous. It is an administrative nightmare that the government has done nothing about. The family tax debt debacle has been the subject of a lot of public anger and anguish, with nearly 700,000 families hit with bills for overpayments last year-and in the overwhelming majority of cases the families did the right thing and informed Centrelink immediately of any change in family circumstance. In the latest government fiasco to hit the average family, it has now been revealed in the last couple of days in Senate estimates that at least 25,000 parents were denied an average $1,500 in entitlements for their children thanks to the tricky fine print attached to the family tax benefit. I say ‘tricky fine print’ because a lot of the people who have raised concerns knew nothing about the requirement that the benefit be attached to filing the tax return within one year. I will bring to your attention one such family in my electorate, Patricia and Rick Gaggin. Mr Gaggin is a small business owner. This family is owed $4,186.69. This money has been denied them despite their being granted an extension by the Australian Taxation Office to lodge their returns beyond the cut-off date of June 2002. What we are seeing is one government department approving the lodging of late tax returns at the same time as another govMAIN COMMITTEE ernment department uses some tricky fine print to deny struggling families a substantial amount of money. An amount of $4,186 might not sound a lot to the Minister for Family and Community Services but let me assure you that, when the Gaggin’s are bringing in $30,000 a year, $4,000 is one almighty sum of money and it is their right to receive that benefit. This miserly act on the part of the minister contrasts starkly with the $16,000 recently spent on fine china for the Lodge, let alone the $120,000 spent on the wine bill and the extravagance of the four-night stay in Rome which cost $45,000, more than most families in my electorate earn in a decent hard working job over a whole year. It is an absolute disgrace. It is frightening to read that key national charities report that growing poverty among workers is fuelling demand for crisis services. I have been following the Senate inquiry into poverty and financial hardship and I find the submissions made by organisations like St Vincent de Paul and Mission Australia mirror what is happening in my community. Services are stretched and there are increasing numbers of people coming to look for emergency assistance, including increasing numbers of families who have one parent in paid employment. The government knows that too many fellow Australians are hurting but chooses to be blind to their needs. Welfare agencies across Australia assisted 2.4 million people unable to make ends meet in 2002, a 12 per cent increase over the previous two years. ACOSS, the national organisation, has reported that over 180,000 people did not receive the help they sought-a jump of almost 20 per cent. In Australia today there are around 2.5 million people living in poverty. One in six of our nation’s children fall into that category. While academics might argue about how one defines poverty and what the strict definitional term should be-whether it should be based on median or average income-these esoteric arguments cannot obscure the fact that the number of Australians living in poverty is growing and now encompasses people who have some form of paid employment. This government, as the budget shows, has an all-abiding belief in market forces. But market forces are unable to solve this deep rooted problem of inequality that is confronting our nation and which this government has turned a blind eye to. The budget also fails to deal constructively with the problems of unemployment and particularly with the plight of the long term unemployed. I raise this issue because in my electorate the average rates of unemployment are higher than the national average. It is a sad indictment of a country as wealthy and as prosperous as ours that in some suburbs in my electorate youth unemployment rates are around 30 to 40 per cent. Despite high economic growth and the fortuitous economic times that this government was bequeathed from Labor, the number of people on the dole for 12 months or more is as high today as it was when the Howard government was first elected to office. Just under 400,000 Australian citizens have been on unemployment benefits for more than a year. The government’s Job Network has, to date, failed to tackle this entrenched joblessness in any meaningful way. If you do not believe me, just look at the Productivity Commission reports that refer to the fact that many of the most disadvantaged long-term unemployed are being ‘parked’ in intensive assistance and are receiving only the ‘pretence of aid’. The rise in long-term unemployment comes as no surprise to me. Under the government, not only has funding for labour market programs been slashed but they consider these cuts to be some kind MAIN COMMITTEE of achievement-at least, so boasted the Minister for Employment Services on the public record just a few months ago. The unemployed in my electorate are facing a bleak future; there is little joy or hope in this budget for them. Not only did the budget fail to provide additional investment for labour market programs; on top of that, the Treasurer predicted a slowing in the rate of employment growth and no substantial drop in the rate of unemployment. So they are not tackling the entrenched problem of long-term unemployment and the Work for the Dole programs in my electorate are not producing sustainable employment outcomes. I, together with a group of concerned citizens and organisations in the Illawarra, have pressed both the government and my party to provide a minimum amount of funding-a small amount of $6 million-so that we can fund a pilot project to create additional apprenticeships in the Illawarra. So far, our pleas for assistance from the government have again fallen on deaf ears, despite the fact, as I have indicated, that rates of youth unemployment as high as 40 per cent are not uncommon in the electorate of Throsby. I want to conclude by saying that unemployment and growing inequality in our nation are two key national issues, yet the budget fails either to recognise their importance or to deal with them in any constructive or meaningful way. Let me say that life is tough for the average Australian family. Making ends meet on a daily basis is hard enough, but it is even harder to accept that these families’ ambitions to give their children a better future are being thwarted by the growing lack of opportunities. Lowand middle-income families are being squeezed by the tax system, by a flawed family benefits system, by increasingly precarious employment and by the lack of support for working parents. What happened to paid maternity leave? What is happening to the families in my electorate who tell me that, if you have a child under two, you can list your name on 30 or 40 agencies without a call back? They are being affected by the insidious philosophy of user pays intruding into basic government services like health and education. They are impacted by cutbacks in public funding with a greater shift of the financial burden onto individuals and their families-as we see very clearly in the so-called reform package in higher education and in what families in my electorate know will be their outcomes as far as the so-called A Fairer Medicare package is concerned. There is nothing fairer about it. The miserable and cynical $4 tax cut will, they know, be given with one hand and taken very quickly with the other. It is a budget that overall has failed the average Australian family. It has failed to ensure that our nation’s prosperity is fairly shared by all. It is a budget that offers little hope or optimism for the large number of families in my electorate who are struggling to survive on less than $500 a week and it offers little hope or joy to the high numbers of unemployed, particularly the youth, who, as I have said, are in suburbs where the rate of youth unemployment is an appalling 30 to 40 per cent. That is not good enough for a country as rich and as prosperous as ours. I regret very much that the Treasurer and the government have turned a blind eye. There are lots of families who are being left behind and it seems the government’s response is totally inadequate to deal with their needs, their concerns and their priorities. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004, in effect in reply to the Treasurer’s budget speech. This is the eighth budget that the government has brought down against the backdrop of the world economic climate. In the world post 9-11, of course, there are many major economies in the MAIN COMMITTEE",135,Appropriation Bill No 1 2003 2004
210,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (6.04 P.m.),"I am very pleased tonight to speak on the world struggling to grow. I believe that our budget bears testimony to the commitment that we have given and to the disciplined approach that we have taken to bring forward budgets that are in balance and, of course, will ensure that our economy continues to grow. The coalition has, over the last eight years since coming to government, repaid some $69 billion of the $96 billion of debt that we inherited from the Labor government. When I say that ‘we’ inherited it, it is the Australian people who had inherited that debt when we came to government. It is the sort of legacy that the Australian Labor Party left all taxpayers and all Australians. Of course, we have had the discipline and the commitment to make sure that we could pay back that debt because of the benefits that inevitably flow from reducing government debt. As a result of reducing that debt, as the Treasurer outlined in his speech, we are now able to save some $4.5 billion in interest payments each year. In other words, if we still had that debt that was there when we came to government, we would be paying an additional $4.5 billion of taxpayers’ money from the budget just to pay the interest on that debt. Because we have brought that debt down, it releases another $4.5 billion for the government to be able to do other things for the whole of the economy and all Australians. We have done this against the challenge that confronts us all in the world in relation to terrorism. Since coming to government, we have continued to make sure that we look after our own sovereignty in this country. We have boosted our defence spending-in fact, we have continued to put more resources behind our defence budget-and all the time we are focused on making Australia a safer and more secure place to live. Importantly, as outlined by the Treasurer in the budget speech, we have been able to provide a modest surplus in the budget and also a modest tax cut to some nine million Australians from 1 July, which is fewer than 28 short days from today. The Labor Party might mock those tax cuts, but I would just say to the Labor Party that it is a step in the right direction. It is an indication that, when we have got some money left over, this government are prepared to hand some of the taxes that we have received back to the taxpayers. They range from $4 per week right through to $11 per week. I know that those tax cuts are going to be welcomed by struggling families. I have seen some of the interviews on television and I have seen in my own electorate, particularly when you talk to those people who keep the family budget, that they say they can do something with that additional $4 or $11-depending on the level of income that that family is on-in the family pay packet each week. The challenge ahead for us, now that we have started to bring our budget into a much stronger position, now that we have got interest rates low, now that we have got unemployment down and now that we are continuing to keep inflation under control, is that we need to look ahead at some nation-building projects-infrastructure projects-that will benefit future generations of Australians. Just as we today inherit the good work of the founders and the pioneers of this country, it is our job to facilitate projects that will benefit regional and rural Australians. In fact, all Australians will benefit from the development of major projects. We are doing this. The Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, John Anderson, through his AusLink reform, is doing this by looking to the long-term needs of our future freight task, our road transport, our rail transport and how we are going to meet the increasing challenge that we have before us in relation to transport generally. MAIN COMMITTEE I cannot talk strongly enough about one major project: the Australian Inland Rail Expressway that proposes to link Melbourne to Darwin by inland rail-a rail line that would traverse three states, through the heart of the Murray-Darling Basin agricultural sector and through the Surat and Bowen coal basins, with their coal and mineral wealth. It is a transport infrastructure that we are going to need in the long term, and that is why I have always lent my very strong support to at least two proponents that I am aware of who have put a major effort over the last six or seven years into business propositions for that inland rail project. A large part of that rail project would go through my electorate. It would go, for instance, to Emerald, the central highlands regional centre that is growing year by year. I know that in my lifetime I will see Emerald established as a significant regional centre built by the wealth that is created in the coal basin and the agricultural sector in the central highlands. There would be an intermodal freight centre that would establish where road would meet rail and where rail would meet road. The rail track would then go through to the port of Gladstone. I would like to spend a bit of time on Gladstone, because Gladstone in our lifetime I believe will be further developed as a deep-sea port in northern Australia that will be capable of unloading ships with a capacity of up to 300,000 tonnes. It will be able to handle the doublestacked container ships, the post-Panamax ships, that will increasingly be coming into our region. It is important to look to the future. We must look at China and the emerging powerhouses in Asia and South-East Asia, and their relationship with the World Trade Organisation. As we in this country develop our free trade agreement with the United States of America, and as we look at how we are going to maximise the benefits so that all Australians can share in them, it is important that we consider the strategic importance of the port of Gladstone in northern Australia and that we look at how we can deal with the imports and exports that will inevitably flow as those major countries bring trade benefits to us here in Australia. We have to be able to do it economically to be competitive on international markets. I see the port of Gladstone as a major port for entering Australia from the Pacific and from Asia. It is important that we focus on the rail and road networks that will feed that port in the future. Once the railway line goes through the Darling Downs and through towns in my electorate such as Taroom, Wandoan, Miles and Chinchilla it will go through the now undeveloped Surat coal basin and then track down through Goondiwindi into the New South Wales rail network and further south into the Victorian rail network. We all know that this is a major project. It is of a similar nature to the great inland rail project, which is currently under construction, from Alice Springs to Darwin. That line is a nation-building project. I recall today that the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line was put together with the agreement of a Country Liberal Party government in the Northern Territory, a Liberal government in South Australia and a coalition government here in Canberra. Mr Gavan O’Connor-Was that the one that got thrown out? lition government, the Liberal and National parties when they are government, that are the nation builders. The Labor Party opposition, which is acting as a rump tonight, are not nation builders; they are economy wreckers.

212,Mr Bruce Scott,"That just demonstrates, Madam Deputy Speaker, that it is the coainland rail project if we can get the support of the Labor state governments of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. The Premier of Queensland will be bringing down the budget in Queensland tonight with his Treasurer, and I am wondering how much money will be in that budget for a major project such as this. He seems to have money for football stadiums and footbridges over the Brisbane River, but not for productive projects. They might be great facilities for the people of Queensland, but let us talk about the major infrastructure projects that all Australians will benefit from in the long term. I want to touch briefly also on roads. Whilst rail and this major rail project are important, I want to talk about the importance of roads in regional Australia. From previous governments-from as far back as the Menzies government-I have seen the benefits from the roads that were laid down across our nation during that time. There are roads in my electorate-one is called the Beef Road, and there are also the defence roads-that were put there by a former Liberal Country Party government, and they are still delivering benefits for the people today. That is what a major infrastructure project does: it builds the economy and it provides an ongoing benefit for years and years. Sadly, in 1973 the Labor Party came to government here in Canberra. That major project in remote parts of Australia ended in 1973, and sadly there has not been another metre of sealed road delivered by those major projects since. We do have to look at those sorts of road projects in the future, because they deliver benefits year after year. In those remote parts of Australia, they provide much needed infrastructure for inland tourism and the extension of trade-particularly livestock trade-in those regions. I also want to talk about water. Water underpins the future of regional development and secures agriculture. Without the security of water in the long term, we are going to see many rural communities diminish in size rather than grow, as they have the potential to do. I want to talk about the major project of bringing Brisbane’s grey water-and read that as waste water-to the Lockyer Valley and the Darling Downs. Once again, the Liberal-National party government have been closely involved in this initiative. In fact, we funded the feasibility study. I would like to outline to members exactly what this initiative seeks to achieve. The initiative is the brainchild of the Darling Downs community based Vision 2000 group. Together with members of the Lockyer Valley based City to Soil Group, working under NuWater, they have been working for the last five years on obtaining a suitable water supply for the Darling Downs and the Lockyer Valley. Madam Deputy Speaker Gambaro, as I am sure you would be aware, the Darling Downs and the Lockyer Valley are currently, and have been for many years, in the grip of serious drought. The Leslie dam in my own electorate has not delivered into the river systems or to the irrigators of the Darling Downs any water for the last two years. The lack of security and sustainability of the water resources in that part of my electorate in that part of Queensland has seriously impeded the growth of agriculture, irrigation and some other major regional development projects. NuWater representatives say-and I agree-that farming areas in the Lockyer Valley and the Darling Downs are considered by many to be amongst the best quality farming country in Australia. The region’s future as a reliable supplier of quality crops and produce is under threat because of the lack of sustainable and secure water supplies. The project is spearheaded by a local Darling Downs irrigator and great forward thinker Phil Jauncey and his committee. They have been working hard alongside council representaMAIN COMMITTEE tives to promote the environmental and economic benefits of recycling Brisbane’s waste water and piping it through to the Lockyer Valley and to the Darling Downs for irrigation and industrial use. The project has quite a history. In 1999 an enormous volume of water was identified as being discharged into Moreton Bay-as you, Madam Deputy Speaker, as the member for Petrie, would be well aware. In fact, 130,000 megalitres of effluent are being pumped into Moreton Bay per year. That is having a detrimental effect on the beautiful Moreton Bay and its marine environment. As well, not one cent can be made from discharging 130,000 megalitres into Moreton Bay. Many have talked about drought proofing Australia and about how we can better use available water. This 130,000 megalitres is waste water that can be recycled and, in turn, bring wealth and the surety of water supply to the Lockyer Valley and the Darling Downs. This is about being smart about how we use our grey water in Australia. Economic rationalists will, I am sure, always find something wrong with this project; environmentalists will probably be on our side. But it is also about building a nation for future generations and about being smart as to how we use our water. I am sure if they could, the early pioneers would be saying that if the economic rationalists had had a say at the time we would never have seen the railway lines built, the roads constructed and the dams built in the inland. It was a long-term dividend that was paid through the capacity that they put into building roads, rail and dams. In their lifetime they saw populations grow and thrive in the inland where this infrastructure was built. We have to follow them when we consider the South East Queensland Recycled Water Project. This proposal has the overwhelming support of the councils and of potential users in the community. As well, the project has the support of the government. We have already provided a grant to NuWater under our very successful Regional Solutions Program. These funds have helped with the completion of feasibility studies. The series of feasibility studies that have been commissioned over the past three years look at the benefit of bringing effluent from Brisbane and Ipswich to the Lockyer Valley and the Darling Downs. There have been many frustrations and delays but I am advised, from the office of the Deputy Prime Minister, that the project is on track to provide final outcomes by the end of this calendar year. AndI reckon that is great news. Clearly, the South East Queensland Recycled Water Project is a perfect example of how our water resources can be used more efficiently. I am also pleased that the Prime Minister was briefed last week on this project while he was in Ipswich, where he was told how important recycling water was in helping to drought proof many of our farming communities. Recycling water has many great environmental benefits-and, economically, it can only be a positive for everyone involved. It provides 100 per cent sustainability of the water supply. As I said in the Main Committee last week when I spoke on the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation-UNESCO-has predicted that by 2020 water shortages will be a serious worldwide problem. Already many parts of Australia are reaching the limits of their supply and many are under great threat. In this day and age there is a very substantial market for water. Under the South East Queensland Recycled Water Project we have a commercial outcome for council, reliable water for users, and the capacity to deliver water to farmers at a price that they can afford to pay. I support, and will continue to support, this venture. It has the potential to secure a guarantee MAIN COMMITTEE of a reliability of supply to irrigators in the Darling Downs and, importantly, to provide water for other industrial projects that are being held back because of the lack of security over water supply for those developments. For the past nine months there have been studies undertaken by the South-East Queensland Regional Organisation of Councils, and this report is due to be released this month. We all await that report. I am advised that this report will conclude that environmentally the project provides a significant range of benefits; that it is sustainable; that the project does stack up economically, by providing benefits, for example, in regional employment and in broader economic activity. Finally, financially, according to the narrow Queensland Treasury guidelines applied to this analysis, the cost of the project remains a challenge. The project is estimated to cost $400 million. Having already moved into the commercialisation of the project, NuWater is confident that these costs will be met. As a member, I represent some 40 per cent of the landmass of Queensland, which is probably one of the last truly rural electorates in Australia because of its remoteness and size. I believe that we as a government-and I seek the support of the opposition to talk to the Premier of Queensland, with his budget being brought down tonight-should support this project and renew our focus on nation-building projects. This is the sort of legacy that I want to leave the next generation of Australians-for all the benefits it will bring in the construction phase, in the security it will give us and through the jobs that will be created for generations to come. spoken very eloquently about water shortages in coming decades. Of course he seeks every opportunity to drive the boot into that good Labor government in Queensland and into the Queensland Labor Premier. I think he has demonstrated here tonight that there is no shortage of hot air in this place. Much of the criticism that he has levelled at that excellent state Labor government in Queensland is unfounded. The 2003-04 budget, documented in the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004 that we are debating in this House today, enshrines all that is arrogant and cynical in the Howard government. Under the guise of the smallest tax cuts in Australia’s history, the Howard government seeks to wreck Medicare and load families with extra debt to educate their children. Geelong’s battling families are supposed to get on their knees in grateful thanks before this arrogant Treasurer while he smirks and grins as he taxes them every time they buy a litre of milk for their family or when they put sugar in their tea or their coffee. Today the smirk was no longer there. The Treasurer had to come to grips with the Prime Minister’s announcement that he, rather than the Treasurer, would lead the coalition at the next election. The Treasurer, who we on this side of the House have described as the Prince Charles of Australian politics-that is, the man who never gets his chance to sit on the throne of the prime ministership-had the smirk well and truly wiped off his face today by the Prime Minister’s announcement. I think it is a fitting treatment for a Treasurer who continues to bring down budgets that entrench inequalities in our society and who continues to burden working families in my electorate. Therefore, I have great pleasure in supporting the second reading amendment of the shadow Treasurer, the member for Canberra. In that amendment he has detailed the litany of shortcomings in Treasurer Costello’s eighth budget.

213,Mr Gavan O’connor (Corio) (6.24 P.m.),"The honourable member for Maranoa hasnext financial year. But it is much more than an accounting document. Enshrined in it is the philosophy and world view of the party that commands the majority in the House of Representatives, which forms the government of the day and which has the right to bring such a budget before the Australian people. There is a very simple conservative philosophy dominating the Treasurer’s budget, and it is this: the government is seeking to shift the cost of health and education from the budget on to Australian families, whether it is by imposing higher costs on families to visit the doctor, imposing a 30 per cent hike in the cost of essential medicines, increasing HECS fees by 30 per cent or driving students and their families into debt to pay for a tertiary education. The Howard government has demonstrated a callous disregard for working families in the electorate of Corio and burdened them with additional costs. In granting miserly $4 a week tax cuts to lowpaid families, the Howard government seeks to mask the increased taxation burden on families elsewhere in the budget. This budget is indeed a bitter pill that the Treasurer expects my electorate to swallow. Let me turn to an area of critical importance to Geelong families: the state of Medicare and the health system in our community. The health system in Geelong is in crisis, and this budget does little to address its outstanding problems. I draw the attention of the House to the decline in bulk-billing in Geelong. It is a matter that I have raised in debates before in this chamber. Bulk-billing in the Corio electorate has reached all-time low figures. If we look at the historical comparisons, in December 2000, 66.9 per cent was the level of bulk-billing. In December 2002, that had declined by 8.4 per cent to 58.5 per cent, one of the lowest in the country. These are the facts, and people need to understand the implications of this situation for Australian families and for people in my electorate. The decline in bulk-billing in Corio means that many Geelong people have to pay more when they go to their local GP. That is the result of the massive decline in bulk-billing that we have experienced. But the crisis does not end there. We face in Geelong, as elsewhere throughout regional Victoria and Australia, a critical shortage of GPs-a problem that is confined not just to the Corio electorate; it is also being experienced by many urban electorates. We also face a significant shortage of GPs who bulk-bill. Once again, I have raised these issues on the floor of the parliament on behalf of doctors and of my community. The shortage of GPs simply means that many of my constituents are forced to wait for treatment, and many practices are not taking new patients. Doctors are not bulk-billing. They are forced to use a pricing mechanism to more rigidly control the flow of patients and to ration services. But there is an adverse impact on doctors also. GPs in the electorate of Corio are being expected to work longer hours and face the difficulty of maintaining the quality of their services. The hours that many of them work pose a real danger to their own health. While they advise others on the state of their health, they simply find that the hours of work they are forced to do in living out the oath that they took to the Australian community when they became doctors simply puts their own health and well-being and that of their families in jeopardy. But the impacts are not confined to doctors and patients. Because patients have difficulty in accessing their GPs, they are now seeking treatment at the Geelong public hospital, creating additional burdens on emergency departments and outpatient services. I commend here the efforts of the Bracks government in increasing public hospital funding in Geelong and elseMAIN COMMITTEE where in Victoria. They have attempted to address some of the problems that have been created as a result of the Howard government ripping funding away from the public hospital system in Victoria. But of course they cannot do it alone, and the federal government has a real responsibility in its health policy to ensure that my constituents, along with other Australians, have access to universal health cover and to the GP of their choice. question? are simply the increased medical costs for families. As a result of the policies of the Howard government, we are facing changes to the PBS and increases costs of essential medicines to the tune of 30 per cent. But it does not end there. If we go to the private health insurance area of policy, under the Howard government Geelong families have been burdened by massive premium hikes from private health insurers, and they face increasing gaps in their private insurance costs as well. The IR reforms have failed to deliver to Geelong families reduced costs for private health insurance, and those who seek access to public hospital facilities face increased costs also. Despite the hard work of specialists and GPs, the hard work of nurses and other health professionals and significant injections of funding by the Bracks government, Geelong’s health system is in a state of crisis. We know the Medicare system is under severe strain. The decline in bulk-billing and the decline in funding to public hospitals have put an enormous strain on our public health resources. We know that the Prime Minister has always opposed Medicare. Indeed, on previous occasions he has stated that he wants to destroy it. His recent reforms have that intent. You do not change the spots on the leopard. The Prime Minister is committed to the destruction of Medicare and he does that under the guise of so-called reform. Geelong families want Medicare enhanced and they know that only a Labor government can do that. In his budget reply speech, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham, outlined the opposition’s plan to enhance and revamp Medicare. He committed the opposition to lifting the patient rebate immediately upon coming to office to 95 per cent of the schedule fee and then taking it to 100 per cent-an average rise of $5 for every consultation that is bulk-billed. He also outlined that the opposition would reward doctors who meet bulk-billing targets; they will receive additional incentive payments. For example, doctors in metropolitan areas who bulk-bill 80 per cent of services will receive an additional $7,500 a year, doctors in outer metropolitan areas who bulk-bill 75 per cent of services will receive an additional $15,000 a year, and doctors in rural and regional areas who bulk-bill 70 per cent of services will receive an additional $22,500 a year. This is the equivalent of increasing the patient rebate by as much as $6.30 for a doctor in a metropolitan area, $7.80 in an outer metropolitan area and $9.60 in a rural area. The opposition are absolutely committed to the retention and the enhancement of Medicare, and we oppose the attempt of the Prime Minister to develop in Australia a two-tiered health care system. We oppose his attempts to Americanise Australia’s great public health care system. MAIN COMMITTEE",144,Appropriation Bill No 1 2003 2004

218,Mr Gavan O’connor,"No, Madam Deputy Speaker. The other implications of thisIn the time remaining to me, I would like to refer to some comments that were made by the honourable member for Corangamite in his contribution to the appropriation debate last week. I do this because the honourable member for Corangamite shares, if you like, the representation of the Geelong region with me. In his contribution, the honourable member for Corangamite lauded the performance of the Australian economy and the Howard government in the process-denigrating, as he is wont to do, the contribution of Labor in our 13 years of government to our current economic prosperity. He mentioned the growth rate at 3.25 per cent for the next financial year, but of course he did not mention that Labor left the coalition a growth rate of four per cent plus for the four years prior to 1996. You would imagine, from the way in which the coalition refers to growth rates of four per cent, that they were something new in the Australian experience. We gave it to you, and the least you could do in government is maintain it. If you have, that is full marks to you, but do not denigrate an economy that was given to you with the features in it that have laid the foundations for the prosperity we now enjoy. The honourable member for Corangamite mentioned a surplus of $2.2 billion as if it is some great revelation or achievement, but he did not mention the fact that Labor was the first government since the early fifties to deliver a surplus budget in the national accounts. He had the temerity to mention public debt reductions, claiming $63 billion has been paid off the public debt-but he failed to mention that almost all of that has occurred as a result of asset sales. Of course, the Howard government keeps selling parts of the farm, and it does it badly. For example, it has been estimated by market analysts that, on the first tranche sale of Telstra, the Howard government was done over in the market to the tune of $13 billion. A share of Telstra-an enterprise the Australian people owned-was sold for $13 billion under its value, and the proceeds were then used to retire debt. The member for Corangamite wants this House to pat him on the back for his government’s incompetence. Of course, we all remember the Liberal debt truck and the deceptive manner in which the member for Higgins, now the Treasurer, lumped in the public debt, the household debt and the trading deficit to pump up a debt figure for every man, woman and child in Australia. What is good for the goose is good for the gander, and we know who the goose is for using statistics so deceptively. The Howard government is in the business of transferring its responsibilities on to households. As a consequence, many Australian families have had to ramp up their household debt. Household debt under the Howard government has doubled to $600 billion. We have to get our heads around this-household debt has increased over 120 per cent to $600 billion. As a percentage or as a proportion of household income, it has risen over 130 per cent. The Liberal’s debt saga continues in the area of student debt. Since it came to power, the Howard government has cut $5 billion from Australian universities and has massively increased HECS fees to students. As a result, student debt under the Howard government has tripled-and this budget adds another $800 million of debt on to Australian students-and is expected to reach a record $11.5 billion by 2005-06. That is a really successful policy, isn’t it: transferring your responsibilities on to households and saddling them with debt! But it does not end there. If we look at the trading debt, we see that Treasurer Costello’s record is appalling. There have been 16 consecutive trade deficits, which have led to foreign debt crashing through the $350 billion barrier. The Treasurer, when in opposition, said that the MAIN COMMITTEE foreign debt was $10,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia and he went around saying that that was a state of crisis for Australia. It is now $18,000. I wonder what the Treasurer would say to that. With no industry policy, this government has returned Australia to simply a farm and a quarry. The honourable member for Corangamite said that the tax cuts are a showpiece of this particular budget. He really cannot be serious. You are really out of touch if you take that view. Senator Vanstone got it right when she poured scorn on her own Treasurer and said that the tax cuts were not enough to buy a milkshake and a sandwich. I went to the footy on Saturday at Kardinia Park and that $4 tax cut a week would have bought me four dim sims, or I could have had a bucket of chips, or 95 per cent of a hot dog or two-thirds of a continental sausage. The Australian people are not fooled by this chicanery, and the honourable member for Corangamite ought to do something in his party about reducing the burdens on Geelong households. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (6.44 p.m.)-It is with pleasure that I speak tonight on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004. This is the eighth budget I have had the pleasure of supporting. It is another surplus, on top of a succession of surpluses that have been delivered in the face of $10 billion black holes, Asian economic crises, decisive action in Timor, the dotcom crash, 11 September 2001 and Afghanistan. This year was no different, with even more international impacts and domestically the worse drought in generations, reminiscent of the great droughts of the 1890s. What have the opposition offered in way of reply? Whingeing on the size of the tax cuts, as just reiterated by the member for Corio, and totally misleading the Australian public on proposed additions to our higher education and Medicare systems. Let me remind those opposite, who seek to amend this budget, that between 1996 and 2003 there were 22,400 more university places made available to Australians under the existing no up-front fees Higher Education Contribution Scheme. That was initially introduced by Labor and engineered and orchestrated by Labor with the responsible support of the Liberal coalition in opposition. The 22,400 places are equivalent to three new universities and have more than kept pace with the population growth in the school leaver demographic. Currently, 18.9 per cent of Australians have a university degree. There is some inequity here. In my electorate of Lindsay, I have the same number of students attending infant, primary and secondary school as there are in Bradfield. In Bradfield, there are 22,972; in Lindsay, there are 22, 911; and in Chifley, next door to me, there are 27,965. However, there are 43,654 people with a university degree in Bradfield compared to just 13,206 people in my electorate. In Chifley, there are only 11,761. In 2001, there were 11,521 people attending university in Bradfield but only 7,229 in my electorate and 6,950 in Chifley. What this suggests to me is that more people in Bradfield are accessing the fully funded places than people in Lindsay. In other words, the taxpayers of Lindsay are funding the university degrees of the school leavers of Bradfield. Let us have a look at the opportunity of those school leavers in Bradfield to get the TERs required to snare one of those fully funded tertiary places, which have increased under this government to the extent that nearly 20 per cent of Australians have a degree. The median weekly income in Bradfield is $1,759, compared to $1,132 for Lindsay and only $899 for MAIN COMMITTEE Chifley. In regard to internet access from home, in Bradfield there are 62,035 compared to 34,904 in Lindsay and 30,152 in Chifley. Let us look at the numbers attending non-government schools. There are 12,590 in Bradfield, compared to 8,327 in Lindsay and 8,297 in Chifley. These figures do not tell you everything but they are good indicators of which HSC students probably have a room of their own at home in which to study, the types of assistance they get at home, the types of facilities they have available for study and the ability and willingness of their parents to pay for extra tuition in subjects in which that student is weak. Let us have a look at the number of people with no qualifications. In Bradfield, there are 36,737. In Lindsay, there are 53,273 and in Chifley, there are 64,214. Of those with trade qualifications, there are only 9,858 in Bradfield, but there are 18,477 in Lindsay and 15,368 in Chifley. The number of tradespeople in Bradfield is 3,776, in Lindsay it is 13,283 and in Chifley it is 14,236. That tells me that more people would be interested in trades in my electorate because their dad was in a trade and their family influence is that way. They do not have the inclination, the desire or the family support to go to university. Labor’s amendments to this bill basically tell the taxpayers of Lindsay to go on subsidising the university education of the good citizens of Bradfield and that the Labor Party is not in the least bit interested in extending to the school leavers of Western Sydney, where 40 per cent of New South Wales children are growing up, the same opportunity that foreigners have in our universities. Ms Burke-Foreigners don’t pay taxes. Miss JACKIE KELLY-Dr David Gow, an academic at the University of Queensland, recently wrote: The Democrats and Greens and other critics of Our UniversitiesMs Burke interjectingMiss JACKIE KELLY-like those whingeing oppositeshould see their naive ‘no fees’ policy for what it is. Their insistence on reducing or eliminating tertiary fees entrenches middle-class privilege and, perversely, requires the working class to subsidise that privilege. Eventually the government will fund more and more HECS places as funds become available, unlike the previous government that just racked up debt. Indeed, the ALP have not shown how they would fund any more places at universities. They just want to stop the addition of full fee places, which any Australian can take up. How are they going to create the opportunities for people whose parents have not been able to buy them a TER and who have just missed out on a HECS place in a course they have wanted to do since they were a child? chamber is very high.

You wonder what Labor is doing-I do not wonder, reallyMr Albanese interjectinglevel of noise is very high. versation, I ask that he sit next to the member for Chisholm and speak more quietly. Miss JACKIE KELLY-I attribute the attitude of those opposite as the very reason they have absolutely lost Western Sydney. In fact, Roozendaal’s latest comments on the further loss of seats in Western Sydney are just a classic example of how far removed the opposition are from what should be a vote which goes fairly well their way, but people are just shaking their heads at Labor at the moment and asking, ‘Where are they?’ They are supporting the issues, and having the working classes supporting middle-class welfare! There are further benefits for the people of Lindsay in this budget package, and that is in the teaching and nursing degrees at the University of Western Sydney. We will be putting teachers back into schools and nurses back into hospitals due to the incentives in this budget. By creating a partially deregulated higher education system, the US will be able to capitalise on its strength and more adequately respond to student demand. Students in Lindsay who choose to pay full fees for their university course will be able to access low-interest loans. Students who are from low-income families or of Indigenous descent will be able to apply for some of the 7,000 new Commonwealth learning scholarships that will be provided each year by 2007, and young residents in Lindsay will be able to join in the popular New Apprenticeships scheme. Consider this: there has been a downturn in the global economic climate, we have been through a war on terror and a war in Iraq, and Australia has experienced the worse drought in generations. In this climate, it would not be unreasonable to assume that any government would be in financial difficulty. However, this government has managed to secure not only a budget surplus but also a tax cut. Much has been made of this tax cut, and particularly by those opposite who fail to understand the principle behind the tax cut. The tax cut is a recognition that the money is not ours. It belongs to the taxpayers and, as such, it should be returned to them. Those opposite want to deride the size of the tax cut, but nothing in the amendment that they have moved shows me how they would make it bigger. Nothing in the amendment that they have proposed show us a bigger tax cut.

227,The Deputy Speaker,"I ask the parliamentary secretary to continue.ing that it should be spent on hospitals and schools. If every person from the opposition to speak on this bill continues in that vein, I will expect every single one of them to write cheques for the exact amount of their personal tax cut from this budget and to send those cheques to their local school and their hospital every year, in perpetuity, with directions on the expenditure. I have said before in this place that in dealing with economics it is often easy to focus on facts, figures and statistics and to ignore the impact they actually have on people and their families. A reduction in the unemployment rate, stark in percentage terms, really means that people have found work and a sense of self. A reduction in interest rates means that families pay less on their mortgage repayments and it enhances their standard of living and their ability to do other things with their disposable income. These things have the potential to increase the quality of life and the happiness of both families and individuals. Let us look at health care. Those patients who choose to pay their fees will not have to line up in Medicare offices to get their rebate or their doctor’s cheque. This saves time and bother for the time-poor residents of Lindsay, especially working mothers and those with small children at home, who, in the past, have had to go to a Medicare office in order to do some transactions. Anyone who has attempted to get small children on a bus for a particular outing and then back home again knows very well that you may be able to get one errand done on that day but that is it. To be able to transact all your business at the doctor’s or specialist’s surgery, at the hospital or at the chemist is an enormous boon. It is about dragging our health system into the 21st century where, electronically, the government follows you to where you do your transactions. It makes sense to allow people to claim their Medicare rebate at the doctor’s surgery. The opposition is basically saying, ‘We’ll increase the rebate.’ That would go straight into the doctors’ pockets; it would do nothing for falling bulk-billing rates. My husband, a specialist, who works on occasion in Dubbo, became ill there recently and could not get to see a doctor because their waiting lists are closed. If you were not a current patient, you did not get to see a doctor. Increasing the numbers of doctors will enhance the rate of bulk-billing. When the numbers of doctors have increased and there is competition-there is enormous competition in my electorate of Lindsay, where the bulk-billing rate remains at about 92 per cent-then the bulk-billing rate will be enhanced. This government has ensured that there is no means testing for bulk-billing. Furthermore, it is encouraging doctors to move out to outer metropolitan areas and to other areas where there are few doctors. Fifty-seven extra doctors, specialists and registrars have so far been approved to relocate to work in outer suburbs across Australia where there are doctor shortages. That will achieve something in terms of bulk-billing. It is about competition between doctors. The opposition will simply raise rebate levels, which will go straight into doctors’ pockets and cost taxpayers an enormous amount of money. The only people to benefit will be the doctors. They can still choose not to bulk-bill. If their books are closed they do not have to deal with the Medicare system, wait for their money or be involved with the government. The government’s scheme provides a tremendous incentive for doctors to be involved. It also provides a safety net for concession cardholders where, from January 2004, if they spend more than $500 on out-of-hospital services funded by Medicare, they will have such out-of-pocket expenses reimbursed at 80c in the dollar. MAIN COMMITTEE They are key initiatives that have been totally misrepresented and warped by Labor, with their amendment to this bill just showing their total lack of policy and comprehension of the real issues. They will continue to treat the symptoms and not look at the root causes of the problem, as they have done with education. It was not about education being free; it was about the initial barriers to school leavers of education. With bulk-billing, it is not about how much the schedule rebate is-that will not make a difference. It is the number of doctors who are available and the competition between doctors which will make a difference, and the incentives that government offers to doctors to electronically receive their rebates. Lindsay is home to many members of the ADF. I have RAAF Glenbrook in my electorate; the 5th Combat Engineer Regiment; and Navy, Army and Air Force personnel at the joint logistics organisation at Orchard Hills. Furthermore, there are many ex-service men and women in my electorate. Suffice to say they recognise the importance of Australia’s defence policy, unlike those opposite, whose defence and foreign policy consists of cheap political points. This budget adds more than $2.1 billion over five years for defence, bringing the total defence budget to more than $15 billion. This includes an extra $156 million over four years for a new special operations command; an extra $102 million over three years to recruit more military personnel and to improve retention rates; and an extra $70.7 million over two years to enhance security at defence bases around Australia through increased guarding, patrolling and protective services. My old service, the RAAF, gets five new-generation air-to-air refuellers; electronic warfare self-protection for our C130H Hercules transport aircraft and Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters; and ballistic protection for our Sea King helicopters at over $250 million. For Lindsay veterans, the new local medical officer agreement will ensure that gold and white cardholders have access to free health care. The government will be spending $61 million over four years, which continues programs like community care, which provides project funding for ex-service and committee organisations which support veterans and war widows. Projects include more access to community services promoting healthy lifestyles, and this is of particular importance to many Vietnam veterans in my electorate. In employment and workplace relations, young job seekers in Lindsay will be required to participate in intensive support job search training as soon as they start receiving unemployment payments rather than having to wait three months. The intensive support is an individually tailored service which helps identify areas where job seekers need most development. They will receive assistance with job applications and interviews, making it easier for young Australians in my area to get their first job. The government will make available an additional 21,000 intensive support places throughout Australia over the next three years. The budget also provides for the employment innovation fund to begin in July 2003, which gives up to $100,000 for initiatives that tackle employment or labour market related problems in innovative ways. The fund is a way of promoting community based action on employment-something I am sure even the member for Werriwa would support. It addresses specific employment and labour market problems and alleviates the social consequences of unemployment. Local councils, community groups, not-for-profit organisations and Job Network members are just some of the organisations that will be able to apply for these funds. A program like this gets the community involved in helping those who have fallen on hard times back on their feet. Once again, the Howard government has produced a budget that delivers to MAIN COMMITTEE the people of outer metropolitan Australia. I commend this bill to the House and congratulate the Treasurer. rather than congratulations today. I wish to make a contribution to this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004 and point out that the member for Lindsay-similarly to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister-has spoken up the so-called economic miracle. Such comments are nothing short of gratuitous self-gratification. Whilst this attitude by the government may give Treasury economists a warm inner glow, it insults the 620,000 Australians who are currently languishing in unemployment queues, it offers little hope for the nearly 400,000 people who have been relying upon the dole long term and it provides little comfort to the 860,000 children who now live in families where no parent has a job. These Australians have a right to know why they are not benefiting from the prosperity being generated by the economy. Unfortunately, the budget before us today fails to rescue the unemployed and their families from being permanent members of a deprived underclass. This budget sentences the unemployed to another period of suffering and hopelessness. According to the budget papers, employment growth will fall from 2½ per cent this financial year to 1¾ per cent next year and to 1½ per cent in the following out year. In short, these figures translate into many fewer new jobs. Despite predicting slowing employment over the next four years, this budget makes no additional investment in the labour market, training and regional development programs that would improve the employment prospects of jobseekers. In eight budgets all the unemployed have got from this government is a privatised employment service that recycles them through endless programs with little chance of meaningful employment at the end, mutual obligation programs that are more about demonising the jobless than providing them with employable skills and a traineeship and apprenticeship system that is being increasingly exploited by employers as a source of cheap labour rather than as an opportunity to skill up our work force and improve the productivity of the Australian economy. The end result of these policies is that the number of long-term unemployed is higher today than when the Howard government was first elected to office. According to the latest data from the Department of Family and Community Services, 382,176 people have been on the dole for more than a year, 60 per cent of all unemployment benefit recipients. However, this rise in long-term unemployment should not come as a surprise. Under the Howard government, not only has funding for labour market programs been slashed, but they consider these cuts an achievement. Back in March, the Minister for Employment Services boasted to the Financial Review that his government had cut $2 billion from labour market programs over the past five years. Under the Howard government, funding for employment assistance has declined from 0.67 per cent of GDP to just 0.39 per cent of GDP. On an international comparison, Australia invests 43 per cent less than the OECD average in help for the unemployed. However, Minister Brough does not always emphasise this. He has one message for the Australian Financial Review and another message for commercial radio. When I debated him last week on radio 720 from Western Australia he emphasised how much support the government is giving the unemployed. MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Appropriation Bill No 1 2003 2004

Even in the context of higher long-term unemployment and slowing employment growth, the only new investment contained in this budget for the unemployed is motivational classes for young people aged 16 to 24. However, this $12.5 million initiative is clearly dwarfed by seven years of cuts. A lack of substantial new investment in this budget will ensure that the government’s cornerstone labour market program, the Job Network, continues to perform poorly in reducing entrenched joblessness in our community. The most recent data produced by DEWR shows that only 18 per cent of those who participated in intensive assistance found full-time employment. In the case of the most disadvantaged job seekers, only one in eight, or 12.5 per cent, found full-time work upon completing intensive assistance. The underfunding of the Job Network was first exposed in a report completed last year by the Productivity Commission. The commission found that the most disadvantaged long-term unemployed were being ‘parked’ in intensive assistance, receiving only the ‘pretence of aid’. Inadequate funding meant that those who did gain access to IA did not get the help they needed. Only five per cent of participants got any form of work experience and only 14 per cent received vocational training. In its submission last month to the Senate inquiry into current and future skill needs, Jobs Australia, the national peak industry association for not-forprofit Job Network providers, stated that none of the three Job Network contracts provided resources for vocational training for people who have been unemployed for less than 12 months unless that person has been identified as highly disadvantaged. Until they reach the 12-month benchmark the training available to most job seekers relates purely to searching for a job, not equipping them with the skills that improve their attractiveness to employers. As well as not providing the type of assistance that would most enhance their job prospects, the government, through its restructuring of the Job Network, is making it increasingly difficult for the unemployed to access the limited support on offer. Specifically, under Job Network mark 3, 53 per cent of Job Network sites are earmarked for closure between now and 1 July. This translates into the loss of 691 regional sites and a further 410 metropolitan sites. In total, of the current 2,087 sites, 1,101 will close permanently. The government are actually closing more offices than they are keeping open. These closures will leave many smaller towns without any Job Network provider and the unemployed in those towns having to travel further to get the help they need to find a job. For job seekers in larger towns and metropolitan areas, these closures will mean less choice. The figures are clear. This dramatic cut in employment services comes at a time when many communities, particularly in regional areas, are still enduring unemployment rates of more than 10 per cent and youth unemployment rates stuck at over 30 per cent. The government are effectively putting these high unemployment regions into the too-hard basket. Back in 1999 when the government announced a significant increase in the number of sites as part of Job Network mark 2, the then Minister for Employment Services, Mr Tony Abbott, proclaimed: Job Network2 will mean very positive outcomes for regional Australia. There will be more than 2,100 Job Network sites across Australia, which is a 50% increase in the 1,400 sites under the first contract. This means better service coverage for job seekers and employers across Australia, including those in rural and regional localities. The government cannot have it both ways. When it expanded the number of sites, it said it was better. Now it is halving them so there are fewer than there were under Job Network 1. MAIN COMMITTEE Given that the number of sites has been slashed, the member for Warringah, the former minister, must now concede that the result will be substantially reduced service coverage for job seekers and employers alike. The deficiency in the Job Network is obvious: not enough is being invested to improve the job outcomes for disadvantaged job seekers, particularly for those lacking either recent work experience in a mainstream job or relevant skills. This budget has failed to rectify this situation, leaving the unemployed and their families facing a bleak and dismal future. The 2003 federal budget also missed the opportunity to reform the New Apprenticeships scheme so that it can more effectively address acute skill shortages in the economy and provide young Australians with the qualifications that will improve their long-term career prospects. The latest data shows that in the December quarter of 2002 only 6,000 people began apprenticeships in the traditional trades. This is the lowest number of commencements since the June quarter of 1998. This decline in commencements comes at a time when the latest national skill shortage list produced by the department has identified skill shortages across a range of traditional trade occupations, including carpentry, plumbing, cabinet making, panel beating and metal fabrication. In its submission to the Senate skills inquiry, the Australian Industry Group reported, ‘Over half of the businesses surveyed face skill shortages.’ At a time when many communities in this country are experiencing high levels of unemployment, we have businesses crying out for skilled workers. This situation is nothing short of irrational. While the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, regularly boasts in the parliament that under his government the number of people undertaking apprenticeships and traineeships has doubled, he fails to point out that most of this growth has occurred in short-term training in industries such as retail and fast food. In addition, this growth in numbers appears to have come at the expense of quality training outcomes for both the individual as well as the Australian economy. Between 20 and 30 per cent of those undertaking traineeships are receiving inadequate training. In a study undertaken by Mark Cully from the National Institute of Labour Studies and Richard Curtain from Curtain Consulting, it was revealed that almost half-47 per centof those who did not complete their apprenticeship or traineeship did so because they felt they were ‘being used as cheap labour’. This is an indictment of the government’s system. This emerging skills crisis is a complete failure of government policy. This crisis has been caused by the financial incentive structure put in place by the Commonwealth government, and this budget does nothing to rebalance these incentives towards the traditional trades and other areas of skill shortages. On top of this failure, the budget also abolishes a program-the Enterprise and Career Education Foundation, ECEF-that was proving successful in bringing schools and industry together to provide young people with the skills that will improve their long-term career prospects. During hearings of the VET in Schools inquiry being conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training, of which I am a member, we heard praise for the ECEF. The Prime Minister’s Youth Pathways Action Plan Taskforce also endorsed the ECEF, which arose from the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation, established under the previous Labor government. The task force found that ASTF made: MAIN COMMITTEE … a particularly strong and practical contribution to achieving a broader approach to schooling. In particular, it has encouraged partnerships between schools, industry and the community to provide a range of opportunities for young people to develop employment skills. The Taskforce believes the ASTFor ECEFwould be an appropriate organisation to drive the shift in thinking needed to create an effective and integrated system of transition for young people from school to the wider world. So what did the Howard government do with this program that its own task force was praising? It abolished it in this budget, with no advance notice and in the middle of an inquiry being held into this very issue by the House of Representatives standing committee, to save a pittance-a miserable $4.1 million over the next four years. At a time when Australia is experiencing acute skill shortages, the abolishment of the ECEF is a retrograde step and highlights the fact that the government is not committed to the integration of vocational education and training into our school system. I asked a question of the member for Macquarie understanding order 143. It is little wonder that we did not get an answer from the member, because the abolition of this program is simply indefensible. One wonders why we are bothering to have a committee inquiry into this very issue, given that some $16,901,000 has been allocated in this budget to run committees so that they can make inquiries into programs. Of equal concern, particularly in the light of current skill shortages, is the defunding of the New Apprenticeships Workforce Skills Development program. Amongst other things, this program enables government and industry to work together to identify and address the skill needs of industry. In addition, the program funded projects that promote and generate new apprenticeships in difficult, challenging or underserviced areas through group training arrangements. Turning to the other key component of our VET system, we find that the Minister for Education, Science and Training has used smoke and mirrors to conceal the fact that this budget contains no new money for TAFE. On budget night, Minister Nelson stated in his press release that he had written to state and territory training ministers offering them an additional $218.7 million between 2004 and 2006 under the new Australian National Training Authority agreement. The fact is that the budget papers for increased spending allocated to ANTA show, for this year, zero and, for each of the out years, zero, zero and zero. The analysis conducted by the state training ministers when they examined this and thought they might have been getting some new money has found that Minister Nelson’s offer contains no new real funding. In fact, base recurrent funding remains at 2000 levels, and the ‘growth’ funding on offer barely keeps pace with indexation. In their letter of response to Minister Nelson’s offer, the state training ministers have written: We note your offer of $220 million for the period of the next Agreement and the objectives you wish to see included. While agreeing with you on some of the objectives which should be contained in the next Agreement, the fact that your proposal contains no new funding is a matter of considerable concern. In the lead-up to the meeting between state training ministers and Minister Nelson on 13 June in Darwin, the minister must put some new funding on the table if he is to have any credibility on these issues. Because, as well as stagnating Commonwealth funding, Minister Nelson is proposing to expand the competitive training market through the user choice mechanisms. MAIN COMMITTEE This proposal has the potential to undermine TAFE as the public provider, making it yet another successful public institution at risk of being dismantled by the market-driven ideological agenda of the Howard government. While the government refuses to acknowledge the growing body of evidence showing that Australia is not adequately planning for its current and future skill needs, Labor has instigated a Senate inquiry into the issue. Given the quality of the submissions already received by the Senate inquiry, some 95 in total, I look forward to the tabling of its report later this year. If Australia is to address skill bottlenecks and remain fully competitive in the global economy, raising the skill level of our work force is absolutely essential. But this will not be achieved if the Commonwealth government is unwilling to invest in our human capital, fund our public TAFE institutions adequately, ensure that our apprenticeship system readies young people for the current and future skill needs of our economy, and integrate vocational education and training into our school system. On all four of these tests, this budget has failed to make the necessary reforms and investment. There is a very clear choice facing Australia. The choice is to continue with this government’s ideological obsession, undermine TAFE and public institutions, undermine wages and conditions and have a fight over further deregulation of the labour market or invest in our human resources and in skilling up the nation and become a high-wage, high-skill economy. The choice is up to Australia, and I believe that this government is failing that test. The broad theme of this budget is on security. However, when it comes to providing the financial security that only a job can bring, this budget contains no strategies, no reforms and no new investment. This budget, like its seven predecessors, contains no steadfast commitment to full employment. It contains only predictions of a deteriorating employment outlook. Already 2½ million Australians are not getting the social and financial security that comes with having enough work. This budget only makes their predicament worse by increasing the cost of basic social services such as a visit to the family doctor and a university education. At the same time that this government is a record taxer, it is also arguing that Australians should pay more for basic needs such as health and education. This budget prioritises $700 million in superannuation tax cuts for the wealthy and $500 million in tax cuts for big business. At the same time, it is doing nothing to invest in expanding support for the Job Network or in the apprenticeship and training system. The contrast, I think, exposes the true agenda of the Howard government. The Treasurer said, quite rightly, on budget night and since that the budget is about priorities. This is a budget that exposes once again that the Howard government governs for the few rather than for the many. That is why Labor’s plan to save Medicare and reform higher education to encourage participation has been so well received. I believe that a strong economy is one which combines economic strength and raw data with social justice and with spreading the benefits of economic growth. This budget fails to deliver on that objective, and one group that will be left to suffer is the unemployed and their families. Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (7.24 p.m.)-I rise tonight to speak to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004. In doing so, I give praise to the measures announced in the federal budget that will benefit the people not only of the Petrie electorate but also of Australia. The Petrie electorate has an enrolled population of over 90,000 people. It stretches from Deception Bay in MAIN COMMITTEE the north to Everton Park, Stafford and Kedron in the south. At the moment, there are about 125,000 people living in the Petrie electorate, according to the 2001 census. The electorate includes a number of outer Brisbane northern suburbs that have experienced incredible residential growth over the last five to 10 years. Some of the northern suburbs such as Mango Hill and Griffin are part of a corridor that extends from Brisbane through to Caboolture, and it has been dubbed the third fastest growing residential area in Australia. Many of the residents living in this part of the world took advantage of the first home owners grant, which was introduced by the federal government in 2000, and they rely very heavily on a combination of low interest rates and a strong economy to ensure their money extends. Many of these people and others like them across other parts of the electorate have also benefited from the income tax announcements in this year’s federal budget. This budget provides benefits for all Australians, including families, students, senior Australians and the disabled, but among the biggest winners are low-income earners. Over 10,500 low-income households across the Petrie electorate, according to the 2001 census, will benefit from a rise in the low income tax offset to $235-a rise of $85 a year-and an increase in tax thresholds. An office worker, for example, earning $22,000 a year can expect a reduction in tax of $329 a year-that is a 10 per cent reduction in their tax liability whereas a senior Australian couple eligible for a senior Australian tax offset will pay no income tax up to $33,612, which is an increase from $32,612. The increases in income tax thresholds and in the low-income tax offset will benefit close to 50,000 households in the Petrie electorate, from young families to retirees. It will mean that Australian taxpayers can keep a higher proportion of their earnings after tax. For example, a tradesperson on $55,000 a year will save $448 in income tax. These tax cuts effectively mean lower taxes for around nine million Australians, amounting to around $10.7 billion over four years. The announcement of these tax cuts, along with spending for defence and for drought relief, is certainly an achievement for this government. In the US, they want to cut taxes by up to $726 billion. But while we are operating in a surplus, the US is operating in a deficit. The real difference between our two countries is that we can afford our tax cuts. This budget is the sixth budget out of eight budgets in surplus. In 2003-04, that equates to a $2.2 billion surplus. What that means is that more can be delivered to more Australians without running a deficit. And we all remember those under the previous administration. We remember how the word ‘debt’ was a feature of many of those budgets. We remember high interest rates and exorbitant monthly mortgage payments, and we remember low investment and business sentiment and high unemployment. A strong economy with consistent growth rates, low inflation and low unemployment rates equates to low interest rates and even lower mortgage repayments. A family with a $100,000 mortgage is now saving $329 a month more than they were in 1995 when interest rates were at 10.5 per cent when Labor was last in power. Today, Australia is one of the very few advanced countries in the world to have consistently solid growth and budget surpluses and to honour commitments to defence spending while providing tax cuts. We continue to do better than any of our OECD counterparts, where the average budget deficit for the whole of the OECD is expected to be 3½ per cent of GDP. MAIN COMMITTEE As the Treasurer noted in his budget speech, Australia has been knocked around by recent world events, including the war in Iraq, international terrorism, SARS and the global economic downturn. He goes on: We have been tested. But we are resilient. And Australia’s economy is resilient. The international body, the OECD, says Australia is ‘… notably resilient to shocks, both internal and external.’ William Pesek Jr., a columnist for Bloomberg News, described the Australian economy as ‘a role model for the world’s biggest economies’ in an article following the budget earlier this month. He said that, despite the major economies of the world struggling, in Australia we are thriving. Rather than worrying about high unemployment, low growth and stagnation, we are thinking about how we keep the good times rolling along. He states: Yes, Australia’s been a star-performer for a few years now. And, yes, some investors maybe missed out on the rally in the Aussie dollar. But more likely than not, this economy will continue to outperform most. The budget is about investing in Australia’s future. It is about investing in education, health, security and defence, and providing tax cuts to help Australian families to invest in their own future. It is about providing incentives to small business to keep the economy strong and helping small businesses to go global through a $2.5 million package-the Supplier Access to Major Projects program. It is also about the continuation of the New Apprenticeships scheme. A strong, stable economy is good for business, and good business conditions are good for consumers and for the economy. This budget is also about helping those who are in need. The budget included $135 million over four years to improve services to assist job seekers with disabilities and $25 million to assist business services that provide employment for people with disabilities. This demonstrates our commitment to supporting the business sector that provides employment outcomes for people with disabilities. Business services currently provide employment to some 17,000 Australians with moderate to severe disabilities. It is expected that over the four-year lifetime of the $135 million budget initiative, around 6,000 job seekers annually will have access to improved employment outcomes as a consequence of the move towards case based funding. It is an effective system because it will ensure that job seekers with disabilities are catered for based on their needs. It also results in an average increase in funding for business services of around 15 per cent and for open employment services of nine per cent. The commitment of $25 million for the business services that provide employment for people with disabilities is an investment that will ensure the vibrancy and sustainability of this sector. In effect, the government has delivered on these reforms to provide support for both business services and job seekers and to encourage diversity in the Australian labour market. These measures are part of an overall package of $186 million that is designed to assist both job seekers and children with special needs. The allocation of 1,250 new mainstream childcare places nationwide under the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme is very much welcomed in my electorate of Petrie. From speaking with local parents in the Petrie electorate who have children with a disability, I know how valuable the extension of this program will be for these children and their families. This injection of $25.8 million over four years is very welcomed by these families and is part of the federal government’s commitment to meeting the needs of MAIN COMMITTEE the Australian community. It gives parents the opportunity to undertake work or study, knowing that their children’s needs are being met through the extension of this program. There are other features in this budget that demonstrate this government’s commitment to providing for our future by investing in education, health and training. There is record funding of $1.5 billion over four years to enhance our higher education system, including $161 million over four years for national education priorities with a focus on teaching and nursing. In addition, there is investment in our education and training system: the budget also includes $3.6 billion over three years to develop a high-quality training system with state and territory governments. There is $917 million over five years to make health care more affordable, particularly for concession cardholders and veterans, through A Fairer Medicare package. There is also $16.4 million over four years for primary care providers to find better ways to help patients, increased defence spending of $2.1 billion over five years from 2002-03 and an additional $411 million to upgrade domestic security. These investments build on the consistently strong economic performance of the Australian economy with economic growth set for 3¼ per cent this year. Strong economic growth will not only keep our unemployment rate down but also provide opportunities for job seekers and businesses to grow and expand. This budget invests in the future of Australia; it invests in the quality of life we cherish. It gives Australians both quality of life and equality of opportunity. One of the areas of need for Australian society, particularly given that we are an ageing population, is in the provision of public health. The Queensland government has again rejected the latest health care agreement from the federal government as contained in this budget. There is a $42 billion federal commitment to the Commonwealth health care agreements for 2003-08 with the states and territories, and that would assist the Queensland government to reduce those long hospital waiting lists. This offer included an extra $10 billion over the current agreement, making a total of $42 billion, an increase of 17 per cent over the next five years. All that the federal government asked was for the states to agree to match the growth in federal funding of 17 per cent against their own funding. What is wrong with that? But the Queensland Premier has rejected this. As such, he has rejected an additional $851 million in funding that is available now for patients in public hospitals in Queensland. If he signs the agreement but fails to match the required 17 per cent growth, he will still deliver to Queensland’s public hospitals 96 per cent of the $8 billion plus, which is an increase of over $2.1 billion under the current arrangements of this five-year agreement. But he does not even appear to be willing to undertake this. According to the Commonwealth Grants Commission, Queensland is one of the first states to receive a financial windfall from the GST. It is expected that over the next five years-the period of the health care agreement that Premier Beattie rejected for Queensland’s public hospitals-Queensland will receive close to $1 billion more from the GST than it would have received under the pre-GST revenue arrangements. This is a sizeable chunk of funding that could be spent on a whole range of areas of need in Queensland, including the ever growing hospital waiting lists. Today, the Queensland budget was handed down. Among the announcements was a tirade against the federal government over our generous offer of $8 billion for public hospitals over MAIN COMMITTEE five years. The Queensland government response was a $300 million increase, with over 50 per cent of that amount going in wages to nurses and medical personnel. I do not lament the wage increases for the fabulous jobs being done by Queensland nurses and medical staff, but I do lament the limited commitment of the Queensland government to the sick and needy in the state and the paltry sum they champion when an even greater fund is available by signing the Commonwealth-state health agreement. There are still some sectors of Australian society that are not aware that all of the GST is returned to the states and territories. Many people are amazed when I tell them that Queensland, for example, will receive over $6 billion in the coming financial year from the GST. Ironically, most people in Queensland are amazed that so much money comes from the federal government, particularly when the Queensland budget has a tendency to be in deficit rather than surplus. From 2000-01 to 2003-04, the Queensland government have received a $1,573 million increase in untied funding from the federal government. That works out at an average increase of 10.3 per cent. The Queensland government are certainly better off under the GST and they know it. Around 18 months ago, the Queensland Premier was advocating increases in funding for public schools. When the media asked him where he was going to get the additional funds from, he replied: I’m going to get the money from the additional GST revenue that will flow to Queensland under the new taxation arrangement. Queensland values the GST and the benefits it gives to them to fund a range of measures. In today’s Queensland budget, the GST along with Commonwealth funding comprises almost 50 per cent of state government revenue. But, despite solid increases in the amount of Commonwealth funding that Queensland currently receives and will continue to receive, Queensland has a sad and sorry tale when it comes to the state of the budget. In February this year, the Queensland government released their mid-year fiscal and economic review. The prediction was for a budget deficit of $741 million-the third consecutive deficit despite record increases in stamp duty, employment and economic growth. Today, that deficit was revised to $350 million, but a deficit is a deficit and the Beattie government seem only capable of returning deficits despite forecasting surpluses. In the area of finance, the Beattie government make a mockery of their ‘smart state’ agenda. On 25 May, the Queensland Treasurer issued a press statement saying that Queensland was in a strong economic and financial position. He even had the backing of Moody’s about Queensland’s credit rating. Back in January this year, the Australian reported on the poor economic performance of the Queensland government according to Standard and Poors. Earlier this week, it was estimated by the Property Council that the Queensland government would receive a windfall in stamp duty of $1.2 billion. Indeed, state taxation revenue is at $5.7 billion for 2003-04, and it represents some 26 per cent of their revenue. Couple that, just for a start, with the $6 billion in GST revenue that Peter Beattie is receiving in the 200304 financial year. So how do the Queensland government reward the good people of Queensland? One of the wonderful measures that they announced today is that they would increase the threshold on land tax payments but, at the same time, they would increase the minimum amount of land tax payable by 150 per cent. So while they appear to provide a sweetener, they MAIN COMMITTEE are actually hitting people harder by increasing the minimum tax payable from $100 to $350. That is hardly what I would call a tax cut. But do not take my word for it. The Beattie government’s third budget and third deficit in a row are a disappointment. The Queensland Teachers Union today called it a ‘dud’ budget. Queensland farmers have declared that they are the losers in this campaign and even the Australian Medical Association of Queensland finds fault with the Queensland government. The AMAQ president said on the AAP news wire today that the budget failed to tackle elective waiting lists. She said: We have 11,000 Queenslanders on overdue elective surgery waiting lists and we need to see specific allocation to address this problem. What a shame that Peter Beattie did not sign up to the Commonwealth-state health agreement. If he had, he would be doing something now about those waiting lists. Instead, he does nothing. The people of Queensland deserve the same financial commitment and integrity that the federal government makes to all Australians. Queenslanders deserve a future of robust growth and the delivery of services where they are most needed. I applaud the federal government and the diversity of the 2003-04 federal budget that delivers to this nation in every community-from low-income earners, families, students and veterans to the disabled and the elderly. The federal budget is about protecting, securing and building Australia’s future. It is about investing in Australia’s future so that we, in turn, can invest in our own future with the surety and knowledge of good economic conditions and, particularly, good national security. I therefore support this bill. 2003-2004. Macquarie Bank made an after-tax profit of around $300 million last financial year. It is an organisation backed by around $33 billion worth of assets. Tonight, I want to talk about one of the greatest acts of corporate bastardry I have seen in my seven years in this place. It is an act which has left the small to medium sized businesses in my electorate out of pocket by around $8 million. Of course, many jobs associated with those businesses are now at risk. The Nardell Colliery in my electorate began operations in March 2001, and its proponents painted a very rosy picture of its future. However, less than two years after it commenced production it was placed into receivership. The closure of the mine was sudden and contrary to market expectations. Clearly, the major equity and debt holder, Macquarie Bank, experienced losses in its investment in the mine. The security that Macquarie Bank holds over Nardell’s assets, however, will help Macquarie Bank recoup most of its investment. Unfortunately, because of the security that Macquarie Bank holds, the unsecured creditors-those small and medium sized businesses in my electorate-will be the big losers. Many aspects of the manner in which Nardell was placed into administration and receivership are of great concern to me. Firstly, they include the positive statements on Nardell’s web site about Nardell and the going concern assumption. Comments made on Nardell’s web site and formal statements made in Nardell’s annual report would lead any reader of those reports-including unsecured creditors, of course-to believe that Nardell had a promising future and that shortand long-term debts would be honoured. Key questions to be asked are: what changed, and when did directors become aware that no further funding would be forthcoming from Macquarie Bank or its subsidiary vehicles? My MAIN COMMITTEE",153,Appropriation Bill No 1 2003 2004
229,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (7.42 P.m.),"I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1)view is that Macquarie Bank nominated directors, who wholly controlled Nardell Holdings, continued to accrue debts after they knew Macquarie Bank was proposing to pull the funding plug on the coalmine. Unsecured creditors, it is worth noting, grew by 142 per cent from 30 June 2002 to the balancing date. My second concern is about the debt capital arrangements and the appropriateness of their terms. Macquarie Bank, through various controlled entities, provided the bulk of the loan funds for the Nardell mine. The terms of the debts were advantageous to Macquarie Bank controlled entities, as typified by an interest rate of 23 per cent being charged on $22 million worth of secured notes. This raises the questions: what actions did the company take to secure additional debt on appropriate terms, and what would the terms have been if Nardell had secured an arms-length transaction with another lender? Further, for the financial year ended 30 June 2002, Nardell incurred interest and financing charges of $3.7 million, which represented 38 per cent of total revenue, yet the annual return was quite clear in stating that the business was ‘a going concern’. In its full financial year of operation, Nardell recorded an operating loss of $14.5 million. The result would have been very disappointing for its stakeholders, though the directors of Nardell were of the opinion that the loss was due to ‘low levels of production’. However, with an expected increase in production in the next financial year, they claimed, there were expectations of a much better financial result. Notwithstanding the early optimism of the mine, on 20 February 2003 the board of directors of Nardell Holdings advised Macquarie Bank to appoint a receiver to the Nardell Coal Corporation. The decision to close the mine appeared to surprise many relevant stakeholders, including the chairman of Nardell’s board, Mr Campbell Anderson. Mr Anderson stated at a creditors meeting on 27 February 2003 that, up until 19 February, he did not believe the appointment of an administrator had been an option. He had been as surprised as anyone that the mine was going to close. The following are salient features of the financial statements of the Nardell mine at 30 June 2002. There were total assets of approximately $44 million and total liabilities of approximately $40.4 million. The major liabilities were: interest bearing liabilities of $33.5 millionall owed to entities controlled by Macquarie Bank; accrued interest on these liabilities of $3.5 million-of course, again all owed to entities controlled by Macquarie Bank; and unsecured trade creditors of $3.3 million. The equity position totalled $4 million, and it comprised $18.4 million of equity capital provided by Nardell Holdings and the loss of $14.4 million sustained in 2002. Nardell is ultimately controlled by Macquarie Bank, which is the major equity holder and debt financier for the operation of the mine. As a controlled entity, Nardell is theoretically an extension of the ultimate holding company-that is, of course, Macquarie Bank. A review of Nardell’s web site on 9 March 2003 reveals several statements which express confidence about the future of Nardell and its operations. It is paradoxical that these positive statements remain on the web site more than two weeks after the company was placed into administration. I ask the House to consider the following quotes from the web site: ... Nardell is strategically positioned to be a reliable, low cost supplier to both the export and domestic coal markets. Current production at Nardell will be up to 1.5 Million tones per annum, with plans to increase production to five million tones per annum. Another quote is: MAIN COMMITTEE Nardell has several contracts in place with several major Asian steel mills and power utilities to purchase the Mine’s high quality semi-soft coking and thermal coal with the first major export shipment made in July 2001. And another quote is: Nardell is strategically placed to be a reliable, low cost supplier to both the export and domestic markets with contracts already in place to supply a large Asian steel mills and the nearby Macquarie Generation power stations which supply almost 22% of south-eastern Australia’s electricity needs. These are all statements on the web site which would have given unsecured creditors every confidence in their financial relation with the company. A review of formal statements made in the 2002 annual report by the directors of Nardell also present a positive view of the future of the company. I note that the directors’ report and the directors’ declaration are dated 18 September 2002, approximately five months prior to Nardell being placed under administration. I ask the House to consider the following directors’ statements. In explaining the poor performance in the first year, the directors state: As a result of the low levels of production the loss of the consolidated entity for the financial year after providing for income tax amounted to $14.457 million. At face value, the financial result would be concerning to all relevant stakeholders in the mine. However, under the heading ‘Significant changes in state affairs’, the directors state: The development of the Nardell Colliery has progressed to a stage where commercial levels of production are expected to commence during the forthcoming year. Further in the directors’ declaration, it is stated: … there are reasonable grounds to believe that Nardell Holdings Pty will be able to pay its debts as and when they become due and payable. However, five months after these statements were made, the directors advised that the company should be placed under administration. Obviously, factors which impact on the viability of an operation can change. But the directors were very clear in supporting the fact that the entity was a ‘going concern’. The Macquarie Bank’s involvement basically underlines this view. The accounting ‘going concern’ assumption was one of the key principles and assumptions relating to the preparation of financial statements. In essence, the accounting ‘going concern’ assumption is premised on the assumption that the entity is expected to be able to pay its debts as and when they fall due and continue in operation without any intention or necessity to liquidate its operations within the next 12 months. Further, according to Australian Accounting Standards policies: When preparing the financial report, an assessment must be made of the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial report must be prepared on a going concern basis unless it is intended to either liquidate the entity or to otherwise wind up its operations ... Further: In assessing whether the going concern basis is appropriate, it is necessary to consider all available information ... which is at least, but is not limited to, twelve months from the reporting date. … … … MAIN COMMITTEE ... it may be necessary to consider a wide range of factors including current and expected profitability, debt repayment schedules and potential sources of replacement financing before it can be established that the going concern basis is appropriate. In the context of the direction provided by Australian Accounting Standards, it is very interesting to read note 1 of Nardell’s financial statements. It says: The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis which the directors believe to be appropriate for the following reasons: (i) Macquarie Investment Trust IIIthat is the wholly controlled investment vehicle of the bankthe majority shareholder in Nardell Holdings Pty Limited (the company), has confirmed to the directors its continued support to Nardell in working towards the completion of development and operation of the Nardell Colliery. … … … (ii) Subsequent to year end, the $22 million convertible note facility from Macquarie Investment Trust III ... which was fully utilised at year end, was extended to a $30.2 million facility ... Macquarie Investment Trust III has no current intention to call the convertible notes held by it and issued by Nardell Holdings Pty Limited. (iii) Mine development activities have been completed to a stage where the directors have a high level of confidence that profitable mining operations are achievable in the short term. In the specific context of Australian Accounting Standard AASB 1001, the assurances provided imply a time frame of at least 12 months-that is, to 30 June 2003. Australian Auditing Standard AUS 708 Going Concern provides detailed and specific guidelines to auditors on their obligations concerning the analysis of the going concern assumption. It states: When planning and performing audit procedures and in evaluating the results thereof, the auditor should consider the appropriateness of the going concern basis underlying the preparation of the financial report. Significantly, if the auditor believes there is an uncertainty about the entity’s future viability, the auditor is required to mention this specifically in the audit report. In this case the auditor basically has two options. One, if the auditor considers that the uncertainty is adequately disclosed in the financial report, the auditor should give an unqualified opinion with an emphasis of matter-that is, further explanation to the readers of the report. Two, if the matter is not adequately disclosed, this constitutes a disagreement with management and then the auditor is required to issue a qualified report-that is, to indicate reasons for the disagreement with management. The auditors of PricewaterhouseCoopers provided a totally unqualified report, which is interesting given that Nardell had recorded a loss of $14.4 million. Because of the financial ramifications of the liquidation, auditors are typically very careful in accumulating evidence to support their going concern judgment. By not providing a qualified report or an emphasis of matter unqualified report, presumably PricewaterhouseCoopers were of the opinion that Nardell would continue to operate for at least an additional 12 months. By clear implication they had taken the same view as the directors, but the support of Macquarie Bank warranted an unqualified opinion. However, it would be interesting to understand exactly what the auditors relied upon in providing such an unqualified opinion. MAIN COMMITTEE It is very significant that part of the funding of Nardell activities came from two sources. The first was mezzanine finance of a loan of around $10 million from Bond Street Investments, another wholly controlled subsidiary of Macquarie Bank. The interest payable was calculated on the outstanding principal at 12 per cent per annum. The loan and the interest owing are secured by a fixed and floating charge over the assets of Nardell Holdings. The second source of funding was convertible notes worth $22 million from Macquarie Investment Trust III-again, a wholly controlled entity of Macquarie. Interest is calculated on the convertible notes at 23 per cent per annum. It would have been cheaper to put the debt on Mastercard! The convertible notes and the interest owing are secured by a fixed and floating charge over the assets of Nardell and Nardell Holdings. Thirteen million in convertible notes were convertible into ordinary shares at the discretion of MITIII at any time up to 30 June 2006 at a price of 63c per share. The remaining $9 million in convertible notes were convertible into ordinary shares at the discretion of MITIII up until 30 June 2006 at a price of 44c per share. Another contentious question is: what is a fair and appropriate interest rate on the debt the Macquarie Bank controlled entities provided Nardell, given that the debt was both secured and convertible to equity? Obviously interest rates on specific loans will be a factor in general interest rates, plus a margin of risk. In normal arm’s-length transactions, competitive forces will dictate the interest rate and the terms of the loan. However, in circumstances when an entity is providing the finance to a related entity, common practice is to use an interest rate for commercial bank bills plus a risk margin of two to four per cent. In general terms, for the last few years, bank interest rates have been at around six per cent. Consequently, we would have expected the rate on the mezzanine loan and the convertible nature to have been around eight or 10 per cent and not 23 per cent. Obviously, there was a greater perceived risk, which certainly was not indicated in the 2002 annual report, with interest rates factored upwards at a rate of more than double the standard rate-that is, 23 per cent-combined with both a fixed and a floating charge that seemed to be outside normal expected boundaries. So, the debt holder has an interest rate reflecting a perceived risk beyond normal lending parameters, which is further covered by a fixed and floating charge. The questions remain: what action did the company take to ensure that additional debt on appropriate terms could be secured? What would those terms have been if another source had attempted to be secured? On a related matter, it is significant that during the financial year ending 30 June 2002, Nardell incurred interest and finance charges of $3.7 million. It is of some note that the interest expense was approximately 38 per cent of total revenue from the coal sales that Nardell earned-which was around $9.7 million-yet the annual return considers the company to be a viable and ongoing concern. There are other issues that warrant consideration, including the apparent growth in unsecured creditors leading up to the day before Nardell was placed into receivership, the domination of the board by Nardell and Macquarie Bank-it was wholly controlled-and the information used by auditors to support the unqualified opinion. These are explained in a report prepared by Professor Scott Holmes and a colleague at the University of Newcastle. I thank them for their contribution in that regard, but I do not have the time this evening to canvass all their points. The key points I want to make are the following. A few pointy heads at MacMAIN COMMITTEE quarie Bank had a great idea for all their investment trusts: invest in a coalmine. When they decided it was not going to be as profitable as they had hoped they pulled the funding pin, leaving unsecured creditors to take a bath. I wrote to ASIC in March this year, asking it to investigate the issues I have raised in the House tonight. To my great distress, ASIC wrote back to me on 22 April informing me that, having had an initial look and some discussions with the administrator, they were not prepared to pursue the matter any further. There was one paragraph in that letter that intrigued me. It was this one: ASIC conducts an assessment of every complaint we receive. In determining which matters we will select for further action, consideration is given to a range of factors including the likely regulatory effect of any available action. I will tell you what that means, Mr Deputy Speaker: within its limited resources, ASIC is more interested in pursuing the high profile cases. Unfortunately, my small to medium sized businesses in the electorate of Hunter are not high profile enough for ASIC. It is prepared to spend lord knows how much money pursuing Rene Rivkin for an act of insider trading which, at the end of the day, is claimed to have led to a profit for him of around $350-yet $8 million to $10 million is owed to my unsecured creditors by an act of absolute bastardry on behalf of the Macquarie Bank and ASIC does not see any merit in pursuing the case. The first question is: why is ASIC not interested in pursuing the case further? I want to pose some questions about Macquarie Bank’s relationship with government in this country: the strong relationship between the bank and the Commonwealth and, I do not mind saying, the strong relationship between the bank and state Labor governments in this country. I note that in the New South Wales parliament-or at least within the Labor parliamentary caucus in Macquarie Street-last week there was a caucus resolution adopted that, in future, when the New South Wales government is considering public-private partnerships with big organisations like Macquarie Bank, those considerations should include the extent to which those private partners are prepared to be good corporate citizens and to fess up to their moral obligations to the people with whom they do business. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 8.05 p.m. to 8.21 p.m. Macquarie Bank, Allan Moss, which is around $6 million plus a significant amount of shareholder options, would cover the money owed to the unsecured creditors in my electorate. Macquarie Bank should do the right thing by them. the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004 and speak to a budget that is responsible, that is right for the times and which will help Australia continue to grow. I am pleased to report that at the local level we can see the positive benefits of a number of the policies outlined by the Treasurer on budget night. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Treasurer on bringing down his eighth budget-a budget which confirms and continues the proud record of this government in achieving sound economic management while still being able to increase spending on government programs for the benefit of the community and the people MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Appropriation Bill No 1 2003 2004

231,Mr Barresi (Deakin) (8.21 P.m.),"It gives me great pleasure to rise in this debate onof Deakin. The great economic record of this government is epitomised by this budget. We have seen a continuation of low inflation, of jobs growth, of a low interest rates regime and, at the same time all this has been happening, an increase in real wages for the people out in my part of the world and of course throughout Australia. This is a proud record for any government to boast, and I am certainly very proud of the fact that I am a member of a government that has been able to bring down this most successful eighth budget. The prudent economic management that this government has become famous for stands in stark contrast to the performance of the economic management and budgets in our states which we have seen in recent times. I particularly would like to talk this evening at some length about the plight of the economy in my home state of Victoria, as evidenced by the budget which was brought down only a couple of weeks prior to ours. It is easy for us to get lost in the number of zeros and the size of the figures in the budget. However, it is when we see local organisations and our communities benefiting from the initiatives contained in it that the figures become easier to comprehend. The bringing down of the federal coalition’s eighth budget came only two weeks after the Victorian government’s budget. As a result, it does enable us to make a very useful comparison of the relative performance of the two governments as they affect the constituency that I represent in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. In stark contrast to the Victorian budget, the federal government have offered income tax cuts, which include raising the tax free threshold and the tax brackets. In the current climate, and given the global context, that is a remarkable achievement. Australia’s economy continues to be a beacon in the Asia-Pacific area. We have been able to deliver tax cuts in a time when we are experiencing a crippling drought; a season of ravaging bushfires; threats of terrorism affecting our tourism industry; and our defence forces in action not only in East Timor but also in the war on Iraq. With this backdrop, giving back to the community tax cuts in the budget was a welcome surprise to the people I represent in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Whilst Victoria can lay claim to a number of unique characteristics, such as the home of AFL football, the Melbourne Cup, the Grand Prix and the Australian Open, there is one characteristic that we are not so proud of. That is, the Victorian government currently holds the trophy of the highest taxing state, which is why the federal government’s tax cuts were so welcome. While some may criticise the $4 tax cut in the marginal rate, as being small and insignificant, it is, however, symbolic of the difference between a coalition government and the ALP opposition and the ALP governments at a state level. Such a comparison helps to underscore the excellent credentials of this government. It also helps us put into context the fiscal policies of this government, given that the states rely heavily on national economic activity. By that, of course, I am referring to the growth in GST revenue which goes directly to the states. In Victoria’s case, for this coming financial year, their GST take is estimated to be in the order of $6,649 million. Despite that revenue, we still see an underperforming state, as evidenced by their recent budget. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there are three core indications that reinforce the notion of an underperforming state government, while having a federal government delivering sound economic management. Firstly, Victoria reaps the highest gambling taxation revenue of any other state-some $1.37 billion, or 37 per cent of total gambling taxation revenue. That share of gambling tax revenue represents 16 per cent of Victoria’s great tax grab. Secondly, Victoria recorded a five per cent higher rate of taxation per capita than the MAIN COMMITTEE Australian national average. Thirdly, Victorian receipts on payroll tax are now $349 million, up 16 per cent from 1998-99; and land tax now yields $146 million, up 40 per cent from 1998-99 levels. Increased taxes, whether they be payroll, land tax or property taxes, have seen Victoria’s tax take up from 29 per cent in 1998-99. What does this mean for the mums and dads who are my core constituents in Deakin? It means that their hip pockets are slugged. The Bracks tax record does not stop there. Stamp duty on conveyancing has increased by 51 per cent, taxes on insurance have increased by 39 per cent and motor vehicle taxes have increased by $102 million since the 1998-99 period. All these hikes have had a dramatic effect on households in my electorate and on their ability to plan and manage their own financial well-being. How can it be anything else when they are also then slugged with municipal rates revenue which has now reached $1.64 billion, equating to a 23 per cent increase? At the same time we have seen inflation over this period at around 12 per cent, yet Bracks and his cohorts have increased the rates grab by nearly double the cost of living. Perhaps the most brazen of all policies in stark contrast to the tax cuts and yet delivering increased spending by this government is that the Bracks government have said that they will index all 300 fines, fees and state charges. This makes them the highest-taxing state in Australia. The bottom line for householders in Deakin is that they are going to have to come up with an extra $1,900 a year because of the Bracks’ taxes. Slugging the household leads to an effect on business confidence. We all know that this budget gives us an opportunity to compare the performance of this government, its revenue raising measures and its ability to fund programs in my core area with those of other jurisdictions. It does affect business confidence; it does affect household confidence. In the May 2003 Yellow Pages Small Business Index, we find that small and medium enterprise confidence levels in Victoria are currently below the national average in Victoria. The business confidence levels in Victoria are the second lowest in Australia. In contrast, however, the Australian economy as a whole is regarded as one of the lowest-taxing nations as a percentage of GDP in the world, according to the OECD data. I know the opposition likes to make out that we are a high-taxing government; in fact, it is a flawed analogy when you look at the fact that it needs to be seen as a percentage of GDP. The OECD ranks Australia as the sixth lowest-taxing nation by GDP. This is testimony to the work by the Treasurer in pursuit of Australia’s interests abroad in securing growth with such consistency. We in Victoria are lucky to have a government looking out for our interests, caring for our welfare, helping job seekers find employment and committed to providing adequate funds to valuable programs and infrastructure projects. It is just unfortunate that the same cannot be said for the state ALP government of Victoria. It is not providing us with the same sort of direction on these issues. The Victorian government’s apparent lack of interest in these areas means that the federal government has to step into the breach. I am pleased to see that, as part of this budget, $10.4 million has been included for the Victorian black spots project. This is a project that I know people in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne have accepted and welcomed quite warmly. We have seen various black spots programs around the place. I also join with my state and federal parliamentary colleagues in welcoming the allocation of $420 million-the residual amount that was part of the memorandum of understanding between the state and federal government-for the Scoresby Freeway. It was MAIN COMMITTEE included in this budget. I know that, in this year’s budget specifically, there was $63.3 million allocated for the 2003-04 financial year for this project. This is in stark contrast to what the state government has allocated to it. That money is in the pipeline. It is waiting on the Bracks government’s acceptance that tolls on the Scoresby are not the answer and not in the agreement. We have had a couple of debates in the last two days on the Scoresby Freeway and Roads of National Importance. We had a debate yesterday after I moved my private member’s motion. It is not so much the introduction of the tolls per se, because there are Roads of National Importance and roads around Australia that do have tolls; it is the breach of a promise and it is the breach of a contract which have angered the people in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. That is at the heart of the anger-the blatant lies that took place, the misleading statements and comments that were made not only in the lead-up to the last election but also subsequent to the last election until the announcement by the state government on 14 April. I have said on many occasions that any polling in my part of the world on issues-and the ALP can verify this-will show that roads and issues surrounding roads take up four of the top 10 places; whether it be road congestion, the Scoresby Freeway, the Eastern Freeway extension or whatever it may be. Roads make up four out of the top 10 issues. The state ALP and the federal ALP know this because, in the lead-up to the last state election and in the leadup to the last federal election, both party leaders had to concede the importance of roads in the eastern suburbs and make a commitment to funding the Scoresby Freeway. We have seen the state government renege on its promise, a memorandum of understanding-not just a promise but a contract-between state and federal governments. What we have not seen, though, is whether or not the federal ALP will also renege on that same commitment. We have not heard, but there have been indications. Two of the ALP backbench members from Victoria spoke yesterday on my private member’s motion and certainly, by their utterances, there was every indication that the federal ALP was totally in step with the state Labor government on the introduction of tolls. The Bracks government can use whatever excuse they like. It does not matter what the excuse is; the end result is that tolls will be introduced. It is a breach of promise. It is a breach of a contract between a state and a federal government and certainly the people of the east feel hoodwinked and angry about it. They will show that anger next Tuesday night at a public meeting-which I have already spoken about in this House-in my part of the world: in Ringwood. One of the areas in which it is somewhat easier to see the benefits of the government’s investment-and which has been identified in this budget, I am pleased to say-is children’s welfare. Much has been said about this vital social policy area in recent weeks but I fear that the interest in it is transitory. There was certainly a lot of interest in the issue of child welfare, by the media and sections of the community, in light of the debate and controversy in respect of the Governor General. Child abuse is an abhorrent act and one that must be fought by governments of any persuasion. But I challenge the media and I challenge the ALP-and all those who stood up and argued about the importance of child abuse-to maintain that interest and that rage. One of the biggest armouries a community can have is a group of organisations and institutions that is committed to fight the insidious abuse that is taking place. It is a fight that MAIN COMMITTEE can be won by improving education, looking at the impact that child abuse can have on the development of children, and recognising possible cases of abuse. A couple of weeks ago-subsequent to the introduction of the budget-I was privileged to be able to congratulate a group in my electorate on securing federal funding for the work they do. Australians Against Child Abuse, which is located about 100 metres from my electorate office, is a community organisation committed to raising awareness of child abuse. From the National Agenda for Early Childhood, the Australians Against Child Abuse will receive $1 million over the next two years to roll out the Every Child is Important program across Australia. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the government and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, for their support of this program and for signalling their ongoing support for the fight against child abuse. The program is designed to recognise the importance of children’s experiences to their development. It acknowledges the purity and vulnerability of children and deserves our recognition. Joe Tucci, the CEO of Australians Against Child Abuse, did not have to sell the merits of the program; they spoke for themselves. This measure will lead to greater awareness of children’s rights, and the responsibilities of those who care for them. I congratulate the team at Australians Against Child Abuse on the success of the program and look forward to continuing to work with them on this important social issue. Another element to the growth of our communities, which has been addressed in this budget, is a capacity for job seekers eventually to find employment. There is a proud record of achievement in Deakin with the unemployment rate currently a touch under five per centdown from around 5.3 or 5.4 per cent 12 months earlier. Much of the hard yards have been done by the employment service providers in this area. And of course the introduction of Job Network3 will be an added bonus to the people in the eastern suburbs who are looking for employment. The budget continues a commitment to structured workplace learning which has assisted many people either to further their employment prospects or to gain additional skills or professional development. Over the last seven years I have had a keen interest in programs that enhance the transitional arrangements for young Australians moving from school to work. In fact I sit on a committee of management for one of the organisations that does such work. The Jobs Pathway Program conducted by KYM-with offices throughout the eastern suburbs-is one such program which looks at the transition to the workplace for kids who do not go on to tertiary studies. We understand that most people do not go on to tertiary studies. It has often been said that 70 per cent of young kids choose not to go on to tertiary studies. So what do we do for them? It is important that we look after the needs of these young people, that we look after their transitional arrangements, and that we help them to find employment and further their skills. The commitment in this budget underpins the government’s view that no matter what your goal is in life-whether it is to go to university, into a trade or straight to work-we respect your choice and we will support you as much as we can. The announcement of the incorporation of the Enterprise and Career Education Foundation and its becoming part of the Department of Education, Science and Training augurs well for the provision of high-quality employment services to the people in the east-in particular, as I said, if young people decide to take the challenging path from school to work. I fully expect MAIN COMMITTEE that the $13.8 million for the Structured Workplace Learning Program will provide much needed assistance to Deakin students who make this life choice. Regrettably, however, this increase in funding from the federal government for transitional programs is not matched by the state’s efforts for employment growth. I am sad to say that MEGT in Ringwood, located in my electorate-a local employment service provider which helped around 10,000 people gain employment-has had to close its program because the scheme was sacked by the state minister for employment, who provided no justification for the cut in funding. This highlights once again the difference between the two governments: one is a government that can deliver programs, can increase the spending on programs, and yet can also deliver tax cuts; the other is a government that inherited a surplus, cannot deliver on programs, cuts vital programs-such as those run by MEGT, which has helped 10,000 people-and, at the same time, increases over 300 taxes. I congratulate the Treasurer and the government on their eighth budget and on a great record of achievement for the people in the electorate of Deakin and in Australia. out exactly where I am. As far as I know, I am in room 2R3, in the Main Committee of the parliament of Australia. to the member for Deakin for the whole 20 minutes, apart from a couple of digressions, we might as well have been in the parliament of Victoria, because it was the state government budget that was discussed here. What was discussed were the appropriations of state governments, not this bill that I see before me now: Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004 of the federal government of Australia. We should be talking about Commonwealth appropriations not only for general government departments but also for our own parliamentary departments. I would think that would be of some interest to all Australians, including the constituents I have in Blaxland and the constituents the member for Deakin has in his electorate. I would think it would be more pertinent, in coming to deal with these Commonwealth appropriations, that members actually made speeches about Commonwealth matters rather than state government programs. But when pinching myself and recognising that we are in the Main Committee-and I have had some substantiation from the member for Kooyong-that we are in Canberra and that we are supposed to be here, with the Commonwealth crest in front of us, speaking about these federal government appropriations, I start to wonder. When you combine the member for Deakin’s speech with the series of questions we have had this week that elicited answers from the minister for transport and aviation, I wonder who is who in this zoo. If you add to that the answers from the Treasurer earlier this week, you would think: what have they been elected to? Do they actually understand that a Commonwealth parliament is responsible for Commonwealth matters? I thought the Treasurer earlier this week had been transformed into the state Treasurer of Victoria, but obviously there is one possible explanation: the written orders going out at the start of the week or at the start of the two-week sitting. The orders are going out to all good Liberal members, telling them what the lines for the week are, what the key things are that they have to say-those things that Mark Textor, their essential tool of government, their MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Appropriation Bill No 1 2003 2004

234,Mr Hatton,"I really do not think I am in the Victorian parliament. Yet, having listenedopinion assayer, has said are the core things they should be pumping out. In speech after speech, you can tell that the running notes they have been given are being pumped out. I was in the past privileged-very privileged, I suppose-to be the recipient of those notes to Liberal members. It went on for some considerable period of time. In fact I was very privileged to be emailed, sitting week after sitting week, what all of their plans were for those particular sitting weeks. I could see a pattern of concentration not on federal appropriations as we are dealing with here but on state matters. We know that in 1996 the then opposition campaigned not on the federal economy and federal matters but on state issues and council issues. There was no difference between them and the existing Labor government on the core issues of the day. The campaign had an American Republican focus on soft social issues and on matters other than those that are their responsibility. I can see them coming into campaigning mode again. This week we have had them campaigning on the basis of the fact that they are not state Labor governments. They were not elected to be. The Liberals are not in state government anywhere in Australia. We know what their record has been in those various jurisdictions. We know that is the reason that there are state Labor governments in all of those jurisdictions. But the appropriations for this House and the responsibilities of a federal government are not to simply campaign on the basis of state issues. The government had to deal with appropriations for the five government departments that are dealt with in these bills before us, and what is covered in the Bills Digest here. About 30 per cent of appropriations are made to cover the normal business of government across most departments. We know that federal budgets are of declining significance, despite the chiming in from the member for Deakin together with his compatriots about what a dreadful, terrible time the Treasurer has had. They wring their hands and say, ‘Isn’t it terrible: he’s had eight budgets to put down and it’s been such a terrible drawing experience.’ Get real. We know that the significant challenges in terms of remaking the Australian economy were undertaken and faced by Labor in government, with Paul Keating as Treasurer. Those essential things that needed to be done, as the member for Kooyong would know, were never done during the period when the member for Bennelong was Treasurer. The key changes that made Australia into a modern, sophisticated, open, diversified economy laid the foundation for the low inflation economy that we have today-an economy with the strength and the resilience to withstand the inroads that have been made through a series of crises. That stability rests on the essential foundations that we laid and which we can still readily lay claim to. Since 1996, though, this is expressed in the strangest set of budget papers I have come across from this government. If you look at their composition and what they intended to do, it is extraordinarily reactive. But there is a set of reasons for the budget to have been composed in this way. We know that there are a couple of main headers, a couple of key issues. The Prime Minister has wanted to push the question of Medicare and what should happen to it in his point of view. The government has pushed it forward in such a way as to deal with the problem it has had with the AMA, a medical association which is the most successful trade union organisation in the country. Mr Georgiou interjectingMAIN COMMITTEE have, whether they are trade unions or associations. The problem I have with the interjection from the member for Kooyong is that there is no recognition from this government that people can properly and readily form associations. Whether they form associations of workers, bosses or those people who see themselves as being independent professionals, it is actually not a criminal act to indulge in that activity in order to try to, one, protect their interests or, two, advance those interests. It is the job of governments to make determinations as to how to deal with what is put forward. It is obvious that the campaign the doctors ran over more than a year, arguing they needed a better deal from the federal government over the moneys coming back to them, has had two completely different responses. We have seen the response of the government, which is effectively to muddy the waters. The Prime Minister is trying to say it will be easier to make your Medicare payments and that, cross his heart and hope to die, he is really not against Medicare. We know on this side that the determined campaign during the Fraser years is being mirrored by the step-by-step campaign of this Prime Minister to knock bulk-billing on the head and ensure that Medicare is effectively gutted. The stark difference between the approach of the government and the opposition to this was outlined in the reply from the Leader of the Opposition on the Thursday after the Treasurer spoke. There is an enormous gulf. What was posited in our approach to Medicare upon coming to government was that Labor would save and restore bulk-billing and Medicare by putting $1.9 billion worth of funding into renovating, renewing and reinvigorating that most important Australian invention and institution. Medicare was invented by a Labor government, pulled apart by a Liberal government and put back again by a Labor government. In the process of the dismantling of Medicare by this government, we will save it and put it back together. The key determinant in the area of health at the next election will be the different approaches taken by government and opposition to this issue. Our determination in terms of the importance of that is underlined by the fact that we have allocated almost $2 billion to that task. We have done that, as we have indicated, by saying that our priorities are different to those of the government. This is no surprise, but it may come as a surprise to members of the government at times because they think it is irrelevant or not right to criticise anything they have done or not done-the expectation is that we will sign up to all that they have proposed. We have said that their priorities are wrong in relation to superannuation and superannuation tax. Their priorities have been wrong not only in terms of superannuation but also in terms of the grudging way in which a tax cut of $4 a week-which will come up later on in another bill as a specific provision of the budget-was given. We had an extraordinary statement from this Treasurer. The Treasurer said that this government will look to surpluses and attempt to just roll up the surpluses one after the other. He went on to talk about providing services as well. I thought, ‘Is this the same government which since 1996 in the National Commission of Audit has said that the only proper things for a Commonwealth government to do were benchmark and audit, not deliver any direct services?’ The report of the National Commission of Audit was a large document, but that document’s outcome was predicated on the instructions given to the people who wrote it. MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Appropriation Bill No 1 2003 2004
235,Mr Hatton,"I have not got a problem with people forming associations, Petro. I neverThat fundamental viewpoint was what was expressed in the report of the National Commission of Audit. That is why the member for Deakin was able to go into auditing and benchmarking mode with respect to the real deliverers of major services-that is, the state governments. They are major administrative units. Their whole function and purpose is directed towards service delivery. He seemed to get onto that point, except that he thought the federal government did a great deal more. They have since 1996 pared that back as much as they have been able to. We are told that the priorities of this government are to: (1) make sure there is a surplus; (2) have those surpluses continue to run on and on; and (3) give money back where possible. Count the budgets. We have had eight. How many budgets have there been up until now in which the excess or the surplus has been sliced off and some of the money has gone back to people? We have the smallest tax cuts in the history of the Commonwealth-four bucks a week-and they have been readily eaten up not because of the normal expenditures but because of the fact that this is a government of levies. While the Treasurer today in question time attacked the states in terms of their charges and the member for Deakin just attacked the states in terms of levies and charges that they impose, this is a government which has had a levy for just about everything that opens and shuts. We have had a levy of 11c a litre imposed in order to try and save the dairy industry; we have had a levy for the Iraq war; we have had a levy for Timor. It is a bit like the three by three. When is a levy not really part of the taxation system? I want to make an excursion into the state arena. When Nick Greiner was Premier of New South Wales, he brought down what was called the three by three: 3c a litre for three years. Every Liberal government in New South Wales after Nick Greiner kept that three by three and every Labor government kept it as well. It is still 3c by three years. Even though they have gone to four year campaigns and four year parliaments, they are still knocking up that as money coming to the government. It is a bit precious to argue that only state governments do that. We have instance after instance where this government has not called a tax by its right and correct name-a levy or a charge or an excise. This is a government that will not own up to the fact that it collects the GST and that the GST is a Commonwealth government tax. As a result of the uniform income tax act of 1942, the Commonwealth has levied and taken in all income taxes in Australia since 1942. It is still constitutionally possible for states to choose to impose their own taxes. I am not being threatening with this, but they have chosen not to do it when it has come to a matter of real decision. In exactly the same way as the Commonwealth takes in all income tax, it takes in all customs and excise. Since a case a few years ago in relation to the tobacco excise, the Commonwealth was forced to properly take on that role again. In exactly the same way, the GST revenues are revenues that are taken in by the Commonwealth and disbursed to the states for their own proper purposes. What we see here, though, is a government that gave four bucks a week but has no imagination, not only in terms of how it gave part of bracket creep back but also in terms of the problems it has had with over-expenditure. It bought its way into the last election; it spent $20 billion in six months to pay its way through. It had no imagination with a series of other expenditures, including what it has done in terms of the war in Iraq and the problems it has had in terms of the so-called Pacific solution-that goes to this budget and also to the last budget. We see some savings within this budget, although not in these background papers, because the expected moneys to be expended by the department of immigration have in fact been MAIN COMMITTEE pared back. It has cost less in this last year than it did in the previous one to fund the so-called Pacific solution. Part of that has been effected because people who were never supposed to come to Australia have in fact come to Australia and are now permanent residentssomething in the order of more than 300 from Nauru and other places. But you get an indication of just how much the world has changed in terms of this Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004 for the parliamentary departments. All up, there is $167 million of it. If you look at how that is to be expended, you see that there is a cut of almost $4 million for the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff; they are down $3.843 million. The Department of the Parliamentary Library is down $135,000. The Joint House Department is down by about $43,000. Yet the Senate and the House of Representatives departments have had increases. While the government denies that there has been a direct effect on Australia in terms of changed circumstances post Bali and post September 11 and also in relation to the adventure in Iraq, you can actually see, despite what the government has said, that in these appropriation bills there are specific appropriations for the changes that have occurred in this building. As I said at the start, I am pinching myself over the fact that we are in 2R3 in the parliament of Australia-here in the central part-and not in the House of Representatives itself. If you go to page 3 of the background paper provided by the Parliamentary Library-even though they have actually had their funding cut for the next year in these appropriations-what we see is that: The Government is providing additional funding of $25.5 million over four years, starting in 20032004, to upgrade physical security in Parliament House, to employ more security staff, and to enhance security-related management and the professional capacity of security staff in Parliament House. It is pointed out in this budget year that the extra amount of money will be shared equally between the two chamber departments and that the government is providing $6.8 million. What happens in the out years with regard to this? The rest of the $25½ million is to be found from savings to be made by all of the parliamentary departments. We have only five of them. If the Podger review goes through, as is intimated within these background notes, there may be savings-but they would want to be some pretty decent savings. If you take $6.8 million-that is almost $7 million-away from $25½ million, what are you left with? About $18 million worth of savings. Year on year we have had savings and cutbacks in the parliamentary departments. I do not know what job losses there will be, what paring back of services there will be or what diminution of the services to the parliament and to the people of Australia there will be from the departments we in this place depend on to do our jobs. But it is part of the pattern. There cannot be a denial of the realities we face-that is, increased security threats and the extra funds we will need to deal with them-but this is a totally penny-pinching approach to the fundamental services that this government is unable to get out of providing. (Time expired) expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Main Committee adjourned at 9.02 p.m. MAIN COMMITTEE",174,Appropriation Bill No 1 2003 2004
236,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Mossfield),"Order! The time allotted for this debate hasThe following answers to questions were circulated: Immigration: Migrant Resource Centres (Question No. 222 Amended) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 14 March 2002: (1) How many Migrant Resource Centres (MRCs) or MRC outposts are currently funded by the Government. (2) How many of these centres were first approved for funding after March 1996. (3) In respect of the new centres funded referred to in part (2), in which (a) location and (b) federal electoral division is each centre located. (4) Have any centres had their funding withdrawn since March 1996; if so, in which (a) location and (b) electoral division did each centre previously operate. (5) What specific criteria are used in assessing the need for MRCs to be established, or to remain, in particular locations. (1) The Government currently funds 30 Migrant Resource Centres and 4 Migrant Service Agencies. Four of the Migrant Resource Centres operate outposts, covering five locations. (2) Eight centres and three outposts were first approved for funding after March 1996. (3) The Department does not collect data by electorate. Using information provided on the Australian Electoral Commission’s web site, a table providing the location and relevant electorate for the centres referred to in part (2) has however, been prepared and is below. The electorate has been identified on the basis of the organisation’s postcode. The service provision catchment area may extend across electoral boundaries.

In both cases appropriate alternative services were established and service delivery in the area was not diminished. A table providing (a) location and (b) electoral division for each centre is provided in the table below. State MRC Location Electorate Funding withdrawn QLD Brisbane Brisbane 1998 Cairns Leichhardt 1998 (5) The establishment of a new MRC/MSA or the relocation of an existing MRC/MSA would be considered on a case by case basis. Factors that would be taken into consideration include: an identified need for settlement services not currently available in the relevant area; significant changes in the locations where new arrivals are settling; a shift in settlement patterns by existing migrant",176,Appropriation Bill No 1 2003 2004
237,Mr Hardgrave,"The amended answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:communities. Data from the ABS Census, community feedback and information from the Department’s Settlement Database are also relevant sources of information in this process. In the course of assessing the annual budget bids by MRCs/MSAs, the Department considers a number of criteria, including: changing demographics in relation to catchment areas of each MRC/MSA; and identified settlement needs. Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 977) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 14 October 2002: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 607 (Hansard, 23 September 2002, page 6799), who advised him in his answer. (2) Further to the answer to part (7) of question No. 607, when will Modes 6A and 8 be incorporated as part of the modes at Sydney Airport. (3) Is he being advised that the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) is all but ticked off in terms of substantial implementation of the Plan. (4) Is it still the best advice of Airservices Australia that the LTOP is substantially implemented even though he has repeatedly advised me that the aircraft movement target of 17% of aircraft movements to the north has never once been reached since the LTOP was first introduced. (5) Who is responsible for advising him that the LTOP is substantially implemented. (6) Since aircraft movements to the north of Sydney Airport have been consistently well above the LTOP target of 17% of all aircraft movements to the north of the airport, is the advice of Airservices Australia that the LTOP is substantial implemented, incorrect untrue; if not, why not. (7) Does the LTOP have a project plan; if so, will he provide the Sydney Airport Community Forum (SACF) with a copy of the plan; if not, why not. (8) Will he draw to the attention of the Chair of the SACF my repeated motions moved during my four years as a member of SACF, calling for, inter alia, a project plan and project schedule for the forward projection estimate of the full implementation and date of completion of the LTOP; if so, when will he do this; if not, why not. (9) On what date will the LTOP target of 17% of aircraft movements to the north be reached. (10) When can he say the LTOP will be fully implemented; if not, why not. (11) When will Mode 6A become operational. (12) When will Mode8 become operational. (13) What impact will the Trident and High and Wide systems have on the ability of Airservices Australia to reach the LTOP target of 17% movements to the north. (14) What impact has the Precision Runway Monitor system had on the ability of Airservices Australia to fully achieve the LTOP targets of aircraft movements to the north, south, east and west. (15) Has the LTOP target of 17% movements to the north of Sydney Airport never once been met. (1) Advice for answers to Parliamentary Questions is provided by officers within the Minister’s Portfolio of Transport and Regional Services. (2) Airservices Australia has advised that Mode8 was made available for operational use during 2000. In practice, Mode8 did not deliver any additional benefits over mode 7, which has a similar opera-",177,Questions On Notice
238,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:tional configuration. Since Mode8 is inherently more complicated with additional safety risks to be mitigated during its operation, and because it does not provide any benefits over Mode7 operations, it has not been used. The development, implementation and subsequent safety concerns for Mode8 were discussed extensively at the LTOP Implementation and Monitoring Committee and SACF. Mode 6A will not be made available for use because of safety and environmental concerns identified in the development safety case for this mode. The Mode 6A safety case development and identified risks have been fully considered and discussed by the LTOP Implementation and Monitoring Committee and the SACF. (3) The Minister for Transport and Regional Development issued a Direction to Airservices Australia on 30 July 1997 on the implementation of the Sydney Long Term Operating Plan which comprised of 31 recommendations. All but two of those recommendations have now been implemented, being the Trident and High and Wide flight paths, under the guidance of the LTOP Implementation and Monitoring Committee and the SACF. (4) See answer to question 3. (5) See answer to question 1. (6) Since all but two of the Recommendations from the 1997 Direction to Airservices Australia on LTOP have been implemented, it is correct to say that the LTOP is substantially implemented. (7) A plan which records implementation progress against each of the 31 LTOP recommendations has been developed by the Implementation and Monitoring Committee and circulated to members of SACF on a number of occasions. (8) See answer to question 7. (9) and (10) These matters have been dealt with in responses to previous questions. (11) See answer to question 2. (12) See answer to question 2. (13) None. SACF has agreed to the Implementation and Monitoring Committee’s recommendation that the High and Wide concept should not proceed. The IMC report on High and Wide also indicates that the Trident concept is, under current technology, unfeasible. (14) None. The Precision Runway Monitor is a tool for use during poor weather conditions during peak traffic periods and has no impact on the runway mode selected. (15) The LTOP target of 17% movements to the north of Sydney Airport has not been met, however it should be noted that there has been a significant reduction in use of movements to the north since the implementation of LTOP. For example, in 1994/95 after the introduction of parallel runway use, 47% of movements were to the north and in 2002 they were 27.09%. Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Question No. 1068) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 24 October 2002: (1) How many vessels were on the Australian shipping register in each of the past ten years. (2) How many of the vessels removed from the Australian shipping register have subsequently been issued with a permit to return to the Australian coastal trade. (3) Does the use of Flag of Convenience shipping on the Australian coast increase the risk of a maritime security breach; if so, what measures has he taken since 11 September 2001 to mitigate that risk. (1) The Australian Register of Ships, maintained by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, records: Year Number of vessels 2002 8,888 2001 8,735 2000 8,576 1999 8,413 1998 8,246 1997 8,025 1996 7,844 1995 7,632 1994 7,386 1993 7,328 (2) It is difficult to ascertain which vessels that have left the Australian Register of Ships in the last 10 years have subsequently been issued with a coasting trade permit, as vessels which leave the Australian register commonly undergo a change of name when sold overseas, and may undergo a series of name changes if the vessel is re-sold. (3) The Government is committed to ensuring that the maritime sector functions in the most secure way possible. Ships are required to meet international safety and marine protection standards and foreign crews are subject to migration and customs processes. The Department of Transport and Regional Services is working with industry and State Governments to implement the ISPS code measures in Australia, which are set to enter into force from 1 July 2004. Immigration: Visas (Question No. 1513) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 13 February 2003: (1) Did he or his Department ask the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to exercise his powers under section 33 (2)(b)(ii) of the Migration Act to establish a new type of Special Purpose Visa category for crews on vessels operating under single and continuous voyage permits: (2) In what way, if any, will this impact on the issuance of single and continuing voyage permits. (3) Will vessel operators working the coast on a continuing voyage permit issued for six months be required to exit Australian waters after the expiration of crews special purpose visas after three months, if not why not. (4) Will a new limit of three months be set for continuing voyage permits. (5) Does this decision indicate that his Department has been remiss by continuing to issue permits to create a situation that did not clearly adhere to all Australian laws, such as immigration law. (6) How does the introduction of this new category of visa ensure that coastal trading is not opened up in such a way as to remove opportunities for Australian workers as stated by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. (1) Discussions between Ministers are confidential. Discussions between officials during 2002 were aimed at clarifying the administration of the Navigation Act 1912 and the Migration Act 1958. (2) and (4) Single and continuing voyage permits will continue to be issued in accordance with the Navigation Act 1912. Continuing voyage permits will be issued for a maximum of 3 months duration.",178,Questions On Notice
239,Mr Anderson,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,180,Questions On Notice
240,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Existing six month permits will not be changed. However, new continuing voyage permits are issued for three months, with a condition that non-citizen crew hold visas for the period of the permit provided the ship leaves Australia at least once in every three month period. (5) No. (6) The introduction of the new category of visa does not affect the long standing legislative requirements that coasting trade permits may only be issued where no licensed vessel is available to carry the cargo, and the issue of a permit is in the public interest. Shipping: Bulk Carrier Safety (Question No. 1541) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 3 March 2003: Further to the answer to question No. 1180 (Hansard, 13 February 2003, page 903), how many single hulled bulk carriers worked on the Australian coastline in each of the past two years and of these, how many have been given single or continuing voyage permits to operate in Australia’s domestic trade. This information is not available, as applicants for coasting trade permits for bulk carriers are not required to provide information concerning whether the vessel has a single hull or a double hull. Shipping: Voyage Permits (Question No. 1542) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 3 March 2003: (1) Can a vessel operate under, or be issued with, more than one continuing voyage permit (CVP) at a time; if so, what circumstances and which vessels are currently operating under more than one permit. (2) Can a vessel be operating under a single voyage permit (SVP) and a CVP at the same time. (3) What is the process in place to ensure all conditions on a permit are complied with and what is the process and penalty that applies if one or more conditions is found to be breached. (4) Does the issuance of a CVP for particular ports cancel another CVP for the same ports for a vessel. (5) How many times have breaches of CVP or SVP conditions been discovered in each of the past five years and what action occurred as a consequence of each breach. (6) Does the Transport Regulation Division maintain a record of the date of voyage and cargo carried by a ship for which the Division is required to be notified within fourteen days of each sailing by a vessel as a term of its CVP. (7) Is it still the case that the Minister cannot cancel or revoke a single or continuing voyage permit if a breach of a condition of a permit is found to occur. (8) Is it still the case that the Minister cannot suspend a single or continuing voyage permit if it is alleged or suspected a breach of a condition of a permit has occurred or is occurring. (1) Yes. For example, if the applicant wishes to extend the end date for carrying coastal cargo and applies for another permit before the expiry of the current permit, or if the applicant wishes to service two different sets of ports, a vessel may have two permits current. At present no ships have more than one current continuing voyage permit. (2) Yes.",180,Questions On Notice
241,Mr Anderson,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,181,Questions On Notice
242,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Data from Statements of Cargo Actually Carried are entered into a spreadsheet together with application details. The sole condition on single voyage permits is “That the office of issue is notified, within 14 days after the sailing date, of the passengers and cargo carried by the ship named in this permit to the port(s) specified in this permit.” This is also one of a number of conditions for continuing voyage permits. Where breaches of this condition are found, the issue of further permits to the applicant concerned may be deferred until the deficiency has been made good by the return of outstanding Statements of Cargo Actually Carried. Where breaches of other conditions on continuing voyage permits are found, the permit holder is asked to provide a formal letter of explanation. Consideration is also given, from a public interest perspective, as to whether the breaches are serious enough to outweigh the needs of shippers to have their cargoes carried at the times specified. (4) No. (5) Over the last 5 years it has been common for permit holders to return late their Statements of Cargo Actually Carried, and for significant numbers of variations of cargo actually carried to be outside the plus or minus 10 per cent tolerance allowed by the permit. It would require substantial resources, which I am not prepared to make available, to scrutinise the permits that have been issued in that time. (6) Yes. (7) Yes in respect of single voyage permits. No in respect of continuing voyage permits. (8) The Navigation Act 1912 provides only that the Minister may cancel a continuing voyage permit. Immigration: Refugees (Question No. 1700) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 19 March 2003: (1) Can he provide details (dates, time, locations, with whom and content) of his dealings with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on the matter of Iraqi refugees arising from a potential conflict with Iraq and will he advise whether these meetings included discussion of the number of refugees Australia would accept from Iraq in the event of an outbreak of hostilities. (2) Can he provide details (dates, time, locations, with whom and content) of his dealings with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) on the matter of Iraqi refugees and Internally Displaced Persons arising from a conflict with Iraq. (3) Can he provide details (dates, time, locations, with whom and content) of his dealings with different UN bodies regarding Australia’s involvement in post-war reconstruction efforts in Iraq. (4) On how many occasions has he spoken in support of regime change in Iraq. (5) On how many occasions has he, or his office, had direct dealings with the Iraqi Embassy since March 2002. (6) Can he provide details of the Government’s assessment of: (a) the number of (i) nuclear weapons warheads, (ii) chemical weapons warheads and (iii) biological weapons warheads, and (b) the number of missiles including: (i) the type, and (ii) their range, in Iraq’s possession. (1) I met Mr Eric Morris, Director and Special Adviser to the High Commissioner, New York Liaison Office of UNHCR, at lunch on 3 April 2003 at the residence of the Australian Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the UN in New York. We discussed the humanitarian situation in Iraq and there was no discussion of whether and how many refugees Australia might accept from Iraq should there be mass outflows from Iraq.",181,Questions On Notice
243,Mr Downer,"The following is the response to the honourable member’s question:(2) I met Mr Kenzo Oshima, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, UNOCHA at lunch on 3 April 2003 at the residence of the Australian Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the UN in New York. We discussed the humanitarian situation in Iraq. There was no specific discussion on Iraqi refugees and Internally Displaced Persons in Iraq, other than to note that, to date, the numbers in both categories had been much lower than some commentators had predicted. (3) I discussed post-conflict arrangements in Iraq during a call on HE Mr Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the UN in his office in New York at 12 noon on 3 April 2003. I discussed Iraq’s reconstruction needs at a lunch on 3 April 2003 at the residence of the Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the UN in New York with Mr Mark Malloch-Brown, Administrator, UN Development Programme and Mr Benon Sevan, Executive Director, Office of the Iraq Programme. (4) The Government’s concern was and remains the disarmament of Iraq’s arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. Regime change was not our objective. (5) On 24 October 2002 the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires called on me at my office in Parliament House with other Arab diplomatic representatives. (6) The Government cannot provide a precise response on the details sought because Saddam Hussein’s regime failed to cooperate with the United Nations in declaring its weapons of mass destruction and failed to facilitate the work of UN inspectors. The Government has drawn its information about the status of Iraq’s WMD from publicly available sources such as UN documents and documents produced by other governments and classified intelligence sources. No source provides a precise accounting, although there is a common view that Saddam Hussein did not possess nuclear weapon warheads. A comprehensive statement of the UN’s assessments of Iraq’s chemical, biological and missile capabilities is set out in UNMOVIC’s document of 6 March 2003 Unresolved Disarmament Issues: Iraq’s Proscribed Weapons Programmes (available on www.un.org). Immigration: Migrant Resouce Centre Outposts (Question No. 1719) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 24 March 2003: (1) Does the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs have a policy detailing the circumstances in which it would be appropriate to fund Migrant Resource Centre (MRC) outposts in either urban or non-urban areas; if so, what criteria apply to the consideration of requests to establish such outposts; if not, will he consider the development of such a policy. (2) How many MRC outposts currently receive funding from the Department and, in respect of each such outpost: (a) when was it established, (b) what is the parent MRC, (c) in which federal electorate is it located, and (d) what is the geographical area that it covers. (3) Since the 2001 election, how many formal requests, if any, has the Department received for the establishment of additional MRC outposts and, in respect to each request: (a) when was it received, (b) what was the requesting MRC, (c) what was the proposed geographical area for the outpost, (d) in which federal electorate was the proposed location, and (e) what was the response to the request. (1) The Department does not have a policy detailing the circumstances under which it would be appropriate to core fund an MRC outpost. Funding approvals have been dependent upon the availability of funds in a particular year and on evidence of unmet settlement need in the area. (2) Five MRC outposts currently receive core MRC funding from the Department1. The details are provided in the table below.",182,Questions On Notice

Defence: SAS Troops (Question No. 1731) Mr Ripoll asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 24 March 2003: (1) Is it the case that SAS soldiers are a small and limited resource and that all available SAS troops are committed to the war with Iraq; if so, does the Federal Government have a strategy to increase numbers of SAS soldiers in the Australian Armed Forces. (2) What policy or planning has been put into place to ensure adequate numbers of SAS soldiers into the future. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) SAS soldiers are highly trained and possess unique skills. Consequently they are a scarce and valued resource. Not all available SAS troops are committed to the war with Iraq. (2) The Army examines and validates the size and structure of each unit at least every three years in order to ensure that it can fulfil its operational role and tasks. The SASR was reviewed in 2002. Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 1773) 27 March 2003: Has there been any change to the route taken by aircraft taking off to the South from Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport; if so, (a) what have those changes been, and (b) what has been the reason for those changes. Yes. Airservices Australia has advised that (a) and (b) There have been a number of minor modifications to the route taken by aircraft departing to the south. The first was in December 1998 when a new DVOR (navigation aid) was installed and commissioned. The new positioning of this navigation aid moved the southerly departure flight paths closer to the coast. To rectify this, the DEENA Standard Instrument Departure (SID) was introduced in June 2000 which moved the flight track back to a position similar to that which existed prior to the new navigation aid being commissioned. In April 2001, a change was made so that those aircraft departing the main runway and tracking via Wollongong would turn out to sea at 13.3 nautical miles rather than at 14.9 nautical miles. These modifications were undertaken in consultation with the community and industry through the Long Term Operating Plan Implementation and Monitoring Committee. The DEENA SID was introduced to assist in reducing aircraft noise over the Kurnell/Cronulla/Bundeena area.

247,Mr Vaile,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows :(1) The first round of negotiations with the United States on a free trade agreement was held in Canberra from 17 – 21 March 2003 and covered a wide range of issues across 17 separate negotiating groups. This included a group dealing with agriculture and quarantine. The focus of the discussions was on laying the groundwork for the negotiations, defining questions of scope and clarifying framework issues. The United States and Australia agree that the science-based nature of quarantine is not an issue for negotiation in an FTA. In the FTA, both sides will reinforce and reiterate their commitment to a science-based approach to quarantine supported by the WTO SPS Agreement. There was no discussion on quarantine and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) issues during the second round of FTA negotiations held in Hawaii from 19-23 May 2003. (2) Australia and the United States regularly have discussions on a range of agricultural issues relevant to our bilateral relationship, of which technical market access issues are routinely a part. Following a meeting of senior officials to discuss agriculture in July 2002, the US and Australia agreed to develop an improved, closer working relationship on SPS issues by instituting a framework for regular meetings. The purpose of these meetings is to exchange information about our respective SPS regimes and processes and also provide progress reports on each others’ specific market access requests. These discussions began in mid-2002 and are part of an ongoing process outside the FTA negotiations. (3) In these discussions, Australia and the United States regularly raise technical issues related to access to each other’s markets for a range of plant and animal products. (4) No changes were made to Australia’s quarantine system during this period. Australia’s quarantine system is transparent and science-based and in line with the rules of the WTO SPS Agreement. Neither Australia nor the US intends to change its quarantine system as a result of the FTA discussions. (5) We agreed to hold regular consultations on process matters. See the answer to question (2). (6) There has been no agreement to change Australia’s quarantine system as a result of US concerns.
