Certainly it has been an amazing result for the Bracks led Labor opposition, although I am hoping it will soon be the Bracks led Labor government. 1 have to admit, as I have said privately and I will now say publicly, that l was shocked by the size of the swing to Labor. It certainly caught by surprise a range of people on my side of politics, and I think also on the other side. The actual nature of that swing raises some very interesting issues in terms of the future of politics in Victoria. Labor, for the first time since the mid-50s, is actually in a situation where it is extremely strong in regional and rural areas. In fact, more seats are now held by Labor members of parliament than by coalition members of parliament. In those circumstances; we look at seats like Ripon, which was once held-although with different boundaries-by the Premier, Henry Bolte, in the sixties. friend and colleague across the way there--who has gone, as he said the other day, from having a range of four or five coalition state colleagues in the areaOpposition member inteljectingcolleagues to a situation where he is now half a tank of petrol away from a friend. As I said, it must be a very large tank of petrol. Mr Ronaldson interjectingmember for Ballarat is a man of quite consummate skill in these matters, and I am sure he will be successful at doing so. When we look also at areas in relation to country such as Gippsland East, Gippsland West and Mildura, we see that Independents who were there have held on. In fact, a new Independent was elected in Gippsland East, beating David Treasure, who was-as I understand it-known locally as 'hidden Treasure' and ended up last Saturday week as being 'buried Treasure'. What it does show is a real crisis for the coalition in regional Australia, because it shows that, in fact, there is a range of problems there with respect to their base vote and the capacity for that base vote to be maintained, partiCUlarly in a time of goverrunent. The Premier and the Premier's attitude and behaviour certainly also warrant comment. Certainly he was seen as being an extremely strong leader.

(Time expired) Murray Region Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage)-There is unfinished federation business along the Murray River. In that region we have the great Murray, with the state border running along the high bank of the south side, so the river itself, from colonial days, has been designated the jurisdiction of New South Wales. But it is a problem for all of us living along the Murray, and particularly in my electorate-named Murray-where we have an incredible difficulty with the lack of state consistency in regulations that apply along that region. In 1979, 20 years ago, there was a border anomalies committee set up by both state governments to try to address some of these issues. Twenty years later, we still have major difficulties. Last Friday we had a seminar'Meeting the Challenges of the Border'-in Albury, and again the list of problems was long. Let me suggest how difficult it is for someone who goes boating. With the high water mark on the south bank being the New South Wales border, there is a problem when a lake or a dam has been formed. What has been decided at this stage is that Lake Mulwala is to become the jurisdiction of New South Wales in terms of boating regulations and laws; and Lake Hume is to have split jurisdiction-north of the Bethanga Bridge will be New South Wales jurisdiction, south of the Bethanga Bridge becomes Victoria jurisdiction. As one can imagine, this is a huge problem when boaters and young families get into a boat, thinking they have the right fishing licences, and thinking they know about the speed limits and the sort of fire prevention equipment that needs to be carried in the boat for one state, and then they magically end up in the jurisdiction of another. That is one small example, but the list goes on and on. We have towns all along the Murray: twin towns like Cobram and Barooga, Echuca and Moama, Barham and Koondrook, Albury and Wodonga. Long ago the communities worked out that, although separated by a border and river, they share the same community of interest. People are working together to develop their tourism and their businesses, and their families are spread on both sides of the border, very much like the pre-colonial days when the Aboriginal tribes had no sense of the river being a barrier. While those communities are getting on with it, they face daily this incredible frustration of the split jurisdictions. Imagine, for example, you are the Mildura or the Cobram hospitals and a significant number of your accident and emergency patients are coming from the other side of the border, from New South Wales, from the other side of your community, but you do not get a transfer of funds to the Victorian side, to the hospital. That is a huge bite out of your budget and it means that year after year you are caught short because, while you very willingly want to have your hospital open to the community, you just do not have the funding from both sides of the country flowing across to where the services are being delivered. It gets sadder. We have, for example, very recently a case where palliative care needed to be delivered to a person who was dying right on the New South Wales border. These anomalies must be fixed to improve the quality of life for the people who reside in our great part of the world. (Time expired) Melbourne Expo there will be a most important event that I would like to alert members to, and that is an expo",140,Representatives Main Committee
369,Mr Sercombe (Maribyrnong),"On 13 October in the Great Hall of this Parliament House10978 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 showcasing the economic strengths of the western suburbs of Melbourne to the parliament and the strengths of the region to decision makers here in Canberra. The expo is being organised by the Western Melbourne Regional Economic Development Organisation and involves the participation of a large number of companies, some very large ones, including Toyoto, Orica, Tenix, AGL and the Docklands Authority. I think that will be a most useful day in showcasing the strengths of the part of Melbourne that I both live in and represent. It is part of Melbourne with over half a million people, growing at the rate of 20 per cent over the next 10 years. It is a region with very substantial economic strengths. It is a place that businesses ought to look at in terms of investment. It has an excellent transport infrastructure primarily as a consequence of former Labor government decisions. Those transport links and that transport infrastructure provide easy access from the region to the Port of Melbourne which handles something like $5.4 billion of trade each year, more than the combined totals of Brisbane, FremantIe and Adelaide. And it has easy access to Melbourne airport which handles a quarter of Australian airfreight exports and a third of Australian airfreight imports. The west of Melbourne also has 40 per cent of Melboume's available industrial land. It has a skilled local work force and outstanding educational and training facilities centred very much on the Victorian University of Technology with some 50,000 students. So it is an area, I believe, which business could well look at in terms of making investment decisions in a most supportive environment from the point of view of the local community. This event on 13 October will attract significant bipartisan support, I might say. Former Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer has most graciously agreed to involve himself in the showcasing expo event and will speak at the business networking lunch as part of this event on 13 October. I urge all of my colleagues in this place to avail themselves of the opportunity to become familiar with the outstanding opportunities that the west of Melbourne provides. Commonwealth Recognition Awards for Senior Australians Committee that at very short notice agreed to act as the selection committee for the Commonwealth recognition awards for senior Australians. As honourable members would be aware, the original time frame was a very tight one and I understand that my electorate was one of the 30-odd that actually got in within the original time limit.

We picked 20 outstanding people, whom I will speak about in the parliament at a later date. I would like to particularly draw attention to the nominee to come to Canberra for the celebrations for the International Year of Older Persons. The person in question is Bert Bent. Bert is well beyond retirement age, although you would never know it. If you met him you would say, 'This is a bloke in his early 60s,' but he is well beyond that age. Bert is a particularly focused man. He is an active member of the Rotary Club of Bundaberg East. I doubt if Bert knew, up until the time he won this award, that he had even been nominated.

There is also a train that sits on a single track like a small monorail and the children can just pedal along quite safely. These new toys were designed by Bert Bent. In fact, he designed those after his retirement. He has since sold the rights to a company and the product is going very well. As I said, Bert is also an active member of the Rotary Club of Bundaberg East, and he was the one who supervised the rebuilding of Bert Hinkler's house when we brought it back from Southampton. In addition to that, he supervised the building of Lake Ellen, which is one of the lakes where children can float toy boats and all that sort of thing.

But, sadly, whilst I reassured the community that the government was acting appropriately, I now know that we knew all along that black elements in the Indonesian military were a planning modern genocide. Our intelligence networks had assembled briefings on the issues; our specialists and analysts had worked through the matter only to have the information wasted due to political ineptitude. Not until after the ballot when the atrocities occurred did the government act, even though they knew the genocide was going to happen. But the government's ineptitude gets worse. Last week, whilst representing the parliament at the Association of South East Asian Nations Interparliamentary Association conference in Manila, I was pleased to be able to meet delegates from many of our neighbouring countries. I was stunned to discover on my return that much of the diplomatic efforts to positively interact with these people were being undermined by the Prime Minister back home, who, it is reported, sees our role in the region as a deputy of the United States. Recently during question time the Prime Minister tried to refute claims of his misquoted dialogue, but the damage was already done. The incident was recorded in most Asian daily papers. The editorial of the Bangkok Post was even entitled 'ASEAN has invited Howard's bravado' and stated: It is sure to raise concerns across the region. Do you remember the time when we were not big enough or intelligent enough to back ourselves or our achievements? It is a case of back to the future. As Mr Harries, a conservative journalist, reported in last weekend's Financial Review: He is a fool. The article simply concludes: For the sake of the Australian people, John Howard should keep quiet. This is a simple truth and hard reality right before our own eyes.

Finally, we must work together with all in our region to ensure that an outcome is reached which resolves the current situation and builds on future relationships with all our neighbours. This will involve positive and active diplomatic dialogue and not the current actions of the government. In closing, I wish our troops in the region all the best and a safe and speedy return. Taiwan and East Timor Australian Ex-Prisoners of War MemorialI express my personal sorrow to the people of Taiwan for events there in the last two weeks. I think that the situation in East Timor has taken over the world news since those events. There has been an appalling loss of life with the earthquakes in Taiwan, and I am sure that I speak for all honourable members in the Main Committee today in expressing our profound sorrow to the people of Taiwan. Secondly, no-one is untouched by the events in East Timor. In conjunction with a group called the Ballarat Friends of East Timor, which is a wide collection of people I spoke about in the main chamber the other day, some 7,000 people in the region have expressed their anger, their disappointment and their wish for a positive outcome for the people of East Timor. Certainly, in 10 years I have never seen such a response to a couple of petitions we circulated. There are a large number of young men and women from my electorate who are in East Timor at the moment, which means that a large number of Ballarat families are watching the news very closely. I suspect that, in some respects, the families of troops sometimes suffer even more than the young men and women involved, as they are there and they know what is happening. The families are not there and they, for obvious security reasons, can never know exactly what is happening. They are relying on word through newspapers and television. There are families, I am sure, with a great interest in what is happening. Father Glynn Murphy, who was in Ballarat for a long time with the Catholic Diocese of Ballarat, is in East Timor, and if anyone is going to be perked up amongst our troops in East Timor, it will be those involved with Father Glynn Murphy. He is one of those terrific fellows who has the ability to lift people up and take them with him. I wish Glynn well. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to have a table incorporated in Hansard.

375,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"Order! In accordance with standing order 275A, the10982 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 1999 Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 June, on motion by Mr Anthony: That the bill be now read a second time. Amendment Bill 1999 is, in its essence, a bill to apply the principles of competitive neutrality to EFIC. The application of competitive neutrality to Commonwealth statutory authorities was commenced under the Keating government and is a policy the principle of which continues to have bipartisan support. It requires that government businesses do not have competitive advantages over their private sector competitors simply by virtue of their public ownership. Once articulated, it is a very hard principle with which to argue. Accordingly, because this bill is based on a principle which we support and which, in essence, we introduced, we will not be opposing the legislation. But we are very concerned about its timing, its impact and what appears to have been a lack of consultation in its introduction. I have to say in the beginning that this is not a measure we would have done in this way at this time, and I will express some reservations we have about its nature and potential impact. Nevertheless, as I say, it is a principle that we support, but we flag these concerns, particularly in the trade context-which I will speak about in a moment. The timing of this is a source of serious worry to the opposition. It is matter on which I wish to spend some time in addressing a few remarks. In considering any piece of legislation pertaining to trade, it is very important to look at the trade context. To do so at this time, let us look at the three Australian records with regard to trade that the Howard government has established. We have had a lot of talk about people fireproofing the Australian economy and, therefore, you always get resentment and aggravation when you point out that certain unpalatable facts stare us in the face. The three records are: the largest ever trade deficit in Australia's history-ver $10 billion in 1988; the largest ever current account deficit--over $28 billion in 1998; and the highest ever level of net foreign liabilities-the last figures were over $350 billion. In case we are complacent and think that this is in some way a minor, internal Australian matter that will right itself with the wonders of modern fiscal management, I just draw people's attention-those who are interested or concerned-to the recent report of the IMF. It was very scantily reported in Australia and, in a sense, I am pleased, because it would certainly not have had a beneficial impact. It was referred to in an article by Alan Wood in the Australian yesterday that the IMF is drawing attention to the external imbalances in about half a dozen countries, including Australia. Usually when international agencies make special references to Australia, we find great enthusiasm to analyse its significance. It is unusual in this instance that the IMF has felt obliged to make this reference, which includes Australia, and that it has been so little regarded in Australia. I think it has some portents for us and for our international economic success and standing, which should be more seriously considered. That is a speech for another day, but it is an important part of the context in which we are dealing with these changes to EFIC. The changes to EFIC are not just some book entry. They are going to impose costs on exporters at a difficult time. It is not just the broad statistics that are worrying. Some of the",145,Representatives Main Committee
376,Mr Mcmullan (Fraser) (10.00 A.m.),"The Export Finance and Insurance CorporationWednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10983 detail that underpins them does not make very pleasant reading either. Consider the markets that we sell to. Up until now, our explanation has been that the collapse in our traditional markets has had an adverse impact on our exports. There is no doubt that that must be true. Our two largest Asian trading partners-Japan and South Korea-are starting to emerge from their recession. Yet our exports to Japan remain flat and those to South Korea recently dropped by a whopping 23 per cent. I am starting to hear more and more reports about the imports coming in not just from Japan and South Korea but from Asian countries in general that are causing concern. It was the expectation that, when the Asian crisis hit, there would be surplus capacity in many of the countries of South-East Asia and North-East Asia and that that surplus capacity might lead to a lot of low priced imports into Australia. That did not happen at the time and, in retrospect, it was probably due to the collapse affecting productive capacity because the capital was not available to mobilise the production. But as people are starting to emerge and a recovery strategy based on exports is emerging, more and more industries are seeing and feeling the pressure of that import competition. I believe in an open economy. I want to see Australia remain an open economy. But we have to be a little more vigilant about some anti-dumping matters that I think are emerging on our industry and trade horizon. The concern is that, while that is happening, while that recovery is starting to emerge, our exports to Japan remain flat and those to South Korea recently dropped by a whopping 23 per cent. And if you think that is bad, I ask you to imagine how the late and unlamented Howard doctrine is likely to affect our exports to Asia. As Griffith University's Professor Nancy Viviani put it on the weekend, John Howard has taken Australian foreign policy back to the 1950s. I have to say that is very grim news for our exporters. Like other members of this place, particularly those who have had the privilege of serving in an industry or trade portfolio, I spent a lot of time in Asia trying to assist Australian access to markets-individual Australian companies, Australian industries in particular and the Australian economy in general. It is not an easy task, but we have got a lot of good products and a lot of willing buyers and we have done very well. But if our standing in the region were to fall, there is no doubt it would make some of that access more difficult. We are seeing early signs of that already. Another worrying trend-and it relates particularly to some aspects ofEFIC's activities-is the composition of our exports. Recently released statistics showed that our exports of manufactures fell over the past year. Not only did they fall overall, but the fall was greatest in elaborately transformed manufactures, exports of which dropped by five per cent. This is the sector in which the growth of exports is most important to underpin our economic growth and our generation of jobs and it is exactly the sector we should be promoting if we are to realise the goal of creating a high skill, high wage Australia. Instead, under this government, exports of elaborately transformed manufactures are shrinking. This is the background against which we need to assess the EFIC Amendment Bill. As I said in opening my remarks, the bill applies the principles of competitive neutrality to EFIC, ensuring that, as a government business, it does not have a comparative advantage over its private sector competitors simply by virtue of its public ownership. This is a principle which we support. We began it. We intend to continue to support it. If it does achieve its goal of furthering the development of the private sector export insurance industry this can only be to the good. But let us not make any mistake: this bill has a short-term-and perhaps longer; let 10984 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 us hope not-potential to have an adverse impact on our exporters. With respect to EFIC's short-term business, it imposes a guarantee fee, a debt neutrality charge and tax equivalent payments. The bill does not give us a clue as to how large these additional charges will be and it is therefore very hard to estimate the effect. Their levels are left to be determined by the minister. But the general effect is clear. As the Parliamentary Library said in its analysis: While overall it is not possible at this stage to estimate the total amount of the payments to the Commonwealth proposed by the Bill, it must be assumed that they will raise EFIC's costs, and unless corresponding savings can be found, EFIC will be forced to pass on these higher costs to exporters in the form of higher charges. it is not apparent on the face of it, either in the bill, the explanatory memorandum or in anything that has been said with regard to it, what it is that will lead to corresponding savings within EFIC unless it withdraws services to exporters, because it is a very lean and efficient organisation with a very fine track record and standing for supporting Australian exporters and a long record of success. It is held in very high regard internationally and in very high regard by Australian exporters-and it should be. comments, flattering though they may be to the speaker. opposition in looking at this bill arises when we ask, 'What assurance do we have that this is not really just a way of ripping some money out of a successful Commonwealth enterprise to prop up consolidated revenue, rather than a genuine attempt through the application of competitive neutrality to foster the development of a private sector export insurance industry?' The problem is that it is a question we cannot answer. That is one question we have. There is just not enough information about the case for these particular fees, or the case for the rate at which they are going to be set because we do not know the rate at which they are going to be set, and we will scrutinise that when it comes before us. Our other concern is the timing. It is hard to see why, at a time when Australia's trade deficit is at an all-time high, the government would be introducing legislation which may increase the cost on exporters. This is all the more incredible when you consider what the explanatory memorandum says. It states proudly: There has been no formal consultation with exporters. Extraordinary! Extraordinary! If there is a group of Australians in the economic field who are doing it tough at the moment it is our exporters. Whatever criticisms I might have of the government, that is essentially not the government's fault, that is driven by international factors. There are some government elements to it such as its cutbacks to DIFF and EMDG and all those things, but that is not my point. For whatever reason, we are having a difficult time in international export markets. Here we have a change that, justified in principle as it appears to be, minor as we hope its cost impact will be--but we do not know-we are proposing to make without talking to exporters. It is an extraordinary proposition and one which makes you question the underlying motivation. If the view was that this change was going to generate a flourishing private sector export insurance industry and therefore give competitive opportunities to Australian exporters to choose between EFIC and its private sector competitors and generate some greater efficiencies,",146,Representatives Main Committee

The difficulty for theWednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10985 you would have thought someone would have spoken to the exporters about that and they would have thought it was a terrific idea. It is not as if it is hard to talk to exporters. They are a pretty well-organised bunch. There are institutes of people involved in export. There are major groups associated with Austrade that provide advice with regard to exports in particular areas. The industry associations are well placed to provide advice on behalf of the people they represent in various export oriented groups. We are concerned about process; we are concerned about lack of analysis; and we are concerned about timing and impact. But, as I made clear at the opening, we will not be opposing this legislation today. We support the principle of competitive neutrality and see no reason why it should not be applied to EFIC. However, this is not something we would have done at this time when the trade deficit is at a record high. We will be watching very closely to see the detail of the charges when they come forward after being determined by the minister, and we will then assess the impact these measures might have on Australian exporters. It is a measure that has been introduced without consultation. It is a measure that does not have a proper foundation of analysis, and the government has not established the case for the relative advantage to EFIC which these measures are designed to overcome. But you cannot challenge the principle. There should be no special competitive advantage accruing to Commonwealth authorities simply by virtue of their public ownership. They should have to succeed on their merits and in a competitive environment. We will not be opposing the legislation, but I place those markers there as signs of our apprehension about the potential consequences in the hope that the charges and other consequences will not be such as to have an adverse impact on Australian exporters at this critical time. there will be a brief intermission while a technical gentleman comes and attempts to retrieve our clock from Alice in Wonderland.

As the member for Fraser has mentioned, this bill goes to the very heart of the government's competitive neutrality policy. I listened with interest to the member for Fraser who says that, yes, they support the bill, but. The fact is, that like part of the Labor rhetoric, there is the throwback to the old golden era of socialism. They believe in the private sector but not quite yet; it is never quite the right time.

If you have a market economy, and the government has an organisation which provides a service to the private sector, you have to ensure competitive neutrality. Otherwise, you have a biased economy, one which is not effectively served. You do not have competition and a lowering of prices.

384,Mr Baird,"This is a situation where you either have a market economy or you do not.10986 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 This is the best time you could have it, because, if there is a need to encourage people into the marketplace, then it is best that there are a number of providers of insurance in the marketplace rather than one. If you only have one provider, this can lead to distortions and to lack of access to a whole range of companies. The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation provides its type of insurance cover so well; there is no question that EFIC is a very fine organisation. It has been assisting exporters into the marketplace for many years, and it is a great tribute to this parliament that we established such a corporation. It is not one that is seen in every country around the world. Having a corporation with such an excellent reputation has assisted companies to get into the marketplace when there would normally be a significant risk in being in those particular markets. The action that the government has taken will ensure a competitive market. While the member for Fraser and shadow minister for industry has made his points, he is not quite sure. Let us get on with it. Let us recognise that if you are in favour of competitive neutrality, this is what it means. The shadow minister has also made some comments about markets and the problem of the balance of payments situation. As we all know, we have just been through the incredibly difficult period of the South-East Asian crisis. Our major export markets have been affected significantly, including Japan. There are only two countries in Asia that are in a growth situation: one is China and the other is Australia. The member for Fraser talked about Japan coming out of the crisis. If you look at the statistics for Japan, it is difficult to see where they are coming out of the crisis. They are still in negative growth; they are still in a depressed situation and spending has been considerably restricted. Korea is slowly coming out of it. There are some areas that are seeing growth; tourism, for example, is growing significantly. There has been a 70 per cent growth in tourism from Korea to Australia this year so far. So some areas are improving. But the member for Fraser said that there is concern about the growing balance of payments. Certainly, when the last figures were reported, there was hardly a glitch in terms of the stock markets or the exchange rate vis-a-vis the US dollar. That is because people recognise that the current government has the fundamentals right in terms of being in a surplus situation and reducing our overall debt. They are the factors that are driving the economy and why we have such a significant growth factor. It does not mean to say that we should ignore the balance of payments issue. One of the reasons why we should be making these reforms with groups such as EFIC is to ensure the emergence, development and fostering of an effective private sector organisation. This is about ensuring that all aspects of EFIC meet the requirements of competitive neutrality so that any assistance that they get from being a government organisation is neutralised by a levy to bring them up to the level of a company in the private sector. There is no doubt that this government has taken a lot of initiatives to meet the challenges of the international marketplace. In recent times, we have seen the manufacturing bond provisions, which exempt exporters from customs duties in some situations, and the Export Market Development Grants Scheme, which has been improved and widened in terms of its context. It was widened to provide parity for tourism operators-which is the first time that has occurred-and it has assisted a lot of new operators in the marketplace. The APEC Market Integration/Industrial Collaboration program is also part of the initiatives. The extension of export access and the new Trades Start programs have been significant and, of course, the announcements of the Ralph report and its new initiatives will provide further inducements and encouragement to small operators and small exporters. They can see the prospect of their corporate tax rate being reduced and of reductions in capital gains tax, if they are involved Wednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10987 in that area. Australia is becoming an increasingly open economy. We have a globally competitive situation. It is important to make these changes at this time, as we move more and more to an internationally competitive situation. EFIC has been operating since 1956 in various forms, providing loans, credit insurance and guarantees and bonds to companies seeking to trade internationally. Usually, companies have come to EFIC when there have been international problems, where the level of risk involved in exporting to countries in terms of repayments would be under threat. It has played a very fine role. The government took the initiative at that time, but we have now moved beyond having a sole government organisation. That is the factor. When you have a situation of market failure, the then government becomes involved. But there is a time when you need to ensure that there is a level playing field and then you make these types of changes. So the role that EFIC has played in areas such as Vietnam and many others, and in supporting Australian wheat farmers, has been significant. EFIC has private sector competition from insurance companies such as QBE Trade Indemnity, which is based in Sydney. This competition is limited to short-term business activity, nonnally within a 90to 100-day period. Where the debtor fails to pay its account, EFIC would cover about 90 per cent of the company's losses. Last year it underwrote some $6.9 billion of insurance business. In EFIC's role in supporting longer term business activity-for example, providing loans for companies to purchase capital goods to set up a factory-it has no private sector competition. I believe that, in the current economy, we would be concerned about not having competition in the private sector. Setting up a factory may take around 25 years in terms of returns and companies are reluctant to tie up capital for such long periods. The concept of competitive neutrality comes in. The Prime Minister announced in his 1997 Investing for growth document that the government had reviewed its ownership of EFIC and concluded that the interests of exporters would be best served by a strong EFIC remaining in public ownership. So it is clear that there was a decision to do that. The government believes it can achieve this objective while at the same time encouraging the private sector players in the export finance and insurance industry. The member for Fraser said, 'This is all very new. It wasn't discussed.' Everyone was supporting this. It was announced in 1997. So what do we see in terms of the four main provisions of the bill? Firstly, there is a question of the debt neutrality charge. Because EFIC is backed by the government, the interest rate that it is able to charge is lower than the private sector would normally be able to offer on a competitive basis. A debt neutrality charge would even it up in terms of putting a surcharge on to be an equivalent of what would be charged in the private sector. Secondly, there is the question of the short-term insurance operations. The costs of reinsurance are not normally included in EFIC's costs because, with the government backing, they do not get involved in reinsurance, but a private sector organisation would be involved in reinsurance. So the costs of reinsurance are included. Thirdly, EFIC is currently tax exempt because it is a government owned corporation. So working out what the tax equivalent cost would be of being in operation is the third major aspect. The final aspect is the question of the insurance agents and brokers. EFIC does not use insurance agents and brokers. Therefore, that is, again, a cost that the private sector would need to incur, but the government owned EFIC corporation does not. So four factors make up the difference between EFIC and the private sector: the question of interest rates, which are lower because they are government backed; the question of 10988 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 reinsurance; the question of brokers; and, finally, the question of the tax charges that will be made by an organisation. This is not new. This covers organisations around Australia. It is also about our National Competition Policy and encouraging the private sector. In summary, this is not about weakening EFIC. This is not about putting an impost on the private sector. This is about encouraging competition which will inevitably lead to lower cost, greater choice, encouraging more exporters out in the marketplace in those markets where there is some degree of risk and some questions about returns because of international volatility or security aspects occurring in that particular market. It assists the private sector in overall terms and in the longer term to be in the international marketplace. I certainly support this bill. It goes to the heart of what this government is about-not only ensuring the long-term viability of the export market, assisting our balance of payments situation and encouraging export earnings, but also encouraging more private sector players in the market. This is not about the grand old days of having a single government owned organisation which dominates. We have seen those failed models littered around the world. This is about empowering the private sector who can best understand the marketplace to be out there assisting the operators in the export field. I commend this bill to the House. and Resources) (10.30 a.m. )-First of all, I would like to thank both honourable members.for their contribution to this debate on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment Bill 1999. I will cover some of the issues raised by the honourable member for Fraser. I will start with his comments suggesting that the government was keeping EFIC purely as a cash cow for the government. I would suggest to the honourable member that EFIC does not need to achieve significant profits each year as would a private company and therefore additional costs on EFIC will not necessarily feed back through to higher charges for exporters. The government made the decision in 1997 to keep EFIC in public ownership. This was to ensure that exporters would continue to be supplied with an efficient support body in EFIC. There would certainly be no point in this if EFIC was hamstrung in its efforts to assist exporters by offering higher charges. The government will certainly be mindful of the international competitive situation in setting the charges which EFIC will have to pay to the government. The member for Fraser also asked, 'Why do you impose higher charges on EFIC at a time when there is a record trade deficit?' I would suggest to the honourable member that there is really no good time to impose these sorts of measures. There is, however, a developing private market for insurance and the measure is designed to ensure that EFIC does not unfairly compete. What the government wants to achieve here is an efficient EFIC, working in tandem with efficient private markets. In regard to the contribution from the honourable member for Cook, he supported the measures in the bill and the concept of competitive neutrality. He mentioned the government's achievements in supporting the industry and exporters, including in the important taxation reform area. As he mentioned in relation to EFIC, it certainly has had a long history of support for exporters--over some 43 years-but a level playing field concept is important. The private sector certainly must be encouraged to continue to develop. It is particularly important in the short-term insurance area. He also mentioned that the government has announced its dual aim of having an efficient and effective public and private sector in the export insurance area. This is very important. I thank both members for their contribution.",149,Representatives Main Committee
385,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, ScienceWednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10989 As Mr Anthony mentioned in the second reading speech, the government had concluded that the interests of exporters are best served by maintaining EFIC in government ownership. The benefits of this decision were seen in EFIC's ability to respond quickly and to provide invaluable support to Australian exporters during the South-East Asian economic crisis. The merits of this decision will be further demonstrated as EFIC provides cover for exporters for risk extending past 1 January 2000. At the same time, however, the government believes that, where the private sector is willing to support exports, it should be encouraged to do so. This bill seeks to ensure that EFIC enjoys no net benefits from its government ownership and will therefore assist in developing a strong private sector that will provide competitive benefits to our exporters. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 June, on motion by Mr Slipper: That the bill be now read a second time. I have unlimited time to speak to a measure. It is refreshing. We seem to be in magic pudding time: instead of the clock running down, the clock is running up so that we cut and come again and speak and speak some more. It seems to be the political equivalent of being forever young. So in this debate, I find myself able to make a very large contribution to the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1999, yet I fear it will test my capacity to expand into this infinity of time that I possess. Madam Deputy Speaker, I hope I will not keep you in the chair for too long. These amendments are the result of a review undertaken by the Customs Brokers Council of Australia and the National Customs Agents Licensing Advisory Committee. The review focuses on the way in which Customs could make a progression following the introduction of the COMPILE computer system and also integrate some of the work it is doing with the planned tax changes that will come in with the GST legislation. The COMPILE computer system allows for the electronic lodgement of import entries, and the proposed amendments will give those in the industry who have links to COMPILE the option of applying for refunds electronically, while retaining the current documentary system for those who do not have that link. It is anticipated that electronic lodgement and payments of refunds will be more resource efficient and faster than the current system. The department has taken the opportunity of preparing the legislation which the minister has introduced and which is also picked up in this legislation. This brings some timing issues in relation to the customs legislation into line with the GST. The GST legislation makes goods and services tax on imports payable at the same time as customs duty and also provides for the deferral of GST on imports. At present, there are no provisions in the Customs Act specifying the time when duty must be paid, so there is no basis for a provision allowing for the deferral of customs duty. The amendments are intended to give Customs the flexibility to coincide payments of customs duty",152,Representatives Main Committee

The legislation will be supported by the opposition. The opposition would make the point that the fact that government has a particular intention is not necessarily proof that the outcome will match the intention that has been indicated. It is a small point relative to the goods and services tax. Before the last election we were assured that there would be a decrease in domestic air fares. We now find that both major airlines anticipate increases. It is similar with the way in which electronic processing of certain procedures by Customs has been put forward as a way of improving efficiencies. There are real doubts that some of these outcomes have been achieved. The Joint Standing Committee on Migration report Going for gold, which focused on the way in which we are preparing for the Olympics, focused on entry arrangements for that event and the Paralympic Games. In relation to computer facilities, it raised its concerns that customs infonnation technology systems used by key border agencies to process visitor infonnation are vulnerable to mal:fimction. Agencies have fallen behind in computer testing and implementation programs. They pointed out that it is probable that their computers will not be able to cope with any Y2K problems in time for the Olympic Games or with the increased workload that will occur during the Olympic period. They noted that the staffing arrangements for border control authorities are inadequate. They pointed to the need for more short-tenn employment of experienced people during that period and noted that agencies were not sufficiently aware of the importance of getting these arrangements right at all entry points. We welcome the fact that the government says that it is intending to build on the COMPILE computer system. We would hope that the deficiencies that have been recognised by the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration which apply to the processing of people are not similarly reflected in the actual outcomes that will occur in relation to these changes to the goods processing area. To date, I have not had representations to me from the industry that have raised this as a significant current issue. With the increased volume that will be generated through these new measures, in the same way as the pressure that the Joint Committee on Migration pointed to will come onto the facilities for people registration and management of people flows for the Olympics, it is possible that any deficiencies that may exist in the system will become more significant in practice as .we move towards greater reliance on electronic systems. AllI can say is that we do not want to be in a situation where we are trying to pick up the pieces too late. I suspect that one of the great deficiencies occurring in a whole range of areas, particularly as we move to outsourcing more of both the physical and the intellectual infrastructure of government, is that arrangements for long-tenn maintenance and thinking through of the way in which we deal with those strategic issues and the vulnerabilities in our critical infrastructure have been left behind. Wednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10991 I had a discussion with the Australian Institute of Engineers about exactly this issue of the expertise and skills base that was hitherto hard wired into the way government did its business. Within large institutional departments, there were sufficient staff and training resources to anticipate problems with the run-down or long-term depreciation of both physical and information technologies and to build a program that would develop sufficient maintenance and upgrading to ensure that the systems did not collapse in any particular point of time. Those planning capacities have been significantly reduced. The fact that stood out in the briefing provided to me was that, at the time when the present administrative officer took her position about a decade ago, approximately 70 per cent of engineers who are members of the institute were in public employment. That figure is now approximately 30 per cent. What we have seen, in a sense, is the shedding of the core capacity for government to necessarily supervise and superintend these new arrangements which were largely passed into private infrastructure, and the absence of any proper audit mechanisms to address a gap that has emerged. I think the government would concede that, if changed circumstances require different responses, it needs to respond to those changed circumstances. One of the problems is that, whilst many people have spoken up about the advantages of so-called efficiency gains and gains that can be had from outsourcing technology, very little attention has been paid to proper arrangements for maintenance, long-term planning or structural change, or to ensure that the critical infrastructure, both physical and relating to the cyber environment, does not corrode to a point where we have significant weaknesses. The Olympic Going for gold report highlights precisely that. We need to have some integration in the way in which the electronic resources of government are thought through. Thinking which proposes greater efficiencies in relation to these new systems and the aspirations that are built into them is always to be welcomed. There is no public interest in maintaining procedures which are labour intensive, which depend on paper transactions, simply for the sake of it. No-one would make that case. Nonetheless, we must be alive to the reality that, as we move to different means of addressing old problems, those problems do not go away-we still need to have a plan B for them. Referring again to the interrelationship between physical technology and the cyber environment, I was able to spend a couple of weeks in the United States prior to Christmas. At that time. I took the opportunity of meeting with the US agency charged with the administration of presidential direction No. 63, which relates to the protection of critical infrastructure in the United States. It was quite illuminating to hear how seriously that country is taking issues that we seem to be very complacent about, in relation to the way in which we are changing the technology for addressing particular circumstances without hardening up the targets so that they are not vulnerable to attack. I will mention a couple of the points that were made to me. One was a point which I had given little thought to, that in the United States now all switching systems on rail are electronic. Most of these were quite vulnerable at the time the review started because the electronic signals were transmitted by single lines that were running along the edge of rail lines. They could be cut very easily and the whole switching system broken. Secondly, even if there were a mechanism for transmitting these signals from switch to switch which did not depend on a line running alongside the rail lines, there was no plan B to deal with a breakdown in the network of switching systems. The whole system that used 10992 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 --------------------------to exist, by which people could pull levers to divert trains to lay-bys and allow them to pass, had gone. The system had rusted out. Even where it existed, staff had no training. Even if you could pull a lever, if the wire was not rusted and was still connected with the line, no staff had any knowledge of how to use a secondary system. There was no redundancy in the system. We have to bear in mind when we speak of the advantages that can come from greater applications in these technologies that we are addressing old problems with new solutions. But we have to recognise that the new solutions themselves have vulnerabilities. That means that we have to always be mindful of the need to have strategies to audit what is happening, to make certain that weaknesses are identified as well as vulnerabilities, which can be by reason of deliberate attack. There is the possibility, of course, of organised crime or of vandals or the like seeking to disrupt critical services. But even just the run-down on ordinary administration may be sufficient to cause real problems, as it apparently did with respect to the water supply in New South Wales and in relation to the Longford power disaster in Victoria and in a host of other areas where we have infrastructure which is inadequately maintained so that what appear to be small planning errors can cascade into real disaster. I understand that these are issues which do not regularly get significant attention in the public sphere, notwithstanding that they are vitally important. It is a cause of real concern that whilst we in Australia occasionally give lip-service to the kinds of processes that would be required to ensure that we do not suffer a continuation of those kinds of infrastructure difficulties, we really give minimal resources to it. Even when government says that it is addressing these issues, again it is more in the nature of a token than a real response. Partly, the responsibility for this failure lies with the media excitement generated with the Y2K issue. It is almost as if every debate that has focused upon vulnerabilities in the information environment, in the national information inventory, as part of the whole debate around critical infrastructure has focused almost exclusively on the Y2K issue. That has diverted attention and allowed complacency to grow, firstly, around the stock of our physical infrastructure, which is not the subject of any audit and which many believe has been significantly run down over the past four or five years; and, secondly, with respect to arrangements necessary to ensure that programs like COMPILE that Customs are putting in, and which have now become essential to the efficient trade of Australia and other countries, are not subject to cyber attack-that is, a deliberate act of terrorism. I will make a simple point. As we move away from that paper environment and as programs like COMPILE, for a whole range of perfectly rational and good reasons, become more efficient and more commercially advantageous ways of doing business between an importer and Customs, and as they stmi to deal not only with Customs but also with the tax relationship between the customer and the Australian government as they process the goods and services tax component, you can see immediately that you have got a single point of vulnerability, If you attack it, not only does revenue suffer but the whole capacity to trade effectively, to bring goods in and out of Australia, can be subject to grinding delay by the failure of that single, COMPILE network. So how many COMPILE networks are there in Australia? How many of them are, in a similar sense, vulnerable? What are the arrangements that we have in place for ensuring that, in case of attack, they are hardened as targets? What are the audit procedures to make sure that simple failures of maintenance, and deficiencies in the way in which the system is monitored and structured, are addressed? And particularly as many of these systems are increasingly outsourced, what control do we have by way of principles of responsible government on the way in which these services are delivered? Wednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10993 These are broader questions than those that were raised immediately in the bill, but they follow logically from what are welcome outcomes because as we move to greater reliance on these systems, to the extent that they are outsourced and the like, then new issues of responsibility arise. For example, when government itself delivers a service there is a direct path of accountability. If somebody complains to me about something government does, I can say to the minister, 'Minister, what are you going to do about it?' and the minister cannot evade that responsibility. However, if it is a contracted out service then there is no privity of contract, the relationship of obligation exists between government and that person who is contracted to provide the service. Therefore, if somebody comes to my electorate and says, 'Such and such a service is not performing effectively,' I can certainly refer the matter to the minister but the obligation of the minister is defined by the terms of that contract. The contractor may say, 'That's not specifically dealt with by the contract.' There may be a dispute about the liability in relation to it. I believe a range of subsidiary issues relating to the way in which we, as parliamentarians, can discharge our responsibility to hold the executive properly accountable need to be addressed. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am taking full advantage of the fact that we are working on the infinity of time principle. In the normal circumstances you would have drawn my attention to the fact that I have spoken for over 20 minutes. I guess we are working on the magic pudding principle and time is expanding upwards rather than declining downwards. But, out of respectMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs Kelly}-I remind the member for Denison that as a first speaker he does have 30 minutes. Your time is not infinite: you have 30 minutes. Denison! where I could take advantage of the opportunity that this suspension of time allows and to live forever in the parliamentary annals, but I have probably exhausted what I can usefully say in relation to this measure. It is a good measure and I have used the debate as an opportunity to raise some larger issues. I am certain the Attorney, who has, at least nominally, prime responsibility in relation to an interdepartmental committee that has been established to look at the critical infrastructure issues, will bear in mind the remarks that I have made. I certainly believe the government's response to date has not been comprehensive. It has been very ad hoc and, really, a Clayton's response. It is the sort of response you have to have as a result of knowing there is an issue out there and you have to do something about it. But it is not a serious addressing of the substantive issue. I have raised as a matter of important principle these issues of how we address long term the way in which we maintain, manage, account for and audit our physical and cyber infrastructure. I have raised also the important issue, in relation to the outsourcing of a whole range of technologies and delivery systems, of how we as parliamentarians acquire the means of insisting on responsibility through that process where privity of contract arrangements supplant the traditional direct line of responsibility that has hitherto existed in public life. These are important and large issues. I thank the minister for the briefings that were provided in relation to this legislation.

I had hoped that I would be able to speak to a point10994 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 but we raise these larger issues in a spirit of goodwill, hoping the government does take account of them and knowing that essentially they are large issues which will remain for future governments of whatever colour to address. Bill (No.2) 1999. I note the comments of the shadow minister, the member for Denison. It is interesting that this legislation is about the electronic transfer of infonnation. I certainly thought during the speech, with the clock standing still, that we were in cyberspace in tenns of the contribution that was made. The bill is a mechanical bill and the shadow minister waxed lyrical, but not too much about the bill. It is simply an efficient transactional mode, recognition of e-commerce in today's environment and nothing more, nothing less. I certainly commend the Minister for Justice and Customs, Amanda Vanstone, for her initiative in presenting this bill, and also the departmental officers for bringing it forward. It obviously is something that should have happened a long time ago, but it is an excellent initiative. The bill provides an enhanoement of the Customs computer system to enable users to lodge refund applications electronically. to lunch but this is not about lunch on this particular occasion; it is about lodging applications electronically. In the 1997-98 financial year, there was $200 million worth of customs duty, and $6 million of sales tax was refunded. This amendment simply allows the applications to be lodged electronically and to be received and processed much more expeditiously than was previously the case. The enhancement will allow 90 per cent of refund applications to be handled in this manner. Obviously, if you are involved as an exporter or an importer in this case, it allows a much more efficient way of handling arrangements. The current manual lodgement system will remain for those who cannot cope with the electronic approach. If those opposite have difficulty in importing products, such as the member for Werriwa's book, they can do it manually. Schedule2 allows for a customs duty deferral facility. At present, customs duty is paid before imports are released into home consumption, although the time for payment of duty is not specified in the Customs Act. These amendments will expressly provide the time when payment of customs duty is required. This is in order to coordinate the requirements of the GST. It has not been fonnally detennined when the final payment of the GST on imports is required at this stage, but obviously there have been representations to the government on this issue. This amendment to the bill will enable the coordination of the import duties and when the GST is paid. This is a logical approach and will assist in tenns of some of the comments that have been made by importers about how they may be otherwise unfairly penalised. This is an appropriate change to the previous legislation. Finally, the Customs Broking Licence System is simply allowing these to go out from one year to three years. I think that is a simple approach. One might even question why it would not go out to five years, but that is a 300 per cent improvement. This will reduce the cost to the industry and will also shift the time from the end of the year to the end of the financial year to enable people to concentrate on that. It is an administrative change and well deserving of support from this House. I commend these amendments and the bill to the House. Amendment Bill (No.2) 1999, which the opposition supports.

392,Mr Price (Chifley) (11.03 A.m.),"I am pleased to speak on the Customs LegislationWednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10995 by the honourable member tor Cook, whilst we welcome the fact that the licence is being extended from a 12-month to a three-year licence, it is a matter of regret that he did not mention that the cost is going from $200 to $1,200-a somewhat disproportionate increase. I do not think the government is setting a good example of low inflation by having a sixfold increase in the cost of the licence. It is very important that we accept the need to increase these licences for agents from the 12-month period to a three-year period, and indeed there may be merit in making it longer. I would also like to draw to the attention of the House that there was in fact a Customs Service review of these matters. It is disappointing that that review was never made public. It would be interesting to know what else was in the review that the government has not acted upon or has decided against acting upon and what the reasons might have been. Was this the totality of the review? The other two issues contained in the bill are on enabling applications for refunds to be lodged electronically. We are seeing quite a number of other government services allowing the electronic lodgement of applications. Taxation, of course, is a very good example of this. It does cut down unnecessary paperwork. It certainly enhances speed. The great benefit from a department's point of view is that, because it is formatted to be compatible, it also aids in diminishing processing times. All these things are very useful. The Commonwealth is not picking up the cost of this initiative. ELOR has already been funded through the industry based Cargo Automation Development Fund. My senior colleague the shadow minister made a relevant point when he was talking about vulnerability. If you are really trying to look at how Australia may be vulnerable and how the Olympics may impact on us, we are all very conscious of terrorism and are trying to minimise that, but information warfare is a growing and productive field. Whilst it requires a great deal of expertise, it does not require manufacturing. It does not require a lot of money. Things like computer systems can be very vulnerable. AlthoughI would have thought that our defence department has a special responsibility to look at this, I would have also thought that the Attorney-General, given his responsibilities, has a responsibility to ensure that, when we are setting up systems like this new customs system and other computer systems throughout the country, they are not vulnerable to information warfare. We have all heard stories about how hackers have been able to break into US Defense Force computers and other government agency computers. It is surprising what damage may be able to be done. I think that, whilst members of parliament can embrace new technology and see all the benefits of implementing new technology and how, all round, people can be winners, it may very well increase vulnerability. It is a legitimate thing to ask the Attorney what safeguards are in place for this proposed new deVelopment and how vulnerable they are to information warfare. This bill also provides for customs duty deferral facilities. People will not be required to actually pay the duty when they are picking up the goods. Again, this is a measure that we can all support. It poses the question, in talking about computers, whether the new system is going to be ready for the Olympics. Presumably, there are going to be huge demands placed on the customs department with the huge influx expected before and after the Olympics next year. It is also appropriate to ask whether or not the department, which has really suffered huge 10996 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 cuts under both governments and has had a history of large staffing cuts, is going to be adequately staffed to cope with all the requirements posed by the. Olympics. I want to finish on a point that is germane to the department of customs, and that is the documentary that was shown on the illegal fishing in the orange roughy grounds. Most Australians who watched that documentary would have bemoaned our apparent impotence to respond, when we knew full well what had taken place. I know that there is very good harmonisation between Customs, its related authorities and the Navy about these matters, and I note in recent times the issue has been raised about whether we need a separate coastguard. I do not have a particular view about that. I know that my learned colleague the member for the Northern Territory is very interested in our review of the state of preparedness of the Army. Yesterday Professor Dibb said that j should East Timor go beyond 12 months, with the current levels of projected deployment there . would be a case to look not only at the Army's state of preparedness-which is absolutely essential-but also at the other three services. I suggest to the government that there is some value in reviewing the adequacy of our current services and whether it is appropriate for those services to be bolstered by a dedicated coastguarn service in Australia, similar to that in the United States. I certainly hope that we will not have any further repeats of the orange roughy situation. In conclusion, I reiterate that I support the measures in this bill that are being proposed by the government. members for Denison, Cook and Chifley, who have contributed to the debate on the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1999. I thank the opposition for agreeing that the bill is not controversial and thereby facilitating early passage. As the previous speakers indicated, the bill proposes to amend the Customs Act 1901 in three separate areas: firstly, with the introduction of an electronic lodgement and payment system for refunds of custom duty; secondly, with the introduction of a duty deferral facility; and thirdly, with the extension from one year to three years for customs agents' licences. Most of the comments have been directed at the first area-the proposal for the electronic refunds of customs duty. This will replace an antiquated resource intensive process. Benefits will clearly flow to industry and Customs, with payments being available much faster. It should be acknowledged that there is strong industry support for this project, with funding, training and implementation provided by industry. The member for Denison raised the issue of the vulnerability of the Customs computer system, COMPILE, and this was also mentioned by the member for Chifley. I seek to put their minds at rest by referring them to a recent report of an inter-departmental committee, entitled Protecting Australia's national information infrastructure. The IDC was set up following a confidential report in February 1997 by the Defence Signals Directorate, entitled, Australia's national information infrastructure: threats and vulnerabilities. The principal recommendation was the establishment of a formal structure involving both the government and the private sector. It is important to remember that much of what is vital in our information infrastructure is actually in the hands of and conducted by, the private sector. j I will not go through the detail of the recommendations, but one of the recommendations was to establish an industry consultative forum. This has been done--in fact, I addressed that forum several weeks ago at one of its regular m-etings. In addition, there is to be set up within government an interdepartmental committee, with representation from those departments and",158,Representatives Main Committee
393,Mr Williams (Tangney,"Attorney-General) (11.12 a.m.)-I thank the honourableWednesday, 29 September 1999 MAiN COMMITTEE 10997 agencies that have a particular interest in the subject. This includes the Attorney-General's Department, which will chair the IDC. Customs is not directly represented-it is represented by the Attorney-General's Department-but there is a capacity for the committee to invite other agencies to join the committee or to attend specific meetings if the committee considers that such participation will facilitate the achievement of the objectives of the committee. There is not a major component in the bill to protect the infrastructure, but the opposition can be assured that appropriate steps are being taken, both within government and in the private sector, to protect the systems upon which government is dependent. COMPILE will be dealt with in that way. The member for Denison referred to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, Going for gold. The committee has noted that there is a narrow margin between the predicted demand and the capacity to process passengers at the primary line. I inform the Main Committee that on 1 September 1999 a state-of-the-art IT system was implemented at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport to facilitate the clearance of international passengers and to improve border integrity. The system is now being rolled out to all international airports throughout Australia and is performing to specifications. This is some 12 months in advance of the Olympic Games. In the current federal budget, Customs was allocated some $6.5 million over two years to bring forward its recruitment program to ensure it has sufficient resources to manage the Olympic demands. This will provide Customs with the capacity to process 6,000 arrivals per hour on a sustained basis at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. This capacity is more than able to match the worse-case scenario anticipated by the Games organising committees and airport planners. Customs has recently implemented a specific duty-free passenger concession for non-Australian Olympic and Paralympic family members. This will assist in facilitating the clearance of these passengers and all passengers in general. The second area of the bill, the introduction of a duty deferral facility, will provide the opportunity for customs duty to be collected following the importation of goods rather than at the normal time of importation. This will enable Customs to be brought into alignment with GST collection when GST becomes payable. The third area, relating to the streamlining elements of the licensing support system for customs brokers, appears to be popular. Notwithstanding the reference by the member for Chifley to the cost of the licence, licences will be for three years not for one year, as is presently the case. Renewal dates will be for the financial year rather than for the calendar year. The title of those holding a licence will not be 'customs agent' but 'customs broker'. These changes are not controversial; they are supported by industry. The member for Chifley mentioned a documentary on orange roughy fishing. I am unable to comment on that because I did not see it, but he should be aware that there are proposals in train for expanding the powers of Customs at sea. These will be brought to light in due course. I commend this bill to honourable members. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. 10998 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 June, on motion by Mr Horne: That the bilI be now read a second time. Transactions Bill 1999. The only criticism in the text of my speech will be that, if anything, it is perhaps a little too timid. The bill has three main purposes: to facilitate the use of electronic transactions, to promote business and community confidence in the use of electronic transactions, and to enable business and the community to use electronic communications in their dealings with the government-specifically, the Commonwealth government. The bill arises from recommendations of the Electronic Commerce Expert Group, which was established by the Attorney-General and which reported to the federal government in March oflast year. The ECEG recommended that the Commonwealth should. enact legislation based on the United Nations Committee on International Trade Law's Model Law on Electronic Commerce of 1996. Those recommendations of the international body, with some modifications, have been adopted. Effectively, the international model has provided a template of model rules for countries to adopt, and Australia was closely involved in the development of that model law. The bill is based on two principles: firstly, functional equivalence; and, secondly, technology neutrality. The term 'functional equivalence' means that transactions conducted using paper documents and transactions conducted using electronic communications should be treated equally by the law and not given an advantage or disadvantage against each other. The second concept, that of technology neutrality, means that the law should not discriminate between different forms of technology-for example, by specifYing technical requirements for the use of electronic communications that are based upon an understanding of the operation of a particular form of electronic communication technology. The government has accepted the ECEG recommendation in that respect to depart from what a number of European countries have done by actually mentioning a specific form of technology. The ECEG committee recommended that to do so could lock in inefficient, outdated or outmoded forms of technology, and the opposition agrees that the approach taken by the government is appropriate. The bill establishes the basic rule that a transaction is not invalid because it took place by means of an electronic communication. It contains specific provisions which state that a requirement or permission under a law of the Commonwealth for a person to provide information in writing, to sign a document, to produce a document or to retain information or a document can be satisfied by an electronic communication, subject to certain minimum criteria being satisfied. The bill sets out rules to determine the time and place of dispatch and receipt of electronic communications, because that obviously could determine where a contract is made and what fair trading or consumer protection laws apply to that particular transaction. The bill also contains provisions that specifY certain exemptions or allow for exemptions to be made by regulation from the application of the bill. It is important to note that the provisions in the bill do not remove any legal obligations which may be imposed upon a person by other Commonwealth laws. Effectively, the sole",160,Representatives Main Committee
394,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (11.20 A.m.),"The opposition supports the ElectronicWednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10999 purpose of the bill is to enable people to use electronic communications in the course of satisfying their legal obligations. The bill has a two-step implementation process. Prior to 1 July 2001, the bill will apply only to laws of the Commonwealth specified in the regulations. After that date, it will apply broadly to all Commonwealth laws unless they have been specifically excluded from the application of the bill. Contrary to the recommendations of the ECEG, the bill applies only to transactions und-r Commonwealth law, but the Commonwealth has obtained in-principle agreement from the states and territories that they will legislate in similar form. I understand that agreement was obtained earlier this year. Nonetheless, there are concerns that the state legislative framework could take some time to develop and that there could be some retardation of the use of electronic communications to facilitate commercial transactions while the state laws are being developed. The opposition notes that members of the ECEG have criticised the government's failure to show stronger national leadership on the issue, and it is important to note that the bill has not been set up as a national scheme law. As I have indicated, while the states have all agreed to introduce similar legislation based on the federal model, there is a risk that it may be departed from. The government's reason for not adopting a national approach was concern regarding constitutional limitations. However, we believe the government could have been more adventurous in this area and we note, for instance, that the government was in fact more adventurous in respect of considering the year 2000 disclosure, where section 12 of the Year 2000 Information Disclosure Act 1999 invokes, amongst other heads of constitutional power, the corporations power, the trade and commerce power and the territories' power. The opposition would have preferred the government to take a much stronger national approach in respect of this bill by: legislating to the maximum extent possible under alternative heads of power-perhaps also the telecommunications power was worth looking at; and seeking a referral of the relevant powers from the states or, alternatively, setting up a national uniform scheme in relation to these matters akin to, for instance, the Corporations Law. However, despite that limitation-and, as I say, perhaps a little timidity of approach-the opposition supports the bill because, clearly, it is in the national interest to enact such a scheme. Before concluding, there are several matters which we would like to highlight. First, the legislation does not address the technically more difficult area of ensuring that businesses and consumers can verify with whom they are dealing-and, later in this debate, the member for Bonython will have some very specific and informed comments to make in that respect. Clearly, confidence in electronic communications depends on business and consumers having confidence in the people they are dealing with. Verification of identify is fundamental to this. However, Labor accepts that it is not easily addressed by legislation alone. Subject to ensuring that reasonable access for law enforcement and national security agencies to any encrypted communication is available, the opposition believes that appropriate recognition of the role of that encryption technology is fundamental to addressing this verification issue. In this regard, we note that the National Office of the Information Economy released a discussion paper on 19 August 1998 on the establishment of a national authentication authority, and that authority, as proposed, would administer a national public encryption key authentication scheme. We note, on the other hand, a contrary argument in the 11000 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 discussion paper insofar as it is at odds with recommendations of the Attorney-General's Electronic Commerce Expert Group, which argued against a detailed legislative regime that specifies an operating framework or the use of particular technologies. The ECEG correctly noted that a framework that is too rigid could seriously impede Australia's ability to participate in international electronic commerce. The Australian Labor Party generally prefers an approach which would allow those entering into a commercial transaction to detennine the most effective means for that transaction to be verified. Governments should not be in the job of predicting what level of satisfaction the market will require or of how it goes about doing its business. However, the governments are entitled to ensure that the public interest in law enforcement and national security is protected. So we note that it is appropriate for those things to be developed. Whichever approach the government adopts, it needs to act quickly and in line with international practice. It also needs to provide appropriate sanctions against the use of encryption technology in the commission of crime, and such conduct should attract significant criminal penalties. Secondly, the legislation fails to address issues of appropriate consumer law protection. By default, the legislation applies the consumer protection law that applies to the relevant jurisdiction. While we acknowledge that the law will define where the communication was sent and where it was received, because of the distance covered there, nonetheless, will be complex issues as to what particular jurisdiction will apply as far as consumer protection is concerned. Given that consumers and businesses will often not consider or appreciate the differences that exist across jurisdictional boundaries, the failure to address this issue will become important. It is perhaps disappointing that the government did not seek to use the bill as a means to help unify Australia's consumer protection laws, particularly in this area of electronic commerce. I note in passing that I have seen several attempts where my younger daughters have attempted to engage in electronic commercial transactions on the Internet. Fortunately, they did not come off. I have often wondered what protections I would have as a parent if they did. Thirdly, subclause 13(4) in the bill contains a blanket exemption for transactions involving the courts. This is despite the fact that the draft bill did apply but enabled the rules of the court to exempt specific matters. Labor believes that, at the very least, the proposal should be amended so that it is possible for the rules of the court to apply the provisions of the bill. We would ask the government to seriously examine this issue before the bill is debated in the Senate. We believe it would facilitate cheaper and speedier access to the courts, particularly as there frequently are strict time limits applying to the lodgement of documents. Fourthly, the bill contains a blanket exemption in relation to dealings with Commonwealth entities in connection with applications for the grant of pennission, a certificate or similar thing where the pennission, certificate or thing is of a kind not capable of being granted to an Australian citizen. These are designed, as the explanatory memorandum says, to have applications made under the Migration Act and the Australian Citizenship Act. We note the rationale for the government having that exclusion was the difficulty verifying some documents emanating from overseas. To verify the source and the authenticity of those documents could present a difficulty. We note, however, that the government has recently provided us with a proposed amendment to clause 11 of the bill. We think that the amendment is much more sophisticated in that, while there is the general exemption, there are exceptions Wednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 11001 from that exemption which will enable a number of transactions to take place by electronic means. Finally, we note that paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 ensure that an electronic transaction can only be validly engaged in with a person who is neither a Commonwealth entity nor a person acting on behalf of the Commonwealth entity if that person consents to the use of electronic communication as a means for the purpose of the transaction. We support this approach. People or businesses that do not want to engage in electronic transactions should not be forced to do so. However, it will increasingly be the fact that their consumer and commercial interests wiiI be enhanced if they do participate in the electronic framework. In conclusion, this is increasingly an important area for Australians. The Bureau of Statistics showed that 650,000 Australians used the Internet to purchase goods for private use in the 12 months to May 1999. That was up from 409,000 in the 12-month period to May 1998. Every indication is that it is increasing at an exponential rate. Despite the defects in the scope of this bill, the Labor Party is prepared to support it. The development of the information economy is vital to Australia's economic prosperity, but we would encourage the government in future to be a little more adventurous and far-sighted in taking hold of this opportunity. Debate interrupted. would like to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of a delegation of members of the United Kingdom branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. The delegation is led by the Rt Hon. Robert Sheldon. On behalf of the Main Committee I would like to extend a warm welcome to our visitors. As an aside: you can be certain that you are in the Southern Hemisphere if you note that our timing clock is running backwards. Second Reading Debate resumed. I commend the government and the Attorney-General for their initiative in bringing this proposal forward. There are few areas of the world economy which have transformed it to a greater degree than the use of e-commerce. E-commerce has revolutionised the way we do business around the world. It is appropriate that the government captures those changes and looks at the various processes in terms of purchasing and the way business is done, both in Australia and internationally, and recognises those changes to ensure the validity of the system and of transactions which are made and also the security of the whole system, making it more possible that we have uniformity of legislation throughout the country so that everyone is operating on the same agenda. Obviously, there are some developments that will take a while for all to come on board, particularly in terms of bringing about uniformity among the various states. But this will provide the overall agenda Within which states can coordinate their own legislation to conform with this model. It is interesting that we have a delegation here from the UK, a country which has a reputation for developments in terms of e-commerce and the use of the Internet generally. It is particularly encouraging to see the role that Australia has been taking in e-commerce.",162,Representatives Main Committee

396,Mr Baird (Cook) (11.36 A.m.),"I rise to support the Electronic Transactions Bill 1999.11002 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 Japanese officials have commended the Attorney-General, saying that Australia is now considered as a world leader in Internet legislation. The high degree of computer literacy in this country, the great degree to which the Internet is accessed by Australians, puts us second or third on a per capita basis in use of the Internet and of computers. We should use that to put us at the cutting edge in terms not only of competitive advantage but also of legislation that can be enacted in this House. This bill provides a strategic framework for the development of the information economy in Australia. It is designed to move businesses towards having the same level of confidence in their electronic transactions as currently they have in paper transactions. The elevation of the information economy to a cabinet position, under the Hon. Richard Alston, reflects the importance the government attaches to information technology. Certainly, Australia's comparatively high level of readiness for the millennium bug and the introduction of legislation like the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill-the result of an inquiry by the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies--demonstrate that we are on top of the game. These highlight the attention that is being paid to ensuring Australia enjoys social benefits, as well as technological benefits, from these changes. The government is eager that access to the Internet be restricted where appropriate--in terms of children, in relation not only to pornography but also to the display of bomb making techniques, for example. On the one hand, we want appropriate restrictions to be in place to restrict access by children. On the other hand, we want to make certain that we develop common standards and ensure standards to improve the system worldwide. The technology revolution is transforming the whole way in which business is done at the start of the new millennium, and we can only imagine what it is going to be like into the 21st century. The growing importance of e-commerce cannot be underestimated. It is the most significant change that we have had in the last 50 years. The World Trade Organisation's role has been significant. Australia has taken a leading role in that organisation and we have been the leading advocates for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, which will police the outlets through which goods will be sold. Of course, we are most concerned that Australia is well placed to enjoy the benefits that come from our high level of computer literacy and adoption of computer technology. At this stage we are keen to encourage the use of electronic technology in business transactions. I notice that in the new tax system we are also requiring that large corporations make their payments of tax electronically, and I believe we are going to see that spread across the board. In terms of dealing with government agencies, there is an encouragement that as companies interface with government we should progress, to a much more comprehensive basis, the interaction through electronic means. This bill is going to remove many of the doubts that currently exist regarding the legitimacy of these transactions. Those doubts are with regard to the writing, signing, and originals in relation to documentation. The bill is based on the principles of functional equivalence and technology neutrality. ·Functional equivalence is the equality under law of the treatment of paper and electronic communication. Technology neutrality is the non-discrimination between different forms of electronic communication. In general this bill has three functions. Firstly, it validates the use of electronic transactions other than verbal contract engaged through the use of a telephone. Secondly, it gives electronic signatures the same status as written ones. Thirdly, the receipt of transaction is defined when Wednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 11003 the electronic communication entered the recipient's system, rather than, for example, when an email was sent. There have been some comments made about various aspects of this bill and the shadow Attorney-General has raised some of these issues. Critics of the bill have focused on its limited scope and that it only applies to the law of the Commonwealth. It was considered that there should be a total generic bill in which the Commonwealth would take a far more expansive view of Commonwealth power in dealing with another e-commerce issue, year 2000 disclosure. It may be possible that there could be lengthy delays until identical state and territory legislation is enacted, which could hinder the development of e-commerce in Australia. The fact is, however, that the government has taken a cautious approach in terms of the constitutional powers and has opted for a uniform national scheme instead of a single piece of Commonwealth legislation, as recommended by the EGEC. While there was initially some concern that some states might depart from the uniform framework, in May 1999 the states decreed at a meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General to draft complementary laws based on the Commonwealth bill. That seems to be an appropriate way to go. It is not unusual. We have similar examples of this, where the Commonwealth enacts the primary piece of legislation and complementary bills are brought simultaneously into each of the state houses. I think it is important there is state ownership of each of these pieces of legislation, that they developed their own access in terms of their own involvement with e-commerce in each state. So these criticisms are basically ill-founded and fail to recognise the fact that that was a decision taken not by the Commonwealth but by the Commonwealth government in concert with the states, which believe this is the more appropriate way to go. The second criticism was that only certain Commonwealth laws would be captured by the bill. Until1 July 2001, it will only apply to laws made subject to the bill by regulation. After that date, Commonwealth laws may be exempted by regulation. The fact is that, while people want everything to be done at once, it is important that there is appropriate lead time for the agencies. This is a reasonable lead time. It is a significant change in the way that agencies and various departments do business, so that time allows them to coordinate their efforts. It is one thing to say, 'Let's do it all at once.' It is another thing to introduce legislation and be caught by agencies not being prepared. It is appropriate that we have a smooth transition. This will be with us for a long time. It is important we get it right and thafthe agencies are ready for this. Also, after 1 July 2001 this bill will apply to all areas of government activity, not only those where specific regulation has been made for electronic commerce, so it is a totally revolutionary approach. If we think of the changes that have occurred in the way that the government does business over the last century, this is amongst the most significant changes that we have seen. The bill has also come under criticism for doing little to solve the uncertainty of electronic commerce. For example, clause 10 provides that, if there is a requirement for a signature under a Commonwealth law, an electronic communication may meet this requirement if, amongst other things, the method used was reliable. The recent announcement by the government of the establishment of the National Electronic Authentication Council may go some way towards solving this problem. NEAC will oversee the development of a national framework for electronic authentication of online activity. It will not require that a particular form of digital signature be used, but will oversee the development of technical standards and codes of practice. This measure will add to consumer confidence. 11004 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 Obviously, authentication of signatures is a vexed problem. While no-one is offering magical solutions at this point, it is an evolving process and NEAC's suggestions as to how it can be verified seem an appropriate way to go. Other comments on this have been that the enactment of a legislative framework for electronic commerce may also require the enactment of data protection legislation to ensure privacy. I think we are all concerned about aspects of privacy, and it is only appropriate that we should raise those questions. In December 1998, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and the Attorney-General announced the government's intention to develop legislation to support a self-regulatory regime for privacy protection. The government is currently engaging in a program of consultation. According to the Attorney-General: The legislation will support businesses that self-regulate to strengthen privacy protection and provide a default legislative framework. Self-regulatory privacy codes will be able to be approved by the Privacy Commissioner and have the same force as the legislation. Where there is no approved privacy code default legislative principles and a complaint handling regime will apply. It has been argued that such a measure is needed to facilitate e-commerce with members of the European Union in the wake of the data protection directive in October 1998. The EU directive prohibits the release of personal information online into jurisdictions that do not have adequate data protection arrangements. I think it is appropriate that all members should have regard to the question of privacy; it is going to be an ongoing development. As we see the burgeoning of e-commerce, it will be something that we as parliamentarians will need to protect. It obviously provides an opportunity for those who would want to exploit it to make us vulnerable in terms of privacy issues, so we as parliamentarians must constantly monitor that aspect of it. Overall, it is a significant step forward. It is quite a major breakthrough in the way we do business not only by empowering the private sector and providing the necessary safeguards but also by providing the necessary framework in which the government can move into the new electronic era, which will be the way we all do business in the new millennium. Ms JANN McFARLANE (Stirling) (11.48 a.m.)-It is a pleasure to rise today to speak generally in support of the Electronic Transactions Bi1l1999. It amazes me, at times such as this, when I reflect on the technological advancements that I have witnessed so far in my lifetime. I can but wonder what the future holds! I very much enjoy the benefits of the 'e' phenomenon. Email is a fantastic tool which I would encourage all my colleagues from all sides of the House to explore. But be warned, once you start using it, you will get hooked. The Internet is a resource that is beyond comprehension. I notice in news reports that there is growing concern about people becoming addicted to spending time surfing the Net. I am not surprised. Its interactivity, visual interest and sheer scope of activities are attractive to anyone. For many it is not just a plaything but a business tool, and it is the more serious business side of the electronic industry that we are discussing today. I must say that I had some concerns about this bill before I saw it. The government's recent Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Act 1999 was such a fiasco that it left many of us with the view that this government did not understand the positive potential of the online industry, or support it in its aims and objectives. As the Internet censorship bill was being processed through to the parliament, the government did not hear, or refused to hear, the voices of families and individuals who said, 'Let us take responsibility as end users for filters and what comes down the line into our computers. ' Wednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 11005 A recent Australian Broadcasting Authority attitudinal survey showed that some analysts are concerned that this ill thought out, politically motivated legislation will cost the industry approximately $150 million in compliance costs. Telecommunication analyst, Paul Budde, commented that not only did this legislation place enormous compliance costs on the industry, it also, even with complete compliance, would be less than 10 per cent effective. This bill will impact adversely on the emergent Australian e-commerce and Internet industries which are strong employers of young Australians. This will mean opportunities lost for industry and Australia. It was therefore a pleasant surprise to discover that the Electronic Transactions Bill 1999 is, as promised by the Prime Minister in December 1997, a 'light handed regulatory framework' that does appear to be workable. The bill seeks to facilitate electronic commerce in Australia. It enshrines the principle that electronic communications can satisfY the requirements of Commonwealth law in relation to writing, signatures, and the production of original documents and records. This bill intends to promote business and community confidence in the use of electronic transactions and enable business and the community to use electronic communications in their dealings with government. This is a giant leap forward. As a society, our psychological orientation is very focused on the superiority of the concrete, in this sense the written word, the original signature. Up until now the law has confirmed that hierarchy. We must now alter our thinking. For some, this is a great challenge-how to feel secure without putting pen to paper and signing the cheque or other such -document. But like everything, we will get used to it. Perhaps now is a good time, however, to enter a small plea to remember those who may be left behind in this new and somewhat frightening e-driven world. It is fine for us to talk blithely about e-commerce and e-trade, but this government also has a responsibility to ensure that older members of our community, and those who are not technologically literate, are not locked out of access to employment opportunities or fundamental services. It is a good thing to facilitate electronic transactions, but we should not allow the commitment to providing services the good old-fashioned over-the-counter way to disappear for those who choose to continue to operate in that way. Of concern to many people is an escalating trend to cut costs by reducing staff and increasing reliance on technology. Phone queuing, voice mails and automated systems are examples of that. Automatic teller machines and reduced counter staff at banks are another. Yes, we must move on, but let us not forget the universal social and moral obligation to continue to provide services to those who, for whatever reason, cannot grasp technology with both hands. The government must also ensure that its economic goals and policies have outcomes with net positive social effects, rather than the current negative impacts people are experiencing. Australians have always embraced new technological developments. This is especially true in the field of e-commerce. According to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 650,000 Australians used the Internet to purchase goods for private use in the 12 months to May 1999, up from 409,000 Australians in the 12 months to May 1998. These figures highlight the need for protective legislation for both business and the consumer. As I have already indicated, in general, Labor supports this bill. I am pleased also to be able to support the process that led to its development. So often this government has failed to 11006 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 consult with the community and small businesses, or it has held token consultations and then ignored the stakeholder's view in pursuit of its own agenda. But I note that most of this bill reflects the recommendations of the Attorney-General's Electronic Commerce Expert Group which was formed in 1997. There are, however, a number of weaknesses in this proposed legislation. Firstly, the bill only applies to transactions under Commonwealth law. This is contrary to the recommendations of the expert group. I know the Attorney-General is of the view that to attempt to apply the bill to states law could be unconstitutional. I can only hope that he has researched this matter carefully and taken advice from all quarters on this because what we have left is a proposed Commonwealth law, with the possibility of the states and territories bringing in their own contrary laws, thus leading to chaos. We have been assured that the government has obtained an in-principle agreement from states and territories that they will legislate in line with this bill. Based. on the history of agreements between the states, territories and this federal government, I say, 'Don't hold your breath.' I would therefore urge the House to support our amendments that seek to firm up the commitment of the states by way of a referral of powers or at least a national uniform scheme. My colleagues on this side of the House have spoken eloquently and at length about this matter and the need to legislate to the maximum extent possible. Therefore, I want to tum my attention to another issue which is of great concern to me. This bill represents, I believe, a lost opportunity to reform Australia's hodgepodge of consumer protection laws. As I understand it, the legislation will, by default, apply the consumer protection laws of a given jurisdiction in each case. This just exacerbates the problems businesses and con-tituents in my electorate, and across Australia, are already dealing with. If one of my constituents in Stirling purchases a product or a service via the Internet from a business registered in New South Wales, they are then subject to the consumer protection laws in that state. So businesses and consumers are placed in a situation where the only way to be sure about their rights and obligations in relation to trade is to understand each and every jurisdiction they deal with. We are familiar with this problem. It comes up all the time-for instance, defamation laws, state industrial relations legislation and the list goes on. I worked for a community legal centre for the past 6Y2 years and many of the issues we helped people with were sorting out interstate transactions, purchases or matters of employment. It is a difficulty, particularly when departments and community services in each state have different names. I am disappointed that, when a prime opportunity arose for this government to nationalise consumer protection laws, they did not seize it. I suspect that, in the future, as we hear of cases where people have been caught out because of this jurisdictional demarcation, we will regret this opportunity lost. Not all people have the money to employ a lawyer in their own state and in another state to sort out a problem because there are no national consumer protection laws. As I and other speakers from this side of the House have pointed out, this bill is somewhat flawed. We have put forward amendments to address the most problematic of these flaws. But I think we all agree that, despite its flaws, the Electronic Transactions Bill is a positive move in the right direction and it will allow for the continued development of electronic commerce in Australia. "" Wednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 11007 Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin) (11.58 a.m.)-The opposition's spin on the Electronic Transactions Bill 1999 is becoming just a little banal. All morning I have been listening to members opposite acknowledging the aims or the objectives of government legislation, but they are not bringing themselves to embrace entirely the particular bill as it reflects inevitably Liberal philosophy-and in this case, the long-held Liberal values of minimal government interference and the rights of the states. This bill should be read and understood in the current context, and that is what the opposition has failed to do. To be sure, the member for Stirling expresses her profound disappointment but we are not operating in a static domestic environment. It is all very well for the member for Barton to say that we have been too timid and not adventurous enough. We should have been more rigid and come down in some heavy-handed fashion on the states and found the constitutional power to unify prescriptive legislation for each state. But he overlooks entirely what this legislation aims to do. It is part of an overall statutory regime. It is designed to create a framework to manage the ever-evolving and emerging challenges of the infonnation economy and e-commerce. In fonnulating policy to deal with the e-commerce momentum, and in considering what role a federal government ought to play, we should be mindful of what we are dealing with here: business over the Net. A whole new mind-set is called for, a mind-set that takes account of the properties of the Internet. It is a global phenomenon knowing no national boundaries, and the depth and extent of its explosive changes are able to impact on business practices and procedures in a way not witnessed previously. Certainly, throughout this century, each wave of new technology has changed the world in unforeseeable ways, but it may take decades before we see how the Internet reshapes society and human behaviour once it becomes a mature technology. Already, irreversible social and cultural transitions have been triggered. The Economist in a recent article on the Internet entitled 'When companies connect' observed that it was over 100 years ago when the British economist Alfred Marshall wrote in his Principles of economics that: The full importance of an epoch-making idea is often not perceived in the generation in which it is made And there is no doubt that the Internet is an epoch-making idea. It is almost a cliche to say that the Internet is changing everything as we knew it. The challenge is to guess what is changing, how and how quickly. From its obscure beginnings 30 years ago as a computer network created by the US military's Advanced Research Projects Agency, going on line in 1969 as a fonn of military communication, to its evolution in the mid-1980s as the largest collection of computer networks throughout the world-from its beginnings as a fonn of communication for the military, then for research and intelligence, then education and now its commercialisation-it may well be a generation, as Marshall would suggest, for the full impact of the Internet to be realised in tenns of the reshaping of society and human behaviour. Internet technology is making its presence felt in every corner of the globe, and the power of the Internet goes way beyond emails and online transactions. It is reshaping the way businesses operate; it is transfonning the way educators teach students, doctors treat patients or governments deliver services. The infonnation economy is the driving force in world trade today. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has estimated that, by the year 2000, the global value of goods and services transacted over the Internet will be around 11008 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September. 1999 $USI00 billion to $US150 billion each year. In the US alone, e-commerce is set to rise from about $12 billion this year to over $40 billion within the next two years. Such predictions are conservative. Governments around the world, not just in Australia, are presently determining the most effective legal framework for the long-term management of this essentially global phenomenon. But governments as well as business and industry are stepping into uncharted territory. Issues of privacy, authentication, encryption, content control and security will continue to be issues in the legal, philosophical and technical debates surrounding e-commerce and Internet usage for some time to come. With increasing numbers of online contracts spanning different jurisdictions, there is a need for national governments to adopt common standards for the efficacy of electronic contracts, and Australian businesses realise that, to remain competitive in a global market, they need to embrace the benefits of e-commerce. The Australian government supports business in that aim by our commitment to promoting e-commerce by working to, in the words of the Prime Minister in the Investing for Growth policy statement: . . . foster business and consumer confidence through a light touch regulatory framework. In that December 1997 statement, the Prime Minister also committed the government to bring appropriate services online by 2001,the intention being for the government to provide leadership in e-commerce by becoming a leading edge user of information technology. In framing legislation for legal recognition of technological devices, such as electronic authentication, the government understands that cooperation with private sector industries is essential. I reject entirely the suggestion emanating from the member for Stirling that such cooperation has not been sought or, indeed, given. So in the context in which we consider this legislation, we have got to include the government's commitment to ensuring Australians enjoy the social and economic benefits offered by the explosion in the information economy and that such legislation reflects the reality of the community's increasing recognition of the value of the Internet and e-commerce. Statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics bear out the belief that Australia has one of the highest take-up rates in the world of digital and information technology. Virtually all businesses use computer technology in some form and even a high percentage of small businesses are connected to the Internet. The business user statistics tell their own story. In May 1999, 48 per cent of small businesses and 82 per cent of medium businesses were connected to the Internet. Those are increases of 41 per cent and 26 per cent respectively from the previous 12 months. In May 1999, 12 per cent of small businesses and 18 per cent of medium businesses were selling online. Those are increases of 140 per cent in the case of small businesses and 50 per cent in the case of medium businesses over the previous 12 months. The value of private electronic transactions in the 12 months to November 1998 was in the order of $110 million, according to an ABS estimate. About 18 per cent of small businesses and 48 per cent of medium businesses have a home page. Nearly all large businesses have a home page. I am particularly interested in these statistics, there being about 10,000 registered businesses in my electorate of Curtin. They are mostly retail and service businesses. The user statistics of Australian households online are equally impressive: 5Yz million adult Australians accessed the Internet in the 12 months to May 1999. That is an increase of 500,000, or 9.3 per cent, from the February 1999 figures, compared with 1.5 million, or a 53.7 Wednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 11009 per cent increase, over the same 12-month period to May 1998. Households with Internet access rose to 22.2 per cent. There were 1.52 million households in May 1999, compared to 14.2 per cent in May 1998. Personal home pages abound. Most significantly, over 650,000 Australians used the Internet to purchase goods and services for private use in the 12 months to May 1999, up from 409,000 in the 12 months to May 1998. SoI think rapid uptake is a given. The challenge for the federal government is to make policy for this global phenomenon and, in doing so, determine the extent of direct government regulation of the Internet infrastructure. There was some argument early in the piece that we should not legislate and that we should allow e-commerce impediments to be removed either by individual contractual arrangements or by self-regulation. The government rejects this argument. It would not give the expected level of certainty for business. Minimalist legislation will facilitate the development and usage of e-commerce. It will provide the vehicle for harmonising the laws governing e-commerce across Australia. It will facilitate international recognition and enforcement of Australian electronic transactions. It will streamline regulatory processes and reduce administrative burdens. The guiding principle for the government in establishing a legal framework was to reflect that competitive based market solutions are to be favoured, wherever possible, with intervention in the market by the government only to ensure that the online environment is a safe place to do business. The government's approach, as demonstrated by this bill, includes ensuring equitable access to the Internet, favouring industry self-regulation and ensuring national approaches are consistent with internationally agreed positions. Because of the very nature of the Internet, it is the policy of the government to keep regulation at a minimalist position at this stage. Essentially, the bill gives legal efficacy to electronic communications when dealing with government agencies. The bill removes legal impediments that may prevent a person using electronic communications to satisfy obligations under Commonwealth law. The bill echoes many of the sentiments of various reports that were prepared during 1998. It is, as the member for Stirling pointed out, specifically based on the recommendations of the Electronic Commerce Expert Group, which reported to the Attorney-General in March 1998. This group recommended that legislation be enacted on the basis of the United Nation Commission on International Trade's Model Law on Electronic Commerce of 1996 with some modifications. That is what this bill is. It recognises that it is essential for there to be a degree of international cohesiveness in what we introduce by way of legislation. The model law was designed as a template to provide national legislators with a set of internationally acceptable rules designed to remove legal obstacles for the use of electronic communications. In doing so, the model law created a more secure legal environment for e-commerce. Its aim was to provide some prospect for uniformity on a global level, something needed for a technology that does not easily recognise national or international boundaries. Following the expert group's recommendations, the government developed a uniform national legislative scheme for e-commerce, in consultation with the states and territories. This bill is part of that scheme, a minimalist approach to regulating online transactions. The criticism of the member for Barton, I suggest, is off the mark. The light touch approach is indeed the right one at this time. It is criticised as a somewhat contemplative or timid approach. But many 11010 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 jurisdictions, including the US, have now implemented or are implementing their e-commerce laws. Given the need for international consistency in e-commerce regulation, our approach gives us the opportunity to test the waters, to be flexible. For example, some jurisdictions have enacted technology specific legislation dealing with 'digital signatures', a term which refers to a particular type of signature technology. An electronic signature is the electronic method of identification that is adopted by a person with intent to be bound by or to authenticate a record. A digital signature, on the other hand, is a subset of electronic signatures that transform a message through the use of an asymmetric cryptosystem. Ms JULIE BISHOP-I am about to. This is fascinating. It is not a digital copy of your handwritten signature. It is created by the generation of two mathematically related keys. Each party in a transaction has two keys, a public key and a private key. The sender of the message encrypts the document with the public key of the recipient and then sends it to that person. The recipient is then able, using the private key, to decrypt the message. The private key can be used to sign a document, and the public key is able to be used to read the signature. The law in the field of digital signatures is very much emerging. It is very popular in some US states, from an extremely comprehensive approach taken in Utah, for example, where the legislation was devised to permit commercial use of digital signatures, to a much more limited approach taken in other states, limiting their enacted legislation to the use of digital signatures in documents filed electronically with the particular state. So there is no uniformity state to state. There is no uniform model law. In Europe, even though the European Commission published a draft directive on the legal framework for the use of electronic signatures, which was aimed at harmonising the conditions for authenticating digital signatures at the EU level, serious divisions among the 15 European member states have prevented the approval of the proposal establishing the framework for the use of digital signatures, because of disagreement over the conditions that would have to apply to the particular technology used. We have not made that mistake. In particular, some of the member countries expressed concern that the provisions would give consumers a false sense of security because technology is changing so fast that, within three years, new technology will be on the market to circumvent the conditions applicable to the prescribed technology. It is for these and similar reasons that our bill adopts many of the model law principles, including technology neutrality-that is, no discrimination between different forms of technology-and media neutrality or functional equivalence, whereby electronic and physical transactions will be equally regulated, so payment over the Internet is the same as payment in person, for example. In other words, legal recognition of electronic equivalents to signature and paper based documents is provided. . The basic rule established by the bill is that a transaction will not be invalid because it took place, in whole or in part, by electronic means. The requirement for a signature is satisfied if 'a method is used to identify the person and to indicate the person's approval of the information communicated' and the method was 'appropriately reliable;. Because the bill does not specify a method for the approval specification of recognition of particular signature technology and thereby endorsing particular electronic signature technologies, it does not have to be amended to take account of technological change. This is a really positive feature of the bill: it takes into account the dynamic nature of technology development and does not lock",165,Representatives Main Committee
397,Mr Sercombe,"--That is an interesting term. Can you explain it to me afterwards?Wednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 11011 us into inefficient or less effective technologies. As a complement, the government has established the National Authentication Council to oversee the development of a national framework for electronic authentication of online activity, again not requiring a particular form of digital signature be used but overseeing the development of technical standards and codes of practice. By virtue of the provisions of this bill, the requirement to give information in writing to produce a document, record information or retain a document can also be met in electronic form. Electronic transactions currently operate on the basis of the law as it has evolved over centuries with respect to the more traditional business transactions, practices and procedures. Contract law, as I was taught at law school, certainly highlighted the need for certainty, the need for writing, the need to identify the parties, authentication of signature or corporate seal, the best evidence rule-sight the original not the copy-and the assumptions that are made about the date and time of dispatch and the receipt of communications, all underpinning business confidence. It enabled business to be conducted in a stable, reliable environment based on a body of law giving predictable legal effects. But the growth of Internet based ecommerce has turned all these concepts on their head-fundamental concepts like writing, signature, witnessing, original, copy, service by post and the like. Things my contracts lecturer could not have even dreamt of teaching me. This bill recognises that the continually evolving nature of technology and its continually evolving impact on the way business is conducted mean that we have just got to accept that some of the new working practices and the dazzling new technology, the virtual environments and the like, can be approaching an 'old hat' status even before some of us come to hear of them. The criticism of those opposite essentially is that the bill is too restricted in its application, applying as it does to transactions, communications, signatures and record keeping requirements of specified Commonwealth laws, and then, from 1 July 2001, applying to all Commonwealth laws unless specifically exempted. And the opposition asks why the Commonwealth has legislated in respect of its own laws and not those of the states. The Attorney-General has confirmed that national agreement haS been reached on uniform legislation to remove legal obstacles to e-commerce in Australia. That agreement was by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, which has agreed in principle to the proposal for an Australia model law to facilitate e-commerce. I suggest that is the correct approach. While this bill is part of a national scheme, through enactment by the Commonwealth and the states and territories, it will operate independently of any legislation in any other jurisdiction and takes effect immediately upon its commencement. There is clear constitutional authority for each· jurisdiction to enact legislation within that jurisdiction dealing with e-commerce. Mr Deputy Speaker, this is like Groundhog Day with the clock going that way! As the Managing Director and CEO of IBM Australia, Mr Robert Savage, said to the Business Council of Australia recently in respect of this bill: In the long tenn, the success of e-business in Australia will depend on a balance being achieved between the flexibility required by individual organisations and the need for a legislative framework that provides standards and methods in this new paradigm. I commend this bill to the House. often talked about electronic commerce and the Internet, I think it is no exaggeration to say that we are living through a technological revolution which, in a very short time, is changing",174,Representatives Main Committee
398,Mr Sercombe (Maribyrnong) (12.17 P.m.),"At the risk of adding to the hype that is11012 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 our society and our economy and that that change is global. There is change on a scale probably even greater than that of the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century. Concerning the Internet, the global user population is expected to grow at 30 per cent per annum to over half a billion people by the year 2003, and global electronic commerce this year is expected to top $US100 billion on its way to over $US700 billion in three years. Australia must position itself so that our business and economy are taking advantage of the opportunities of this technological revolution; otherwise we will lose out to others, most probably the United States. It is worth noting that a high level of business and consumer confidence in electronic commerce is a necessary condition for Australia to maximise its advantage. The Electronic Transactions Bi1l1999, which has come before the House after a very lengthy time, is really a pretty minimal approach to this matter, as the government itself says. From the opposition's point of view it has a number of significant deficiencies, although we are going to support it in the absence of anything better. It is pleasing to hear the member for Curtin indicate that apparently, according to her, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has now agreed in principle to some uniformity in relation to these matters. I must say that that has taken an extraordinary length of time, if in fact it is correct. I do notice it is only an in-principle agreement, according to the member for Curtin. I certainly hope, in the interests of maximising certainty, that the information is correct. as it does in responding quickly in a whole range of areas of business regulations-appears to be some sort of demarcation dispute that exists between the Attorney-General and the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation. The extraordinary length of time the Commonwealth is taking to respond to the High Court decision in relation to the cross-vesting of powers is an example. The sort of conflict that seems to exist-the demarcation dispute that seems to exist-between the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation and the Attorney-General is, I suspect, one of the reasons why this bill has taken so long to get to the House. I think the shadow Attorney-General has fairly adequately discussed a number of issues in respect of the legislation. From the point of view of the legislative base from which the Commonwealth seeks to operate, this government appears to have failed to provide the strong national leadership that the Electronic Commerce Expert Group called upon it to provide. The bill has not been set up as a national scheme law. This can lead to divergence in approaches between the states, although one hopes that the in-principle agreement that the member for Deakin advises me was reached in May will hold up. The position, certainly in the member for Deakin's and my home state, has been that the Victorian government has had a discussion paper on its electronic commerce framework bill before it for some time-in fact, I think since December of last year. That particular discussion paper makes remarks about the absence of suitable federal initiatives being the basis upon which Victoria has felt the need to proceed. remain Victorian policy to modify its bill, as necessary, if substantial uniform national legislation were enacted.

402,Mr Sercombe,"Yes, I would think so. The discussion paper also states that it wouldWednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 11013 of states rights issue here in relation to it establishing a national framework in this matter does not seem to be borne out by the Victorian government's approach under the soon not to be so lamented Kennett government. It really is difficult to understand .why the federal government has not taken a more creative and leadership oriented approach as its own experts have asked it to do. The problem with not having a national approach can be seen in the United States, for example, where I understand jurisdictional disputes are very much at the heart of early litigation in relation to Internet services. I understand that in a number of cases courts have found that a service provider or a content provider in a remote web site can be held liable under the law of the state where the person accessed the web site. Other cases have found that more than merely offering or accessing a web site is required to ground jurisdiction. So the experience in the US certainly adds weight to the need for a national approach on this, given that the purpose of legislation in this area is to provide the sort of business and community certainty necessary for electronic commerce to flower. For example, the government could well have adopted the approach that under the telecommunications power in section 51 of the Constitution it has the power in this respect, and it could have legislated to the extent of its powers in that respect. The bill could have provided a more adequate framework, as in the Federal Evidence Act, or an alternative framework, as in the Year 2000 Information Disclosure Bill, to make it clear that the Commonwealth was legislating to the maximum of its powers. But that has not happened. We have a very minimal bill, and that is disappointing. The legislation, as I indicated, is supposed to address the issue of providing a greater degree of certainty. A crucial issue in relation to certainty is the matter of the reliability of electronic commerce. Section 10 of the bill illustrates this issue. That section provides that if, under the law of the Commonwealth, the signature of a person is required, that requirement can be taken to have been met in an electronic communication if a person can be identified and indicates their approval to the information communicated and 'having regard to all of the relevant circumstances at the time the method was used, the method was as reliable as was appropriate for the purposes for which the information was communicated'. It would appear that that definition really is leaving it very much to the market to determine what is reliable. The government is not seeking to provide an adequate definition of what reliability is. So much for national leadership! There is no progress in the bill in establishing an adequate framework for the authentication of electronic messages. There is no progress in providing a widely accepted framework for determining what is reliable for electronic signatures and the reliability, security and confidentiality of electronic messages, despite the work that has been done on these very issues by Standards Australia and the National Office of the Information Economy on identifying possible approaches for the federal government to take in this matter. Section 14 of the bill, dealing with time and place of dispatch and receipt of electronic communications, also leaves a number of uncertainties. For instance, section 14(1) attempts to determine the time of dispatch of an electronic communication by stating that the time of dispatch will occur when the communication enters an information system outside the control of the sender. This appears to disregard some technical aspects in the sending of emails. For instance, will an electronic communication be regarded as dispatched even if it is bounced 11014 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 from one server to another and eventually comes back to the sender without actually having arrived at its original destination? Another similar issue occurs in section 14(4). That section provides that, if a recipient of an electronic communication has not designated an information system for the purpose of receiving an electronic communication, then, unless the parties otherwise agree, the time of receipt of the electronic communication is the time when that communication 'comes to the attention of the recipient'. Determining this time may be extremely difficult. Is it that time when the message was received by the server or the particular mailbox to which a message was originally dispatched? Also missing in the legislation is an adequate provision for data protection, and that is particularly important in the context of the decision of the European Union to establish a framework. There has been real concern in Australian industry that participants in electronic commerce will be impeded in transacting online with European Union members, as our current data protection laws are not as stringent as those required by the European Union directive. I think that, here again, there are serious problems which need to be adequately addressed. The member for Curtin referred to comments made in relation to this legislation by Robert Savage, who is the Managing Director and CEO of IBM Australia, in a recent pUblication of the Business Council of Australia and seemed to be quoting some of his remarks as some sort of support for the approach the government is taking. Mr Savage is quoted as saying: . the Commonwealth Bill as it presently stands provides little guidance to the courts on whether a particular technology satisfies each particular legal requirement. On the first occasion that any particular issue arises, it will therefore need to be the subject of careful argument by the protagonists before the court; . the Commonwealth Bill establishes no mechanism whereby any particular technology could be declared to satisfy any particular legal requirement. Adoption of formal standards and careful drafting of contractual terms might help, but for them to deliver a high degree of confidence, they would still need to be tested in the court. It is difficult to see how this bill is going to provide the sorts of levels of certainty and confidence that Australians need in electronic commerce when so much of it is still subject to what may well be lengthy and protracted litigation. The approach the government is taking and their rationalisation of that approach on the basis of being light handed and minimal is not really fundamentally addressing some of the issues that I have referred to, and that view is supported, as I indicated, by no less a person than the Chief Executive Officer of IBM. The bill also fails to address appropriate consumer protection measures. Once again the question of confidence is important in terms of electronic commerce, and the differences that may very well arise because of the Commonwealth's failure to provide national leadership across jurisdictional boundaries in this matter will impact adversely on consumers and is a failure of this particular legislation. This government in its approach to the Internet, and its approach to electronic matters generally, is guilty of sins of both omission and commission. We have seen sins of commission with its unworkable attempts to regulate some aspects of Internet content in a very heavyhanded way. That approach to the Internet and the problems that arise on the Internet, which all members of this parliament agree need to be addressed, is simply not going to be workable in the form in which the government has approached it. Wednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 11015 In this particular case we have got a government that is guilty of sins of omission simply because it is not adopting the approach that is needed by Australian business and Australian consumers for higher degrees of certainty in terms of access to electronic commerce and the use of electronic commerce. As I started offby saying, given the massive growth in electronic commerce that we can envisage into the very near future, and the importance of that in terms of the competitiveness of Australian business and Australian industry, this government's failure in that respect is something that is pretty appalling. The opposition, as the shadow Attorney-General has indicated, supports the legislation in the absence of anything better, but the government really should not take any great credit for this particular bill. It is very minimal, it is very inadequate, and I am sure we are going to be back here on a number of occasions addressing those matters. Regrettably, it is typical of the government's approach to business regulation generally. The Prime Minister really ought to do something about sorting out this jurisdictional blue that is going on between his two ministers because, as I indicated earlier, as in that massively important area for Australian business, the High Court's intervention on cross-vesting, it is just not good enough for Australian business to have to wear the consequences of this government's failures. Transactions Bill 1999 as it is an example of the Commonwealth taking the lead and setting an example. By giving official and legal status to electronic transactions we are sending a message to the community that this method of doing business is with us to stay. We are saying you can have full confidence and trust in it as a means of conducting your business transactions. We are sending a message that it is safer and quicker to engage in electronic transactions rather than the traditional, time consuming, but often comfortable paper and faceto-face transactions. We are also conveying the message to the states that we expect them to honour their commitment to introduce complementary state legislation, as they indicated they would to the Attorney-General as recently as May this year. In order to understand the reasoning behind this bill it is important to understand how electronic commerce and the entire Internet industry have changed dramatically over the last few years. There are any number of issues related to business and vast opportunities presented to business by the expansion of electronic commerce. I remember a few years ago the Microsoft ad for its Internet browser. Very simply, it posed the question, 'Where do you want to go to today?' A couple of years later I am just starting to comprehend the depth of that question. The answer, of course, is anywhere your imagination can take you. Believe me, there are some people out there with an extremely vivid imagination and it has taken them places hitherto undreamed of. The Internet is the prime example of globalisation. It has brought the world not just into our boardrooms but into our living rooms at home. It is television with which we can interact. Recently, I connected my home computer to the Internet and I have been amazed at how quickly one can become hooked. While helping my son surf the Net, he said to me, 'Dad, the Internet is telling us to buy this product now. We'd better go and do it.' How times have changed. The old belief that if it is in the newspaper it must be true apparently has been supplanted by belief in the Net. How big is the Internet today? It is a hard question, but we can say that it is nowhere near as big as it will be in 10 minutes time. One recent estimate put the contribution of e-commerce in the US economy last year at $455 million in revenue and 1.2 million jobs.",176,Representatives Main Committee
403,Mr Barresi (Deakin) (12.32 P.m.),"I am pleased to speak in the debate on the Electronic11016 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 The Australian evidence is just as compelling. Small to medium enterprises have responded to the technology age, with 82 per cent of small businesses and 99 per cent of medium sized businesses using computers. Thirteen per cent of all small and medium enterprises are using the Net to sell products and services. Estimations are that will more than double in the next year. Given the amount of activity in the sector, this bill is a timely contribution to the future of electronic commerce in Australia. That we are debating it here in the Main Committee, the chamber reserved for non-controversial legislation, is somewhat ironic, given the ever-growing and ever-changing nature of cyberspace. Recently, I challenged an audience to find a page in a newspaper or a magazine that does not contain the word Internet or list at least one web .site address. Today, it is a difficult, if not impossible task. Electronic commerce, as we term transactions conducted via computer hook-up, is a growing business and it is growing fast. Many have asked if this boom is for real. Kerry Packer thinks so. He recently launched his second major cyber venture and backed it with a lot of money. Merrill Lynch, the respected multinational broking firm, now allows its 5.4 million customers to do their dealings on the Net at a substantial discount. I somehow believe this is not an act of altruism on the part of Merrill Lynch, rather an acknowledgment that e-commerce cuts the cost of doing business rather substantially. We now see on television as promoting E-Trade Australia, which is encouraging us to use the Net to buy and sell stocks. IBM Business Solutions have weighed in heavily of late, advertising during prime time. Tuesday's Financial Review has an e-directory of online business players. At present, it is a full page of companies and web site addresses, and I predict that the Australian Financial Review will have to, in the very near future, discontinue this feature because there will be too many to list. According to a recent survey, 23 per cent of small businesses are connected to the Internet, with 69 per cent planning their own home page. Australia today ranks eighth among 55 surveyed countries as an information based economy. We boast 27 computers for every 100 people. In our household, there are three computers-one for each child, and mum and dad have to wait their turn. Aside from business applications and retailing of goods, provision of financial services, banking and legal and medical services are all part of e-commerce. Amounts spent in these areas are already substantial. The percentage of users buying goods and services on the web is expected to grow from 8.8 per cent in 1996 to 33.4 per cent in 2001. This explains why our retailicg sector is increasingly worried about the future of patrons coming through doors. An interesting statistic from the United States shows that new car sales from showrooms in California are down 40 per cent because of online competition. People are buying their cars through the Net in California. Therefore, it is conceivable that, within 10 to 15 years, car dealerships as we know them will be a thing of the past. Why have such a valuable floor space taken up by thousands of dollars of automotive stock? The same will take place in other retailing businesses. Simply put, the Internet presents endless possibilities for rapid delivery of services. While there is considerable angst in rural and regional Australia on a perceived loss of services such as banking, it may be that e-commerce will be able to breach this shortfall. That will be so partiCUlarly if those communities that are more comfortable with person-to-person dealings can embrace a perhaps colder but more efficient way of doing business. Wednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 11017 I represent Deakin, an electorate that is becoming the IT and communications centre of Australia. I am keen to see the expansion of and further advancements in communications. There is a proposal in my electorate by one particular businessman to set up a virtual reality village, whereby all the services in the area will be accessible through the Net supported by the local city council. These sorts of ideas will, in the next few years, start to overtake our own imagination. This legislation will help to give confidence, trust and credibility to industries to be able to embrace these ideas knowing that their transactions are secure. New technologies have enormous potential to foster legitimate and new commercial activities. In the 1990s the Internet has become accessible to an ever-increasing number of individuals, corporations, governments and interest groups. It is a decentralised tool. Data can be accessed and distributed from just about anywhere in the world. It is used as a means of communication by individuals, groups and organisations, as a source of information and education, for entertainment and for business. The potential for business to be transacted and goods and services to be sold and purchased over the net creates an enormous potential for commerce in markets worldwide. Efficiency gains from the use of electronic commerce can be enormous. For example, the costs of transacting business and defining, protecting and enforcing the property rights to goods and assets amount to a staggering 45 per cent of the United States national income. This bill will aid the further development of the information economy of Australia by broadly removing the existing legal impediments that may prevent a person using electronic communications to satisfy obligations under Commonwealth law. It will give business and the community the option of using electronic communications when dealing with government agencies. Using recommendations from the Electronic Commerce Expert Group, the legislation is based on the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Model Law on Electronic Commerce of 1996. The model law contains a set of internationally acceptable rules designed to remove a number of legal obstacles to the use of electronic communications for the communication of legally significant information, thereby creating a more secure legal environment for electronic commerce. The bill will allow electronic communications to satisfy existing legal requirements for writingsignature, document production and the retention of documents, subject to certain minimum requirements. It does not discriminate between different forms of technology. All governments in Australia are trying to maximise their opportunities in the information age and have given their in-principle support to writing legislation based on this bill. It is appropriate at this time to also talk about the fact that electronic commerce can be subjected to criminal manipUlation. There is a need for us to make sure that we present opportunities for electronic commerce through legislation but we must do so in a way which guards against endless possibilities of illegal activity, which includes such things as damaging or interfering with defence and other data processing and telecommunications systems; the electronic funds transfer crime-electronic money laundering to disguise the proceeds of crime or to avoid taxation of legitimately gained income; the use of telecommunication systems to further organise drug trafficking, gambling, prostitution, arms trafficking and other illegal activities; and, of course, the scourge of all of us, the spreading of viruses through the Internet and on the email. 11018 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 The very features of the Internet which make it such an exciting medium-its enormous reach and anonymity for users-also create enormous potential for it to be used to aid existing forms of crime and to generate new crimes. The Internet does, however, have potential uses as a crime prevention tool. As one leading criminologist said recently, although its potential is yet to be realised, the use of technology for general public relations, for the communication of basic information for crime prevention and for the exchange of information in furthering of criminal investigation, may be expected to increase dramatically in the years ahead. Already, photographs displayed on the Internet have led to the arrest of fugitives. The activities of pornographers and software pirates may be traced effectively using the information available on the Internet. Australians are enthusiastic users of new technologies, and in no way are we immune from those perils. In terms of reducing risk to legitimate e-commerce, the developments of an effective encryption system is vital. Australian criminologists and lawyers are among the foremost analysts of telecommunications and technological crime in the world. Cryptography is being used by the Australian government as a means to combat fraud in the conduct of electronic transactions. Encryption ensures confidentiality of data by transforming it into data which is unintelligible to third parties. Decryption converts the unintelligible data back into its normal intelligible form. The uses of cryptography, including encrypting communications and the creating of digital signatures, will help in safeguarding against such criminal activity. It is important that we create and maintain a climate that encourages technology innovation, supports legitimate electronic commerce, and ensures privacy and security for consumers who use the Internet. This legislation is part of that wave of ensuring that we have provided safeguards to consumers not only, in the first instance, in their dealings with the Commonwealth, but also in having that confidence to go out and create new products, look at new service deliveries and know that their transactions have the full backing of law. The opposition has pointed to some shortfalls. I believe that anything that moves as fast as this particular industry is something with which we are going to be tested and which we will have difficulty in being able to keep up with. This legislation is the first part of that process. I look forward to state governments and other jurisdictions following suit and the public in general embracing electronic commerce as a new way of doing business. General has indicated, the opposition is broadly in support of the Electronic Transactions Bill 1999. It seeks to enable electronic commerce to have the same kind of sound legal footing that ordinary commerce has enjoyed under common and statute law in this country for well over 100 years now. As electronic commerce moves throughout the world, recent OECD and United States reports have indicated that we will be talking many hundreds of billions of dollars in a few short years time. Clearly electronic commerce needs the same kind of statutory and common law footing for its undertakings as ordinary commercial transactions have had. This will guarantee that citizens can rightly have confidence in the way in which those transactions are undertaken and be certain that the legal system will stand behind them in disputes. Businesses can be sure that they have a solid basis to undertake the transactions with consumers. People will not be able to walk away from those transactions, and businesses can gain the productivity and efficiency benefits which electronic commerce promises. Without a sound legal footing, those efficiency",179,Representatives Main Committee
404,Mr Martyn Evans (Bonython) (12.46 P.m.),"As my colleague the shadow AttorneyWednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 11019 and productivity gains will be very light indeed and very difficult to put into effect. It is the basis oflaw on which the system operates which guarantees that those efficiency gains offered by electronic communication, the Internet and e-commerce in general can be translated into real gains for business and consumers throughout the country. This legislation represents a very good tentative and first step into the area of electronic commerce regulation by the government. It is unfortunate, as my colleague the shadow Attorney-General has said, that this did not come sooner. It is unfortunate that the government has not taken the opportunity to more aggressively pursue with their colleagues in the states a more national basis for this legislation. Nonetheless, that does not in any way counter the beneficial effect of this legislation. I certainly encourage the government to proceed further with it to see how a more national approach can be adopted. The referral of powers by the states is one option, but a more aggressively pursued cooperative regime by the Commonwealth will be very important. It needs to take place very quickly because this, as honourable members opposite have said, is a rapidly evolving area and we do not want to wait too long. Also, as other speakers have indicated, we do not want to be too prescriptive about the technology which we are supporting in the law. The legislation must be enabling but it must not be prescriptive or attempt to pick winners in the area of particular technologies. The market should be allowed to determine what it will support by way of digital signature verification, for example, and all those areas of technology which underlie electronic commerce transactions. The parliament should attempt to enable those areas. It should attempt to give legal and statutory underpinning to electronic commerce without attempting to determine which technologies will be the winning technologies in the years ahead. No doubt they will change many times over the next few years. The parliament must move aggressively to secure people's rights and to ensure that dealing with the Commonwealth in an electronic form is even more convenient than dealing with the Commonwealth in person or by correspondence. That is an area in which the Commonwealth has a long way to go. I encourage the government to look further at ways in which it can be a market leader and a principal investor in this technology, ensuring that its own business affairs are conducted via the Internet so that people can ensure a sound domestic base is established for these transactions and business is encouraged to move because of market leadership by the Commonwealth. The investment which the Commonwealth can make in these transactions will underpin investment by business. Again that is not in specific technologies, in terms of the legislation, but very much in terms of enabling those processes to occur and in being a leading investor in these technologies so that the public can gain confidence in them and so that business will have a sound domestic base on which to build its own investment in this area. I would like to tum to areas of this debate which might appear at first sight to be more esoteric but which I think will underpin electronic commerce in the future and which we ignore at our peril. One of those is the encryption debate. Colleagues opposite have indicated the importance of encryption as an underlying means of securing electronic commerce, of securing privacy over the Internet, of securing the protection of data and of generally providing for public and business confidence in the integrity of these systems and the validation of identity by electronic means-something which it is not so easy to do. As the saying on the Internet goes, 'On the Internet no-one knows you are a dog.' The reality is that over the Internet no-one knows either that you are Martyn Evans or Alan Cadman or whatever. So some method of 11020 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 1999 evaluating people's identity, of confinning that the transaction is indeed taking place between the parties that they represent themselves to be, is also very important. Those things are all underpinned by encryption. Encryption was once the sole preserve of secret agents and defence departments, and indeed was jealously guarded by those people and held tightly to their electronic chests so that they were the only ones who had this technology. And, indeed, in the fifties and sixties that was a valid assumption for government to make. It was important that government held those secrets as national security issues and preserved its own ability to undertake secret communications, but excluded the general public, and in particular criminals, terrorists and the like, from undertaking those kinds of secret communication. However, the reality is that electronic commerce has turned this whole argument completely on its head and it is now fundamental that government encourages-indeed, almost mandatesthe use of strong encryption in the community and in business, not only to ensure privacy but to ensure the invulnerability from attack by criminals, by terrorists, of private financial transactions, of our national infonnation infrastructure, as the Americans call it, and of our telephone networks, electricity networks, even the water supply network and so on. All of these things are underpinned. by electronic commerce and by computer systems. It is only through the use of encryption technology that they can all be properly safeguarded and protected and that public confidence in electronic commerce-which will be absolutely critical to the future building of electronic commerce in this country and throughout the world-can be sustained by strong encryption, as can the establishment of identity over the Internet. Governments still tend to cling to those 1950s national security/secret agent agendas. This government has made some attempt to move out of that era but, unfortunately, like the government in the United States, it still clings to some of those old ideas. I hope, in a spirit of bipartisanship in putting this idea forward, that the government will seriously examine its commitment to open, strong encryption technology in this country, with a view to supporting that solidly. Instead of holding back as if from the edge of a precipice, it should step forward and admit that the technology is now essential to electronic commerce and important to the average citizen and to business, and can no longer be held back from open use in the community because of fears about national security, criminal activity and the like. The reality is the whole debate has now been turned completely on its head. In order to protect citizens and business and government infrastructure from terrorists, criminals and others, it is essential that it is the good guys who now use the strong encryption technology, even if this will in some cases allow criminal elements to use that technology as well. The reality is that terrorists and criminals can buy strong encryption technology on the open market in the United States, they can download it from the Internet and they have access to it. We are excluding in some cases and we are failing to encourage the public to adopt this technology because of some lingering national security fears which are now very much outdated. It is possible to use strong encryption in this country without too much restriction. If you want to put that on your own computer, you can do so. But if you want to export that technology you face interrogation by the government. If you want to ensure that you are able to use that technology in your own networks, you face real bureaucratic difficulties in importing this technology from the United States and implementing it on your own network for electronic mail security. For example, the parliament has recently sought to bring into this country a security certificate for 128-bit encryption technology to use on our own internal mail Wednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 11021 system in Parliament House. It took months to get that technology validated from the United States, and that only brings us to 128-bit encryption. The average Internet browser in this country used by ordinary citizens is only good for 40-bit encryption. The technology we are proposing to use in Parliament House, which has taken much bureaucratic effort to get in place, is only 128-bit encryption. A few weeks ago, in the United States, scientists broke 512-bit encryption. It took them a fair bit of effort, they had to use a number of computers to do it, but the reality is that 512-bit public key encryption is now suspect. Yet we are encouraging the public to use 40-bit encryption and the parliament itself, after much effort, has only just proposed to move to 128-bit encryption. Clearly, we have a long way to go in this debate. It is time the government said, 'This whole thing is now completely different. We must insist on the public using very high levels of encryption, beyond 512-bit. The average person should be using 768-plus bits of encryption. For really sensitive material you would use much more. It is overkill, of course, but it does guarantee privacy, it does guarantee certainty of transactional identity and it does guarantee public confidence in the system. It secures our transactions against invasions by criminals.' Some people will say and the law enforcement agencies will say, 'This prevents us from listening in on other people's transactions. This prevents us listening to drug dealers who wish to exchange communications over the Internet on drug deals. This prevents us from deciphering and decrypting child pornography over the Internet.' If those people are serious, they can already use very strong public key encryption which they can download over the Internet. I downloaded, quite legally, pretty good privacy POP encryption from Norway, where it is up on the Internet. Many other people in this country have done the same thing. That offers 2,OOO-bit encryption and is unbreakable, I would suggest, even by the National Security Agency of the US-but who can tell? It is certainly unbreakable.in Australia. The reality is that if you can download that in 20 minutes over the Internet, then if you are serious about child pornography or you are serious about drug trafficking you will have already done that and you will not have any problem in defeating the law enforcement agencies. So those people already have that technology. It is important that we now get the rest of the community using it so that they can be safe from the people who would threaten their transactions, who would threaten their privacy and who would threaten the very foundations of electronic commerce. The fact that some people will continue to use that for criminal purposes should be made a serious offence. The use of cryptography to cover criminal transactions ought to be a serious offence in this country, because that would have put us on the correct basis forpenalising the criminals while encouraging the public and business as a whole to use encryption technology for what it is meant to be used for. And the government should be behind that. Law enforcement has been greatly assisted by technology in recent times-DNA fingerprinting, cameras in public places, the use of neural networks to track financial data transactions. In all those areas technology has delivered massive gains to law enforcement, and so it should-I am not against any of that at all. I think it is very important that law enforcement agencies stay on top of all of these new technologies and take maximum advantage from them. One technology offers a small degree of detriment to them. They should overlook that, see the greater good of electronic commerce in this country, take the other benefits which technology has delivered to them-DNA testing itself has delivered enormous benefits to law enforcement in this country and throughout the world-and live with the small 11022 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 September 199.9 problems, which they are already going to have to live with anyway, due to encryption technology. (Extension of time granted) Obviously, one of the few ways we can address this sensibly in the modem climate is to enter into some treaties with countries like the US and Europe to ensure that we have reciprocal obligations and rights b-tween our countries to allow encryption to flow between these countries and to allow export and development in the domestic market without restriction. I think the government should then proceed, having negotiated some international agreements in this regard, to review its domestic laws and to repeal some of the measures which we adopted here last year-for example, to force telecommunications companies and ISPs to decrypt on demand of the government any transmission which they have encrypted. I debated with honourable members in this very place a year ago the government's legislation which mandates the decryption without reference to the consumer or the business of any encrypted message which an ISP or a telecommunications service provider has encrypted. That technology itself, once the public understands that measure, will severely undermine confidence in electronic commerce. The government should step back from that and criminalise the use of cryptography for criminal purposes but at the same time encourage and remove those laws which provide for the decryption of those messages because they will undermine public confidence. That is the reality of this, and there is no way of avoiding that outcome when the public know that their messages can be decrypted. It is for that very same reason that mandatory key escrow systems will also not work. If the public know that either the government or some third party is holding decrypt keys for their messages, then they will not trust the security of those messages. Any attempt to use those mandatory key escrow technologies will also be unsuccessful in the long run. We might as well admit that now and make a virtue of the necessity and move forward on the legislation and the technology and gain the maximum advantage for Australian business. The reality is that the United States is very rapidly moving in this direction. Having resisted it strongly for years, having declared the export of encryption technology be the same as the export of dangerous munitions, the United States a few days ago announced new policies on encryption technology which I think will rapidly lead to the removal of all restrictions on the export of escrow encryption from the United States, meaning that Australia's window of opportunity to capture this international market will be lost once the US moves into it. Instead of having only a toe in the water, so-to-speak, at this stage, the government should move forward much more aggressively in this area and in the area of electronic commerce to ensure that Australia's place in the world in this area can be well captured. Earlier this year the government also put in place Internet censorship rules which I think will damage electronic commerce severely in the long run. Honourable members opposite congratulated themselves on saving Australian children from being exposed to unsavoury images and practices over the Internet because of their censorship regime. Of course we all support that kind of outcome, but the reality is that the government's legislation will go no way to achieving that outcome and it will seriously undermine some aspects of Australia's e-commerce. Again, we must review all of those laws which put roadblocks on the' electronic superhighway' -to quote the Vice-President of the United States-and ensure that Australia's place in pursuing electronic commerce can be a very strong one. That is our role in this region. We have a very good telecommunications base. We have a strong legal base and very competent financial and other work force employees. We could adopt a very strong role in this if people had confidence in our legal system and in our Wednesday, 29 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 11023 technology, which they will only get if the government removes these kinds of restrictions from its legal base. r strongly commend this legislation to the committee. r ask the government to review exactly the role that it is pursuing and, instead of adopting this more timid approach, to move forward more strongly to ensure Australia's place in the e-commerce world.
