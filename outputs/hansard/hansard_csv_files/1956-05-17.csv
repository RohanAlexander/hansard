Petition received and read. Deputy Speaker, last night on the motion to adjourn the House a division on a motion that the question be now put was requested and granted by you, but when, upon the submission of the question, "" That the House do now adjourn "" members of the Opposition again requested a division you ignored the request and left the chair. I ask under what standing order, or by what authority, you ignored the request of the Opposition for a division. was taken on tbe closure and tbe House determined that the motion for the adjournment should be put. In accordance with past practice, once the House had made that determination I put tbe question, "" That the House do now adjourn"" and I ruled that the House had agreed to the adjournment. I then declared that the House stood adjourned until to-day. your statement mean, Mr Deputy much smaller European wheat crop, parSpeaker, that as soon as the House ticularly in France, and to that extent decides that the question that the House there will be obviously some enhancedo now adjourn shall be put, that carment of the opportunity for the sale of ries witb it the automatic conclusion that Australian wheat.

I know that Mr Speaker on one occasion did it ih very unusual contrary to the rules. I ask that, before tbe occasion arises again, you consider the matter. well, I will give consideration to it. present in tbe House last evening when the matter that has been referred to took place. Seated on this side of the House, I wondered that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, could have heard what had happened because of the unseemly row that developed in the Opposition benches. Therefore, I venture to say that you, as you are duty bound to do with a disturbance of that nature, must necessarily leave the chair. certain whether this question should be directed to the Minister for Trade or the Minister for Primary Industry, but as the latter gentleman is engaged in another part of the Commonwealth on important national business, I shall address it to the Minister for Trade. Is it a fact that, due to the unfavorable seasonal conditions in Western Europe resulting in damage to wheat crops, the outlook for the sale of Australian soft wheats overseas is now much more hopeful? If this is so, can the Minister inform the House whether shipping space will be available to take advantage of this position? with which my colleague, the Minister for Primary Industry, would be more familiar than I am, but I think I am able to give the honourable member for Corangamite some information.

8,Mr Mcewen,"This is a mattergrown in France, and we look forward to a better opportunity for sale and, perhaps with some confidence, to a hardening in wheat prices. Tbere is a concurrent problem of heavy freight rates from Australia at the present time. This is the outcome of a very heavy trans-Atlantic traffic in coal which has put a pressure on charter shipping for bulk cargo. At the present time, the effective freight rate on Australian wheat in terms of Australian currency is about 6s. 4d. a bushel from east Australian ports to the United Kingdom and that, of course, is a counter-balancing factor against the better opportunity for sales. Minister for Trade a question in relation to the quotas of imported goods under the restrictions that have been imposed. Is the practice of disposing of a quota still operating? In fact, is it not increasing? Has the Minister inquired into it to see whether that practice can be controlled? A person who has, in respect of certain quantities of goods, a right to import and has no further intention of importing, often advertises his desire to sell his right from the Government, and that means a direct addition to the cost of goods in this country and a direct increase in the cost of living. ""Will the Minister consider promulgating a regulation which will make this practice illegal, becanse it is quite contrary turbed at the fact that there appears to to the purpose of the system of import quotas, which should be confined to permits given in accordance with a particular category? with the administrative details of this issue as I should wish to be and as I hope to be in the future. I am aware that out of the complexities and difficulties of administering quite severe import restrictions, which are extremely severe in the categories of less-essential goods, there are arising anomalies, and perhaps grievances, and what are regarded by many as injustices. That is inherent in the situation with which we are confronted. The Government is not content, nor bas it been at any time content, merely to devise a set of rules and tben allow the situation to develop with those rules unaltered. The problems that the right honourable gentleman has in mind have been under constant scrutiny,, and at present a pretty thorough re-examination of the whole administrative practice is being undertaken at the official level, with a view to trying to determine the most defensible arrangement in the circumstances, and that which represents in the greatest degree a reflection of the public interest and substantial justice to the interested parties. I can assure the right honourable gentleman that that kind of re-examination of the administrative practice is proceeding at the present time. master-General whether, in view of tbe extraordinary increase in the population of Geelong and tbe surrounding districts during recent years, and the consistently increasing demand for telephones, any successful progress has been made by the Postal Department in what I know has been an intensive search for alternative sites for the installation of equipment to provide more adequate telephone facilities in the near future. ago the honourable member asked me to look at this question, because be was disbe insufficient provision for the extension of the automatic telephone services in the City of Geelong. I can inform the honourable member that at present a considerable amount of the equipment necessary for providing trunk-line services between Geelong and other centres is housed in the automatic exchange building, and that fact is hampering the further extension of automatic telephone services in the city. Realizing this, the department commenced negotiations some time ago for the acquisition of another site, and I understand that my colleague, the Minister for the Interior, has completed negotiations for the purchase of a new site, on which it is intended to erect another building which will be",11,Wheat

46,Mr Pollaed,"The honourable memuseless for honourable members oppositeour policy that if we became the Government of the Commonwealth we would divert the entire proceeds from the petrol tax to road purposes. Governnient supporters, and Australian Country party members in particular, know only too well that probably the most articulate aud persistent persons in the 'Commonwealth in regard to roads, and naturally so, are municipal councils, country roads boards, motor associations, automobile clubs, and transport-owning associations of all sorts. They are most persistent in advancing reasons why all this money should be diverted to road purposes. The Opposition agrees that we have reached the stage where that view should bc .accepted. When the Treasurer made bis measure, as an excuse, and a very plausible excuse, for .not diverting the whole of the proceeds from the increased tax of 3d. to this purpose, he said that under our economic policy we seek more revenue, and that if we give the whole of the petrol tax revenue to road-building authorities, or to the States for roadbuilding purposes, we sball be so much short of the amount of money that we desire to give to the States from loan funds for all sorts of other State purposes. He said that we would then be confronted with tbe need to increase perhaps, sales tax or income tax, or to seek revenue from some other source to take the place of the money which we would lose by handing over the whole of the proceeds from the increased petrol tax. As I say, that is a very plausible excuse, but it was never accepted by supporters of the Government when tbey were in opposition. Tbat type of excuse never seemed to occur to them then. If we had used a similar excuse, it would that the pounds which we collect from not hold water now, because in tbose days £1 was worth £1 and gave us £1 worth of value. However, according to the Commonwealth Statistician and the Opposition of the day the £1 then was worth 12s. l i d . Let us accept that figure. To-day the £1 is worth 7s. Sd.,' which quite clearly confirms my affirmation that to build a mile of road now costs almost double the cost involved at that time. In fact, in most areas road construction costs have more tban doubled, but an analysis of tbe figures of the relative value of the £1 that I have cited indicates that the cost has almost doubled. A comparison of the amounts diverted from proceeds of the petrol tax for road-building purposes between 1949 and 1956 shows that it is essential that the entire proceeds from the additional tax of 3d. should go to the State authorities. Let me cite the Treasurer's own figures. He endeavoured to show how much more generous this Government has been in this respect. He saidBy 1049 . . . the percentage of Commonwealth Aid Roads grants from petrol tax collections had risen to only 47. In the current financial year, no less than 73 per cent, of the total customs and excise duties on petrol is being set aside specifically for second-reading speech on this roads. hear! the apologists, but let me re-emphasize the figures. They indicate that since 1949 the grant to the States has increased by a miserable 26 per cent. an addition. because of the Government's failure to check inflation the grant will build fewer miles of roads than ever. The depreciation in the value of the £1 from 32s. 13 d. in 1949 to 7a. 8d. in 1956 indicates that to-day 73 per cent, of the tax will not build as many miles of road as did 47 per cent, in 1949. agree that the honourable member's argument is true, it must be remembered the taxpayers and disperse are the same. argument! They are the same pcmid* but the Government, has let them become so worthless that they will build fewer miles of roads than did the pounds oi 194*9. The Government comes forward with a miserable plea that it has increased the number of pounds!

Labour is in the clear because in our policy speech we told the electors, without equivocation, that if we were in government we would devote the whole of the petrol tax to road-making. Now, after advocating the spending of more money on roads, the honourable member is confronted with the situation that the Government he suppoj-ts has not made available-if one takes into consideration the diminished value of tbe £ 1 sufficient money to build as many miles of road as could be built with an allocation of 47 per cent, in 1949.

We must keep in mind the changed purchasing power of money and the fact that there is throughout Australia a greater volume of motor transport on the roads than ever before. Moreover, we have not yet caught up with the depreciation in the roads that occurred during the war. This Government apparently believes more than we do that war is likely to occur, and good roads are essential to the defence of this country. If we wish to provide against the possibilities of war we could not do better than pour more money into our roads system. It is true that a large share of the money w ill be used in the country areas. That has been the position for years. I do not deprecate it , but we must remember that the position in the metropolitan areas is entirely different from that which obtained when most of the money available for road construction and maintenance first went to the country districts. in tbe metropolitan area of Melbourne",18,Government Supporters Hear

59,Mr Pollard,"I realize that theare in a deplorable state. I take it that tbe same position applies in Sydney. All the city municipalities find themselves in an unenviable position. The vast growth in population on the perimeter of the cities has led to the use of the inner roads by an enormous' volume of motor traffic passing through to the outer areas. Great damage is being done to the road surfaces and tbe inner municipalities are quite unable to cope with the situation. This may be a side issue, but it is important, and the claims of the inner' city municipalities should surely receive special consideration. They are in a deplorable plight. At one time the city roads were infinitely superior to those in the country. To-day, the main country roads are infinitely superior to the arterial city roads. Honourable members can imagine the position in which the inner and outer municipalities find themselves when faced with the need to construct entirely new streets. When petrol tax was first allocated to the States for road-making purposes the motor car was, in the main, used by commercial travellers, persons wbo had business in the country, and persons who lived in the country. To-day, it is a fair guess to say that in all the big cities of Australia at least 50 per cent, of workers, that when it had the opportunity. That artisans, and salaried, professional and business people go to work in a motor car. They are paying petrol tax, but under this measure a large proportion of it will be devoted to the roads in the country areas. honourable member said that the workers could not afford motor cars. them, even though tbey cannot afford them. I will sympathize with the honourable member for Mallee who, in his ignorance, does not know much about city conditions. If he did he would know that often a worker will buy a car and, with four or five of his neighbours, will drive to his work at some industrial concern in the city area. He will help to pay off the car with the co-operation and contributions of his friends. If to-morrow it. He did tell me, but I did not think the tramway and railway transport systems of Sydney and Melbourne were paralysed, motor transport could, as has been demonstrated, carry the people to work. However, if the whole of the motor transport in the metropolitan areas of Melbourne or Sydney were dislocated it would be quite impossible for the tramways or railways to carry the people to their destination. There has been a heavy increase in the ownership of motor cars which are used to take people to work in tbe cities. The State governments will have to deal with that new feature of the transport situation. However, they will not be able to do so satisfactorily unless they receive a further increase of between Id. and 3d. a gallon from the whole of the tax. This would enable them to devote more money to roads in the country areas and have available, perhaps from other sources, a fund from which a distribution could be made to the city municipalities. My time is running out and there are on this side of the House a large number of competent people who know the position of the municipalities intimately. They will make a valuable contribution to this debate. I am also looking forward to hearing Government supporters speak. No doubt their main argument will be that the Opposition did not do this or is not the problem. This is now their opportunity. What do they intend to do about it? We will give them the opportunity to indicate what they will do about it. I foreshadow that at a later stage in this debate, Her Majesty's Opposition will move an amendment to this measure with the object of diverting the whole of the increase of 3d. a gallon to the respective State instrumentalities. I know that, inevitably, an attempt will be made during the debate to sidetrack the issue.

There was a good deal of justification for the adoption of the area-population basis of distribution. The government of which I was a member adhered to that principle. The Government of which the honourable member for Mallee and the honourable member for Deakin are supporters also adheres to that general basis. There may be a case for some slight readjustment, but over all, in the national interest, it is a basis that is amply justified.

They may suggest that the State of Western Australia should sacrifice a proportion of its allocation, or a South Australian may say that South portion of its allocation so that Victoria and New South Wales, which pay the major part of the tax, may get a little more in return. But that diversion will not befog the issue. Those supporters of the Government who have taken this attitude in the past will now have an opportunity to give practical support to it by voting for an Opposition amendment designed to increase the additional allocation of petrol from Id. to 3d. a gallon. I honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) has spoken with some fluency ancl at some length on the general political position, but that has little to do with the problem of roads that confronts thi.» Parliament. The honourable member for Lalor said, in .the first place, that this problem could be solved by allocating all the petrol tax to roads. In the second place he said, if I understood him correctly, that the allocations made by the Labour Government, of which he was a member, compare more than favourably with the allocations made to the States for road purposes by the present Government. The truth is-and I quote from the second-reading speech of thc Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden)-tba t in this current financial year, the total amount distributed will probably be in the vicinity of £32,000,000. In the last year of office of the Labour Government, the allocation was in the vicinity of £7,000,000.

69,Mr Davis,"On any basis that is the honourable member for Lalor referred to, if it is right or wrong for the Commonwealth to make an allocation to the States for road purposes, tben thc record of this Government, in terms of pounds, -shillings and pence ancl in terms of practical contribution to this problem, is infinitely greater than the effort made ^by tbe previous Labour Government. There can be no dispute on that if any -one cares to study tbe figures and relate those figures to the realities of the position. The second point made by the honourable member for Lalor is tbe old, worn-out political argument that has done so much damage to efforts to solve tlie problem for which we all have some responsibility. He said that if the Commonwealth Government allocated all the money raised by tbe petrol tax to road purposes, then, by inference, tbe problem was solved. Nobody knows better than my well-informed friend from Lalqr thnt that is not the solution to the problem. ber did not say that, then for a quarter of an hour I listened to bim intently and reached the wrong conclusion. Indeed, he said the policy of his party was to give all receipts from the petrol tax to the States for road purposes. If one is not entitled to assume from that statement that it is the solution in which his party believes, then one is not entitled to assume anything. The honourable member for Lalor tben endeavoured to anticipate the argument that might be put forward by members on the Government side and, indeed, some members on his own side of the House. Because he has had experience, to a limited extent, and to a limited extent only, there is some truth in what he said. This bill, insofar as it makes some contribution to the problem, is good, but, insofar as it perpetuates the existing practice, then it is bad in principle, inefficient in application and unfair in distribution. The position in Victoria is well known, and at this stage I do not want to labour that point. I return to what is, after all, if not the main point, at least the second point that is really at issue in these discussions. The first premise implied and, I believe, accepted by the honourable member for Lalor, was that, all our road problems would be solved, by tbe expenditure ou roads of all the money rai.sed by the petrol tax. The second premise was that there is a responsibility, accepted or implied, on this Australian Government to make all the petrol tax moneys available to tbe States for road purposes. On that second and narrower aspect, the truth of the matter is, of course, that the Australian Government has no constitutional responsibility for road construction. That is the responsibility of the. States. I therefore say that this bill, which, as I have said, is designed to perpetuate an existing practice, is bad in principle, because it implies that this Government, vvhich is responsible for the collective raising of revenues, should hand out those revenues to governments that have no responsibility for raising them,, but merely have to spend them. I make no criticism of any particular government in this regard. AllI say is that it is wrong in principle, and as long as we adopt this kind of outlook we are unlikely to make any real contribution to a problem that becomes more urgent every day. This allocation of revenues by the Australian Government to the States has continued for a number of years. While tbe practice continues it becomes more and more accepted by the people, and by State and local governments, that the responsibility for raising funds for road construction and maintenance lies only with this Government. For an Australian government to relate expenditure on one particular project to the revenue collected from one particular tax, as governments of all political colours have done in the past, is wrong in principle. That practice has tended to cloud the real issues ancl to delay the adoption of a realistic approach to the problems involved. The existing formula results in very unfair distribution of the proceeds of the tax. [Quorum formed.] If we -have a situation, accepted in this Parliament, in which Victoria receives only 17 per cent, of the moneys distributed, when in fact more than 32 per cent, of the tax is raised in that State, then I suggest that we should again consider the principle of this bill.

I make no criticism of the governments every State, but in the two major of those States; I merely say that those States, New South Wales and Victoria, are the facts. Therefore, I contend that the annual deficit on railways is huge and if this legislation is designed to develop is becoming larger. The roads, towards the outlying parts of Australia it has the construction and maintenance of not succeeded in its purpose because the which we all contribute as taxpayers, are allocations to the States are simply not being destroyed by a form of transport being spent.

If tbe railways are not efficient-abou t wbicb I am not competent to speak-thei r standard of efficiency should be raised, by agreement between tbe Ministers concerned, to that of the heavy transport operators. It seems to me that that is the way in which we should approach the problem and that, until we, as a Parliament, approach it in that way, all we shall do will be to retain the existing state of affairs, the cost of which to the economy cannot be calculated. I come back to where I started: l t seems incredible that men with the capacity and experience of the honourable member for Lalor should continue to pour out the arguments that he has advanced, which, he must know, do a grave disservice to the country. I support the bill for the reasons that I have given. I earnestly urge the Government and the Parliament to approach the problem from both a long range and a short range point of view. It has been estimated that to bring the roads of Victoria-whic h I once heard described as being the garden State-to the required standard would cost, over a period of ten years, £340,000,000. I tbink the present allocation is £5,000,000. So it is not likely that the problem will be solved during the lifetime of any member of this House. think of the unhappy fate that awaits ments when they have been opposed to my friend from Wills, and the life to helping the States in any way. which he will return. He will probably meet many of his colleagues there. These problems cannot be solved by continuing we are to maintain the present narrow of the Federal Government as much as approach, I cannot emphasize too of tbe States. strongly the point that this House, in all justice and fairness, must give some ber say that to the States? consideration to the unfortunate position in which Victoria is placed.

This House must consider the problem, not in terms of what is right and what is wrong, but in terms of elementary economies, because the drain on Victoria is a drain on the economy of the whole country. I do not make that suggestion from the narrow point of view of State rights, but, as my friends from Western Australia will agree, from tbe point of view of the increased cost of manufactured goods which other States are fortunate enough to import from Victoria. Because of the inefficiency of the Victorian road transport system, such goods are becoming increasingly dear. The problem affects Western Australia, Queensland and every other State. What is true of Victoria is true, to a lesser but still great degree, of the other great industrial State-Ne w South Wales. ! hope that, although little can bc attempted at this stage, the vitally important principles to which I have referred will be considered by the Governnient and the House at the earliest opportunity. believe that local government authorities, such as shire councils and municipalities, have been treated very harshly.

87,Mr James,"I would not have gotof coal. Coal! There is that subject again. When the late John Rosevear was in this House, he and the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) used to say, when I rose to speak, "" Ten to one-fiftee n to one-h e will talk about coal"". Tbey would say to me, "" We bet you don't sit down without saying ' coal' transport of coal can be carried out only by road in flood time because the railways are brought to a standstill. I have advocated the building of an all weather dry railway to take over the J. and A. Brown railway and the connection of this line with the Bluegum to West Wallsend railway. There is an all weather, dry railway on to Cockle Creek and from Cockle Creek to Newcastle and Sydney. The roadway from Cessnock over the mountains and on to Lake Macquarie has been cut up terrifically by heavy traffic. Trucks of ten and fifteen tons weight have been going over that road, which was never meant to carry such heavy traffic. I recommend that, if the Government will not take over the maintenance of roads, the local government authorities should heavily tax those vehicles which carry such terrific tonnages over the roads and smash them up, and pay nothing in respeot of the damage that they do for the Army) [12.3] -The whole of the Labour case in this debate appears to have the purpose of getting the whole of this additional tax of 3d. a gallon devoted to roads tunder this agreement. AllI have to say about that is that I am quite sure that the Opposition knows ""hat this is a thoroughly irresponsible request, as I shall attempt to prove a little later. Members of the Opposition know full well that the reason for the imposition of additional tax of 3d. a gallon was given in the recent economic statement made by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). They know that it has no relation at all to the subject of roads. As a matter of fact, one could say at this stage that the I d . a gallon that is being given for road maintenance is an indication to the people of Australia of the importance that the Federal Governinent attaches to the need for road development. In the whole of tbe economic statement in which the additional taxation in various categories was announced, there was no mention that the additional money to be raised applied to any particular expenditure, with the sole exception of this item for roads. That, as I say, indicates quite clearly SoI am on coal again. The that the Federal Government does, in fact, put the importance of the development of roads on the very highest possible plane. [Quorum formed.'] I was pointing out that the Opposition has stressed that the whole of this addition of 3d. a gallon in the tax should be applied to road purposes, and that in my opinion that was an irresponsible statement in the light of the fact that the increase of tax by 3d. actually has nothing to do with the financing of road construction and maintenance, but that there was a great degree of generosity in the Government's offer of an extra I d . a gallon for road purposes, which is to be provided under this measure. I charge the Oppositiou with being not genuine in its appeal in this matter. Honourable members opposite are only attempting to seek some political advantage because they know that the subject of roads and increased revenue for roads is a matter that is troubling local governing bodies throughout Australia. The speciousness of the Opposition's arguments on tbe subject of the devotion of petrol tax proceeds to road purposes is clearly shown by the facts on the Labour party's administration of the tax when it was. in office. What did the Labour Government do in 1948-40 about the use of petrol tax proceeds for road purposes? The Labour party in oflice did not then adopt the same attitude as it is adopting now, when it is in opposition. As a matter of fact, I remind the House and the people that when the present Government came into office, petrol rationing still existed in Australia, although the war had been over for more than four years. This Government abolished petrol rationing. A little later I shall cite some figures to indicate the effect that petrol rationing had on the community. The Labour Government curtailed the use of petrol by the community, for very necessary transport, because of its restrictive controls.",25,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads
88,,"Mr CRAMER (Bennelong-Ministe rlb is interesting to note that in 1948-49, the last year of office of tbe Labour Government, only 47 per cent, of tbe proceeds of petrol tax was allocated by Labour for road purposes. Compare that figure of 47 per cent, with the figure of 73 per cent, of the total amount raised by petrol tax which this Government is allocating for road purposes this year. I think that those figures are most significant, because they prove beyond doubt that the Government is taking very seriously the need for new and improved roads throughout Australia, and that the Labour party is not sincere in its claims to-day that it desires to assist road construction. One has only to refer to the utilization of petrol tax proceeds under Labour's administration to show the insincerity of bonorable gentlemen opposite on this matter. In 1942-43, the Labour Government allocated only £1,603,000 for road purposes; in 1943-44, the amount was £1,487,000. It was only in 1947-48 that the Labour Government increased its total allocation to the figure, relatively high compared with its previous performances, of £6,000.000. In 1948-49, its last year of office, it allocated a total of £7,701,000. Immediately this Government came into office, it set about increasing tbe allocation for road purposes,, and in the coming financial year the magnificent sum of £32,000,000 will be devoted to road purposes by the Government. I ask anybody who argues on this matter to compare the figures-£7,701,000 under Labour and £32,000,000 under this Government. How can honourable members opposite justify any argument such as they havo advanced to-day? They are just being absurd. I think those figures dispose of the Opposition's arguments. The Government has a. magnificent record in relation to the allocation of part of the proceeds of petrol tax for road purposes. On no fewer tban three occasions since assuming office the Government has introduced legislation to increase the allocation. This year the total is £27,500,000 and under this measure the total will amount to £32,000,000' in the next financial year. It was, of course, this Government that related the consumption of petrol to the allocation of sums fbr road purposes. Tn 1954, the Government allocated 7d. a gallon of petrol consumed in Australia for road purposes; under this bill that allocation is to be.increased to Sd. a gallon. Local governing bodies have for a long time been suggesting that petrol tax was originally levied to provide finance for roads; but, in fact, the revenue from petrol tax, as such, was never intended to be used solely for roads. As the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) rightly pointed out, income tax was introduced in the Commonwealth sphere in 1902. tben. it was not until 1923 that petrol tax was introduced, which was long after petrol had come to be used in large quantities in this country. As the honourable member for Lalor knows fullwell, as does everybody else who thinks about this subject, petrol tax was never in specific terms related to road purposes. There is no doubt about that. In 1940 petrol tax was' increased by 3d. a gallon, but there was no increase that year in the allocation for roads. In 1946, under the Labour Government, the tax was reduced by Id. a gallon, but the allocation for roads did not alter. So the argument used all over the country, particularly by local governing bodies, that tbe proceeds from petrol tax are related to the allocation of revenue for road purposes, is the result of a misconception.. I appreciate the attitude of local government bodies, because I have been a local government man myself for the last 25 years, and I know the problem of local government. I know that local government bodies have been sending telegrams all over tbe place seeking support for the view that petrol tax is collected for road purposes. Mr Pollard interjecting, honourable member who is interrupting is well aware that this is something that local government people are trying to have recognized, so that they can obtain more money. I do not blame them for .that. As I have said, I know local government, and I know the dilemma in which local governing bodies are placed because of their paucity of funds; but the",26,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

Those burdens have and allied products comprise a very great caused very difficult problems for them. part of our imports, and they absorb I do not blame them for their advocacy about £100,000.000 of the money availin seeking additional funds, but the fact able to pay for imports. The large is that the State Labour governments volume of imports was one of the basic have virtually dumped local government reasons for the economic adjustments that in Australia.

The statistic? other activities, which local governing showing bodies in the past did not normally have motor vehicles registered are very illuto finance. Therefore, I say that the minating. A t the 31st December, 1949responsibility is squarely upon the State Labour went out of office in December. governments. As every one knows, roads 1949-ther e were registered in Australia throughout Australia are the direct 702,380 motor cars and 476,623 comresponsibility of the States.

I cent, the proportion of Commonwealth mention these figures to indicate to the aid roads funds to be spent on rural House the extraordinary growth of motor roads.

The allocation of transport 40 per cent, of tbe aid roads funds to country under the management of the rural roads means that something like present Government.

Local government is an of spending more money. 1 pointed out roads is a very special indication of this Government's realization of the imporimposed for that purpose.

93,Mr Cramer,"I have never said it matelyI t has brought the problem of the excess of imports over exports. Something had to be done, in the interests of the people themselves, to damp down the flow of imports, and that was one of the reasons why the additional petrol tax of 3d. a gallon was imposed. The second reason, also, is obvious. It was essential for the Government, as we have been told before, to raise further cash in order to allow essential public works throughout Australia, to be continued. We all know that loans have not raised suflicient money to meet the needs of the States for essential developmental works, and that it was necessary to find cash to prevent the cessation of those works. Part of the revenue from this increased tax must be applied to that purpose. In this matter, I charge Labour witb complete insincerity, because Labour supporters know full well that the additional tax of 3d. a gallon was imposed, in the first place, to damp down the flow of imports, and, in the second place, to raise funds for State works. They cannot have it both ways. Tbey cannot apply the entire proceeds of the additional tax to road works. The Government proposes to devote Id. of the 3d. a gallon to sucb works. The remaining 2d. a gallon will be absorbed by the States for State works. This fact must be kept in mind. The Opposition knows full well that my arguments on this matter are genuine, and that the increased tax is necessary. The various States have all sorts of commitments for State public works, and, if they were denied the funds necessary to undertake those works, Australia's basic development would suffer a serious blow. Opposition members know full well, also, that the Opposition amendment designed to devote the whole of the additional 3d. a gallon to road works would strike a serious blow at other very important works for which commitments bave been entered into by the States. The Opposition's proposal is completely lacking in genuineness. We all agree on the importance of roads. They are essential to decentralization. Australia will never become a great nation unless we decentralize activities and allow tbe country to develop in a proper way. Roads are essential to rural development, and to transport efficiency, which, of course, affects the cost of transporting goods, and, consequently, greatly affects the cost of living. Therefore, it is a factor of great importance. I should like to place on record, also, some interesting statistics concerning the mileages of roads throughout Australia. We have a total of 525,742 miles of roads, comprising 40,651 rniles of concrete and higher-standard roads and roads that are paved or sealed, 115,719 miles of unsealed roads, and 369,372 miles of roads tha* are merely formed or cleared, or are in a natural state. Those figures give some indication of the growth of the roads system throughout. Australia. I know that what has been done so far is not nearly enough. There must be a greater development of our roads system aud we must give a lot of attention to that task. Bui we cannot do everything at once-. I know that some people become very irritated when this road or that road cannot be constructed. Let us be practical. Australia is a young nation, with only 9,000,000 people. We have a huge continent to develop, and everything cannot be done at once. Even if £50,000,000 were allocated to-morrow morning for the purposes of road construction in Australia, it would not be physically possible to do all the work required to be done. The limitation is imposed, not so much by a shortage of money as by a shortage of man-power and materials. The rate of development is governed by the facilities available. A magnificentjob has been done already, but much more must be done. I agree that we should develop our roads to the full extent of our economic capacity. This Government has been conscious of tha< need ever since it came into power, as the figures show. It has clone a magnificent job in giving financial assistance to the States for the construction of road? throughout Australia. As I have said already, roads are essentially a State responsibility, and I am sure that thiStates do not want to give away that responsibility. I know that a little later on we shall have an argument about the formula. Under the present formula, Tasmania receives 5 per cent, of the money available for distribution, and the allocations to the other States are made, as to threefifths on. a population basis and as to two-fifths on an area basis. I know that the operation of the formula is causing .some difficulty, but I appeal to chose honourable gentlemen who propose to speak on this matter, particularly the Victorians, not to be parochial about it. This is a national problem of the widest significance. I do not think that we can be arbitrary about these things. The formula has worked reasonably well, although I do not say that it is perfect. This Government has made an appeal to the States to organize a system of priorities for public works. It has urged the States to undertake first those public works that are most necessary for the development of Australia. I believe that roads should be put into that category, and that we should not discuss the problem of roads from a parochial viewpoint. It would be very difficult to devise a formula that would be accepted by all the States. It is a great pity that this State argument, so to speak, should occur. If there is to be any alteration of the present formula, which was obviously designed, because Victoria is a small but densely populated and highly developed State State. Comparatively speaking, Victoria has more motor vehicles than any other State and pays more money by way of petrol taxation than any other State. But do not let us be parochial about this matter. Let us consider it from the wide national point of view. Honourable members interjecting, me at once. Let us look at this matter from the national point of view. Let each State be prepared to confer witb the other States. Surely all honourable irembers know that there is a great need to develop ""Western Australia-whic h I visited only recently-the northern parts of South Australia and the magnificent State of Queensland. Those are some of the great areas in this country that must be developed. I appeal to the Victorians not to he too parochial about this matter. , limited. We can devote only a certain amount of money to roads. Let us use that money in such a way that it will be of the greatest benefit to the development of Australia as a nation. I ask honourable members not to interfere with the formula at this stage, unless we can devise another and more satisfactory method of distribution. regard as fair a formula under which more money is distributed to States other than Victoria than those States can possibly spend on their roads, and which deprives Victoria of money which it is eager to spend and could spend on roads < ' honourable meinber for Gippsland that that is the position. But I believe sincerely that it has arisen because of tbe preoccupation of State Labour governments with matters other than roads. They bave other ideas in their minds, and they have not applied money granted under this legislation to the purposes for which it was provided. I do not think it is true to say that they could not have spent all of that money on roads. I believe that they could have done so, with great benefit to the States for which they are responsible. Let me counter the charge that this Government has not devoted to roads a sufficiently .great proportion of the revenue from the petrol tax. The Government has done a magnificent job. I suggest to the House that, in view of the present economic position of the nation, we should be acting quite irresponsibly if we allocated for roads purposes more than one-third of the additional revenue from the tax. That is the only part of the additional revenue that will be raised by the recently increased taxes that has been allocated for a specific purpose-tba t is, roads. Surely that indicates to the Australian people the high importance that the Government attaches to the development of our roads. I am astonished and dismayed that the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer)",28,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

101,Mr Ltchetti (Macquarie) [12.32j.,"has opposed the construction of roads. One would have thought that the Minister, being preoccupied with the problems of the defence of Australia and being concerned with strategic roads, would be the first to advocate a vigorous road3 policy for the development, decentralization and defence of this nation. But the Minister, despite his record in local government, has not advocated that more money 'should be made available for roads. He has expressed his contentment and satisfaction with the Government's proposal that only one-third of the additional revenue from the petrol tax shall be allocated for roads purposes. He believes that that allocation will be adequate to meet tbe needs of the nation. I repeat that 1 am astonished and dismayed that the honourable gentleman has made those statements. To the defence departments, £9,000,000 is only small change. Therefore, it is amazing that the Minister responsible for one of those departments should oppose a proposal that the whole of the additional revenue from the petrol tax should be applied to the making of roads in this country. Prom the very beginning of federation in Australia, people have advocated the need for good roads. Every true patriot in this country to-day will say that, without roads and without development, there can be no real defence of Australia. Vet the Minister came into this chamber to-day and spoke in the way that he did. He made it quite clear that this is not a bill for the purpose of providing money for roads. It is, to use his words, a bill to damp down inflation. If that is the view of the Minister and other members of the Government, I suggest to him that, in honesty, the Government should alter the title of the bill. This is not a bill to aid roads. It is a bill for a petrol tax grab to provide the Commonwealth with money to help it out of its present difficulties. If the Government were to alter the title of the bill so as to express that purpose, undoubtedly it would do the light thing. I ask the House to disregard the views expressed by the Minister for the Army and to consider this problem, as it ought to be considered, on the national plane. Let us ignore the disputation between States about the formula, for that does not come within the ambit of this proposal at all. W-e are considering at present whether Id. out of the additional tax of 3d., or £4,000,000 out of £12,000,000, should be used for road-making purposes or whether the total proceeds of the increase, £12,000,000, should be used for that purpose. I have an intimate knowledge of the need for good roads. Persons in my electorate, who are similarly placed to persons in other electorates, perhaps at this very moment are unable to take their goods to market or their children to school because offloodedstreams and the absence of bridges and good roads. I have a recollection from the recent past of the need in my electorate to carry ballot boxes by pack horse to the returning officer because it was impossible to get a motor vehicle to the centres of population. Conditions of that type exist in the country at the present time. I am astonished that members of the Australian Country party should lend their force and strength to the Liberal party in relation to a matter of this kind. One would think that, in these days of great difficulty with regard to production and the need to increase it, the members of the Australian Country party would say, ""Weneed good roads for the development of our districts, for the convenience of the people, for the taking of our produce to market, and because of this essential need we shall insist that the total proceeds from this additional tax, £12,000,000, shall be devoted to the purpose which the title of the bill suggests "". Of the additional tax collections, only about £4,000,000 will be used for road making while £8,000,000 will go into Consolidated Bevenue. The Australian Government receives £46,000,000 in a full year from the petrol tax and will pay to the States £30,500,000. The percentage of money from the petrol tax devoted to road-making is decreasing. Two years ago, the Government retained £4,500,000. Last year it retained £7,500,000. Tbis year, subsequent to the passage of this legislation, it will retain £15,500,000. Surely that is an indictment of a government which professes to be concerned with the development of this country. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), in his 1949 policy speech, promised to raise, from the petrol tax, £250,000,000 for the development of our country districts. Having this promise in mind, one can only deplore the fact that the Government is escaping its responsibility and is retreating from the pledge made to the people. I was very much concerned with the wild and extravagant statements made by the Minister for the Army. His allegations followed the copy-book style of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden). He said that this tax was never intended as a road-making tax. He said, in effect, ""We had no intention at any stage of applying the proceeds of the petrol tax for road-making purposes. That was neither more nor less than an alibi. This was to be a vehicle by which the people woulcl be taxed, ancl the money received could be paid into the maw of Consolidated Revenue while tbe people would be denied the roads that they need and to which they are entitled."" The honourable gentleman suggested that provision of roads is a responsibility of the States. The States are paying for road construction and maintenance approximately twice as much as this Government is providing at the present time. They are accepting their responsibilities. If the honourable gentleman had made an investigation which apparently he did not make, he would have found that the principal act upon which this legislation is built, act No. 46 of 1926, is described asAn Act to authorize thu Execution by the Commonwealth of Agreements between the Commonwealth ancl the States in relation to the Construction and Reconstruction of Federal Aid Roads, and to make provision for the carrying out thereof. The preamble to the act is absolutely specific. It statesWhereasi t is expedient to provide for financial assistance to the several States for the pur pone of the construction ancl reconstruction of roads: Every word expressed in that act makes abundantly clear that the intention was to honour the promise made by the Prime Minister of Australia at that time, Mr tory of petrol tax legislation and proved Bruce, now Lord Bruce, that £20,000,000 would be raised over ten years at the rate of £2,000,000 a year and be paid to the States for the purpose of building roads, and that the Commonwealth would pay the proceeds of the petrol tax into a trust fund to make that possible. This proves beyond any shadow of doubt that the total proceeds of the petrol tax would be paid into a trust account for the specific purpose. So careful was tbe then Prime Minister with regard to the matter that he went considerably further, and in commenting on the bill, on the 3rd August, 1926, he is reported at page 4800 of Parliamentary Debates, volume 114, to have saidBut the Government, having received further information on this subject, is now prepared to insert an amendment in thc bill that will enable a rebate to be given to those users of petrol who are not road users. I think that disposes of the first legitimate objection to the Governments proposals. So concerned was the government of the day in regard to this matter that it decided to excuse from the incidence of this tax those persons who were not tben using the roads, so that it could be said that persons who were using petrol other than on the roads would not be taxed, in order that the crystallized amount obtained from tbose persons who used the roads would be applied for road-making purposes. That was the exact statement made by Mr Bruce, who was Prime Minister of Australia at that time. Not ono member of the House then made any suggestion whatever that Id. of this money would go into Consolidated Revenue. Mr Perkins, the then honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who spoke in support of the measure, said, as reported on page 4672 of the same volume of ParUamentary DebatesMotor traffic is now the principal means of transport, and it is essential that good roads be provided for it . Every owner of a motor vehicle must come to a realization of the fact that, although he may be called upon to pay a little extra in taxation, the good road that he w ill have provided for him will be ample compensation.

He is of the opinion that the tax could have been increased to allow the States to do away with the registration fees. Those who would quibble about Commonwealth-State relationships should consider this unequivocal statement by the honourable member, who would have increased petrol taxation to the point where registration fees might be waived altogether. All honourable members will agree that a person who buys a car must shoulder an almost intolerable burden. Eirst, he must, because of the high profits of the manufacturing companies, pay a price that goes beyond proper bounds; he must pay the taxation imposed by the Commonwealth; and he must meet registration and insurance charges. These burdens weigh as heavily upon the private motorist as they do upon tbe producer who requires motor vehicles in the pursuit of his calling. The then honourable member for In d i , Mr Cook, said furtherI submit that the Commonwealth is definitely responsible for the maintenance of our defence highways. then member for In d i . It is unfortunate that the Ministerf o r Defence did not heed those words and act upon them. 1 am not putting forward a case in support of the contention that all the petrol tax has always been devoted to the making of roads. I know that that is not so. But that is no reason why to-day, when this additional impost is to be placed upon the motorist, we should quibble about devoting it all to the construction and maintenance of roads. The proposed tax is a burden on the producer, upon whom we must depend for greater production if we are to build up our trade. The constant cry of the Government parties is that they wish to reduce the cost of production, yet thuy do not hesitate to support a proposal such as this, which w ill increase the petrol tax by 3d. a gallon and bring the customs and excise imposition to ls. I d . and l l £ d . respectively. This w ill be an intolerable burden, and if the revenue is not to be spent to make, the way easier for the man on the land, who must have petrol if he is to develop his property, the burden should not be imposed. A t least, in all honesty, the Government should alter the title of this bill. It has no right to refer to the measure as a roads bill when it is concerned purely with raising revenue and plundering those who use motor vehicles for any purpose. I do not intend to refer to the other speakers who dealt at length with the original legislation, which was introduced by the then Ministerf or Works and Eailways, MrW . C. H ill . The Prime Minister of the day was Mr. Bruce, now Lord Bruce, and the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), then Mr Page, was the Treasurer. Both advocated the imposition of this tax as a means of raising money with which to develop our roads. Even those speakers who opposed it did so on the ground that they considered it unjust. They also argued-on e might almost say with some right in those days-that the maintenance of roads was a State responsibility. Since those days, uniform taxation has been introduced and the petrol tax has grown to such proportions that the Commonwealth Government has",32,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

104,Mr Luchetti,"Mr Cook, who wasclearly been the proper authority to ensure that funds are provided to meet the roads problem, which is one of the most serious facing this country. We have heard honourable members arguing about how much money has been provided in the past. The Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer) spoke of the "" insincerity "" of members of the Labour party. If there is any insincerity it is on the part of the Government, which has so often spoken of applying all of the proceeds of tbe petrol tax. to the needs see it expand and made secure. Surely of local government but has failed to carry out its election pledges and promises in this regard. My criticism applies with particular force to th« Minister for the Army, for he has evaded his responsibility to ensure that strategic roads are built in this country. Report after report has drawn attention to the fact that our roads are incapable of foping with a crisis. Honourable members, who care to turn, back the pages of war-time history will recall that when the Japanese were a menace to this country and virtually knocking at our front and back doors an investigation was made, of the east coast especially, to ascertain how we could move our population, stock and merchandise from the seaboard to tbe hinterland. Meetings were called to consider this important matter and. it was found that our roads were quite inadequate. Surely, for that reason, if for no other, the Government should, in view of the f act that vast sums nf money are being voted for defence, give consideration to handing over for road-making purposes not £4,000,000 of the newly won revenue, but the whole ei 2,000,000.. I repeat that the £8,000,000 to be retained by the Commonwealth will not bolster the tottering, economy forwliich the present Government is responsible. It seems to have more money than it knows what to do with and. in the coffers of the Minister for Defenceis kept £9,000,000 as small change for any eventuality, for anything that might crop np at any time, and he can. transfer it from one defence department to another. Adermann) -Order! ' member'sremarks bave nothing to do constructed in this country is so poor with the bill. that'to emphasize the need for the allocation of the entire proceeds of the petrol tax: for road-making purposes for the defence and development of this country. The figures of road development in Australia present a pitiable record, so little has been accomplished in recent times, particularly when the vast development in. other countries; is borne in mind. Surely there is some spirit alive on the Government side. Surely the Government wants to develop this country and it wants roads to go to the points of production, and the fortunesof rural communities to be improved and enhanced, so that those who are producing in our country shall have an opportunity to bring their produce to the markets. Municipal and shire councils should not be stopped from building necessary bridges by the lack of funds. This is a topical matter and one that should actuate the mind of every honourable member in this chamber. I have a report issued from Bonn by the Press and Information Office of the German Federal Government. Dealing with the question of the provision of money for roads in West Germany, it says. Providing for a total expenditure of 35,000,000,000 dentschmarke over a period of ten years, the new road programme announced by the Federal Minister for Transport and Communications, Dr. Seebohm, is one of the biggest projects to be undertaken by the Federal Republic in the course of its short history. The report then deals with other activities and says that no fewer than 7,500 miles of roads will be built. The West German Government is also considering not only the question of petrol tax for the building of roads in West Germany but also the provision of money from consolidated revenue for the purpose of building good roads. If we were to give all the money from the petrol tax for the provision of roads and, in addition, were to give some money from Consolidated Revenue to provide better transport facilities in this country, there would be very little wrong.

106,Mr Luchetti,"I am mentioningJO ritfcte. In the whole of Australia there are only something like 520,000 miles of roads. Tbat takes into consideration roads composed of wood and stone, concrete, bitumen, macadam and otherwise, formed only and cleared or natural surface only. When one looks at these ngures, one can only say that it is a sorry day indeed when the honourable member for Hume( Mr And'crson), who represents a country electorate, opposes tbe people whom he is supposed to represent in this chamber. People in his electorate who require mads find him opposing in this chamber the provision of money for roads to help the development of those areas. I know thearea only toowell, and, indeed, not only the roads in fhe Hume electorate, but also those in the electorate of EdeiT-Monaro and in this district, which cry out for the expenditure of vast sums of money. Yet honourable members opposite are more concerned about speaking in accordance with the point of view of those in authority in their parties than about speaking for the people tliey should be representing in this chamber. Our record is not good 1 enough. When it is contrasted with the record of the United .States of America, West Germany and certain) other European countries, there is every reason for us to try to obtain a road programme worthy of the development of this country. There should be a transport policy in this country in which rail, road and all other forms of transport form a composite whole. I am not completely sold on the idea of main highways alone. The honourable member's time has expired. 1 The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) rambled all over the place in an endeavour to hide his discomfiture, caused by the fact that he does not know very much about this legislation. He went back to 1926 and quoted from Hansard of those days. He rambled on about roadsall over the place, even those in tbe electorates of otber members, and only occasionally made mention of this legislation. One glaring instance that shows he knows very Httle of it occurred when he said that this bill is wrongly named and should be withdrawn. He said it was a revenue proposition and did not dead with roads-. But, tbe bill expresses the definite purpose that out of theBoll'ection to which lie 13 referring, covered by another measure altogether, Id. a gallon will go to Commonwealth aid roads A ll it means is the addition of anextra paragraph to the schedule im the 1954-55 act. The honourable member spoke about bow this petrol tax was' imposed in 1926, leading the House to believe that it was introduced in that year. Bless my heart and soul! The Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden), in his second-reading speech, said quite clearly that the petrol tax was first in traduced into this country irr 1902"". The honourable meniber for Macquarie went on to. say fhat this Government, out of the additional 3d. a gallon, will allocate Id. a gallon for roads', and pur £Sfi0Ct,0Q& into the coffers of ConsoUdated Eevenue. I often wonder whether the members of the Labour party really take any responsibility ih running this country. They should know that tbe £8,000,000that will be left after the Id. a gaH'on isallocated to the States for road's will go to no other place than the coffers of the State governments to help them carry out their works and housingprogrammes. That was mentioned clearly by the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer) this morning. My colleague, the honourable member for Hume( Mr Anderson), mentioned, also, that the money would be used by the States for their hospitals, schools, electricity undertakings and so on. Opposition members will not pay attention to these mattersand that is one reason why my friend, the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), this morning drew a red herring' across the track by suggesting that the whole of the petrol tax should be made available for the construction of road's. d'eal with fhat shortly a little later on. party do when it was in government? about what it did in government; T know it did very little.

Let me use the figures given in 1949 by the great leader of the Labour party in those days, the late Ben Chifley. He said the £1 was worth, in terms of purchasing power, somewhere about l is . or 12s. The Institute of Public Affairs, in Melbourne, in its bulletin for the December quarter, 1955, said that it may now be back to 7s. 6d. The difference between l is . or 12s., which represented the value of the £1 in the days of the Chifley Government, and 7s. 6d., which is the comparable value now, does not account ""for the difference between the £7,0U0,000 that the Labour Government provided for construction and maintenance of roads, and the £32,000,000 that is being provided by this Government. Opposition members may use any argument they like, such as the difference in the cost of machinery, but they cannot explain to their own satisfaction the difference in the amounts provided by the different governments for this purpose. As my colleague, the honourable member for Hume, bas said, the record of tbe Labour party in this matter is one of hot air. We had quite a lot a few moments ago from the honourable member for Macquarie. It is very obvious that that honourable member has never taken the trouble to read some of the comments of his predecessor in the Macquarie electorate, the late Mr J. B. Chifley, a man with whom I disagreed violently politically, but who displayed some statesmanship and showed some consideration, not only for the people of his own State, bnt also for tbe people in the rest of Australia. The honourable member for Macquarie stated that in 1926 Mr Perkins, the former honourable member for Eden Monaro, said there was a need for a confidence in tbe loan market. petrol tax. I inform him that the petrol tax bad been in operation for 24 years member for Bass suggests that we could when Mr Perkins made that statement. restore confidence in the loan market. The honourable member for Macquarie government, as bad I , and presumably he would know very well, as I do, what was behind the move that was made in 1926 to introduce this legislation. The Prime Minister of the day, Mr S. M . Bruce, as he then was, said that over a period of five years his Government would make a contribution of £10,000,000 to the States. That meant that the Australian Government would contribute to the States at the rate of £2,000,000 a year. The honourable member for Macquarie said that the money would have come from the petrol tax. If he takes the trouble to look into the figures, he will find that in 1926 the amount collected by way of petrol tax was less tban £500,000 a year. In those circumstances, how would it have been possible to provide £2,000,000 out of the petrol tax ? The arrangement made at that time was made, I am happy to say, by a government of which the Treasurer was the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), a member of the Australian Country party, and a man who has always shown statesmanlike qualities. The increased tax on petrol amounts to 3d. a gallon, of which this Government proposes to contribute Id. to the States for road purposes. The Labour party, however, is suggesting that the whole of tbe petrol tax collected by the imposition of this extra 3d. a gallon should be banded to the States. Let us assume that that is a valid argument. How, then, would Opposition members suggest that money should be raised to finance the developmental programmes of tbe States? If we give the whole of this increase in petrol tax to the States for the purposes of road construction and maintenance, then we must find some other source from which to finance the States to carry on their work programmes to provide housing, hospitals, and other necessary works. might help in that direction by restoring",35,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

If Opposition members suggest that all the extra money from the petrol tax should be given to the Statesf or road purposes, they should make some suggestion, when moving their proposed amendment, as to how we should raise funds to meet the requirements of the State developmental programmes. The petrol tax has never been used solely for road purposes, but I am happy to increased the contribution towards roads from the petrol tax, so that now 73 per cent, of the collections fro m that tax are allocated for road purposes. Ministerf or the Army cited the significant figures this morning. He said that in 1938-39, only 43 per cent, of the collections from petrol tax was made available for roads. In 1949, the percentage had risen to 47, and that was the best effort the Labour party made in this direction. In the current financial year no less than 73 per cent, of the collections from petrol tax w ill be given to the States for the construction, reconstruction nnd maintenance of roads. The tax collected is comprised of customs duty and excise. down through the years, has asserted that v-p must press on with development, and that we must undertake developmental works in order to provide employment. This Government has done exactly that. Sincei t came to power it has been responsible for the erection of oil refineries from one end of Australia to the other. It is confidently expected that by next year about 90 per cent, of the petrol used in Australia w ill be refined in this country. .By encouraging the expenditure of overseas capital in Australia in the establishment of these If honourable refineries, the Government has provided work for Australian workmen. But what w ill be the outcome of this development? In the future we shall collect less from customs duty on refined petrol, and we shall bave to rely almost completely on excise for the provision of money for road purposes. Next year we shall have to find about £32,000,000 for roads, and instead of allocating 73 per cent, of the collections from petrol tax for this purpose, it will probably amount to about 80 per cent. Any one who says that this Government is not doing the f a i r thing by the Statesi n regard to the petrol tax should consider the position again. The excise on petrol, if my memory serves me aright, amounts to S^d. a gallon. This measure w ill provide for Sd. of that amount to go back to the Statesi n respect of every gallon of petrol used in this country. The greater the quantity of petrol used, the greater the amount of say that this Governinent has nioney the States w ill receive. I well recall, as, no doubt, do other honourable members, that when this Government camo to office in 1949, Australia was plagued The with petrol rationing. We were told by tbe previous Labour Government that it was impossible to obtain petrol from anywhere in the world, but within six months of this Government coining to office petrol was flowing into the country in unlimited quantities. No one was short of a gallon of petrol, and that has been the position ever since this Government came to power. As the Minister for the A r m y bas said, the great increase in the number of new motor vehicles in Australia and thu abolition of petrol rationing, which was one of the main causes of tlie vast increase Tlie Labour party, in the numbers of motor vehicles, have caused a corresponding increase in the consumption of petrol, and resulted in fhe States being granted much larger sums of money for road construction and maintenance than were formerly provided. When Opposition members argue that all the money collected from petrol tax should be given to the Statesf or road purposes, I feel impelled to remind them of remarks made by the Treasurer when he introduced this measure. He said at that timeIt is sometimes argued that the .petrol tax was introduced for roads purposes and that, as it is ostensibly a tax on motorists, it is only right and proper that it should be used specifically for 'roads. Sucli an argument completely ignores thc facts. Then he gave a history of the petrol tax, and he continuedTu ;1940, .for example, the rule of petrol t>ix was increased by 3d. a gallon, and in 1946 the tax was reduced by Id. a gallon-in each case without any change being made in the proportion of the tax set aside for roads purposes. Finally,, it is a .fallacy to say that .anything like the whole amount of tlie petrol tax is paid by motorists. Only a week or two ago, the president of the Long Distance Eoad Transport Association of Australia declared that "" whatever tax is paid by the commercial carrier, it must be passed on to the public in the cost of sioods and services "". Therefore we return to the point that a Although a similar set of circumstances contribution is being made ail along tbe exists to-day, bonorable members opposite line by the whole community for this are running away from the position. purpose. If the whole of the community is making -a contribution, it is tlie duty of this Government, as a central government, to see that the community benefits, by some means, as a consequence.

You, Mr Deputy Speaker, know the position in Queensland better than does any other member. Y o u know only too well that the Minister who is responsible for the allocation of that money in Queensland has deliberately been playing about with the Queensland fund . Y o u know that, instead of this money having been made available freely to local authorities for road works, it has been lent to them for that purpose. You know moreover, that it was you who raised the matter on the floor of tbe House as a result of which amending legislation was passed in 1955 to ensure that the local authorities in country areas received at least 40 per cent, of the allocations for a particular State. It was also stated this morning that £1,360,000 remains unexpended in the Western Australian trust fund. I tried, by way of interjection, to tell my colleague, the honourable member for Deakin, that admittedly the records show the money as being unexpended, but I assure him and the House generally that the money at least is allocated. It must be remembered that, by the time the necessary legislation is passed, the money collected, and the records submitted, we are working some months behind in Western Australia. two hours behind for a start. able member for Hume says, we are two hours behind. that we receive here do hot reveal the. real position. I remind honourable members who represent electorates in the eastern part of Australia that Western Australia sometimes experiences great difficulty in obtaining the necessary plant for road works. Every time a strike occurs on the waterfront or in the manufacturing industries of the eastern States, the repercussion is felt in Western Australia some months later. I recall having raised this question in the House when I sat in opposition. A t that time, local authorities in Western Australia hari placed orders for road-making machinery The honourable valued at, for the purposes of argument, £2,500. A friend of some of the gentlemen who are now sitting in oppositionI think, in particular, a friend of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr. Cairns)-the noted J i m Healy, held up 72 ships in Sydney Harbour. Even eighteen months later, Western Australia still had not received that machinery. Instead, it had been driven up to Queensland and as f a r afield as Adelaide by road. B y the time the local authorities in Western Australia obtained the necessary machinery it cost, not, say, £2,500, but £4,500 or £5,000. I say to those honourable members who live on this side of the continent that every time there is a little hold-up in the transportation system, the repercussions are invariably felt in Western. Australia 9, 12 or 18 months later, because, although the area of that State is large, its population and manufacturing centres are small.

126,Mr Cairns,"Tb e honourable membercaught again, I shall go to see the honourable member for Yarra. I said that I received a complimentary copy. Splashed over it were appeals for the construction of roads in Australia. I am reminded of the incident by the remarks of the honourable member for Macquarie, who continually referred to the need for defence highways. I raise no objection to the construction of defence highways, but let the powers that be start at Cooktown in Queensland and work down towards Brisbane, and start on the other side of Australia at Wyndham and work down to Perth, before building this suggested great highway from Brisbane to Adelaide. I raise this matter because just the otber day, like other honourable members, I received from the Australian Road Federation this booklet that I am holding in my hand. Red lights and such things are portrayed right through it. I say to those them be original and get their own persons who are interested in Australian roads that they are insulting their own intelligence when tbey send such publications to people who they think will swallow their suggestions. This is an American publication. It has pictures of cars lined up and if one looks closely amendment? at them one can see what kind of cars they are. They are all Ford VS's probably taken outside the Ford works at Detroit and represented in this publication as having been on the road. Geelong. be at Geelong, because they were driven on the right-hand side of the road. Surely people do not do that in Victoria in order to be different from the rest of the Commonwealth. As one goes through this Americanized high pressure propaganda, one is urged to form organizations to get this and to get that. that it has mentioned. Here, they show a picture of a worker, and I am delighted to look at it because the worker is sitting in a very comfortable lounge room and there is a most exclusive television set in the corner. Well, we have not got television yet. By all means, advocate finanoe for roads! But let us look at this subject properly. Twelve months ago, these organizations were talking about building great autobahns from Sydney to Adelaide. They cited how much a mile it would cost and said what length of road they could build in a year. This propaganda was being fed to people in the hope that they would believe it. Actually, the road would cost thousands of millions of pounds to build, and would take 50 or 60 years to complete. Then they put up the plea that this was necessary as a defence road. If they want to gull tbe people into swallowing that story, let them realize that the most vulnerable places in our Commonwealth are in the north of Queensland, the Northern Territory, and the north-west of Western Australia, where there are over 100,000,000 tons of iron ore SO per cent, pure above high-water mark in Yampi Sound. I suggest that they get some other medium of propaganda instead of feeding this American stuff to us. Let propaganda if they want to do that sort of thing. What does the Australian Labour party hope to achieve with the demand that it has made, and by its proposed The amendment states that the Government's proposal should be withdrawn. Does the Opposition really want to bold up the payment of money to the States to prevent them going on with their works programmes? The Opposition has completely confused this issue. This bill authorizes the transfer of an additional Id. a gallon from the fund that has been raised so that it can be spent on roads. It may be a very good idea for the Opposition to give further thought to this matter before it moves an amendment along the lines purpose of this bill is to amend the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act in order to deal with the distribution of the additional tax that has been placed on petrol by the Government. Out of the amount to be raised, it is proposed that 2d. a gallon shall be confiscated and held by the Government in its private coffers, and",39,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

132,Mr Clark (Darling) [2.58],"Thethat only Id. a gallon shall be made availexports. The point is made continuously able for road improvement throughout Australia. Two issues are involved, and I shall deal with tbem later. One is the economic effect of the legislation; and the other is the distribution and use of money raised in this fashion for the purpose of road construction in Australia. Before dealing with those matters, I shall dispose of a couple of points that have been raised by the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton). He was the first speaker for the Australian Country party in this debate. Evidently, he bas been put up as tbe chief spokesman for that party. Honourable members who represent country areas which are crying out for roads and road improvement know the parlous condition of roads iu those areas. Very little substantial improvement bas been carried out to tbose roads in recent years because the necessary funds have not been available. As a matter of fact, it is said that it is almost impossible, with the heavy transport using the roads, to undertake the ordinary and reasonable maintenance of the roads. If we are to develop this country, we should substantially improve the roads. As a matter of fact, early history indicates that one of the greatest developable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) mental measures of a nation was the building of improved roads. In the history of Rome, one thing stands out above all others, and that is the way in which the Romans improved the roads in. the areas in which they went. With the good roads they brought civilization and an improved way of life to the people. It is only by improving roads in the back country of Australia that we can hope to bring greater amenities to the people who live in those areas. It is only by improving the roads that we can hope to reduce the cost of marketing their products. The Australian Country party is absolutely neglecting its responsibility to circumstances from tbe present. It was the country people by advocating that more money should not be made available out of the additional taxation of £12,000,000 to improve country roads throughout Australia. As a matter of fact, the cry to-day is for additional that costs are fast rising in Australia. Everybody knows that the greatest contributing factor in the cost of primary industry in this country is the cost of transport. It is only by the establishment of modern roads that we can possibly hope to improve that position. A point was also made that this legislation is not for the purpose of road improvement but is primarily for the purpose of producing revenue; and that only a small proportion of the tax collected is being and should be made available for road improvement. I hope that I have successfully contested that point and shown that the whole of the amount collected should be made available for road maintenance. As a matter of fact, when the Labour party was in office in 1948, it was pointed out that we did not spend the whole of the money that we received from petrol tax on road improvement. I want to point out that One of the troubles of Australian Country party members and of members of the Government is that they live in the past. The Opposition is offering, a policy for to-day and for the future. Government supporters are confused on future policy for the development of this country. Tbey should not live in the past as the. honorusually does. They should be a little more modern in their approach to the problems of the day. At the recent general election, the Labour party put forward a policy to the people wbich provided that we would give the whole of the petrol tax for the development and construction of roads in Australia. We have not departed from that policy. We say that the present Government is remiss in its duty in not providing all the funds that the States can expend in carrying out road construction. But what the Labour Government did in 1948 matters little indeed because it was done under a different set of done in a period of reconstruction which came after a great war when the whole of our national resources had been devoted to war purposes. After long years of anti-Labour governments in this country, the Labour Government during the war had to divert men into the Allied ""Works Council in order to carry out road construction-abov e all things-in Australia. Roads were constructed through various States including New South Wales, Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia for the defence of this country. The adequate defence of Australia could not bave been undertaken if the work of road construction had not been carried out by Labour during that war period. I say that it was a reflection, available, and the work for which it was at least, on the previous anti-Labour administrations that they had neglected road construction and the defence of Australia to such an extent that labour had to be diverted from war activities to road construction. Had those roads been constructed in the period of the depression when there was a surplus of man-power, OT between those years and the outbreak of war, we would have been able to use that labour on more urgent works for the furtherance of the war effort. Man-power was wasted in those times on works that had been neglected. Similar works are being neglected to-day. Why, the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer), before the suspension of the sitting for lunch, took the floor and told us that adequate money was being provided for roads, in present circumstances. Tbis came from the man who is in ministerial charge of the Army, and who should know that the Army must move over the land and cannot, like the Air Force, fly over the land, and does not, like the Navy, sail on the sea. Unless roads are constructed the Army cannot move. As a matter of fact, the bill provides for the setting aside of a certain amount of money for expenditure by the Commonwealth on the construction of roads for defence purposes. I made inquiries about where and how such money was being expended, and I discovered that all of it was being expended on the maintenance of roads in the Northern Territory. Nothing further is being done to develop new defence roads. I say that the Government is neglecting its duty in that regard also. I do not wish to chide the Australian Country party again for its neglect to carry out the promises it made during general election campaigns; but I think it is within the memory of the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) and other members of the same party, that promises were made by their leader in 1949 to make £250,000,000 available to carry out country works, chiefly road construction. Money raised from loans launched by the Commonwealth was to be lent, free of interest, to State governments. That money has not been made to be used has not been done. When the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) introduced his supplementary budget some time ago he attempted to mislead us regarding the objectives of that measure. He was not prepared to bring down that supplementary budget at the proper budgetary time last year, or to tell the people at the last general election in December that he intended to bring it down. He wanted to keep hidden from the people his intention to raise additional taxes, including additional petrol taxes. He told us that the supplementary budget was brought down to reduce the community's spending power, and to overcome inflation, but, in fact, the revenue derived from the increase of taxes will merely add to the cost of living. The increased sales tax on motor vehicles will add considerably to transport costs, and therefore to the prices of commodities carried by motor transport. The supplementary budget, instead of alleviating the present worsening economic position, will aggravate it. The fact is that, as a result of the deteriorating economic position, the revenue is falling in other directions. This has led the Government to increase tax revenue in an attempt to balance its budget and finance public works, which should be financed out of loan moneys. But the Government is unable to finance public works out of loan moneys because, as has been amply demonstrated, the people have lost confidence in the Government, and willnot subscribe to its loans the money necessary foT the financing of large public works. So, the Government has to slug the people to obtain the money for such works as the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric power scheme. { Mr Bowden) -Order! The honourable meinber knows that these matters are not under discussion on this bill, which is concorned with the allocation of moneys. Mr OX ARK I believe that the increase of petrol tax is for the purpose of balancing the budget. I was trying to emphasize the deteriorating economic position. I leave it at that. My point is that the Government has destroyed thc credit of this country, and the only means by which it can obtain extra revenue is to levy increased taxes. -Order! knows quite well that this is not the taxing bill. This bill is concerned with tlic distribution of the money raised by the tax. to the point. I wish to point out further, that the additional amount that will be raised by the increase of tbe petrol tax is £12,000,000, of which only £4,000,000 will be made available for road improvements. The balance will go into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. I believe that the whole of the additional proceeds, the entire £12,000,000, should be made available for road purposes. As a matter of fact, tbe Opposition intends to move an amendment to achieve that objective. J hope that when that amendment is before us honourable members who represent country areas, in particular, will realize the absolute necessity for road improvements in the outback, and will support the amendment. I am quite sure that if local governing bodies to-day were each to get an additional few thousands of pounds of revenue they would soon show that they have the man-power and the material to enable them to expend that money usefully on road works. ""When tbe Labour Government left office iu 1949 we were facing an entirely different set of circumstances. As I pointed out earlier, at that time we were engaged in rehabilitating this country after the war, and many of the local government bodies did not have the equipment to enable them to engage in road works and expend all the money for road purposes then allocated to them by tbe Labour Government.' If I remember aright, in the last year the Labour Government was in office, we had £3,500,000 or more of unexpended money in the roads fund, and when the then Treasurer, Mr Chifley, was asked to make further funds available to the States for road purposes he said that the States and their local government instrumentalities were not able to expend all the money that they were already getting. He told them, however, that when it was demonstrated that the States and the local government authorities could use the money they were getting, and spend further money, the Government was prepared to make it available. I am quite sure that The honourable gentleman if the Labour Government had remained in office longer than it did, extra money would have been provided. It is well known to honourable members, particularly to those witb long terms of service in the Parliament, that the Labour party had a post-war scheme for extensive bituminization of roads throughout Australia. Expression was 'given to that great need, not only in the Parliament but also in the press. But in recent years very little work of this kind has been carried out. The latest information that I can obtain shows that between 1948-49 and 1953-54 only 4,000 miles of roads were bituminized. In that period only 4,000 miles of virgin roadsthat is, roads formed, cleared, and provided with a natural surface-were constructed. The Government has failed lamentably to honour its undertaking to provide funds for the improvement of road surfaces and the extension of road mileage. In 1948, there were 511,000 miles of roads in Australia; in 1953 there were 520,000 miles of roads-a n increaso in that period of only 9,000 miles. The smallness of that increase is due to the shortage of money for carrying out this essential work. Speakers on this side of the House have emphasized that this is work of a national character. In other great countries road improvement and development has been carried out on a national basis. The only authority that is able to raise the necessary funds to do the work property is the Commonwealth. A little earlier this afternoon, we heard a discussion across the chamber between a Western Australian member",40,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

135,Mr Clark,"I think my remarks aroand a number of Victorian members, in wbich the representatives of the respective States complained that one State was not getting sufficient money because the other State was getting too much, or that not enough road work was being undertaken in the other State. That sort of thing is detrimental to the proper carryto take place, and the cost of marketing ing out of an Australia-wide road programme. There is too much bickering between States, with one State claiming that it does not get sufficient funds and that other States are not doing enough with the money they receive. The Snowy Mountains hydro-electric project bad to be undertaken by the Commonwealth. New South Wales and Victoria had bickered about it for approximately 60 years, and nothing but bickering would have happened yet but for tlie enterprise of the Commonwealth. If the Commonwealth were responsible for the main task of road construction, there would be less buck-passing between the Commonwealth and the States, and the job would be done much more satisfactory. In the years during which I have been in this Parliament, I havo heard various members from time to time make the excuse that road works are the function of the States. ing, the Minister for the Army preached the text that the Commonwealth has no responsibility in this matter. He said that the responsibility rests with local governing authorities and with the State governments. I say tbe responsibility rightly belongs to the Commonwealth, which should shoulder its responsibility and should not try to back out of it, as the Minister endeavoured to do this morning, by trying to put the responsibility on the State governments and on local governing bodies. Tbe local authorities have very small revenues indeed, and they are not in a position to undertake extensive and costly road construction programmes. The States have to obtain from the Commonwealth funds for almost every activity they undertake, and the Commonwealth should see that money is made available for necessary road construction works throughout Australia. It should make available suflicient funds for a proper job to be done. I emphasize that point, and I hope the Government will take cognisance of the fact that country people are crying out for the improvement of their roads and that their cries are not heard. If the Government wishes more people to settle in the country areas, more development primary products to be reduced, it should lower road construction costs by entering into road works on a bigger scale and constructing up-to-date thoroughfares. I wish to direct the attention of tbe House also to the increased burden on the roads to-day. In 194S, there were approximately 1,224,000 motor vehicles registered in Australia. The latest registration figures I have been able to obtain are for the 31st December, 1955, when there were 2,214,634 motor vehicles registered in Australia-a n increase of about 1,000,000 vehicles. Any one capable of simple arithmetic sbould realize that the greatly increased number of vehicles on the roads must bave a very considerable effect on the rate of deterioration and destruction of our roads. I u 1945, there were only about 800,000 motor vehicles registered in Australia. Only this mornNot only has the number of vehicles using the roads increased tremendously, but also a very substantial proportion of tbe vehicles now registered are heavy transport vehicles equipped to carry loads of 10 and 20 tons, whereas, in the pa:!, the maximum load was, perhaps, about 5 tons. Tbe destruction caused by transport vehicles to-day is not strictly in proportion to the use they make of the roads. It is far greater, because the weight of the vehicles themselves, and the loads carried, are much greater than was the case in earlier years. In the light of these facts, the Opposition's proposal that the whole of the proceeds of the additional petrol tax should be made available to the States for the improvement and construction of roads is very reasonable. The only argument that thc Government can advance against tbe proposal is that it does not consider the roads should be improved. Apparently, it considers they are sufficiently up to date. Indeed, that was, more or less, the tenor of the speech of the honourable meniber for Canning, who is a member of the Australian Country party. myself and other Opposition member* money available to the States for road who know the country areas well, is that works. I hope it will make the whole country people are extremely dissatisfied of the proceeds of the additional petrol with their roads at present. The Ministax available for the improvement and ter for Social Services( Mr Roberton) the construction of roads. knows that. I wonder whether he will address the House during this debate. Does he support the measure, although [3.23] -What is needed is less politics it does not make available for road and more roads. I do not propose to works tbe whole of the proceeds of the follow clown some of the alleyways of additional petrol tax? Will he say that political abuse into which the House has sufficient funds are being made available -been led in this debate. I wish to get for the construction of country roads, down to the roads problem. I was rather or will he say that too much money is disappointed in the Government's probeing spent on country roads at the posals in this bill. When the debate on present time? I should like him to tell the general economic proposals was in the local authorities in his electorate, and progress in this House some time ago, I his constituents, that he thinks tbe roads mentioned that I considered that the are too good for them, that they are in whole of the additional money to be raised satisfactory condition, and that, thereby this increased tax on petrol should before, tbere is no need to spend more devoted to road works. I still hold that money on them. Would the Minister view. As honourable members know, I agree, off the record, that the whole of bave circulated an amendment designed tbe proceeds of tbe additional tax should to achieve that object, which I hope to be made available to the States for road move at the committee stage. There is a works? I realize that, in this matter, he lot to be said for the view that we should is tied hand and foot by the Government, not waste money by frittering it away on and that he could hardly be expected to roads without a plan. I do not think it say openly that he disagrees with the is enough merely to add the proceeds of measure. to the Ministry. must keep quiet for some time if he does fact, we need a roads plan, and a roads not wish to be dropped from it. The fund. I consider that the money to be point I wish to make in relation to the raised by this additional tax, which the increased traffic on the roads is that the Government has said will be only temvast increase of the number and the porary, should be used to form the weight of vehicles greatly accentuates nucleus of that special fund, wbich should their destructive effect on the good roads be the foundation of a national roads plan. that already exist. Those roads must be I am not going to canvass the details substantially improved, and a considerof the amendment which I hope to move able number of other roads must be in committee in that regard. In fact, I constructed in areas where the present do not want to detain the House at this roads are inadequate. In my electorate, stage for very long. which is in the back country of New South Wales, there are very few bitumen roads. The people there depend on history of the petrol tax. That history, ordinary dirt roads that have been merely I fancy, is of academic interest only. graded and formed. In dry times, they We are not really concerned with why are generally beds of dust, and, in wet the tax was imposed originally. What times, they are quagmires and bogs. Tbey are reasonably trafficable for only a very short period of the year. The people have long been crying out ior the improvement of those roads. The Government should this additional petrol tax to roads funds. I should like to see it all spent on roads, structively than roads funds have been We are not just contemplating the",43,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

140,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar),"we are concerned with is how the proceeds can best be applied in the light of present circumstances. A new transport situation is emerging. Our roads are inadequate for the increased number of vehicles which bas come upon them. During the course of the life of this Government, that number has nearly doubled. I believe it is a number which will increase. I do not look on it as a static number. I believe that we have got to plan for more vehicles on the roads. I fear that, in some respects, we have got to plan for heavier vehicles on the roads, because freight seems to be carried by road to a greater extent. We are, in fact,, in a road transport mess, which is going to get worse. Whatever we do in other directions, that has got to be met, because transport is basic to the Australian economy. Something like one-third of our national outlay is upon transport. Unless we have an efficient transport system, we shall never effectively combat the inflationary forces, we shall never keep costs down and we shall never reach the full standard of living to which our people aspire and to which I believe they are entitled by their efforts. We have got to cure the transport tangle. A part of the cure, not all of it, requires greater expenditure on roads and -wha t is even more importanta better planned expenditure on roads. We want to balance the various forms of transport. As the House knows, I have been a great advocate of curing some of the railway tangles. I believe that thai;I make only a passing reference to it-is basic also. We have got to reach tbe position where each form of transports-be it sea, road, rail or air transport-is doing the job for which it is best fitted economically, heavy and slow. Its heavinesss means and which it can do cheapest in terms of real effort. Then, by a combination of the best forms of transport, each in its appropriate place, we will get the greatest efficiency from the economy. I believe that a great deal of the stuff which now goes between capital cities by road would go better by rail. I think it would be more economical for it to do so. I believe also that there are goods at present going by rail which could be transported more economically by road, especially if they involve short hauls and non-specialized hauls. In view /of the extra cost of double loading and double unloading, damage in transit and other factors of that character, some goods could be hauled better and more effectively by road than by rail. So, whatever we do, we-have got to plan for increased road traffic. That means that we must have a better roads system, particularly a better system of main arterial roads. We have got to keep some sense of proportion here. We have, got to cure first tbose road bottlenecks where the greatest volume of traffic occurs. We have got to look, first, to our main arterial highways. I am not saying that tbose are the only roads that we should look at, but I am saying that they are the first roads that we should look at. We need a national roads scheme. Eor that, we need both a plan and plant. I believe that one of the purposes for whicli this money could best be used would be to set up in each State a pool of heavy road machinery, which would make the construction of future main highways more economic. I believe that, instead of giving the States this money, as an addition, to fritter away-that is what happens usually in the case of ad hoc additions*we should see that the money-whic h maybe a non-recurring item, because the Government has said that this increased tax is only a temporary measure-wil l be put into a pool so that it can be used to the best advantage. If this is a temporary tax, then this is a temporary opportunity which should not be wasted. There are many things which can be done to our main highways. We have got to realize that they are now carrying a great deal of freighter traffic, which is that there has got to be a reconstruction of the pavement of the roads. Its slowness means that, in some cases, the design of the highways must be changed so that these heavy vehicles will not block the roads, as they very often do, and line up behind them long rows of cars which get into each other's way and impede thf flow of traffic along the whole of the highway. There is a fairly simple thing that can be donein regard to that. PerhapsI can digress' for a moment. It will be only for a moment, because this is a small matter. These heavy freighter vehicles move fairly fast down hills and along flats-so fast that private cars find difficulty in passing them. But they go very slowly up hills. Because of curves or crests, passing on hills is unsafe, particularly if there is a long line of cars behind a freighter. It very often happens that cars driven by nervous drivers accumulate behind a trailer, it would be easy to widen roads, on the left hand side going up hills, so that freighters, which go uphill very slowly by reason of their low horse-power-weight ratio, could keep well to the left and allow faster traffic to pass them on the hills. Then we should find that dangerous accumulations of traffic would uot occur on the flats, because the roads up the hills-mos t of our main highways have a fair number of hills on them-woul d have passing space. It would require perhaps, only a few hundreds of thousands of pounds to do that on a main highway, but it would make the highway a very much more functional instrument. It would get rid of, if not all, then a great and significant part of the congestion, l t is that kind of planned expenditure, which I mention only in passing, that we should have in mind. I realize that the imposition of this increased duty is a Treasury problem. 1 am aware of tbe factors which induced the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) to impose this extra tax. I realize that, in view of the inflationary tendencies at present loose in the community, the Treasurer would not want, this month or next month, to inflate the roads expenditure of the States, and thus cause greater employment difficulties throughout the Commonwealth. But that is a transitory and very temporary affair. What may be true in May, June or July will uot necessarily be true in August, September or October. I realize also that tbe Treasiirer does not want to put into the hands of the States road moneys which they might find it diflicult to expend. We have already heard of some of the difficulties that are occurring in Western Australia. I understand that the same is true of Queensland. It is much better, if this money is to be made available, to make it available in accordance with an ordered plan, because that can be done in ft. -[83 ] a way which conforms entirely to the technical requirements of tbe _ Treasury. If the Treasurer does nbt expend the money this year, but holds it in a trust account, it is just as good to him technically as if it were paid into Consolidated Bevenue. At the present moment, as we know, and as the Treasurer and the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) have told us, there is a cash deficit and the situation is being met by transfers between trust and revenue funds. So it does not matter tuppence from the real point of view whether this money is held in a trust fund or in Consolidated Revenue, provided that it is held. Knowing exactly the financial troubles which the Treasurer is facing, I sympathize with his position and I would not propose anything which would in any way aggravate those financial troubles. Instead, my proposal is that we should take this money and put tbe whole 3d. a gallon into a trust fund, and that the trust fund should be payable to the States within the next twelve months-that is to say, that would be the upper limit, but perhaps it would be paid before that time and used for the purpose of obtaining approved heavy road plant and for approved schemes for the reconstruction of our main arterial highways. In other words, I believe that we should put it aside. It is a non-recurring nucleus for a real foundation for a national roads plan. Of course, it is not enough to carry the thing through. One does not think of that, because in all these affairs one has to start in a fairly modest way because the organization takes some time to get going. I believe that tbe right place to start is probably a machinery pool in every one of the States, which would help them to carry out their future schemes more efficiently. I believe that this can be achieved in a manner which does not in any way interfere with the technical requirements of the Treasurer in relation to the economic situation. If this is a revenue tax-and there is something to be said for that point of viewthe proposal I make will not get in the Treasurer's way in this vital inflationary period which he is trying to ride down, and some phases of which the Prime Minister has assured us will be under control by the end of this financial year. There is a"" proposal from the Opposition that we should just take this money and pay it away to the States. I cannot altogether support that, although I can sympathize with the view, which I do support, that the whole of the extra petrol money should go to tbe States. I think it is far better to deal with it in this ordered way, both because it will help the Treasurer in his present difliculties and because it will enable a more efficient use to be made of the money for road purposes when it gets into the hands of the States. Eor those reasons I feel a little regret am moving to the right. But in respect that the Government has not seen fit to ear-mark the whole of these extra proceeds. We are in a position to-day where we have to balance the various forms of transport one against the other. We have to see that the right things go by rail and that the right things go by road. I do not believe that we need a great system of compulsion. I should like to see perhaps all of these artificial that is the case, it gives my agreement restrictions upon transport removed. We must find a fair basis of competition. That fair basis must mean, surely, that each system must pay tbe proper proportion for its own permanent way. In the present situation, whatever happens, looking at the matter on a national scale, we must do more to help Australian roads. We must spend more on roads in the national interest, in' tbe present state of technical transport development. It seems to me to be a little short-sighted not to nse the money which is specifically raised from transport to pay for the facilities for transport. It is perfectly true, as honourable members have said earlier in this debate, that all share in these costs. Yes, but that is not the point. The point is that all share also in those transport outlays, and if we are to have the most efficient system of transport all will benetax should go to the States, but in point fit, and we get the most efficient system of transport when we can lay down conditions of natural competition between different forms of transport. We want the scales to be held fairly, and I am afraid that the present proposal does not quite exemplify all those principles. Por those reasons I am hoping to move, in the committee stage of this bill, the amendment which I handed to the Clerk of the House last night and which was circulated .early this morning to honourable members. some satisfaction in fol owing the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) in this debate, because I find that there is much in what he said with which I agree and with which other members of the Opposition will agree. At the same time. I feel some disquiet. I am not sure whether the honourable member for Mackellar is moving to the left or I of the heavy traffic on the roads, which, according to the honourable member, seems to move not dissimilarly from water in that it rushes downhill and, at best, moves slowly under pressure uphill, the honourable member for Mackellar has noticed what an improvement there would be if it could move to the left. Perhaps like the heavy traffic, tbe honourable member is moving to the left. If with him a feeling of comfort, in that I would not be moving as far to the right as he is in most things. The measvre before us will have the effect of distributing the £12,000,000 that the Government expects to receive as a result of increasing the petrol tax by 3d. a gallon. It also has a second effect, which seems to be no obvious part, at any rate, of the Government's intention, and it is this second effect that I desire to stress. The second effect changes the proportion of the total proceeds of the petrol tax which is obtained by tbe States from the Commonwealth, and this is a most important matter. Tbe Opposition, and the honourable member for Mackellar, think that the greater part, or all, of the proceeds'of the 3d. increase in the petrol of fact the second main effect of this bill is to reduce the proportion of the total revenue from the petrol tax which will be going to the States. Not only does the Government disagree with the attitude of the Opposition and that of the honourable member for Mackellar, but it is going to the other extreme and, by",45,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads
141,Mr Cairns (Yarra) 13.43],"I havethis measure, paying to the States a still smaller proportion of the total revenue in one year from petrol tax. I wish to lay considerable stress upon that aspect, but before dealing with it and one or two other matters that are closely associated with it, I wish to point out that building roads is not just a matter of granting more money, or of deciding that all,. or a larger proportion, of the revenue from petrol taxation shall be paid to the States for the purpose of building more roads. It is also, and fundamentally, a question of whether more men and materials will be available for this purpose. The honourable, member for Mackellar has spoken of planned road development. I am completely in agreement with that, but it might be more acceptable to Government supporters to bear the word "" planned "" coming from the honourable member for Mackellar than from myself. The honourable member' has pointed out that it. is not only a matter of getting money and distributing it, but of deciding how it should be used so as to give us the kind of road development that we most need. Nor'is it merely a matter for decision on technical grounds, but rather of deciding whether the men and materials will be available in this sector of the economy. At present they are not available in sufficient quantity. If they are to become available-and I suggest that this question is closely related to the billa change will be needed not only in the way in which revenue of this sort will be used but in national economic policy as a whole. What is needed is a change in the relative attractions in the economy, and particularly of lending and investment. As we have pointed out measures which have been discussed recently, it is a matter of relative economic attractions the relative returns that are to come from lending and investment in particular directions. If we are to permit a continuation of excessive returns to private investment we shall not be able to obtain the resources that we need for road building. An associated matter which also has a distinct bearing upon whether tbe objectives of this bill will, be achieved is capital issues control. ( Mr Xawxence) -Order! Unless the honourable member can indicate how he proposes to link his remarks with a consideration of this measure, I cannot allow him to continue on those lines. proposal to the House the Minister saidIf, therefore, we were to adopt the suggestion that the whole of the increase of 3d. in the petrol tax be devoted to roads, we would have to raise this nioney from some other source. Methods of raising money from other sources have been made relevant to the raising of money in this way because of the Minister's method of presenting the bill to the Parliament, and the debate has proceeded on those lines. I would remind you, also, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, that the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton) raised the question of the need to draw revenue from other sources if the additional requirements of the States were to be satisfied. I am, therefore, merely following the line of argument initiated by the Minister and continued by the honourable member for Canning. The use of the money to be made available to the States involves the question whether men and materials are available for road building. I suggest that that, in turn, involves a consideration of capital issues control. The Prime Minister had something to say on this subject in his economic statement on the 14th May last. He saidThere may be a good deal to be said for introducing selectivity into the demand for capital by some system of capital issues control like the one which existed during the war and was thereafter for a time continued under the defence power . . . but for present in considering other economic purposes any discussion of that problem would be premature. I suggest that a discussion of this problem is not premature. We are discussing the question of raising revenue and spending it upon the construction of roads. We shall achieve the ends that we set out to achieve only if we can ensure that this kind of legislation is accompanied by a suitable national economic policy. Therefore, as I suggested at the beginning of my consideration of this point, it is not merely a matter of getting money, or more money, but of whether",48,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads
142,Mr Acting Deputy Speaker,,49,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads
143,Mr Cairns,"In presenting thismen and materials will be available. That being the case, this bill can be considered in. relation to whether the whole or portion of the revenue to be derived should be distributed between the States and the Commonwealth with a view to its being eventually used for road construction. It is only logical that the Commonwealth should accept responsibility for main roads. Moreover, it should, and must, accept the responsibility for national development. member use his influence with the Labour party to ensure that the power to do so i. given to the Commonwealth? a member for Darling( Mr Clark) made out quite a strong case on this point, and I merely want to set against it the argument used by the Minister for the appears to liave taken a rather parochial Commonwealth point of view and suggested that the responsibility should fall upon the States. Of all the members of tbe Government, I would have least expected the Minister primarily responsible for defence to put forward this argument. Surely main roads are, from the point of view of defence, mainly a matter for the Commonwealth. When one considers the defence aspect in association with the arguments raised by the lionorable member for Darling one sees that the responsibility is clearly that of Hie Commonwealth. My second point is that it seems logical that the proceeds from a petrol tax should bo expended on roads. It is a tax upon vehicles which travel upon the roads and is levied somewhat in proportion to tbe extent to which the roads are used. Surely there could be no more logical connection between a tax and tbe way in which it is to be spent. I can hardly think of a tax in which the connection is more logical. The tax is also related, quite closely, to the extent to which the roads are used by each particular vehicle. II is related to the weight of the vehicle and. therefore, to the amount of damage that it does to the roads. For instance, the driver of a light car which uses only a small amount of petrol can travel many mort) miles to the gallon and, therefore, pay less in tax than does the driver of a heavy vehicle wbich does much more damage and travels fewer miles to the gallon. The connection between the way in wbich the tax is derived and spent is very logical. That being so, it is even more difficult to follow the reasoning of the Government in this matter. Perhaps it was not completely aware of the consequences. The bill reduces the proportion of total revenue from the petrol tax which will be distributed to tbe States and, therefore, spent upon the roads. Before this additional tax was imposed, £7 out of every £10 raised by the tax went to the States and £3 to the Commonwealth, or 70 per cent, of the tax went to the States. This bill concerns the distribution of £12,000,000 at the ratio of £1 to the States and £2 to the Commonwealth or 33$ per cent, to the States and 66$ per cent, to the Commonwealth. Before this measure, £34,000,000 was Army( Mr Cramer), who raised and seven-tenths, or £23,800,000, went to the States', and £10,200,000 to the Commonwealth. Under this bill, one-third of £12,000,000, or £4,000,000, goes to the States and two-thirds, or £8,000,000, goes to the Commonwealth. £8,000,000 go to? £12,000,000 concerned. When one looks at the situation, one sees that £27,800,000 goes to the State and £18,200,000 to the Commonwealth. That means that of the total of £46,000,000 that will be raised if the Government succeeds in obtaining the £12,000,000 in this way-that is to say, the total proceeds of the petrol tax60.434 per cent, will go to the States as against 70 per cent, before this bill. member's argument ? Army had been listening, be would have followed my reasoning. The argument is that the Government will, in fpct, pay a smaller proportion of the petrol tax to the States after this bill than was paid before, the very opposite of the argument advanced by the Opposition. Of course, if the Government wants to do this, that is its own business; but it is only able to do so because it has a majority in this House.",49,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

149,Mr Cairns,"If the Minister fortheI t is true, as has been pointed out, that vernment authorities and State governexpenditure on roads has increased in recent years. The aggregate expenditure by tbe States in 1949-50 was £4,364,000 and by 1953-54 it had risen to £9,893,000. Local governinent expenditure on roads from loan sources in 1953-54 was £29,700,000 and from revenue £10,800,000, or a total expenditure on roads by local government authorities and by State governments of about £50,000,000. The total national expenditure in that year was about £5,000,000,000. So we. have the rather comforting thought on the one band that there has been an increase in expenditure on roads, so that the Government can say that it bas more than doubled the amount of money provided for the States, even allowing for increased prices. But when this has been taken into account, that comforting thought should not be given very much time in our minds because, of the total national expenditure in that year of about £5,000,000,000, only £50,000,000, or about 1 per cent., was spent upon the building and maintenance of roads in the Commonwealth. income? ture of about £5,000,000,000. I am talking about expenditure, not income. It is a fantastically low percentage, when we realize that, for reasons of development, roads are of such great importance to the Commonwealtb. Railways cannot be built and airlines subsidized as economically as, at least, subsidiary road services of great importance can be developed, and much of that applies also to main roads. It seems to me that an expenditure of about 1 per cent, of tbe total national expenditure in this way is fantastically low. The second point I want to make in relation to road expenditure with which the Government seems to comfort itself, is the position of the local government authorities and the State governments. When we find that an organization or a government is carrying on its affairs only by getting more deeply into debt, then vve become disturbed about the situation. I want to direct the attention of the House to this point, because local goments have been getting into debt in recent years at a disturbingly high rate. The total amount raised by loans by local government authorities in 1948-49 was about £12,000.000. The last figure I have is £21,000,000 in 1951-52. That seems to me to be a considerable increase; but the total local government debt in 1953 was £125,000,000, and it is much more at present. The position with the States is even more disturbing. In 1949, the debts of State governments were £1,008,000,000, or £128 ls. I d . a head Certainly the States have been able to carry on some of their activities and roads have been maintained at some kind of a rate. Increased figures of expenditure in these directions can be quoted. But other associated matters should be considered. What has been happening with State debts at tbe same time? In 1950, the total was £1,078,000,000, or £132 7s. 7d. a head, l n 1951 it was £1,208,000,000, or £144 Os. 5d. a head In 1952 it was £1,395,000,000, or £162 3s. 9d. a head. the national In 1953 it was £1,543,000,000, or £175 15s. 2d. a head. In 1954 it was £1,6S'S,000,000, or £188 18s. 4d. a head. It seems to me that State and municipal authorities that are being forced, because of the lack of revenue from ordinary sources, to go into debt to that extent can bc said to be very far from a prosperous or satisfactory condition. It is all right for the Commonwealth Government to tell the State governments that it is their responsibility to undertake greater activities in these directions. But at what cost? At what kind of cost? It seems to me that tbe Commonwealth Government has to face its responsibilities to raise revenue directly from the public, and here we come to a key point in the platform of the party to which I belong. We believe in raising revenue by direct taxation in proportion to ability to pay, as far as possible, for purposes of this sort. I turn now to another question. It is true that expenditure on roads has increased, and it is true that the Commonwealth has provided more money from the petrol tax for these purposes. It is also true, as I quoted in relation to another point some little time ago, that",50,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

"" This question has been raised a hundred times and it was one of the main points in the speech of the honourable member for Canning a little while ago. The Treasurer also said, in effect, "" If , therefore, we were to adopt a foot in the cities.

What a terrible predicament the Government would be in ! It might have to carry out some of its responsibilities as a gotbe most difficult of all taxes to pass on. vernment, if it could not take 2d. out of the 3d. increase that it has imposed upon petrol. Let us have a look at some of the places to which the Government could turn for revenue without turning the country upside down and without putting people on the streets to beg. Let us have a look at some of the otber possibilities to get the Government out of the predicament it uses to justify taking 2d. out of the extra 3d. levied on petrol. I should like to preface my submission with these remarks: I know that tbe States in some cases can very well raise more revenue in certain directions. I know that can be done, but it is quite useless. It is not a proper exercise of national responsibility for the Prime Minister to go to a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers and to say to the State Premiers, in effect, "" You must increase your taxes on certain items before we will give you any more money "". Let us consider some of the ways in which the Australian Government could raise more revenue if it were prepared to run the risk of doing its job as a government. Land tax was abolished by this Governnient on the lst July, 1952. £6,19S,76S was raised in land tax. Land tax could have been increased above the rates that were operating in 1952 without doing any injustice to the people whom members of the Australian Country party are supposed to represent. The rates of land tax could have been increased without greatly increasing the could have been raised mainly at the expense of highly populated areas in the city. When the Australian Country party, in order to meet its short-term interests, which it seems to be doing most of the time, supports a government that removes land tax, it is assisting the people who own land valued at £3,000 to £5,000 the farmers at all. passed on to tbe consumer? and recognized that land tax is one of ber for Hume is talking claptrap again. That is not unusual; he is continually talking in that way. WhatI am suggesting is that considerably more tban £6,198,768 could be raised in land tax without harming primary producers. If the Governnient is in such a desperate position for revenue that it has to take 2d. out of every 3d. that it raises in additional petrol tax, then it could turn to land tax, among other things, to fill its coffers. Let us consider another form of tax to which the Government could turn. I refer to estate duty. That is a kind of tax that we in this country have hardly ever used. \Quorum formed.] The honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson), who drew attention to the state of the House, is not normally so badhumoured. I can probably ascribe bis interruption to my speecb to a proper appreciation of the extent to which my arguments have been undermining the Government's position. I was referring In 1951-52 an amount of to estate duty, which was used, in 1953-54, to raise £10,000,000 on estates which were estimated to be of a. dutiable value of £134,000,000. That is to say, by means of estate duty only 7.5 per cent, of the total value of estates subject to that duty was gathered in tax. That tax could be doubled or trebled, and it would",51,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

155,Mr Cairns,"The honourable memhave desirable social effects in producing greater equality in a country that needs greateiequality. It would also have the effect of raising substantial revenue. I now consider gift duty. In 1953-54, only £1,3S5,000 was raised in gift duty on gifts estimated at a value of nearly £33,000,000. Only 4.7 per cent, of the value of those gifts was paid in gift duty. A considerably greater amount could be raised by means of this tax. When one turns to company tax, the position is found to be very similar. From companies that made profits in excess of £50,000 in the year 1953-54. £71,000,000 was raised in company tax on income that amounted, after deduction of incoine tax, to £230,000,000. Therefore, 31 per cent, of those incomes was paid in company tax in this way. The comparable proportion in the United Kingdom and United States of America is 41 per cent., so that here also there is an opportunity to raise considerably more revenue, if the Government wants to get out of this desperate situation that causes it to take 2d. out of every 3d. that is levied in additional excise on a gallon of petrol. 1 suggest that this bill should be opposed, because, in the first place, it changes the proportion of revenue paid to tlie States from the total proceeds from petrol tax. Secondly, it does not provide adequate revenue for the States for the purposes of road building, which are so important to the Oommonwealth in all aspects of national development. I have listened to a number of speakers who have taken part in this debate, and one of the most gratifying aspects of their remarks is that they are all agreed that more money should, be provided for roads. A ll honourable members seem to be agreed on that point, and the only important difference appears to be in regard to the method of obtaining this extra, money. Honourable members have wandered over a very wide field during this debate, and, I trust, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you will be as lenient with me as you have been witb the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns), who digressed very frequently. The purpose of this bill is to increase tbe amount of money to be granted to the States from petrol tax, so that they will now receive 8d. for every gallon of petrol that is sold in Australia. This provision can be taken as an indication that thc Government feels that something should be done about our roads, but, on present levels of consumption of petrol, it provides for increased contributions to the States of only £4,000,000 a year. All I can say on this matter is that it is high time we took a careful look at what should be done in the way of providing finance for road purposes. In February of this year, a meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council was held in Hobart. At that meeting, certain informed people, much better informed than many of the honourable members in this House, pointed out that proper road construction and maintenance in Australia requires an expenditure of about £1,000,000,000 in tbe next ten years. The Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator Paltridge) has indicated that it is expected that about £700,000,000 will be provided i i i that period. The people concerned in presenting a case for increased facilities for transport, and particularly for roads, believe that the amount provided will be closer to £500,000,000. No matter how we approach the problem, there will be a shortage of either £30,000,000 or £50,000,000 a year. I shall take the lower figure of £30,000,000 a year as being the sum required. Several honourable members have adopted the attitude-it is a very understandable one, because this tax has grown up over very many years-that the whole of the petrol tax should be made available for roads purposes. It is very easy to advance that argument, because, as has been pointed out, the motorists use the roads and pay the tax. Indeed, the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) has pointed out that 65 per cent, or 70 per cent, of the total amount of petrol consumed is used in commercial vehicles, which indicates that a large part of the tax is passed on and becomes a community cost. But farmers and fishermen also come into the picture. They are vitally concerned because they must use the roads to get",52,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads
156,Mr Buchanan (Mcmillan) [4.12].,"their products to the markets. I u addition, a farmer who usea, say, a 40-gallon drum of petrol a week for his mechanized /equipment, will be paying a couple of pounds a week in tax, which is quite a lot of money. If such a suggestion were put to the farmers and fishermen, they probably would be quite willing to agree to the money being spent on roads, but the trouble is that, even if we applied to this purpose all the money that is available from the petrol tax, it would not be nearly sufficient to cope with the problem. Of the total estimated receipts of approximately £48,000,000 from petrol tax this year, £31,000,000 or £32,000,000 is to be distributed to tbe States. It will be seen that that allocation will not overcome the difficulty. Tn my opinion, any tax that is imposed for a specific purpose is a bad tax. We realize that revenue must be raised from some source, and I am not quibbling about the fact that a tax has been imposed on petrol. Because of its universal use, petrol seems to me to be in the same category as beer and tobacco; it is an excellent source of revenue. But I aline the petrol tax with the pay-roll tax, which was introduced for the purpose of paying child endowment. Any tax that is earmarked for a specific purpose must fail to achieve its primary object. Either too much money is raised for the particular purpose, which means that the rate of tax 13 too heavy, or the position, is just the opposite. If we cannot find other sources of revenue, by all means let us retain these taxes, but if we must find money for such purposes as roads or child endowment, I submit that the correct way to do it is to decide how much is needed for the particular purpose and to allocate that 3um from revenue just as is done for such things as defence works. I suggest that a moro effective, way of members opposite have said is true, they nv>'-r>oming tbe roads problem would be should do so. to approach it on a national basis. That suggestion bas been made by several honourable members, but they have not indicatedaffecting just their own small area. If how they think it should be done. I sugwe could get, not only the State govern'fsest that we should convene a meeting of ments, but also the vaj'ious motoring the Federal and the State transport bodies-to forget their own selfish interests Ministers, the Commonwealth Treasurer, and to examine a sound overall plan, it who is vitally concerned, the Minister for should be possible to overcome the backDpfpnce, because defence enters into the log of road construction in ten years,as matter very much, and the Minister for National Development, who I think is more vitally concerned than anybody else, because transport costs, which represent 30 per cent, of our manufacturing costs, have a distinct bearing on every aspect of national development. The State transport Ministers would then be able to furnish reasoned and considered statements about their essential State requirements"". By way of illustration, I remind the House that in Victoria this year approximately £22,000,000 is available for roads purposes, of which about £5,000,000 will come from the petrol tax. The Country Roads Board is contributing approximately £12,000,000, governinent departments, £2,000,000, and municipalities, out of rate payments, £8,000,000. That sum of £22,000,000 will be inadequate. It is estimated that approximately £3:1,000,000 is required. Victoria could place its needs before such a meeting as I have suggested, and the other States would have no difficulty in doing likewise. Thc meeting could be conducted along the same lines as the Australian Loan Council but, I hope, without being bogged down as the Australian Loan Council ao often is. Such a body, which could be called, perhaps, the National Transport Council, could decide on a list of priorities. Then, the difficulties that Western Australia seems to have experienced in obtaining certain machinery would need to be offset, and such sums as the £1,000,000 that it has tucked away would be available for use by another State. It would have to be borne in mind that the States alone have the sovereign power to carry out the actual work. Itwould be necessary for the States to be willing to co-operate. Unfortunately, in some States Labour governments are in office, and tbey might not be prepared to co-operate although, if what honourable Too many people see this problem as waa originally suggested. As tlie position is. the available moneys are really only sufficient to provide for ordinary maintenance. A lot of planning is needed for the improvement of roads in order to reduce costs and to reduce the very heavy wear and tear charges to which vehicles are subject. I instance the fact that it i? planned to spend the sum of £77,000,000 on the Princes Highway over a period of years in straightening bends and providing width. It is not proposed merely to widen the left-hand side of the road going uphill, as the lionorable member for Mackellar ( Mr one of which relates to a basis as to Wentworth) suggested, but to provide a really efficient four-lane road. Any honourable members who leave the city on Friday night and drive for any distance against the oncoming traffic, realize the wonderful asset that it would lie to have a four-lane road to enable those drivers who are going out to avoid driving against the headlights of those who are coming in. [Quorum formed.] In passing, I should like to touch on the subject of the formula that is used. When we examine the amounts of money that are available to the States for expenditure on roads, we find that there are some remarkable differences. To take the total amount available in the financial year 1954-55, for instance, we find that in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia tbe moneys obtained from road tax and registration fees for road improvement were about the same as the amount obtained from petrol tax. Tbat is to say, 55 per cent, of expenditure on roads came from road tax and registrations and 45 per cent, from petrol tax. In the case of Queensland, the corresponding figures were 47 per cent, and 52 per cent.; in Western Australia 10 per cent, and 90 per cent.; and in Tasmania, 31 per cent, and 68 per cent. I also have figures representing the amount of petrol tax received in respect of each motor vehicle in the various States. In New South Wales, £8 is collected from petrol tax in respect of each motor vehicle; in Victoria, £5; in South Australia, £9; in Queensland, £13; in Western Australia, £26; and in Tasmamia. £14; all of which indicates that the States with the most cars which would be expected to have the most wear ' and tear on their roads and require tbe greatest amount of funds for road maintenance, get the least money in respect *of each vehicle. If we are to maintain the present system of allocating petrol tax receipts for use in the repair of roads -and I presume that we must carry on with it-som e factor relating to tbe number of cars in each State should be included in the formula in accordance with which petrol tax moneys are distributed. I also have several formulae, one-fifth area and four-fifths motor vehicles, and another which runs into fifteenths and looks too complicated. I do not doubt that it is quite possible for the powers-that-be to work,out a very suitable formula in which the number of cars in use in each State would be taken into consideration. One of the points that is in debate in this measure is the fairness of placing some of the petrol tax in Consolidated Eevenue. The general services and obligations of tbe community bave to be met, and it has been made abundantly clear by the Treasurer and other speakers that a lot of the tax is paid by commercial users. They have shown that motor car owners do not, in fact, pay all revenue derived from the petrol tax. I know that car owners think that they do pay all that revenue; I am quite certain that one could not convince many car owners that they are not carrying the whole burden. But I agree that quite a lot of the impost is passed on to other people. I suggest that there is another side to this question. It is an argument that we might well take into consideration. There are thousands of people in the cities who do not have cars and, consequently, they do not pay any petrol tax directly. They do not pay motor registration fees. The only contribution that they make to the upkeep of the road*) is some infinitesimal amount which comes from whatever loan moneys are actually used for road purposes. Although that amount is not very much, the Government, in addition to providing petrol taxmoney for road maintenance, does make other contributions out of general funds. Tbe people in tbe cities would starve to death without the produce that we in the country send them by road. Surely it is fitting, if they are to have the benefit of the health-giving milk that we send them from McMillan, the juicy steaks and the tender lamb that we are at pains to raise on our lush pastures, that they should make some contribution to the general revenue for road maintenance and if the petrol tax is not sufficient to cover the whole amount Mr ""WARD -They make the contribution in the prices that tbey pay for those commodities. contribution in the prices that they pay for those commodities, but they still have a very real interest in providing the roads on whicli the food is brought to them. The maintenance of country roads is no more a problein that should be put on the shoulders of the country people than the maintenance of city roads should be put on the shoulders of the city people. I am suggesting that we get away from the out-moded system which operates at the moment. I suggest that we should go into the whole matter on a national basis, take over collections from where we are getting them now and put them into general revenue. We should examine the whole position and make priorities for the various needs of the various States. We sbould give them as much of the necessary money as we are able to give them, though I do not see that they would be able to bave all tbe that to-day, because local government money that they say they need. By establishing the council of Ministers for transport and other Ministers concerned that I suggest, we should be able to get a working basis and then we could make the necessary money available from general revenue. I commend tbe bill to bonorable members. My only regret is that it affect* only a very small facet of the whole problem. The honourable member for McMillan( Mr Buchanan) has followed the usual pattern of Government speakers. We have had a series of repetitious utterances It set up various bodies, which, under thp from them about the need for a national plan on roads, and about the fact that insufficient finance is made available for road construction. However, no supporter of the Governinent has yet dealt properly with the basic facts of the situation. One of those basic facts, about which there is no dispute in this Parliament, is the need for a national plan. But why is it that we have not had a national plan? Eirst, simply because the Government is incapable of providing one; secondly, because this Parliament is not clothed with sufficient constitutional powers to implement such a plan. Honourable members on the Government side who now speak of the need for a national plan and of the constitutional difficulties that stand in the way of having such a plan, as recently as 1946a mere ten years ago -whe n the Labour government of tbe day wanted to extend the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth Parliament so that we could deal with the problem of getting a proper system of co-ordinated transport, were the people who advised the electors to vote against the Labour Government's proposals. So what is the use of Government supporters talking about the lack of constitutional authority to-day, when they do nothing about correcting the situation and, in fact, opposed the Labour Government's attempt to have that situation corrected ? Let us examine the position. It is quite true that a great national loss results from our present inability to achieve a co-ordinated transport system because of constitutional limitations. I would say bodies and State government authorities determine their road works plans according to the amount of finance available to them, the width and standards of thp roads that they construct are conditioned by that amount of finance. So, there is a sheer national loss as a result of the failure to have a national plan for coordinated road transport. It is admitted that there is a great disadvantage in the division of authority between the existing responsible bodies. The Labour Government, of which I was honoured to be a member, attempted, desnite the constitutional difficulties, to do something about this need for a national roads plan.",53,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

This Parliament, although it is a great national authority, has no power to deal with vehicular standards and standards of road construction. It can only try to encourage the States, by agreement with the Commonwealth and between themselves, to determine a common basis of standards Years have gone by since tbe Labour Government established the bodies to which I have referred, and not a great deal of progress has been made in tbose years. I know tbe difficulties of dealing with State governments in achieving a national plan. The Labour Government attempted to get a national plan in respect of rail standardization, and I say that one would have a much better chance of getting agreement between the Balkan States tban between the States of Australia in respect of a co-ordinated plan. [Quorum formed.] I wish to thank the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton) for bringing his colleagues back from the parliamentary bar so that they can listen to such an important discussion. I know, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, that it has been quite evident during the day's proceedings! Acting Deputy Speaker.

In addition, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) has just reminded me, Mr Playford, the Premier of South Australia, who is an anti-Labour Premier, told the honourable member for Hindmarsh on one occasion that I was the best Minister for Transport that this country has ever had. on several occasions.

166,Mr Ward,"I do not mind the interWhen the Minister for the Army was addressing us earlier to-day he quoted figures relating to money provided without reference to the actual value of the nioney at the times concerned; but this important report deals, at page 55, with the value of money in the respective years in which grants for road purposes were made. I suggest that the Minister for the Army examine thesefigures,which are contained in one of the Government's own reports. In the financial year 193S-39, actual expenditure on roads amounted to £22,286,064. The expenditure is given for each financial year up to .1.953-54, which is the last for which the figures are available. In 1953-54, the provided from various sources. 1 well expenditure had risen to £76,852,946. These figures are cited in a report by government experts, who have also gone to the trouble, in this report, of, as it terms it, deflating the figures, using 1938-39 as the base year, to express them in terms of 1938-39 values. 193S-39 values, the £76,852,946 spent on roads in 1953-54 becomes £22,941,178. This very important and valuable report shows that, in terms of 1938-39 values, all. this and other governments did in regard to this great national problem was to increase expenditure by a miserable £655,114 up to 1953-54. I remind honourable members that there has been great need in tbe meantime for the extension of the roads system as a consequence of the increase of population and of development since 1938-39. Therefore, the indications are that, having regard tomoney values and to the magnitude of ^be problem, governments have not increased, the funds for road works by one penny piece. When the Minister for the Army talks about what tbe Government has done is two years behind the times. He cited figures that are two years old. nnly come up to two years behind the times instead of remaining 50 years hr-hind the times, we in this country might be better off. He has so little appreciation of the national problem of roads that he opposes an Opposition proposal that would make a few more million pounds available for road works. Why does he not ask the Government to make these additional funds available under its defencepowers, so that we can develop a satisfactory roads system in Australia ? Is he aware that, as the honourable member for McMillan said, the Department of Shipping and' Transport recently investigated the financial requirements for road construction in Australia, and estimated that £301,000,000 more will be needed in the next decade than the expenditure at present provided for this purpose? On the Government's own figures, this means that £30,000,000 a year will be required over the next ten years in addition to the funds already recollect, and I remind members of the Australian Country party in particular, that it was a Labour government that introduced the principle of earmarking portion of the Commonwealth aid roads grants for the construction of roads in On sparsely populated areas. If Labour had remained in control of Australia's affairs, our transport system would not have beeu in"" the chaotic mess that it is in at present. What is the present situation? I do not suggest that the solution to the problem will be found merely by increasing the taxes levied on tbe motor transport industry. I do not think that is the solution, because a great deal of our motor transport is engaged in commerce, and additional taxation upon it will merely be passed on to the consumers of the goods transported by road. We need an efficient roads system in Australia, and I think the responsibility for financing it rests with the Commonwealth. The States are incapable of doing the job. As a matter of fact, they are in very grave financial difficulties at tbe present time, because they are unable, in consequence of a judicial decision with respect to their powers over road transport, to regulate motor transport by taxation, even if they wanted to do so, and even if it competes with the government owned railways systems. The problem that has arisen as a result is acknowledged by the Commonwealth and by the various States.

That was a conference with the State Premiers. Then he saidIn the meantime, I feel it is quite useless to discuss thc matter any further. -Order! The honourable member for East Sydney must keep quiet. He has made his speech. where the gallant gentlemen wbo have issued challenges this afternoon were on that occasion. I am not talking about the members who have only recently come into the Parliament and who do not know what happened here in the past. I listened to their speeches with a certain amount of interest, and also with a certain amount of amusement. I am referring to those honourable members opposite who were in the Parliament in 1949. Tbey have performed a political somersault. Now that they are in opposition, they want the Government to assume responsibilities wbich, as members or supporters of a Labour government, they rejected. Why have they done that? The reason is that now, when they are in opposition, they have no responsibility for raising money, implementing this legislation or doing anything else in relation to the government of the country. Tbe debate on my motion was a very fine one. You will notice, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, that I spoke first. The next sneaker was the risrht honourable J. B .

T now find that this Goverament, led by the Prime Minister, and with that great statesman, the Treasurer ( Sir Arthu r Fadden), administering thp petrol tax, bas already put into effect tbe main portions of the proposals I made that day. In .1945-46. Labour collected £12,192,000 from the petrol tax. Tn that year, from that amount, it paid to tlip States £3,32S.000, retaining in. ConsoliG o on. dated Revenue £S.864'.000.

182,Mr Turnbull,"I shall show whatLabour's procedure. Labour paid to tbe States one-quarter of the proceeds, but this Government paid three-quarters. Labour retained three-quarters, but in the last financial year this Governmeni re tained matters must be inquired into. In 1945-46, retained £8,864,000. Last financial year this Government retained £8,796,000, or £6S,000 less than did the Labour Government, despite the fact that in the meantime collections had increased by £20,846,000. I shall bring those statistics up to date. I am sure that lionorable members want ine to do that. I know that the honourable meniber for Darling( Mr independent. Clark) does not like things to be kept in the background, in spite of what the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr interesting to note what Labour members Luchetti) may say. In the last full financial year before Labour went out of office in 1949, it collected from the petrol tax £17,516,000. Of that amount, Labour paid to the States £7,701,000 and held in the Consolidated Revenue Fund £9,815,000. Last financial year the present Government, under the agreement, collected £33,038,000, and paid to the £8,796,000. Those figures show that although this Government collected approximately £16,000,000 more than the Labour Government collected, it retained over £1,000,000 less than the amount retained by the Labour Governnient. It paid to the States over £1,000,000 more than the total increase in the amount it collected. These are figures that no one can doub I have obtained them from + the right authority and they must be examined as on them we must build our entire case. Honourable members should know that the petrol tax is lOd. a gallon and excise duty is 8£d. a gallon. In 1945-46, collections from excise duty on petrol amounted to £319,000. In the last full financial year for which Labour was in office, namely, 1948-49, collections from this source totalled £2,249,000. Six years later, under the regime of the present Government, excise collections were -£12,908,000, or £10,659,000 more than was collected by the Labour Government. When this increase is related to the excise duty rate of 8-Jd. a gallon, it illustrates the remarkable expansion in refining in Australia, and the great benefit which the community bas enjoyed from this expansion. Constantly we hear Labour members complaining that we only one-quarter. These sold Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, but since that organization was the Labour Government; sold we have collected from refineries more than £10,000,000 in excess of the amount Labour collected, less petrol is being imported, and Australia is so much the richer. Labour members, however, continue to say, "" What a calamity!"" Tbat sale was one of the best things done in recent times in this country. It enabled refineries to be expanded, and made us more prosperous and I desire to refer to one or two of the speeches that have been made. It is very are saying. The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) is tbe great champion of the city roads. He forgot to speak about country areas, because his electorate includes the City of Sunshine, and knowing that be obtains his majority there and not in the country, he appealed for improvement of city roads, saying, "" How can the workers drive their cars States £24,242,000, retaining to work if the roads are not in good condition?"" Labour members have been saying that the workers are in a deplorable financial position, yet the bonorable member for Lalor asked how they could drive their cars to work if tbe roads were not good. The thinking of Labour supporters seems to be in a tremendous mess. It is in.a frightfully muddled state. One member cannot even keep to one line of logical thought for one day. First, he says that the worker can scarcely live because his wages are pegged, and that he is up against it. Next we are told that the worker is driving his car to work, and needs good roads. Some time ago, I said that when I was coming to Melbourne by train I passed through Sunshine and saw vast numbers of cars parked outside the factories. I could show them to any honourable member. I shall take the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) and show him these things. Just as Dame Enid Lyons very courteously invited bim to Tasmania to have a full meal from a shinbone, whioh invitation lie did not, of course, accept. J invite hun to come with me and 1 will show him these cars. Honourable members opposite cannot have it both ways. If the workers want to go to work in cars, good luck to them. ""We think that they can, and I know that they do. When I interjected, the honourable member for Lalor sought to escape the implication. Tie said that one man buys a car and tbe others travel with him. So long as they travel in cars, it is all right, but my not a lost art I believe that we should see statement is correct. The cars are there, and. the workers do travel to work in thorn. If they have good roads, it is all the better for them, but let us not starve tbe country for roads. Tbis Government has changed the allocations from the proceeds of the petrol tax. Only 35 per cent, was allocated to tbe country when Labour was in power. We know thai: that amount was not being expended on country roads. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr table. He said that limitations upon the Ward) said that the Labour Government was the first to ear-mark a certain amount of money for rural districts. know about the matter say "" Hear, hear! "" However, if the State Government desired to allocate a certain amount of money to, say, the district of Hopetoun, the matter bad to be referred to Canberra to bc approved by the Minister. it? the reins all the time. Whether or not he approved is beside the point. He may have approved, but be was the great dictator. Only 35 per cent, of the distributed proceeds of the petrol tax was tben allotted to roads into rural areas, and there was no accounting for its expenditure.. What did this Government do? It decided that 40 per cent, would be allocated, ancl that the States woulcl have to give a proper account of themselves and show definitely that the 40 por cent, hacl been expended on country f Mr Luchetti) spoke of the Australian roads. What a difference from th? Countrv party, and of the wide -open procedure under Labour! What a snares in his electorate. One could see difference from the state of affairs from, his face that he was bewildered. H P which prevailed when a great diceould not understand, be said, why tbere tator like the honourable member for East Sydney sat in isolation in an office in Canberra, receiving correspondence from the Shire of Karkarooc, the Shire of Walpeup, or some other place! Wliether he approved or not is beside the point. The shires had to come cap in hand to Canberra, this place of isolation, to obtain money to expend on country roads. Surely the newer members will realize the folly of that. If blushing were the honourable member for East Sydney blushing now. In fact, I believe that he is. What he did is apparently enough to make even a tough man like him blush. I do not want to concentrate all my attention on the Opposition, wbich is already weak enough and I turn now to the Government side. BecauseI treat matters as I find them, I want to have a few words to say about the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer), who is at the spending of the money were imposed by the availability of man-power anil materials. Of course that is so, but as I said to the Prime Minister, Mr Chifley, in 1949, if one State cannot spend the money available, why not let another State do so? I put it to the Victorian Government and the Victorian Country Roads Board, too, that if one municipality cannot spend the money wby not let another do so? Why hold up Victoria's progress when some other State cannot spend its allocation? That is, surely, a fair proposition. The Minister for the Army made a characteristic appeal to the Australian Country party. Hrlooked straight over at us because, at tli!appropriate time, I intend to move a certain amendment, and appealed to us not to attempt to interfere witb the present formula. All I can say to the Minister is that the appeal is dismissed. 1 shall move my amendment as soon as I get the opportunity and then we shall se-. 1 where the Victoivan members of the Labour party, tbe Liberal party ancl the Australian Country party stand.

186,Mr Turnbull,"The Minister heldshould be opposition to the spending of all petrol tax revenue upon roads. If the Labour party will move that total petrol tax revenue shall be expended on roads I will vote witb it. I challenge the Opposition to do that. I expect that very soon a quorum will be called for because I am getting right down to bedrock on these things and telling honourable members exactly what is going to happen. This special tax, as the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) has said, should be considered quite apart from the ordinary petrol tax because it will be of short duration only and anything done in the meantime will not matter a great deal. In moving the second reading ol' the bill the Treasurer saidI f , therefore, we were to adopt the suggestion that the whole of tlie increase of 3d. in the Petrol Tax be devoted to roads, we would have to raise this money from some other source. In other words, we would have to impose some further taxation either on incomes or on commodities other than petrol. I feel sure that any such move would find little support. But it did find support. It found support from the honourable member for Yarramy pen was moving while he spokewho went on to refer to land tax. He said that the previous revenue of £6,000,000 before abolished tbe tax could be increased enormously, and that this would affect not the man on the land but the big city interests. Here, surely, is confused thinking. The honourable member had just said that if an extra ls. in tbe £1 company tax were imposed it would be passed on to tbe people generally,and that the primary producers in particular would suffer. Is it logical to suggest that the primary producer will not suffer if land tax amounting to another £6.000,000 or £10,000,000 is imposed? Will not the bisr city interests pass it on? Of course, they will. the first place. believe the honourable member, but that has been Labour's theme throughout this debate. The approach of Labour supporters has been so illoprical as to make it difficult to discuss. The honourable member for Macquarie tried to make some startling points, but he is hardly a star and failed in his ambition. He said, "" The Government, it is estimated, willpay out £30,000,000 this year and will retain £15,500,000 "". Then, affecting the grand manner, he waved his arms and said, "" What an indictment of the Government ! "" . that? ment of Labour in 1944-45, when in government, to have collected £12,000,000 and paid out £3,000,000; and in 1954-55 to have collected £17,000,000 and paid out only £7,000,000 in 1949? Labour supporters should learn a little more about debating. A speaker should make his strongest points; he should not make points that his opponents can chop to pieces, as I am doing with tbe arguments of Labour supporters now. ber' is kidding himself. the Government myself, as did the honourable member for East Sydney when he said, "" I was told that I was the greatest transport Minister that Australia had ever had"". Tbe honourable member for Hindmarsh was told that. said about area, and the distribution of the petrol tax generally, that I shall not spend much more of my fleeting time on those aspects. WhatI have said so far bas merely been a preamble to my main theme. The present customs duty on petrol is lOd. a gallon. In 1945-46 it was lOd. a gallon and excise was 8£d. Of the revenue so collected the Labour Government paid out on roads a fraction more than 3d. a gallon. In 1948-49. when customs duty was still lOd. and excise 8^d., Labour paid out 3^d. In 1953-54, with customs and excise still the same, this Government paid out more than 6d. a gallon. It has now fixed a flat rate of 7d. One can only consider the figures of past years, for future",63,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

196,Mr Turnbull,"S o much has beenfigures are uncertain. More and more petrol is being refined in Australia. One finds that petrol to the value of £12,000,000 is being refined here annually. Previously the figure was £319,000. Before long 90 per cent, of our petrol will be refined in this' country. The excise on this will be 8£d. a gallon, but the Government has fixed a flat rate payment on roads of 7d. a gallon. Very few honourable members have argued against that. What we do oppose is the formula. As honourable members know, under it Victoria suffers greatly. Por instance, there £15,020,000 in petrol tax, but returns to the State only £5,460,000 of that sum. In Western Australia, the Oommonwealth collects £3,750,000 and pays back to that State £6,000,000. It actually pays to Western Australia about £1,000,000 more than it pays to Victoria, although the amount collected is £10,000,000 less! than is collected? very vital and should be looked at. More is paid than is collected, for the simplereason that it is taken from the State of Victoria to pay to the State of Western Australia. The sooner that honourable members know about these things, the better. What about the State of Victoria? Let us bear about it. The honourable member for Macquarie said that we must cart our goods and produce by road. What does Victoria produce more than the other States? Each year Victoria's 56,000,000 acres produce 70s. worth of primary products per acre. In comparison. Tasmania produces 22s., New South Wales 18s., Queensland 6s., and Western Australia 2s. 3d. worth of primary products per acre. This 70s. worth of produce in Victoria has to be carted, as stated by the honourable member for Macquarie. The value is 70s. per acre in Victoria as against 18s. per acre in New South Wales. Therefore, I say very definitely that the amount of money allocated to Victoria under the formula may cripple not only Victoria but the whole of Australia. Shortly, Victoria will not be able to provide the revenues from the petrol tax that are at the present time benefiting Western Australia. Western Australia cannot spend the money that it receives from this source, l n 1953, it had an accumulated amount of money. The Treasurer, in reply to a question on the 29th February, 1956, on the allocation of Commonwealth aid road funds, said that on the 30th June, 1953, Western Australia had an unexpended balance of £373,000, in the next year £487,000, and by the end of the last financial year £1,163,000. Why? Because the allocation is worked this Government collects out on a basis of three-fifths population and two-fifths area. But some of the country taken into the calculation of area in Western Australia would not feed one snake to 10 square miles, and it never will. When an aeroplane was lost up north some time agoa disastrous thing -it was difficult to find. Roads will never be built in that area, or on the far side of the Nullarbor Plain. The area that could become productive in Western Australia toria in it. that at all. If only that area and its population were considered for the purposes of the formula, Western Australia would not get an amount of money that is approximately £1,000,000 more than the allocation to Victoria. Western Australia would not be getting 19 per cent, of the collections when it only pays in 7 per cent. Victoria pays 31 per cent, and receives only 17 per cent. These things are all wrong, and must be righted. Therefore, I foreshadow an amendment when this bill is in the committee, and I seek the support of all fair-minded men. I appeal to the honourable member for East Sydney, to all Victorians, to the honourable member for Angas( Mr Downer)-afte r all, it will not affect him much-and to New South Wales members generally because my amendment will serve their State by increasing its allocation by 6 per cent. The only State it will affect much is Western Australia and, as the Western Australian Government cannot spend the money it is receiving now from this source, tbe reallocation will not do that State any",64,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

If so, I propose to second it. The amendment has not been presented to the House. It will be presented in committee. am a little confused. I am supposed to follow the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) but I do not know whether I am following him or Danny lvaye. Members of the Opposition have uo apologies to make when they suggest that the £12,000,000 which will be received as a result of the increase in the is to be developed in an orderly and petrol tax should be handed over to the States for the development of roads. That is the policy which the Labour party enunciated at the election on the LOth December. I do not want to go back into the past as some honourable members have done, but it would be interesting to note that when Mr Chifley was in office he told the municipalities and the States that, if they could use for road purposes the money that they had then, he would allocate more. The memories of bonorable members should be brought back to the fact that in those days there was a great transition going on from war into peace. I want to say, without reservation, that equipment. Up-to-date roads must be not one honourable member can deny that the deterioriation of the Australian road system is one of the greatest tragedies facing this country to-day. It has proceeded far beyond the realm of State parochialism, of formula and quota, to become in stark reality a national problem and responsibility as great, as demanding, as imperative and as urgent as any atomic, guided missile, airways, television or hydro-electric scheme that this Government or any other government has attempted to carry out. To accuse previous governments of inactiou is sheer humbug. I mean that in every sense of the word. To make such accuThe honourable sations is only adopting a negative attitude to a problem that has become very apparent and acute all over Australia. It is truly said that there are three things that make a country great and prosperous-fertil e fields, busy workshops and ready means of transportation from one place to another. No one could contradict these words; no one could have any other desire than to see Australia great and prosperous. But that can be achieved only by the development, of our far-flung spaces and the decentralization of commerce and industry, which are so dependent in these modern times on adequate road transport and road systems. Since the cessation of hostilities, the transition this country has experienced in industry, immigration and nafional development is almost without parallel in the world to-day. These circumstances compel us to realize that if our nation efficient manner, there must be one authority to plan, construct and maintain highways. In this I agree entirely with the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth). I would go further and say that if there is one question on whicli the people of this country would be unanimous it would be that a national roadplanning and constructing authority be set UP in order that all the resonrces ancl road-making equipment could be used to the fullest, gainful capacity on road construction. I do not attempt to adopt a parochial State attitude. To meet present-day demands and future demands, there must be modern ideas and modern built, with full regard being paid to proper widths, proper traffic capacity, standard road marks and signs and standard traffic rules. The Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) stated in his second reading speechT do not think any one can fairly say thnt this Government has not given full recognition to the importance of the roads problem in Aus-",65,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

204,Mr Mcivoe (Gellibrand) [5.30],"iiralia, or tliat it has uot been liberal in the provision of finance for roads. By a series of legislative measures-of which tliis is the third since it took office-it has made progressively more generous the basis on which grants are available for roads purposes. This year the Commonwealth aid roads payments will be £27,500,000. Next year, the payments will bc more like £32,000,000. If these figures are compared with what was done previouslywith the grants being made, for example, in tliu year before we took office, which amounted to no more than £7,700,000, how we have substantiated our interest in the basic developmental problem which roads represent w ill be seen. Indeed, the annual provision which we are now making for roads is three or four times as great struction in the City of Footscray. In as the amount being provided when we first took office. I remind the Treasurer tliat'construction costs have increased by five or six times since 194S, and that if comparisons are made on that basis it will be seen, even from the Treasurer's own statement, that this Government has fallen down badly. But I give a direct denial to the Treasurer's statement. This Government has not fully recognized the importance of the roads problem in Australia, and bas not been liberal in tbe provision of money for roads. I further remind the Treasurer that the kind of vehicle using the roads to-day is much heavier, and the load capacity is much greater, than any honourable member visualized in 1948. It is interesting to note that, according to present-day requirements, 75 per cent, of our main roads are sub-standard, and that the condition of our roads can be held responsible for 75 per cent, of the accidents that occur on them. From the human stand-point, therefore, there is a strong reason why more money should be provided for road purposes. Although it may be argued that more money has been allocated to the States for road works, rising costs have swallowed the increase, with the result that less work has been completed than was formerly the case. To substantiate this statement. I shall give the House certain figures regarding costs of road-building materials. Tn 1947, the basic wage was about £5 a week, and in 1956 it is £12 16s. In 1347, sand cost 9s. 6d. a cubic yard,compared with £1 4s. in 1956. Cement in 1947 was priced at £4 13s. 6d. a ton, whereas it now costs £11 5s. a ton. Bitumen is the only item tbe price of which has remained reasonably stable. In 1947, it cost 2s. Id. a gallon, compared with 2s. 8d. to-day. Metal and screenings, which in 1947 cost 12s. lOd. a cubic yard, now cost £1 ls. 4d. In 1947, it cost 12s. an hour to hire a truck, whereas now the price is £1 10s. Bulldojser hire cost £4 10s. an hour in 1947, compared with £12 10s. an.hour at present. Salamander cost 4s. 9d. a cubic yard in 1947, compared with 16s. to-day. I shall now give the House some figures which are even more illuminating, and which can be substantiated because they are taken from tenders for road con1947, the price tendered was £1 6s. a lineal foot, and in 1956 the tendered price was £13 a lineal foot. This Government claims that it is granting more money to the States for road purposes than was granted in previous years, but the figures that I have cited demonstrate that the actual assistance granted to the States for this purpose has not been increased at all. When one hears statements in this House to the effect that £9,000,000 can be obtained more or less from thin air, one becomes resentful of the fact that the Government will not provide more funds for such nationally important works as road construction and maintenance. Lack of money prevents work of a permanent nature being done, and patching is resorted to as a temporary measure. This is, of course, a waste of time, money and material, and it is estimated that, not allowing for reconstruction, and taking into consideration only the present road system, it would take at least 30 years to seal all our roadways. Needless to say, permanently constructed roads are a great investment for shire and municipal councils, and for State and Commonwealth governments. Victoria will receive an extra £650,000 from this grant, and that, on present-day costs, would build about 10 miles of roadway. I may say, in passing, that I could use that amount in my own electorate. I shall now give the House some information about the petrol tax. On the 12th April, 1902, customs duty on petrol was imposed at the rate of $d. a gallon. It was subsequently increased by one farthing a gallon, and it became Id. a gallon on the 3rd December, 1914. It remained at this rate until 1926. when tbe tax was raised to 3d. a gallon, the additional amount collected being devoted to road works under the Federal Aid Roads Agreement of 1926. Since that date, tbe tax has progressively increased, reaching l i d . a gallon during World War II . It was afterwards reduced to 10d. a gallon. The recent increase of 3d. a gallon now brings the customs duty to ls. Id. a gallon, and excise to l l ^ d . a gallon. As a large amount of petrol is now refined locally, tbe average collection by the Commonwealth is about ls. a gallon. From the collections which, during the next financial year, are estimated to reach £48,000,000, the Commonwealth will use £800,000 for strategic roads, and £150,000 for road safety measures. It will distribute to the States £31,050,000, and retain in Commonwealth revenue £16,000,000, representing 33 per cent, of the amount collected. The Commonwealth collects an average of ls. on each gallon of petrol that is sold. Of that, the Commonwealth retains 4d.: it uses, for strategic roads and road safety practices, .2375d., and it distributes to the States 7.7625d. Tinder the announced variation to be made in the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act 1954, the Commonwealth will pay, from the 1st April, 1956, 8d. a gallon instead of 7d. into the trust fund set up under that act. After deducting £800,000 for strategic roads, and £150,000 for road safety measures, the remainder in the trust fund is distributed. Five per cent, is given to Tasmania, and the balance goes to the mainland States according to an areapopulation formula, the basis being twofifths according to area and three-fifths according to population. A plan that has been prepared for the State of Victoria indicates that, during the next ten years, no less than £340,000,000 should be spent on roads in that State. At present, the Victorian Country Roads Board is expending £12,000,000 ;a year. Taking an overall picture, municipalities are devoting £8,000,000 a year to roads, and the annual expenditure by government departments is £2,000,000, making tbe total expenditure on roads in Victoria £22,000,000 a year. When this is contrasted with the amount of £34,000,000 a year that is needed to implement Victoria's ten-year plan, the need for further adequate financial assistance is obvious. It is worthy of note that, due to the large concentration of the populace in tbe capital cities, the State road authorities are expending huge sums of money on the reconstruction of the sub-standard highways entering the cities to provide four-lane and six-lane roadways capable of coping with the traffic flow, especially at peak periods. Of course, the carrying out of this work leaves less money available to be spent on roads in rural districts. In order to assess the need for one co-ordinated authority, let us consider the present day cost of earth-moving equipment, that is, the kind of equipment that is needed for quick and efficient road construction. For instance, tbe kind of bulldozer that is needed for this class of work costs about £20,000. What council or shire can afford to buy this kind of equipment, unless it can be gainfully employed for twelve months of the year? How many contractors who are prepared to do this work have the necessary plant? I shall cite a classical example in my own municipality. Two private street construction schemes were started about the same time. The contractor who had the necessary plant and experience to carry out this kind of work has done about ten times as much work as has the other contractor who lacked both equipment and experience. This brings me to a contention with which I tbink all honourable members will agree. It is, that in Australia to-day the greatest bugbear and money-waster is tbe lack of continuity of construction. A little bit of work is done here and there, but nothing is actually completed. To-day, the job of permanent highway construction is one for specialists using the resources and equipment available in a manner consistent with the economic demands of the country. The Treasurer has said that the question of roads was a State matter and, therefore, outside the Commonwealth Constitution. When the Constitution was drawn up, its framers did not visualize the advent of the motor car and the problems that would be caused by its introduction. Time and progress have outmoded some sections of the Constitution, which could well be revised in order to provide for both present day and future requirements. Tbis would result in advantage to the economic and national development of Australia. It is on these lines that we should be thinking instead of going back and delving into the past. This question has become more than a State matter, and it has become move than merely a political issue. It is as important to Australia as any defence project on which we are engaged. Actually, modern main roads are essentially as much a part of defence as are guided missiles and atomic bombs. Our roads difficulties can be overcome only by the adoption of a long-range plan under which all roads authorities aro co-ordinated, so that waste can be eliminated and full value obtained for every £1 that is spent on the roads. I believe that now is the time to discuss this matter and formulate a national plan in relation to our main roads. Support for my advocacy of a national or a co-ordinated road authority is contained in the following extract from an article wbicb appeared in the April issue of Road NewsI t ia surely realistic and equitable to claim that if thc Commonwealth is to be asked to devise and provide additional road finance, in sufficient suras to provide the nation with a modern road system, it must be given a voiee in the planning of the expenditure, in partnership witli the States, and in pursuance of a plan which envisages contemporary and future national requirements. A national approach to the problem is inevitable and should be undertaken now, not only to give Australia the roads she so desperately needs, but to arrest the wasteful continuous expenditure of millions of pounds in patching and maintaining a road system which, though sufficient for the age in which it was laid down, is now thoroughly outmoded and uneconomic Good roads arc a national investment: they pay national dividends and have a legitimate call on the ratio 's resources for their development. Tf we were involved in a w a i , Australia would prut ably be the base of operations, and our roads were not built to carry war-time traffic. It would he too late to (ind this out when war broke out-it must be done now. I agree entirely with the view expressed in that article. Having in mind the fact that, during the past ten years there has been a 100 per cent, increase of motor vehicles, as well as a terrific increase in the tare and the load capacitj of hauliers' vehicles, particularly those of the diesel-powered type, I feel impelled to suggest to the Government that it consider bringing down a tax on diesel fuel, in order that additional revenue can be obtained, especially from the operators of the heavy vehicles which cause so much damage, for expenditure on the roads. In tbe main, the loudest cry for modern highways comes from the operators of these vehicles. It is only reasonable, therefore, that since those vehicles damage our roads much more than do petroldriven vehicles, a federal tax should be imposed on distillate in order that more money might be made available to provide modern road facilities. A statement on Australian roads, which was prepared for the meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council that was held in Hobart in February, contains tbe latest available information on tbe source of funds expended on roads in each State. The following table of figures in that statement is illuminating :ROAD EXPENDITURE . From Wrom State. mrol Other Totol. Tax.

From these figures, it will be seen that the percentage of road expenditure in the various States derived from the proceeds of the petrol tax, was as follows:-Ne w South Wales, 23.1 per cent.; Victoria, 17.9 per cent; Queensland, 24.3 per cent.; South Australia, 29.6 per cent.; Western Australia. 65.5 per cent.; and Tasmania, 30.6 per cent. It is unquestioned that road maintenance is a vital problem wbich affect? all States. The population, the number of motor vehicles, and the amount of automotive fuel that is used in a State all indicate the use that is being made of its roads system. I am of the firm opinion that a national roads system is a necessity, and that it demands the immediate formation of a national road planning and construction authority with powers to co-ordinate the activities of all road making authorities within the Commonwealth, and to produce a master plan for Australia. With that thought in mind, I advocate a conference of all State road-making authorities. In the face of all the facts, I feel that it is imperative that more money should be provided and that, therefore, the extra £12,000,000 that will be derived from the petrol tax should be devoted entirely to road construction. I do not agree with the reference by the honourable member for Mallee( Mr the shire of Holbrook we now have 59 Turnbull) to the sale of Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited to private enterprise, because it has no bearing on the matter now before us. However, I digress for a moment to say that when the Australian Oommonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, it bad a measuring stick that it could apply to the oil industry. The oil refineries that are being established in Australia to-day are separate from any activity that has resulted from the sale by this Government of its shares in Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. Shipping costs and the probability of the search in Australia leading to an oil strike made it imperative for the oil companies to build refineries in this country, ancl to bring crude oil from, overseas to meet Australia's needs, fn conclusion, I say that it would bo far better if all of us were to realize the magnitude of this national problem and to tackle it accordingly. Good roads do not cost: they pay. Sitting suspended from 5.5S to S p.m. AlthoughI disagree with one or two points brought forward by the honourable meniber for Gellibrand ( Mr Mclvor), there were a number of points in his speech with which I am in complete agreement. One of them is that nothing i? to be gained by going back over the ; past. I have listened attentively to this debate all day and I have heard all about what happened in the 1930's, 1940's and 1950's, but I am sure that that is not the question we should be asking ourselves. Nor sbould we be asking ourselves which side in politics has been responsible for making the largest grants available to the States. We should approach the matter from a different angle and ask ourselves the question: Is our programme adequate to-day? I put that question to honourable members, just as I put it to myself. I represent a large country electorate -no t as large as some electorates but larger than others-and I use the roads in it to a considerable extent. I have found that on the whole, during the last five years, there has been a considerable improvement in the standard of the less important rural roads. For example, in miles of tarred road. Admittedly, Holbrook is one of the most progressive shires in New South Wales. That is not only my own judgment; the shire was recently awarded the Bluett memorial Government controlled prize. Even so, there is no doubt in my mind that there has been a considerable improvement in the roads in country shires during tbe last few years. However, when we come to the main highways, I have no hesitation in saying that they are no better to-day than. they were five or even ten years ago; if anything, they are worse. member desires, I will give the honourable member a jolt by jolt description of the Hume Highway. In many places, it is in a most shocking condition and is exceedingly dangerous. The surface is very poor, and it is difficult to travel a mile without coming upon large holes in the middle of the road. I have seen some which measured 12 feet across and a foot deep at their deepest spot. Only three miles from where I live on this highway is a place where accidents constantly occur. On one occasion three people were killed; and many cars have turned over because of the poor state of the highway. Cars and trucks using the highway swerve to avoid holes, do not see cars coming behind them, and",66,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

I say that it should be our No. 1 highway because it connects the two greatest cities in Australia, Melbourne and Sydney. volume of traffic every day. Something like 300 trucks pass any given point in one day on the Hume Highway, and each would carry loads of from 10 to 25 ton3. little tax. that, and I shall deal with that matter later. This great highway-o r this highway which should bc great-shoul d compare with some of the high standard roads overseas; but it does not. Any body who has been overseas, even 25 years ago, will be familiar with the magnificent roads in Europe-the autobahn in Germany, thc auto-strada in Italy and the route nationale in France. Britain, too, has roads of a. standard far higher than that of any in this country. Obviously, with our small population and long distances, we cannot expect to have six-lane highways such as exist in the United States of America; but for heaven's sake let us put down one good main highway between our two main capitals that will bc capable of carrying any load .that is likely to be carried over it in the foreseeable future. As I have said, this highway should be our No. 1 highway. In faet, it is designated No. 31. This number is indicative of the general attitude of the two organizations responsible for caring for it-the Country Roads Board in Victoria and the Main Roads Board in New Soutb Wales. At certain places in Victoria one can see signposts pointing, not to Sydney or Albury, but to Wodonga. Tbat is indicative of the general attitude of the authorities towards this great main highway. It should be, as I have said, a road in which we could take great pride; but it is not. I have told the House of the abominable state of its surface. Some five years ago a yellow line was painted, on the New South Wales side, down the middle of the road. That has been a great help and has, I am sure, beeu responsible for reducing the rate of accidents. To-day, however, the yellow line is, like my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner), rather invisible. I see the honourable member is present; I am sony -h e is only invisible to the Speaker at It carries a considerable question time. In addition, ibis highway has a large number of narrowbridges on which two cars cannot pass, and it also has a large number of open railway crossings. From Melbourne to Wodonga, I think tliere are thii teen open railway crossings. Surely, the time has come when we-coulcl do something to improve this great, road ancl make it fully capable of carrying the. traffic that uses it. About a fortnight ago, I was returning from Melbourne to Albury and telephoned the police at Wangaratta to ascertain whether it was possible to get through because tbere had been a small downpour in the Alps. The police said Great they were sorry, but tbe road was closed. As I particularly wanted to got home, I continued on niy way and met a man with a Ferguson tractor hauling cars across the flooded road for a charge of £1. I paid my £1, but by the time. I got through I realized I would have been able to drive through anyway. Surely, the time has come when we should be able to build a main highway so that traffic could get through irrespective of a small downpour of rain in the highlands. It is a shocking state of affairs. One sees notices along the road wbicb are' masterpieces of understatement. Examples read, "" Uneven surface"", "" Slippery when wet"". Such phrases are mild compared with those in which car drivers describe the road. It presents a sorry spectacle. What can we do about it? Obviously, the time has come when we must improve the surface considerably. As I have said, it is carrying enormous loads, some trucks weighing up to 25 tons. I recall seeing travelling on it. an army truck carrying a tank, the combined weight of the carrier and tank being 50 tons. We sbould have a road capable of carrying that load. Newer ears are being produced which can travel at very high speeds. A friend of mine purchased a. ear and looked up the instruction book",70,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

The instruction book said, "" Please do not exceed 90 miles an hour for the first 100 miles "". try to pass and, very often, that causes ""We have to construct highways like the autobahn on which fast motoring will be safe. I agree with the honourable member for Gellibrand f Mr Mclvor), wbo said that we must have some sort of national, overall plan for highways. I think that far more is being spent on the repair and maintenance of roads in New South Wales than is being spent on the construction of new roads, and that is just plain silly. On the Hume Highway we see a truck going along with a little gravel on (he back. The truck comes to a' hole in the road, the driver pulls up, and the occupants jump out and shovel a little gravel in it. Some one spreads a little tar from a watering can over it and they get back into the truck and drive off. In two or three days, the hole is there a'gain. The sum of £2,700,000 is being spent annually in New South Wales on the repair and maintenance of roads, whilst only £2,000,000 is being spent on new roads. Surely, in planning for tbe future construction of roads, we should decide to put down roads that will be there in 10, 20 or 30 years' time. I know the New South Wales roads. Between Goulburn and Marulan a 10-mile strip of concrete was put down in 1930 and it is still there to-day. As far as I know, it has had practically no mainThat is the reason why I support the tenance and it is in the same condition as when it was put down in 1930. It still has a far better surface than other sections of the road. The honourable member for Coriof Mr Opperman), who has probably had closer association with the Hume Highway than any one else told ine that in 1930, when he hit this stretch of concrete he was told that his speed increased by 2 miles an hour. A road of that sort is far better from the standpoint of the car owner. It does not result in as much maintenance trouble as a rough road and, from every point of view, we should have roads of that kind in this fountrv. As the honourable member for Mackellar f Mr Wentworth) has said, it is necessary, where a reasonably steep gradient occurs on the Hume Highway, to widen the road by a third lane. Heavy trucks that cannot do more than 5 mile3 an hour uphill block the traffic behind them, and drivers become impatient and an accident. It has been suggested that the States could do the job if they are given the necessary finance. It is because I feel that a good job has been done on the smaller inland rural roads in this country, and that a good job has not been done on the main arterial highways that 1 support the amendment that has been foreshadowed by the honourable member for Mackellar. One trouble is that when legislation relating to this matter was first introduced, it was called the Main Boads Development Act; then it was altered to the Federal Aid Roads Agreement, and later to the Commonwealth Aid Roads Aet; and during the last few years we have increased the allocation for rural roads. In 1950, the Government stipulated that 35 per cent, of the money granted under this legislation must be spent on rural roads, and in 1955 it increased that proportion to 40 per cent. The result is that in New South WalesI do not know whether it is so in other States-ther e are small roads which caj-ry little traffic. There is money to seal such a road and make it a first-class road, but when it gets to the main highway it meets an inferior road because there is no money for the sealing of the highway. This is a farcical position. amendment of the honourable member for Mackellar and it is why I do not support the amendment foreshadowed by the Opposition. Unfortunately, some weeks ago at a time when we were not sitting on a Friday, I made an engagement which I have to keep in my electorate, and, consequently, I will not be able to be present in tbe House to-morrow. If I were here, I should certainly vote for the amendment wbich bas been foreshadowed by the honourable member for Mackellar. But honourable members will realize that, owing to my absence, I shall not be able to do that. There is no doubt that, because of lack of finance, we are not producing first-class main arterial highways in this country. We eould get the necessary finance in a number of ways. The first is by allocating a greater percentage of the receipts from petrol tax to road maintenance or by making a greater allocation of Consolidated Bevenue. Secondly, tbere is the possibility of collecting a tax on dieselene. More and more, the main transport companies that are running heavy trucks from one capital to another are using dieselene, distillate or whatever it may be called by different companies. At present, there is no tax on distillate. This is a most difficult problem because only a small percentage of the distillate used in this country is used in road transport. The bulk of it is used by farmers and a certain amount is used in industry. A suggestion has been put forward which I know is being considered by the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator Paltridge) that it might be possible to colour distillate so that only the coloured distillate could be used for long-distance road transport and an extra tax could be put on it. When I was in England during the war, service petrol was coloured so that it could not be used by civilians. Although distillate does not lend itself to this treatment quite as readily as petrol because it has a natural colour itself, I am sure that something of this nature could be done in order to ensure that the people who use the roads sball pay for them. I tliink that there is a very good case Mallee, ad absurdum, I ask him whether for some alteration to be made in regishe feels that all the money raised by way tration fees.

At the outset, I say that I come here primarily as an Australian and not as a State's man at all. I do not even know what I should call myself.

He is one of the back-bench supporters of the Government who from time to timecan no longer contain themselves at their Government's dilatoriness and ineptitude. Eveni f he could not find it in himself to support the amendment foreshadowed by tbe Opposition, and we will not be surprised if that amendment were defeated, he should have joined us in supporting the amendiment foreshadowed ;by the Wentworth). And we hope that to-morrow there will not be too many supporters of tbe Government whose prior engagements will prevent them from carrying out their duty to the nation. If they feel as strongly as the honourable member for Farrer, who has so eloquently described, and the honourable member for Mackellar, who has so lucidly explained, this national problem, their constituents would forgive them if they were on this occasion to forgo tbe smoko or the fete to which they have already committed themselves. We take the national view which those two honourable members have themselves propounded, and we on this important occasion will be present to support the viewpoint which one of them is not prepared to put to the ultimate test"". This bill is to implement part of the supplementary budget introduced by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), which has since had to be carried by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden). The measure provides that one-third of the increased impost on the road-users in petrol taxwhich was the smallest of imposts put on motorists in the supplementary budget -wil l be allocated to roads. Naturally, road-users are up in arms because of the fact that thereby the proportion of the petrol tax which will be spent on roads will be decreased. Hitherto, 7d. out of the lOd. a gallon petrol tax has gone to the States for roads. From now on 8d. out of a Is. Id. a gallon tax will be spent on roads. Therefore, the contribution from the petrol tax which will be spent on roads will automatically be decreased from tbe lst April last from 70 per cent, to 60 per cent. Mr Cramer for the Army( Mr Cramer) shaking his head. I ain surprised that the only sound I heard when he did so was his voice. This morning, with all the archaism that one would expect from the owner of a blunderbuss rather than even a Lee-Enfield, he was heard to decry any suggestion that roads had any national or defence significance. what the Minister was saying. should keep to the truth. the Army did not mention that matter was it not rather an extraordinary omission? But, after all, there are quite a number of honourable members who vouch for the fact that he did mention it. The principal act deals with strategic roads, and I assume that they must have some defence significance. I think that the Minister for the Army said that if the whole of the petrol tax was devoted to roads, some additional taxes would have to be levied in other directions, and tbe people would not stand for that. The amendment which we are supporting, and which the honourable member for Mackellar is proposing and which the honourable member for Farrer is at least acknowledging, would provide for an extra £8,000,000 in a full year in addition to the £2,000,000 in the current financial year being spent on roads. It ill beseems the Minister for the Army to suggest that £8,000,000 may not be useful in our defence spending. Yesterday, we beard his boss, the Minister for Defence( Sir Philip McBride), the over-riding man in these matters of national importance, suggesting. that £9,000,000 could easily be tucked away in a budget for defence purposes. Eveni f the defence departments were not asking for £9,000,000 and could not budget for it, he justified the amount being thrust upon them.

223,Mr Whitlam,"In November,section 90 of the Constitution, which is the section under which we impose the petrol tax; and the petrol tax has advantages over every other form of taxation for road purposes. I shall deal with some of those advantages. First, it is predictable in amount; secondly, it is easy to collect; and thirdly, it is fair in its incidence. I am aware that the States do, iu fact, levy a considerable amount-totallin g about £30,000,000 a year-in taxes in the form of registration fees and licence fees charged to persons who use motor vehicles. The levying of those fees is, apparently, quite constitutional so long as it is uot related to any direct charges for using the roads. That is, if a government licences a driver, or registers his vehicle, and levies fees for £20,000,000, in the middle of the financial doing so, its action is constitutional; but if it charges him directly for using the roads, which are open to everybody, then its action is ultra vires the Constitution as regards anybody who is engaged exclusively on an interstate trip by road. As I say, the petrol tax is predictable in amount,* and it therefore has the advantage that the States can budget from year to year as to how much they will spend on their roads. AVe know that one of the greatest difficulties in governmental finance in the last few years has been that no governmental authority can state, more than twelve months ahead, and, in the case of Commonwealth departments, more than nine months ahead, how much they will have to spend in any financial year on any activity. Let me recapitulate the position in which the Sta'tes have found themselves as a result, not so much of the decisions of the Australian Loan Council, but of the extent to which the Commonwealth Treasurer, who is the agent of the Loan Council has implemented the council's decisions. I shall not go over the sore spot of how the money should be raised, or what interest should be charged, or what conditions should be imposed. The plain fact is that, in 1951-52, the six State governments received for all their activities, including the road works, an amount of £225,000,000. In the succeeding year they received £196,000,000 and in tbe year after that £200,000,000. Last year the total was £180,000,000 and this year it will be £190,000,000. You will appreciate, therefore, sir, that it is impossible for the State governments, which are responsible for the main roads, the primary roads, to budget ahead. It is not until June that they learn how much the Loan Council will authorize the Commonwealth Treasurer to raise for them during the financial year which runs from July to the following J une. Usually at that time the Treasurer says how much he proposes to make available to the States. He often provides a safeguard by saying that in December or January next he will see how things are going in relation to the revenue position; and, on occasions, he does as he did in the last financial year, when he reviewed the position and reduced the amount to be made available by year. One can see, therefore, from experience, how impossible it has been for thc State governments to budget ahead for any of their activities. Local government, which has responsibility for the secondary roads, which are very largely the roads on which primary producers depend, is in a still worse position, because although the Loan Council decides in June every year how much local government authorities will be permitted to raise, there is no obligation imposed by the Financial Agreement on the Federal Treasurer to raise any of that money. Those authorities are allowed to fend for themselves and they never know until the last day of the financial year how much wil] be available to them. There are many local governing bodies which have been able to raise no more than half of the amount that they were permitted to raise. The consequence, of course, in regard to roads, is that the authorities in charge of them never know how much plant or how many men they will be able to employ for the whole of a current financial year, still less for the following financial year. The first advantage, therefore, of further reliance on tbe petrol tax to finance those works would be that we can predict very closely how much petrol, or dieselene or distillate will be u?ed in any financial year or, for that matter, in any particular season, and accordingly we could impose a tax at such a level as to raise the amount required. There is no field in which planning is more necessary over a period of years than in transport. Transport is something we source. There is no evasion of it. Everyshould, and could, plan for over a period body pays it promptly and initially. of five years-or , if any one does not like the sound of ""five-yearplan "", then every ten years.

In that year, expenditure topped the 100 per cent., and reached 103 per cent. Until 1953-54, we were spending no more money's worth on roads than we were in the last year before the war, although we were laying out more of our resources. This index relates simply to the value of money. It makes no allowance for the increase of population of more than 2,000,000, the increase in the number of vehicles, which has doubled since 194G, and the increase in the weight and.horsepower of vehicles, which has trebled since next ten years, if we are to get our roads 1946. If we examine the contribution from all sources on roads since before World War II we find an actual decrease. That position was known to the Governprovides for the additional annual expenment and to the Australian Transport Advisory Council before the last amendment was passed in the budget session of last year. Nothing was done. I suppose one becomes blase about these matters. I spoke on that subject, quoting passages from the report, on the 20th October last. Now we have before us a further amendment to the act. In the meantime, a further report was made at the request of the conference in Brisbane in August, and it was presented to the conference of the Australian Transport Advisory Council in Hobart in February. The further report sets out the estimates by the roads authorities in AustraliaCommonwealth, State and municipalfor primary roads and secondary roads for the next ten years. I point out first that, in regard to primary roads, the -figures I am about to give refer to the cost of capital works and not to maintenance. They refer, further, to the amount of expenditure on capital works which will be required to provide properly for tbe anticipated traffic in accordance witb accepted road standards; that is, so far as we can tell from what the Toads and that the authorities in Australia have ordination of road plans in Australia is complete. The resources of men and materials are lacking, and they can be permanently engaged only when resources of The report sets out the estimated volume of the traffic, and the amount that the bodies concerned need to spend in ten years. So far as primary roads are concerned, it is pointed out that the amount expected to be spent on capital works in the next ten years under foreseeable conditions totals £557,598,000. It also points out that the funds which, it is' expected, will be available for capital works from State taxation, from Cqmmonwealth aid road grants and from loan funds will.be £256,586,000, leaving a deficiency of £301,002,000; that is, a deficiency of £30,000,000 a year for the up to scratch as regards conditions and traffic. What contribution have we made to that programme in this bill? The bill diture of £4,000,000. Therefore, the annual deficiency now will be under £30,000,000; we shall have a deficiency of only £26,000,000. If the other amendment that has been foreshadowed by the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), the honor-, able member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) and, somewhat tentatively, by the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) on behalf of the Australian Country party, which seems to be withering on the vine, is agreed to, most of the deficiency will be found from the petrol tax alone, because if the entire proceeds of the petrol tax were allocated for expenditure on the roads, an additional annual amount of £24,000,000-almos t twice the present amount-woul d be available. If the foreshadowed amendment is agreed to, we shall get 80 per cent, of the amount wbich the Australian Transport Advisory Council said would be required for primary roads. I do not want to frighten anybody but, for secondary roads, the best estimate for 10 years for maintenance and capital works was a. mere £442,027,000. Faced with that position. I ask: What is the Government proposing to do? see, that is true. After receiving thtj report that I have mentioned, the Australian Transport Advisory Council carried this resolutionThat the Commonwealth consider an additional tax upon petrol and diesel fuel used by road transport, such tax to be wholly divided between tlie States, solely for the new construction of new roads, the division of the collections to be subject to the approval of the States. . I point out that the council comprised six Commonwealth Ministers and the Minister for Transport from each State. It carried the resolution last February yet, in the next amendment to the relevant act, the Government bas done nothing about it whatever. I have referred frequently to the dilatoriness of this Government. When we speak of fiddling, Nero was a novice compared with the first violins in the Menzies Philharmonic. debate on this measure has at least lost some of the fiery interstate jealousy that coloured it before tbe suspension of the sitting for dinner. It was not very refreshing to bear honourable members making extravagant claims on behalf of their respective States and implying, for instance, that the pulse of Australia beats along the Hume Highway or somewhere out in the Mallee. When we talk about the allocation of aid roads funds, and expenditure made out of those funds in the variotis States, we must recognize that the States that are handicapped in many ways need incentives in other ways to make up for their original handicaps. When I found the circulated lists of the foreshadowed amendments on my desk this morning, I was very much afraid of the outcome, until I heard the remarks of the honourable member for Mallee( Mr for, and the local authority does not imTurnbull). He advanced against bis own case the strongest arguments that any man could possibly have produced. We have heard bandied about between these four walls allegations that the Western Australian Government has been guilty of some dilatoriness in the expenditure of money allocated to Western Australia from the Commonwealth aid roads grant. ff-[84] I know that, on the 29th February last, a question was asked in this House about the amounts remaining unspent out of the grants made to Western Australia in the last three financial years. The honourable member for Mallee cited the question and the answer to it. In the consideration of that matter, we must realize one thing: Although the amount stated in the answer as remaining unspent is far too high, it is not a true indication of the amount actually not spent. tioned by the Treasurer in his answer. the statement made by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden), but, since I am a Western Australian, I claim to know a little more about what happens in Western Australia than does the honourable member for Mallee, and, if he will bear with me for a few minutes, I shall explain it. what happens in Victoria than the honourable member does. He need not try to tell me what happens in Victoria. so. I am merely trying to tell the honourable member how we must regard the amount of £1,163,000 which is alleged to remain unspent. The system of making payments out of aid roads funds in Western Australia may be totally different from the system in every other State. In Western Australia, the local governing authority that seeks aid roads funds for road works must first satisfy the central authority-the Department of Public Works-that the work wil] be done, satisfactorily. Then, when the work is' completed, it must be inspected and passed for payment. As a consequence, a lot of completed work is not immediately paid mediately receive payment out of the grant. This means that, at the end of the financial year, the figure shown for the unexpended portion of the aid roads grant is, in reality, slightly false. If the figure were adjusted to allow for payment for all the commitments for the year, the amount unexpended would not be as high as it now appears to be.",77,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

231,Mr Chaney,"I am not trying to doAnother factor, also, must be taken into consideration. I understand that a certain sum has been set aside out of tbe amount mentioned by the Treasurer for the construction of a bridge over the Narrows, in Perth. I think the setting aside of that amount is justified under the terms of tbe principal act, although I personally feel, having lived in the country districts of Western Australia, tliat I would much rather see city people inconvenienced by traffic delays in order to give country people better surfaces on tbeir roads so that they may enjoy some of the amenities at present enjoyed by city residents. Australia, as a whole, parasitically depends upon primary producers and tbe producers of goods for export. whether tbey live in tbe cities, the towns, or the villages, depend for their livelihood and their future welfare upon those who produce from the soil or who produce goods or commodities that can be exported in order to build up Australia's trade balance. Eor this reason, emphasis should be placed on tbe development of country roads. Such a policy has been faithfully followed in Western Australia. As honourable members are aware, the population distribution in that State is no different from that in the other States. Approximately 53 per cent, of the population is concentrated in the Perth metropolitan area. If the argument of the bonorable member for Mallee were correct, the petrol tax, which is paid mainly by the majority of the people who live in the metropolitan areas, should be used only for the construction and maintenance of roads in the metropolitan areas. That is what his argument means if it is taken to its logical conclusion. ri -"" . cannot pick on any part of Australia i nncr say that, because the people who live there pay more petrol tax than the residents of another area pay, it should receive preferential treatment in the distribution of the grants made out of the proceeds of the tax. If that were done, the district that tlie honourable member for Mallee represents would receive nothing from the proceeds of the petrol tax. One must look at the picture not for one State but for the whole of Australia. I think the honourable member is totally unaware of the true position. The statement on Australian roads which was recently issued by the Australian Transport Advisory Council gives some interesting information about the roads that have to be cared for. The total mileage figures are amazing. I sball not itemize the various mileages of paved, sealed, unsealed and other roads, but in Victoria, there is a total of 104,000 miles of roads and in Western Australia, the total of 83,000 miles. need not be parochial. He should talk about Australia as a whole. I thought I was talking to a fairly intelAustralians, irrespective of ligent audience that would understand that I am talking from the national standpoint and not parochially. However, I am not responsible for the interpretation placed on my remarks by any individual. Western Australia, witb its very large area, is served by only 83,000 miles of road, whereas the compact State of Victoria is served by 104,000 miles of road. Who would say that the person living on the fringes of civilization, as it were, is not entitled to treatment equal to that given to the person who lives in the centre of a city? I know it is impossible to provide sealed highways to every village and hamlet, but many of the people living in country areas are benefiting Australia and its future more than are the people who live in the closely settled areas, and, in addition, they are putting up with far greater hardships than are experienced by those persons who happen to travel only along the Hume Highway in motor cars that may be run in at a speed of 90 miles an hour. To return to my parochial remarks about Western Australia, during the last four years, expenditure from the aid roads grant in the Perth metropolitan area has amounted to 10 per cent., fl per cent., 8 per cent, and 15 per cent, of the grant in the respective years. The sudden increase to 15 per cent, is accounted for by the setting aside of portion of the money for the construction of the causeway that links the south side of Perth with tbe north side. It is not generally known in this House that the volume of traffic across that causeway at peak periods is almost equal in density",79,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads
232,Mr Wahd,The honourable member,80,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads
233,Mr Chaney,"Strangely enough,to the volume of traffic over the Sydney Harbour bridge, and that the road over the causeway is, I think, a few feet wider than that over the Sydney Harbour bridge. There is dire need for a further outlet from the city and, accordingly, plans have been made for the construction of a bridge over the Narrows, at a cost of several million pounds. I think the idea of the planning authority is to set aside a certain amount each year to meet this commitment-of course, at the expense of roads in other parts of Western Australia. If we disregard the amount spent on the construction of these bridges, the percentage of the aid roads grant spent in the Perth metropolitan area in each of the last four financial years is 6 per cent., 7 per cent., 6 per cent, and 6 per cent., respectively, although 53 per cent, of the population of Western Australia lives in the metropolitan area. Western Australia is religiously observing the condition that no more than 40 per cent, of the aid roads grant shall be spent would have affected them in some small in the metropolitan area. Most of the Perth metropolitan area is under the control of the Perth City Council, which does not receive from the aid roads grant one penny for the maintenance and construction of roads within tbe area under its control. It meets such expenditure out have been content up till now to follow of its revenue from rates paid by the local the bullock tracks of the early days. We residents or from other sources. It is clear that Western Australia, which has been most severely maligned in this House to-day for its alleged failure to spend its ahead, or by trees that did not meet with share of the aid roads grant is, in fact, setting a very good example to the other States by the manner in which it spends the grant made to it. I feel that -the majority of representatives from Victoria will not in any way accept the proposed amendment for a change in the distribution of this money to a percentage basis calculated upon area and population. It has to be remembered that the formula was drawn up originally by people who had vast experience in these matters. Each year since 1926, the year when it was drawn up originally, there has been a protest from Victoria about the treatment it was receiving. I venture the opinion that if Victorian members looked at the matter logically they would admit that they could apply their protests in respect of expenditure in Melbourne when considering tbe total expenditure that bas been incurred on roads in Victoria. That being so, members of this House must not limit consideration of this problem to the boundaries of their electorates or States; we must consider it upon a national basis. After all, 1 do not think that any of the city users of motor spirit, concentrated as they are, would expect the whole of the money to be expended solely upon the roads which they themselves use. We took the wise course in Western Australia. Probably, the same thing has been done in other States; but there we obtained the services of Professor Stephenson, one of the leading town-planners in England. He came out and gave us an overall plan for tbe whole of the metropolitan area. Some of tbe suggestions be made were so far-reaching that people with little vision immediately dismissed them because the implementation of the plan way. They could not see that the overall effect would bave been the provision of something not for to-day but for the future. We must adopt a similar type of plan in respect of roads throughout Australia. As a pioneering nation, we bave been content to accept as roads what were merely tracks, the direction of which was controlled by the size of the trees the axe that happened to be carried in the dray. We have just followed the steps taken in the past. Our future planning must be such that, irrespective of what is undertaken or the way in which the money is spent, we shall spend not for tbe needs of to-day or of to^ morrow but in order to meet the needs of the future that lies before us. The principal intention of the bill, of course, is to allocate I d . of the 3d. increase in the petrol tax. A short-sighted attitude seems to have been adopted by some who argue that this means that of the total increase of £12,000,000 the States will receive only £4,000,000. It should be bome in mind that the balance of £8,000,000, obviously, will not be just frittered away. It will find its way back to tbe States, perhaps through the Commonwealth Grants Commission,, or in some other manner, and will be expended on vital public works, thus ensuring employment to the many thousands of people in those and ancillary industries. I admit that it is posare in Victoria. sible to spend £.100.000,000 on roads, but 1 cannot see the sense in having excellent highways throughout Australia if there is to be no one with a motor car io use them, or if there is to be no need the amount required in Victoria for exto carry good3 and commerce along them simply because a. depression has started and we have not the money to finance vital works iu various States. In those circumstances, I hold the view that to. criticize the fact that the whole of the £12,000,000 is not to be expended on roads is foolish and short-sighted. Any one who considers the matter logically must admit that what is proposed is in the best interests of everybody in the community. I bave discussed this question with certain transport authorities in Western Australia. Their initial reaction was one of extreme anger at the fact that they had to pay an extra 3d. a gallon for motor spirit; but, upon realizing that will see that on the one hand there is in Western Australia they wero enjoying some advantage from the "" payback "" for road grants, they accepted it in the spirit in which it was imposed. The honourable member for Farrer( Mr ment resolves itself. In the west we have Fairbairn) made the point that special arrangements should be made for the eommercial users of distillate. I suggest that some allowance should be made for people whose livelihood depends upon the transport of goods; and in my own State, where transport is the very life of the community, this is of vital importance. It is of far more importance than it would be in closer settled areas develop that area in the way in which or places that bave been completely built up. I cannot remember the exact figures cited by the honourable member for Mallee relating to tbe productive capacity of the various States, but I thought they were particularly applicable to our own case because a .State with a potential like that of Western Australia needs encouragement from the National Government and Parliarefreshing and stimulating to find areas ment. For the bonorable member's inforof true Australianism in this National mation, I point out that nearly every farm that is now being sold on the private market in Western Australia, is being bought by Victorian farmers, who realize that there are far greater possibilities in Western Australia than there In conclusion, I make another comparison between Victoria and Western Australia. According to the journal of the Australian Transport Advisory Council, penditure on primary roads capital works over the'next decade is £55,000,000. Among the things it provides for are the duplication of pavements between Melbourne, Geelong and Oakleigh to beyond Dandenong, and the widening of arterial roads, such as the Hume Highway and the Princes Highway east. I ask honourable members to draw their own conclusions from that. According to the same journal, the estimated amount required for Western Australia over the same period is £86,000,000, which is to be expended on capital works on main roads and important secondary roads, which is the responsibility of the State roads authority, as well as on developmental roads in tbe State. Honourable members terrific need for assistance in an expanding and undeveloped State, whilst on the other hand there is need for consolidation in a well-developed State. So, the argua place that is crying out for development, a place that has a latent capacity for development, but which can be developed only with the help of the National Government. Another point is that in tbe vast northern area of Western Australia we have undertaken a responsibility which rightly belongs to fhe Commonwealth. No State is in a position to it is capable of being developed. There, we have an added responsibility which can be borne only by the help of the preferential treatment which has been given by this Government in the past and which, I feel certain, this Parliament will see is continued in the future.

241,Mr Duthie,"Before the federal election campaign in December last year, afive-yearnational roads plan was devised by the transport committee of the Labour party, submitted to and approved by the federal executive, and included in tbe policy speech of our leader. It was a constructive approacn to this great problem, and dealt with it on a national level. Several ways of financing it were suggested. The first was to allocate to expenditure on roads the entire £46,000,000 which would be the proceeds of the petrol tax in the next financial year. The total cost of the plan was to be £50,000,000, which is the total of five equal annual allocations of £10,000,000. The £46,000,000 derived from the petrol tax would be given to the States for them to spend as they thought best. They could not be directed as to how they would spend it, but two ways of doing so immediately suggested themselves : one would be on road construction, and the other in the purchase of road making equipment, which is in very short supply. My colleague, the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Mclvor), who made an excellent speech earlier this evening, pointed out that one piece of heavy road-making equipment, the Euclid bulldozer, costs £20,000. One tyro alone of that vehicle costs £1,000. That indicates that . modern, heavy earthmoving and road-making equipment is expensive, but nonetheless essential. Three more ways are suggested for spending tbe £46,000,000 derived from petrol tax. The honourable member for t Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) is most interested in this problem, and because be does not intend to speak on this bill, I am bringing his ideas before the House. They are excellent. He suggests that some of this money should be spent by the States to maintain the traffic police force which patrols the highways. A further portion should be used to cover court costs involved in dealing with offences against traffic laws. The third suggestion is that some of the money should be spent to meet the cost of hospital treatment of persons who are injured in road accidents, and who occupy hospital wards every, day. Honourable members may be staggered to know that in Australia, a young country with a population of jonly 9,000,000, each year 2,000 die and 40,000 are injured as a result of road accidents. If that rate is multiplied by the ten years which have elapsed since 1945, the totals are 20,000 dead and 400,000 injured. A couple of years ago, in a speech in this House, I pointed out that between the years 1939 and .1951 more Australians were killed and injured on our roads than died in World War II . Hospital staffs have to devote far too much of their time, night and day, attending to cases brought in as a result of road accidents. A second proposal to finance this £50,000,000 five-year road plan is to allocate an amount from the defence vote. Road maintenance is a national undertaking. In peace time. Australia spends £190,000,000 annually on defence. That is nearly twice as much as the total amount of the budget in 1940. The Government is spending £23,000.000 on an ammunition factory at St. Mary's, another £1,000,000 to enlarge the military camp at Puckapunyal, in Victoria, and £2,500.000 a year to keep 1,400 troops in Malaya. Defence does not come into this discussion. an oblique reference to it. I am trying to show the House that the Labour party has a practical plan, and also that roads play a vital part in both primary production and defence. The primary producer needs good roads to transport his products, and in every country governments realize the importance of good roads for defence purposes. Consequently, it is proper to advocate that portion of the defence vote should be applied to this five-year road programme. I wish to acquaint honourable members of tbe attitude of the Australian Transport Advisory Council to road construction and maintenance. It is not doing the job that is expected of it. Towards the end of last year, tbe Australian Automobile Association, which represents eight or nine national motoring organizations met the council in conference, and although it has Australia-wide representation it refused to regard roads as a national responsibility. One of the suggestions put forward by the Australian",84,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads
242,Mr Deputy Speaker,Order!,85,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads
243,Mr Duthie,"1 am making onlyAutomobile Association was that tbe Commonwealth should assume financial responsibility for interstate highways, and that funds should be provided from the defence vote. 1 invite honourable .members to listen to a significant passage from tbe official report of the proceedings at that conference on this point. It reads HS follows:That brought forth tlie rattier surprising rejoinder from tlie Minister for the Interior, Werriwa( Mr Whitlam). I shall not the Houorable W. S. Kent Hughes, that the 'Defence Department did not regard roads as important from the defence aspect, particularly in comparison with railways and sea transport. Eoad transport carries 76 per cent, of the total volume of goods transported in Australia, and only 18 per cent, is carried by rail, yet the Australian Transport Advisory Council will not regard roads as a national responsibility. I stress the urgency of linking the road system to defence. Defence is on a national level; so also should roads be on a national level. For instance, wo could not imagine in Australia six navies, six air forces, or six armies, with one for facb State. That would be absolutely ridiculous. It is just as ridiculous to have six sets of divorce laws, six sets of marriage laws, six sets of railway systems, six sets of health laws, and six sets of road control and construction policies, but that is the system we have to-day. We are completely divided on this great national issue. We claim that the provision of roads should be raised to a national level as roads are strategically necessary for defence and absolutely essential for primary production. Such a course is being adopted overseas. The United States of America is realizing the importance of the matter more and more. In its recent budget it provided a colossal sum for road construction, and an entirely new approach is being made to tbe subject. It is interesting to note that the Americans have adopted a national outlook iu regard to roads. The federal government at Washington has allocated millions of dollars for roads linking all the States. 10,000,000,000 dollars to be expended over ten years. adopt a similar national outlook we shall continue Avith the horse and buggy roads and highways, on which more and more people will be killed day by day. The third manner in which we suggest a £50,000,000 five-year plan could be financed is by the imposition of a diesel fuel tax, such as was mentioned by my colleague, the honourable member for mention much about this subject beyond stressing its importance. America bas tackled this problem and it finds a new, legitimate field of taxation in this modern fuel. The Federal Newsletter issued on the lst May, 1956, by the Australian Automobile Association statesA principal feature of the American Automobile Association proposal is an increase in the share of federal aid highway costs being borne by large trucks so that the contribution of these trucks will be closer to their fiscal responsibility. Vehicles using diesel fuel all fal l within the large truck category. A dicselburning large truck frets about. 40 per cent, more miles per gallon than a gasoline-burning truck of the saint; weight. Also, including taxes, the cost of diesel fuel is about two-thirds of the cost of gasoline. Therefore a substantial increase in the federal tax on diesel fuel would be one of the means of having large trucks come nearer to paying for tlie added eost of the highway facilities they require. We must face the fact that these big diesel trucks whicli move from Adelaide to Sydney, for instance, wear out the Hume Highway, about, which the honourable member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn) spoke in so much detail to-night. We all agree with his contentions. What do the proprietors of these large trucks contribute to the upkeep of that highway? They contribute virtually nothing. They have recently escaped the imposition 'of a tax by a legalism. The High Court of Australia has ruled that the State governments cannot tax them and the State governments have appealed to the Privy Council against the decision of the Higli Court. To-day these operators are on a bonanza; no one can touch them. A diesel fuel tax could be imposed upon them. diesel fuel increase the cost of goods?",85,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

If the consumers realized that the imposition of a tax would niata: these fellows pay for the roads they destroy and so enable the roads to be rebuilt, the consumers would not mind. After all, many other costs are being ironed back to the community. We may not agree with them, but we realize that in the long rim they are helpful to the eountry. The imposition of a diesel fuel tax would enable us to reduce the petrol rax. I have pointed out that such a tax is beiug imposed in America. I contend that interstate operators should pay for the roads that they are helping tc destroy. A fourth way in whicli we can finance a £50,000.000 five-year plan is by imposing an excise duty on tyres. This is a. matter which should be examined. This would be one of the fairest ways of obtaining finance for road construction purposes. Perhaps we could adopt a tyre tax as an alternative to a diesel fuel tax. Persons who usecars and trucks most would pay the most. The more miles they travelled, tbe greater tbe tax they would pay. The only problem that might arise would be in regard tn tyres that blow out. A tyre might blowout even after only a few miles on the road, but that, too, is a risk which we -would have to take. I contend that a tyro tax would be fair, because the more a vehicle was used thc greater would be the owner's contribution. T have advanced these thoughts to the House in a spirit of co-operation aud with a constructive outlook. I again congratulate all those honourable members who have tried to raise this matter to a national level. I do not think that we sball ever improve our roads until tbey become a national responsibility. was not my intention to speak to this bill, but I have a few comments to offer. The honourable meinber for Wilmot( Mr continue to do that. This is one way to Duthie) sat down on the note of a blow nut. I think that that would happen to most of the theories that he was expounding. Honourable members noticed the way he was airily throwing away with complete irresponsibility millions of pounds. T h a t is a reasonable He spoke about an amount of £48,000,000 which will be obtained next year from the petrol tax. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) spoke airily about an American scheme for the expenditure over ten years of 10,000,000,000 dollars. We must come down to realities.; We cannot afford all these things. At present the Opposition is not in a position to put its hands into the people's pockets to get money. However nice aTi these things would be, tbey have to t paid for. I have been in the House the whole day and I have noticed the marvellous time that the Opposition has been having in their contributions to the debate on this bill. Honourable members opposite have had a delightful time. They are completely irresponsible. We have seen them beat their breasts and say what they would do if they were in office. Throughout the debate they have been chiding the Government. This country cannot afford the annual expenditure of £10,000,000 on roads. As a member of the Australian Country party I should very-much like to see better roads provided, but unfortunately it is necessary for us to raise the money. . Taking our minds away from the millions of pounds to which lionorable members opposite have airily referred, this bill provides for the allocation for road construction of Id. out of every 3d. additional petrol tax collected. Thnt is all that it does. [Quorum formed.] BeforeI was interrupted, I was bringing the Oppositior back to a consideration of the amount of money that we can afford for roads, and I was dealing with the Id. allocation. Why was this additional tax put on? That is the point. It was put on for two reasons, one being to raise finance and the second, and a very important one, being to deal with our balance of payments position. It is easy to say, ""We will get more petrol from overseas "". But petrol has to be bought. We were spending £152,000,000 a year on motor cars and petrol, and we could not afford to reduce the use of petrol; make it a little more expensive and people will conserve it more carefully. There is an alternative way, and that is to ration petrol. Those people who criticize the action of this Government in imposing an additional",86,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

248,Mr Anderson (Hume) [9.38],"I ttax of 3d. a gallon on petrol miglit spend & little time in examining those two alternatives. Our overseas balances are not inexhaustible. I .think that the general consensus of opinion in Australia is that the people would rather pay 3d. a gallon more for petrol than have petrol rationed. The other purpose of this increased taxation is to raise funds. Not one penny of those funds will come to this Government. Not one penny will be expended on work which this Government wishes to undertake. The whole of the money is being raised for the purpose of supporting the works programmes of the States. It is well to remember that fact. As the Opposition gaily spends our pounds on building marvellous roads, it forgets that we are still responsible to raise funds for hospitals, schools, and everything else for which the six States rely on this Government. Honourable members opposite say that we are mean in regard to the amount of money that we allow to the States for tbe making of roads, but I ask them to remember that the Menzies Government has supplied more than £500,000,000 to the State governments for State works. That sum has been found by this Government, wbich they are so pleased to criticize, from Commonwealth resources. No criticism on the ground of meanness can be levelled at this Government by the five Labour-governed States. It is easy to have a discussion about building wonderful roads and to overlook the fact that there is a budget to meet. It is very nice to have good roads. We have been told that in Europe there are magnificent roads, including the autobahns of Germany. But how were those autobahns built? I have travelled on them, and I admit that they are magnificently constructed. They would cost many fortunes to construct nowadays. But they were built under a dictatorship. All the resources of the state were called on in order to build them. Do honourable members opposite want that to happen here? Exactly the same comments may be made about the Italian highways. They, too, were built under a dictatorship. Are we going to plan our road building that if we did so we should haye on tbo'se lines.? Reference has been made road problems no longer, because roads to the roads in the United Kingdom, which is a highly settled small country. Of course, the British roads are good. Tbe price of road construction per head of population in Great Britain is a minor matter compared with the cost in a great, sparsely populated continent such as Australia. We want to get down to hard facts in this matter. It is time to call a halt to the picnic that the Labour party has been having on this question of roads. According to a book that the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton) has introduced to the House, even the United States of America has numerous road problems. I wish now to read a passage from tbe second-reading speech of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden). He saidHowever, the roads problem, which, incidentally, is primarily a State responsibility, is but one of the many important developmental problems which face us to-day. I ask lionorable members opposite to believe that that is so. The Treasurer went onI f every branch of activity were to receive all the finance it claims to require, we would liave a total works programme in Australia nearer £1,000,000,000 a year than the £-100.000,000 a year now provided. Honourable members opposite should remember that thero are hundreds of other projects being undertaken which are of equal developmental importance to roads. I do not decry the need for good roads, but I appreciate that there are many other things that also are necessary. Honourable members opposite spe;ik about making roads a national responsibility, but do not many people want education, hospitals and other things also to be made a national responsibility? When the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) was telling us his fairy tales this evening, be spoke of the need for building hospitals, out of road funds, for the wounded from the roads. Is everything to depend on roads? The honourable meniber also suggested that we should take money from the defence vote for roads purposes.",87,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads
249,Mr Bryant,And why not?,88,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads
250,Mr Anderson,"Fo r the reasonwould be built by slave labour under tbe direction of our conquerors. No money should be diverted from the defence vote for the purpose of making roads. Has this Government been mean in its contribution to the cause of road development? In the last years of the previous Labour government, the government that is supposed to have been so wonderful and to have done so much, the allocation for roads was £7,000,000. Let us consider the record from that time until the Menzies Government took over. The allocations since then have been £9,000,000, £12,000,000, £14,000,000, £15,000,000, £16,000,000, and £22,500,000. Those figures indicate the planning that has been going on under this Government. Yet, honourable members opposite contend that the Government does not plan. With tbe £32,000,000 that will represent the Oommonwealth aid roads payments next year, the States, if they plan properly, will have sufficient money to start putting deceived in these matters. The honorabl' the roads in good order. There is no question that this Government has planned sufficiently well to meet any criticism on the subject of roads. In tbe space of six years, it bas increased the allocation from £7,000,000 to £32,000,000. Honourable members opposite speak airily about giving so much money to the States for roads purposes, but they forget that there are other problems. Only one honourable member opposite offered an alternative method of raising money for State works or other public works, and that was the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns). As honourable members are aware, I have often questioned his figures, because they are always subject to doubt. For that reason, I wait for the Hansard report of the previous day's debates to examine his figures. As the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) stated, one method of assisting road construction, suggested by the honourable member for Yarra, would be to impose land tax because, according to him, that is a tax which could easily be borne by the big land-owners. [Quorum formed.] Who called for a quorum? not entitled to ask that question. honourable member for East Sydney( Mr This Government decided that 40 per cent, Ward) be bas been here long enough to show proper respect for the Chair and stand when calling for a quorum. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), when speaking of the economic proposals of the Prime Minister, said that the ls. increase in company tax would be passed on to the consumer. Now the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) proposes an increase in land tax, which would automatically be added to the overhead costs of commercial firms and would naturally be passed on, to the consumer. Honourable members opposite would like to bave it both ways, but they cannot. This potential Labour Treasurer said that it would be quite easy to find the money that is needed. He suggested a higher probate tax because, apparently, in his view, the Federal Government does not raise nearly enough revenue in this wayonly about £10,000,000 out of a total of about £200,000,000. One can be easily member for Yarra apparently does not know that the States levy enormous amounts in probate tax. Perhapsi f he did know be would conceal the fact. Any one who lives in New South Wales would tell him that the probate taxes there are prohibitive. His proposal follows the principles of Karl Marx, whose plan was by heavier and heavier taxation to destroy ownership of property. This potential Treasurer, the honourable member for Yarra, toid us of two ways in which we might raise money for road maintenance. Unfortunately, his party is merely trying to gain political capital from this issue. First, he suggested imposing a heavier land tax and, secondly, he urged that the Government should re-establish confidence in the loan market. That is the sort of thing one might expect from an Opposition which favours low interest rates. Can honourable members imagine how we could restore confidence in the loan market during a time of prosperity by offering an interest rate of 3J per cent.? The Opposition does not tell us how to do it ; indeed, it is not possible. Labour says that the Commonwealth Government should accept responsibility for country roads. The Australian Country party, in consort with its coalition friends, has already accepted that responsibility. of the petrol tax allocation should be",88,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads
251,Mr Ward,The honourable member is,89,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads
252,Mr Anderson,"If it was thespent on rural roads. The Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) said, in moving the second reading of this billAs a result, the proportion of the total grant which must be speut on rural roads in the current financial year will amount to about £11,000,000 and tliis amount, with the increased petrol tax allocation proposed iu this present bill, wil l increase to nearly £13,000,000 taxation, which was introduced by a next year, in the year before we took office, 1048-49, the amount set aside for such roads was only £2,000,000. This provision is, of course, designed to promote development in rural areas and ia of . particular benefit to primary producers and to the local authorities who are largely responsible for roads in these areas. That gives the lie direct to Labour's, suggestion that the Australian Country party and the Liberal -party are not concerned about rural roads. It is very nice to have roads like the German autobalms but they must be paid for. Ours is not a small continent. Its population is scattered and the cost of road-making on the European scale is prohibitive. This Government, as can be proved from the figures, is each year allocating more and more money for road building. Eventually, if the States handle their finances efficiently, we shall have roads of which we may be proud, but I do not think that we can possibly have roads like the German autobahns of which the Opposition speaks. There is scope for a national conference on roads, but that does not alter the fact that this Government has recognized its national responsibility and has provided, to the best of its ability, for the construction and maintenance of roads. This is the beginning of a scheme which, if we improve our finances and this Government remains in office and protects the Australian economy, will give us roads of which in years to come we may well be proud. sbould like to refer to some of tbe points which were raised by the bonorable member for Hume( Mr Anderson). He claimed that this Government had handed to tlie States countless millions for road building. The Opposition believes that there is no real division between Federal and State responsibilities in tbe matter of roads. We from Victoria are prepared to accept the fact that even some of the people from southern New South Wales ate also Australians, and should be treated as such. We acknowledge that in spite of their addiction to odd ball games. We hope that in the end they will be able to see that this is a national responsibility. It is idle to talk of tbe great sums that have been paid to the States. They have, after all, come from uniform Labour government. Reference has been made to Australian overhead costs, and the necessity for us to build more roads per head of population. It merely follows that road building is more expensive per head in this country than elsewhere, and that we simply need more money for roads. Oddly enough, Government supporters oppose any attempt to find ways in which more money could be provided. The honorable member for Hume criticized the idea of a land tax advanced by the honourable member for Yarra. I suppose that opposition is to be expected from the representatives of the people, who have cornered most of the land. Road development, of course, adds to the value of land. However, although the honourable member opposed the imposition of a federal land tax he did point out that because of State estate duty, it is now almost, too expensive to die in New South Wales. That is something in his favour. He also mentioned a fellowcalled Marx, whom he manages to bring into most of his speeches. If Karl Marx were sitting in the public gallery to-day he would say that at last, after .100 years, he had found somebody to fit into his most expansive theories. The theories advanced by the honourable member warrant a place among the classics in anyMarxist museum. Fortunately, in most parts of the world, and especially in Australia, we have not reached the stage at w hich the Marxist theories apply. 7 [9.57] I I should like to suggest in passing that the rather dreadful title of the bill, "" Commonwealth Aid Roads Bill "", should be amended by inserting either the word "" for "" , or a hyphen between the. words "" A i d "" and ""Roads"". I do not know if they were left out in the dim-distant past for reasons of economy, but their insertion would, certainly, produce better English and make the title more readable. I have been intrigued most of all by the remarkable discord on the Government",89,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads
253,Mr Bryant (Wills),"side of the HouseI assume that the Australian Country party may still be regarded as being on that side of the House. Like the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) I congratulate all those on the Government side who happen to agree with my point of view. The Australian Country party has, for some reason or other, in the last few days-and particularly on this billcarried all tlie weight of the Government. Liberal party speakers have been notably absent, and I am not surprised. Perhaps they read a little deeper and think a bit further, and they find themselves in such a position of contradiction that they are not prepared to take up the cudgels on this case. It is hard to find thc ostensible alliance see that it allows the importation of the between the Liberal party and tbe Country party. We have the sideplay between the bonorable member for Perth( Mr inflationary spiral; and from some proChaney) and the honourable member for MaUee( Mr Turnbull); we have the Wentworth) versus the rest, supported by proxy to-morrow, perhaps, by the lionorable member for Farrer( Mr either! Fairbairn), wbo has 90-miles-an-hour friends and supports a zero-miles-an-hour government. I congratulate the Australian Country party members on the fighting attitude ihey have taken on this bill. After all, vve appreciate fighters, particularly in the political sphere. It adds a little zest to the rather dull business of watching the country going backwards from day lo day. The honourable member for Perth put up a remarkably good case for the State Labour Government of Western Australia. I congratulate bim on that. There are a couple of vacancies on this aide, and he can get in, if he moves to Victoria, for 4s. a year. Why bas this measure been introduced? If we look into the dim ancl distant shades of this session, we see that on the 14th March, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) made a statement on economic measures. He said his purpose was to do three things. He would defeat inflation by soaking up our surplus spending power. Fancy-the Bryant surplus -spending power! He has a passion for myths. He would make up the deficiencies in the Government's accounts. I will refer to that one a little later. The deficiencies in tbe Government's accounts, of course, were little matters that came in at the tail end of his speech Inflation was the enemy. Ten or twelve years ago, you could get away with anything by saying it was required for the war effort. Apparently to-day you can get. away with anything by saying it is to fight inflation. This bill, in effect, is another part of the smoke screen whicli this Government is spreading in. order to defend itself against the hostile criticism from this side of the House ancl from about 9,000,000 other Australians. The Government says it will also reduce imports, but it is very careful in its calculations to same quantity of petrol. There is tbe balance of payments position, and the nouncement of a rather defeatist nature by the Treasurer-anc l after all it is his bigger deficit than he thought of in tbe first place, ancl be will not achieve that, ThenI come to bases of the petrol tax. If honourable members agree with th.u petrol tax as a matter of logic, I suppose tbey can claim that the people who use the roads should pay for them. Of course, we all pay for them, and we all use them. No matter what sort of an Australian one is, at some stage of the game be will bave to use the roads and rely on the roads. In this case, an extra £12,000,000 will be raised by the petrol tax but only £4,000,000 of it _ will be applied to the logical expenditure on roads. This means that £S,000,000 of it is plain, straight, indirect taxation. Some of my colleagues pointed out to the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer) that there was a change in tbe incidence or the ratio of this tax. Previously 70 per cent, of the actual collections was applied to roads, but, by processes of arithmetic that do not seem to be common even to both sides of the House, it will be down to about 60 per cent, after the bill becomes law. That is an interesting development of this Government's attitude. After all, indirect taxation is like the hearth tax, fhe chimney tax, and the window tax-",90,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads
254,Honourable Member For Mackellar ( Mr Bill,"w e gather that he expects to bave awhich finally ended with Charles Stuart outside Whitehall on a cold January morning. That will eventually occur here. It is a way of dodging the main issue. If £1,000,000,000 is required, I presume the statesmen-like position as distinct from the statesman-like position adopted by the Australian Country party ts tell the people of Australia "" We need £1,000,000,000. You can hand in your ration. Here is your bill. It is your tax "". It has been stated by the Minister indirect taxation, a taxpayer chooses to tax himself. He works out what the position is and says, "" I think my ration ought to be £10. I will buy another 5U0 gallons of petrol, and there it is "". This is a sort of do-it-yourself government. The Government did the same sort of thing when it drew up the last lot of electoral boundaries. We oppose indirect taxation in principle. It is a way of soaking the people so that, if possible, the Government avoids facing them and saying, "" Here is your bill "". It is not really a sound procedure. This is part of that system, even though it is a fairly small amount in £.1,000,000,000. It is part of the general retrogression in taxapened tn incur the wrath of this House tion principles which this Government has produced, and we oppose it. We support direct taxation such as income tax and land tax. We support probate duty-that is, if any of us have anything left on which probate duty is payable. anything left with the Labour party's policies. honourable member has been telling us we have not a policy. However, we are gaining ground. This is something we can be congratulated upon, and his recognition of it, of course, is a great advance politically. When the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) quoted the case of dieseline, the honourable the Government is to meet that expense, member for Wimmera( Mr Lawrence) said, "" Will not that increase prices, be reflected in production costs, and increase again that the tendency of this Governinflation ?"" That was the implication, anyhow. I answered him at the time by saying that, after all, he was denying his own Prime Minister and the very basis on which £8,000,000 of this £12,000,(IU0 was being soaked out of us. What are some of the things to be paid out of this extra £8,000,000? A great case has been made out for roads, but £8,000,000 extracted from the poor suffering motorists is to be paid into Consolidated Revenue. I am a motorist because, for 100 years the general transport system in this country has been managed by people who did not want it run properly because it is socialist, so one bas to own a car. You do not have to live in the rural areas of Mallee; you can live in the suburban areas of our capitals and still need a car, and, incidentally, you have a good case for starting up in the spring-making business. I simply point out that £8,000,000 of the £12,000,000 to be collected from the petrol tax increase will be absorbed in a series of odd activities of this Government. Let me show what they are. There is a little matter like a couple of handy Convairs, which cost £900,000. Some deficiencies in Army blankets have to be made good. Tbat is a few thousand pounds. There are all sorts of odd things. A couple of gentlemen who hapbecause they tangled witb my friend the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan), cost us £10,000-in legal expenses, mark you! Yet we have a government with ten Queen's Counsel, seven legal men, a whole phalanx of lawyers, and batteries of them, I think, in the legal department. The collection of literature handed out to us yesterday about Additional Estimates, Supplementary Estimates and so on shows that architects will be paid £56,000 extra, and there are hundreds of architects in the Public Service. Erom my own point of view, as a person and as an Australian, I object to the fact that I am asked to pay extra tax as a motorist to provide for these things. If I am prepared to pay additional income tax-littl e though the income is. I stress ment to resort to indirect taxation is a retrogressive move and we will fight it all the way. At every opportunity we have to point it out to the public, we will tell them.

257,Mr Bryant,"Eo r two months thenotices saying "" This is soaking up some of your surplus spending power "". The Minister for the Army, who seemed to be a little terse on tbe subject, and to think it illogical, asked ""What does it matter if the ratio is reduced from 70 per cent, to 60 per cent. ?"" It is a matter of principle, and I should not expect it to be seen too clearly by honourable members on the other side of the House. This measure effects a change in the whole basis of our tax structure, l t is changing gradually, but if honourable members care to look up the taxation schedule they will see how tbe proportion of sales tax rose gradually. When that tax was introduced it represented the small amount of 6 per cent, out of the total tax collections. In 1941 it rose to about 13 per cent, or 14 per cent. Under the impetus of a Labour government with proper taxation principles, it was reduced, even in the face of war, to about 7 per cent. Now .it is back to 12 per cent. The object of increasing this tax is, of course, to avoid responsibility and to impose the tax on the people who can least afford to pay it. The attitude of the Opposition is a logical one. We do not mind if everybody owns a motor car. We dp not consider that a terrible crime, and the standard of tbe roads in Australia forms part of our calculation of tbe general standard of living of the community. I should now like to direct some remarks to the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull), who, at least, added a bit of life to the debate, be being a fighting member of tbe Australian Country party. I shall tell honourable members the implications of his foreshadowed amendment, which was to the effect that all the money raised from petrol tax in Victoria should be spent in Victoria. Victoria, of course, is tbe salt of the earth. Mr TrnNBUT.T, -Not all tbe money; only the extra 2d. wording of the honourable member's amendment implied that the money would be spent proportionately in that State. I think it was tbe bonorable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) who suggested that we take that argument to its logical extreme. What. then, does it mean ? I have calculated that during the last twelve months I have spent about £20 in petrol tax. It would be very nice, from my point of view, if that £20 were spent on the street in which I live, which is a very difficult and dangerous one at certain times of the year. We oppose this contention regarding States' rights. It is an attitude, of course, wbich has nothing to do with Labour policy. We shall support the outlook of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Chaney). We believe that Western Australia, with its great potential, has the right to claim from us in Victoria this extra amount from the petrol tax, so that it may expand and eventually be able to produce from its land something worth more than the 2s. 3d. an acre, which, I understand, from the figures given by the honourable member for Mallee, is the present average value of Western Australian production. cannot spend what it is getting now. things will improve, when we throw this Government out and are able to have the man-power and materials in the right places. However, it is the principle that we wish to espouse at the moment. We have had a statistical picnic in this House during this debate. More figures and charts have been produced to-night than we have seen in the last two months. The Year-Boole has taken a severe thrashing. We need to analyse these matters to arrive at the contradiction of principle, to which the honourable member for Mallee is so addicted. I have heard him contend that his electorate is too big, that because of its area he should have fewer constituents. He advocates an area principle, for electoral purposes, but he advocates a non-area principle in the matter of tbe spending of taxation revenue. But. of course, that argument was bowled over in Victoria in 1952. when we managed to corner Government supporters on Ibis proposition, and they were soundly whipped. What is the position :it present in regard to roads? The lionorable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie"") pointed out that we should consider it ridiculous if we had six navies, six armies, and six air forces, although such a multiplicity of armed forces might help to keep up",92,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads

261,Mr Bey Ant,"Yes, perhaps sLx this Government chose to do so, sectionA n honourable member has just handed nie a glass of water, ancl I am reminded that it is one commodity on which there is no tax. Let me digress for a moment to examine the benefits that the average Australian has received fro m government enterprise. When he takes water fro m his tap, that water has been provided from public investment. switches ou a light, the power has been provided by public investment. roads, about which we have been talking, are constructed by public investment. The school, to which, in Victoria at least, be cannot send bis child because it is already over-crowded-mostl y because of the neglect of Liberal and Australian Country party governments-is a public investment and a public responsibility. The addiction of this Government to private investment will lead eventually to the permanent economic paralysis of the nation. Asf a r as the average citizen is concerned, it is much more important for the nation to be building roads than to be turning out Holden motor ears. Tbat, I think, indicates the financial differences between tbe two sides of this House. Country parties have failed to acknowledge the real role that public investment should play in this country. Tlierefore. we have reached this pretty impasse in which public investment has collapsed, and private investment is going ahead in leaps and bounds. Creeping paralysis has afflicted our economy and you wonder why it has happened. BeforeI conclude, I should like to point out again tbe jiosition of the Labour party in this matter. We believe that the indirect portion of this tax is bad in principle. We believe that it is a national responsibility to build fhe roads of this country. We believe that constitutional reform is necessary and that we must base our taxation principles upon equity. If that can be done in connection with land tax and probate, it can be done in this instance. I am very interested in the private conferences that have been taking place in the corner between members of the Liberal party and members of the Australian Country party. T hope that their consciences will guide them, and that they w ill vote to accept the amendments that have been foreshadowed from this side of the House. In rising to speak on this measure, I find that I am the twenty-first member to do so. While I was occupying your chair this afternoon, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker( Mr Bowden), I was approached When ho by an honourable member and asked whether there would be many more The speakers on this bill. When I replied that there was a long list of members who desired to speak, he made the observation that if we all went out and began physically to build the roads, we might be quicker in getting what Australia required. This is in keeping with the belief held by many people that in the past there has been too much talk and too little action in developing our national roads system. The honourable member for Wills( MrB r y a n t ) who has just resumed his seat, talked far too much, and indulged in clowning. For the reasons I have stated, I shall speak only briefly on this measure to-night. On referring to Hansard of the 20th October, 1954, I find that on that date The Liberal and Australian I made a long speech on a measure similar to the one now before the House. I find, further, that I am in absolute agreement with what I said on that occasion. I support this measure, because it provides the means whereby still more money w ill be made available to the Statesf or the construction and maintenance of roads. [Quorum formed.] I believe that no expenditure of public moneys contributes so much to the national welfare as does expenditure on building good roads. This applies, not only to Australia, but also to all other countries of the world. We see that, when funds are made available under tbe Marshall plan, the Colombo plan, or through the several agencies of the United Nations organization to countries less fortunate than our own, a major portion of it is used for road construction. The national needs of Australia are, I believe, such that road improvements must be made if we are to continue to progress. Whilei t was realized by the Australian Government as far back as 1923 that road construction generally was the responsibility of the State governments, it has now come to be recognized that with",94,Philip Mcbkide Yo U Are Still The Main Roads And The Semi Main Roads
262,Mr Lawrence (Wimmera) [10.20].,"the rapid development of motor transport, the provision of suitable roads has uow become a problem of national importance, and one of too great magnitude for the various State governments to handle without the aid of the National Government. Under the provisions of the measure that is now before the House, in a f u l l year another £4,000,000 will be made available to tbe States for road construction. approximately £32,000,000 being made available in the coming twelve months. The present formula that is .used to determine the share of this grant for each State has been in operation since 1926. [ find, on looking at the reports of conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers at that time, that this subject was debated f u l l y for over three days. The formula, as honourable members know, is based on three-fifths as to population and two-fifths as to area. Victoria has never been happy witb the way the formula has operated against that State. I shall quote two short extracts from Hansard of former days to illustrate my point. In 1926, the then bonorable member for Henty, the late Sir Henry Gullett, stated the attitude of Victoriai n these wordsHad the suggested allocution of the money been fair, I should have no trouble in deciding ber for Bonython( MrM a k in ) , who my attitude. And in 1937, the right honourable member for Cowper (Si r Earle Page), when tracing the history of road grants over the previous ten years, saidThat State He meant Victoriarefused to give recognition to the principle that money should be expended on a threefifths population and two-fifths area basis. I , together with all other members of this House, like to feel that we are here as Australians rather than as State residents and representatives of States, and therefore I approve of a system under which the wealthier and more populated States help the weaker and less fortunate ones. I agree with this principle in general, but I believe that the formula as it now exists has become unbalanced. Tbe. honourable member for ""Werriwa( Mr Whitlam""! said, by interjection, a moment ago that, I was an expert at extraction. I hope, in this particular case, that I can extract more money from the Government, and I hope, also, that it w ill be a painless extraction. I make this observation regarding the formula, because of the large number of motor vehicles, particularly large transports from other States that use the Victorian roads. On the 20th October, 1954, I cited This is expected to result in figures which showed that the ratio of Victorian transports to other States' transports using the Victorian highways was as 39 is to 51. To-day, I believe that the position is even worse, as f a r as Victoria is concerned. Our Victorian interstate main roads, particularly tbe Western Highway, the Midlands High way and the Hume Highway are taking a f e a r f u l pounding from heavy, high-speeding vehicles. The roads that are used by these heavy high-speed interstate vehicles which travel between Adelaide and. Sydney pass mainly through the electorates of Wimmera, Bendigo and In d i, and I am sure that the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) and tbe honourable member for In d i ( Mr Bostock) w ill agree that very serious damage is being done. I know, too, that my friends, the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) and the honourable memtravel on these roads regularly, w ill agree that they are taking a fearfu l pounding. It is dreadful to tbink that these once wonderful highways are being pounded away in this manner. Because of the facts I have outlined, I believe that very special extra consideration should be given to Victoria, and' that a greater contribution should be made to it . I suggest that it should be done in one of the following three ways:First, by amending the existing formula so that four-fifteenths of the funds are distributed in proportion to area, fivefifteenths in proportion to the number of vehicles, and six-fifteenths in proportion to population; secondly, by allocating the round sum of £1,000,000 to Victoria before distributing the balance according to the existing for m u l a; or thirdly, by allocating, say, 2£ per cent, of the funds to Victoria before distribution according to the existing formula. I a m prepared to agree t h a t the e x t r a money t l i a t w o u l d be g i v en to V i c to r i a in that w a y should be used e n t i r e l y on interstate highways. I do not in t e n d to repeat the arguments t h a t have been so effectively advanced to-day by m y colleagues, p a r t i c u l a r l y the honourable m e mber for D e a k in ( MrD a v is ) . The r e for e , I conclude by saying t h a t I believe t h a t for f a r too long V i c to r i a has carrie d too much of the road construction b u r d e n ; t b a t it is h i g h t i m e that the other States realized t h is ; and t h a t at the next conference of C o m m o n w e a l t h and State Ministers t h e i r representatives decide to give V i c to r i a a f a i r go. a d j o u r n e d.

These questions are not capable of precise answers. Assessment of the effect on the balance of payments of dollar and other over(by Sir EBICHARBISO N) prosea investment in Australian industry is not simply a matter of comparing the amount of capital funds remitted to Australia wit h an amount of outward dividend remittances. Oversea investment of the kind in question has contributed and is contributing substantially to the development of the Australian economy, and this development itself frequently hua an In the case of General Motors-Holden's Limited, for instance, the amount of outward dividend remittances represents a small proportion of the amount of oversea exchange that would have been involved if the motor vehicles produced in Australia by the company had had to be imported. 2. Such statistics as are availab'e indicate capital investment in Australia since the double tax agreement was signed in 1953. It is not possible to say to what extent this increased investment has been due to the double tax agreement rather than to other factors. 3. Presumably, the honourable member's reference is to the acquisition of "" know-how "" by payment of fees rather than by the introduction of oversea capital.

Fraser) asked the following question:Has the Department of Health in Canberra made any survey of the incidence, or prevalence, of hydatids iu the grazing area surrounding the eity? understand, is one to which children are particularly susceptible, will the Minister consider initiating here a programme for eradication of the disease, similar to that being adopted in adjoining shire areas in New Soutli Wales? 1 now provide the following answer to the honourable member's question:My department has been aware for many years of the high incidence of hydatid disease in sheep in the Australian Capital Territory and surrounding districts as evidenced by the Iiigh rate uf condemnation of sheep livers at the Canberra Abattoir which is controlled by my department. To obtain more specific information a survey was made in January and February, 1955, to determine the incidence of hydatid iii sheep killed at the abattoir and it was found that 30 per cent, of sheep killed were shown to be affected. Hydatid disease in Australia is conveyed to humans by dogs where the sheep-dog-man association is intimate and common. Tlie disease has not been established in the urban dogs in tlie Australian Capital Territory and this is no doubt largely due to tlic strictness of the supervision of tin; Canberra abattoir in preventing hydatid iufected offal meats reaching the urban dog as food. During the tuberculosis mass X-ray survey iu 1952, 16,792 chest X-rays were taken' by my department. An investigation of the non-tubercular abnormalities among these X-rnys indicated that only two had suffered from' hydatid of the lung which is the second most common site of hydatid disease in man. These figures, which are supported by the experience of senior medical practitioners in Canberra, indicate the relative insignificance of the disease in humans in the Australian Capital Territory. However, my department is aware of the existence of a problem in the rural areas of the Australian Capital Territory. Field veterinary officers have continually brought this to the notice of stock-owners and informed tliem of measures which should be taken to ' reduce the infestation in sheep and dogs. My department will continue this campaign, the success of which depends upon the co-operation of stock-owners. Mr O'CONNOB asked the Postmaster General, upon notice1. Have instructions been issued in the metropolitan area of Sydney that no installations «of telephones are to be effected and that, at the moment, thc policy of the department is to deal only with maintenance? 2. If so, for how long is this position to prevail ? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. No. Telephone services are being installed in the metropolitan area of Sydney as quickly as circumstances permit. 0,004 new connexions As this disease, I have been made during the past four months. The normal maintenance of services is proceeding. 2. See answer to 1. Mr O'CONNOB asked the Postmaster General, upon notice1. Are certain post offices in the Sydney metropolitan area refusing to accept £5 notes as legal tender, and is this causing great inconvenience to the public? 2. If so, does this action follow any instruction issued to this effect by the department? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. There is no known instance of a post office in the Sydney metropolitan area having refused to accept a £5 note as legal tender. 2. The department has not instructed post office staffs to refuse acceptance of £5 notes. Customs and Excise, upon notice1. What is the average landed cost per lb. excluding Customs duty, paid by Australian tobacco and cigarette manufacturers for imported tobacco? 2. What is the amount of duty on that cost, assuming tlie concession of ls. 6d. per lb. in respect of Australian leaf usage is claimed? 3. What was tlie average price paid at last season's sales of Australian tobacco for leaf of similar grades from Queensland and Western Australia respectively? 4. Is there a wide discrepancy between tlie price paid for Wesfern Australian leaf and that paid for Qucensiand leaf; if so, is this due to the absence of competitive .buying in Western Australia where sales are held at a much later date than in the eastern States? 5.

Factors contributing to this so far as Western Australia is concerned are said to ibe:-(o ) Tlie lower proportion of cigarette-type leaf, (fc) thc relatively higher salt content, (c) less .active competition than in other States due to later sales the date of which are influenced by seasonal conditions, distance from markets and the relatively small crop compared to that of Queensland,' which is the principal producer. 5. The percentages of Australian leaf content prescribed from time to time are designed to absorb the whole of the usable Commonwealth erop. ii. Because of marketing procedure and practice, it is customary to fix tlie percentages at least twelve months ahead, and they are announced in A p r i l or May each year. The percentage to operate for the year 1956-57 was fixed at 17£ pcr cent, for tobacco and 74 per cent, for cigarettes by my predecessor and announced in May, 1955. The percentages to operate as from the l s t July, 1957, are now being considered, and I expect to make an announcement at an early date. 7. Tlie initiative in changing marketing procedures normally emanates from the industry rather than from the Government. However, I will bring this part of the honourable member's question to the notice of my colleague, the Minister for Primary Industry. can be given to tobaccoTIN. senting tbe Minister for National Development, upon noticeI now f u r n is h the f o l 1. What are the figures for tin production in Australia and to what degree does production meet Australian requirements? 2. Isi t anticipated that expansion of Australian t in production w ill , in the future, supply the f u l l needs of industry, including the new rolling mill which will shortly be in operation ? National Development has furnished the following replies:1. Australian production of t in is about 2,100 tons per annum. Local consumption of primary t in is approximately 2,400-2,500 tons per annum. 2. It is expected that Kaveiishoe t in dredge. North Queensland, will be in operation by early Suutll Western 1957. The output from this dredge should land. local production and consumption of t in . However, there are no other developments d. d. taking place at present that would make any 210 189 148 appreciable addition to domestic production. 189 166 114 The tinplate plant, which is expected to com.165 137 84 mence production at Port Kembla in about 152 106 75 two years time, is likely to use about 1,000 tons of t in annually at the initia l capacity.

Which industries are affected, and -what, nre the names of the companies concerned? honourable member's questions is as follows : Some companies in Australia are understood to operate under arrangements -with overseas companies which affect in varying degree the freedom of the Australian company to export.
