This question has been debated in this chamber before, but in view of the early meeting of the Convention for the purpose of revising the Constitution, I think it should be raised again. This interference of the Senate with tbe financial legislation of the House of Representatives cannot be justified if the Senate is to be regarded as a States House guarding the rights of the States, unless behind each of these requested amendments there is some indication that the rights of a particular State are infringed.

That being so, if the Oommittee admit the right of the Senate to interfere in a financial matter, in which the rights or powers of a State are in no wise involved, we are admitting the right of the Senate to interfere with the financial policy of the Government, and are acceding to any claim that Chamber may ever have made to the supervision of our financial policy. about the entertainments tax? done nothing. I strongly hold the view that the Government is the custodian of and ought to fight for the privileges which the Constitution intended to confer on this Chamber. If , on any attack, we simply accept what is done in another place, and allow the control of this Chamber over the finances to be frittered away, we give to the Senate, with its unequal constitution, powers which, in the interests of the electors who send us here, we should most jealously conserve. the Government have assented, and I object to the Government assenting to a request by the Senate on a matter that in no way affects the rights of any State, but is a matter of financial policy. not raising any question as to the Senate's right to make these requests ? settled in 1902. settled wrongty in"" 1902; but I do not wish at this time, when the Constitution Convention is sonear at hand, to take up the time of the Committee by further discussing the point.

If it be accepted that the Senate has the same power as this House has to interfere with financial legislation, we must again question the constitution of that Chamber by equal State representation.

91,Mr Greene (Richmond,"Minister f o rspirits which the Australian manufacturer uses and the import duty which is paid hy *he importers of perfumery. There has been, side by side with the duty on perfumes and the Excise duty charged to the Australian 'manufacturer, an attempt by this Parliament to encourage the growth and development of a primary industry that is carried on in several parts of Australia, namely, the manufacture from various plants and flowers of those essential oils from . which perfumes are made. An attempt has been made by an adjustment in connection with the 'Excise duty to encourage the production of essential oils in Australia. When we were discussing the matter before, it was attempted to encourage the use of Australian essential oils by reducing still further the Excise duty to be paid on the spirit used by Australian perfumery manufacturers, if they used a certain proportion of Australian essential oils. As the Tariff was originally framed, encouragement was given in two ways to Australian manufacturers . of perfumery. The Australian manufacturers were allowed to get their spirit at a special rate of duty, and were charged duty at so much per liquid gallon instead of per proof gallon, provided that they used Australian essential oils in their perfumery. It was found in practice that the quantities of Australian essential oils obtainable were insufficient for the local industry, and that, therefore, this encouragement was of littl e advantage to it . Therefore, the manufacturers were given the advantage I have mentioned, provided that one-third of the essential oils they used were of Australian origin. As the spirit used is very much overproof, that gives an additional advantage. The Committee altered the proposals of the Government, making a reduction in the Excise duty on the liquid gallon for Australian manufacturers using Australian essential oils. have to be considered side by side in determining the amount of protection that is being given to this industry. Thei n dustry is a useful one, because the spirit that it uses is distilled from our primary products, and use is found for our essential oils, the production of which is in creasing. Prior to the war the perfumery made in this country consisted almost wholly of the cheaper kinds of scents, but during the war our manufacturers com[477] menced to make the more expensive perfumes. A t the outset they encountered difficulty, because none of the essential oils required for the. higher grades of perfumery were obtainable in this country. being commenced now. sent moment the production is wholly in sufficient for the industry. Australian manufacturers of the higher grades of perfumery cannot take advantage of the provision in the Tariff which allows the use of spirit at a lower rate of duty, charged per liquid gallon instead of per proof gallon, because they cannot comply with the requirement that they must use a certain proportion of Australian essential oils. They have, therefore, to pay the f u l l duty of 25s. per proof gallon. manufacturer could bring down the duty to 12s. cause unless spirit is used which is very much overproof, the essential oils w ill not amalgamate with it . ing by the provisions adopted by this House1 tial oils, about which the honourable member is concerned, are affected. A t present the manufacturer of the higher grades of perfumery has to pay 25s. per proof gallon on his spirit, because he cannot obtain the Australian essential oils that he needs.

The following memorandum, which has been carefully prepared by my officers, sets out the true position: _ In a letter addressed to the Department, and circulated also among honourable members, the following statement is made :The following duties were paid a few days ago on a shipment of. eau-de-cologne from France:21-oz. bottle, invoice value £21 6s. l i d . , duty £24 5s. 8d -112 J per cent.",26,Customs Tarif Fbill

Tbis statement implies that Australian manufacturers are protected in regard to the lines quoted to the extent of from 112* per cent, to 3174 per cent. This view ignores the fact that the Australian manufacturer has to pay Excise duty on his spirit and import duties on bottles, corks, containers, ribbons, and labels. The duty is also calculated at the general Tariff rate, whereas it is the position in regard to the British preferential Tariff that must be kept in view. The following statement shows the percentages represented by the fixed rates of 40s. and 50s. under British preferential Tariff and general Tariff on the one hand and the percentage represented on the other by the Excise duty alone, i.e., without giving any consideration to the duties the local manufacturer has to pay on his bottles, fancy boxes, labels, &c (1) Duty at British preferential Tariff.

In every case worked out in this statement the local manufacturer of perfumery is without protection under the present operatiou of the Excise duty. The matter was given careful consideration hy the Department, and the alteration requested by the Seriate, and, as a matter of fact, made at my instance, is in all the circumstances fair.

There is no protection to the local manufacturer under the item as it ' stands, and unless we agree to this request the importers will'be able to wipe out the industry. The request is a result of the investigation of invoices actually produced to the Department. ilr. RICHARD FOSTEB -We cannot get away fro m invoices, in which the effect of the duty is given in pounds, shillings, and pence. the honourable member, and the Minister has seen the invoices relating to importations actually made and showing the duty paid. shows that there is no protection as against the British manufacturer, and only a small measure of protection under the intermediate and general Tariffs. The Minister has done the right thing. says that we have a valuable industry producing high-class perfumery, and that it ought to be encouraged by means of a f a i r and reasonable measure of protection. I regret that, as the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Penton) has said, it would be impossible to sell the beautif u l perfumes made here, or for that matter any other high-class perfumes, if they were put in the class of bottles that aire manufactured in Australia. be put into high-class fancy bottles, and, unfortunately, at the present time such bottles are not being made here. As soon as they are I am sure the local manufacturers of perfumery will be glad to use them. mittee, has always been anxious to give reasonable protection to local manufacturers, and since it has been demonstrated conclusively that the Tariff as it l e f t this Chamber gave practically no protection to the manufacturers of high-class perfumes in Australia, the Minister invites us to agree to this request. I think the Committee will readily accept it . Again we have the cry that in order to encourage new industries in Australia we must have high duties. The Minister( Mr Greene) told us when the Tariff was before us on a previous occasion that, as the result of the heavy duties for'whic h it provided, we should have cheaper goods. Th'e fact is that these high duties have so increased prices that one wonders how the man in the back country w ill be able to carry on. Honourable members have been speaking of the great perfumery-making industry of Australia, but we find that practically everything used in the manufacture of perfumes, with the exception of water, is imported. We are told that one reason why this request should be agreed to is that perfumery bottles have to be imported, and are dutiable at a high rate. The corks and practically everything else used in the putting up of perfumery have also to be I agree with imported. When we discussed this duty some four months ago, the Tariff had been in operation for more than twelve months, and the Minister then told us, in moving The departmental investigation an amendment of the item, that his experience of its operation was that the ad valorem duty pressed heavily on the high grades of perfumed spirits, which were not manufactured in Australia. He He therefore asked for a re-arrangement of the item, which he said was necessary to protect the lower classes of manufacture in this country, would lead to a greater consumption, and would consequently produce more revenue. That was his opinion of the effect of the item'after it had been in operation for about fourteen months; hut as soon as the honourable gentleman showed his hand in this House by agreeing to an enormously increased duty on bananas, we had representatives High-class perfumes have to of the Chamber of Manufactures-whic h has been silent up to that point-as well as individual manufacturers, who up to that time had been quite satisfied with the duties imposed in the Tariff as introduced, besieging the House and making I submit that the Comdemand after demand for increased duties. The Minister gave way to this clamour, with the result that we have the present monstrous duties. The statements I have before me in regard to the effect of the duty on perfumed spirits came only from the importers of perfumery, and I cannot vouch for their accuracy; but I should like to know what will be the average duty paid when the ad valorem rates are added as proposed to the fixed duty.

What had the exchange to do with the price paid by the Canadian farmer for his reaper and binder? I say that in that matter the Minister misrepresented the position. may think so, but I am equally entitled to maintain that I did not misrepresent the position. plained, I am informed that, if the Senate's request in this matter be. agreed to, it will involve an increase in the duty of from 200 to 500 per cent. In a letter which I have here from a Melbourne firm, the statement is made that this proposal represents, in the case of a 2^-oz. bottle, a duty of 112$ per cent., and to indicate the accuracy of these figures I may say that the Minister has admitted that it represents a duty of 112£ per cent. On the 4^-oz. bottle, the duty will be 140 per cent.; on a 9-oz. bottle, 187 per cent.; on an 18-oz. bottle, 280 per cent.; and on a 36-oz. bottle, 317$ per cent. The Minister has himself pointed out that the imposition of such extreme duties must involve a loss of revenue which he does not desire to see brought about. ber say what is the ad valorem duty on brandy? I may inform him at once that it is about 600 per cent. In dealing with the articles now under consideration, the honourable member is really obam not putting figures on paper with a view to misrepresent the position.

The firm supplying me with those figures must accept responsibility for them. ber arguing against the amount of protection involved in the Senate's request or against the principle of Protection? the increase of these duties in the way proposed, merely for the purpose, and I shall speak plainly, of helping certain people starting an industry in a small way. The duty at first proposed by the Minister was in operation for twelve months. Because of certain representations made to him, the Minister changes his mind, and now proposes that on these articles there should be an ad valorem duty as well as the fixed duty previously imposed. The same thing is proposed in connection with cigars; but we shall come to them later. The Minister did not quote the report of the Inter-State Commission in regard to this matter. I specially direct the attention of the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) to it. man knows my opinion of the Tariff recommendations of the Inter-State Commission. reported, in 1914, on this subject, as follows :No particulars were afforded by manufacturers as to the local costs of production.

In spite of that report, we now have the Minister proposing an increase in the duty on these goods when only a little while ago he told us that he could not accept an increase because it would lead to a reduction of revenue."" I shall not waste time in submitting arguments in support of the Senate's request in this case. It is so reasonable t h a t : I am satisfied the Committee will agree to it. There is, however, a matter connected with this item to which I should like to refer. When we give adequate protection to an Australian industry, and it is fostered by that protection, those carrying it on should, in Common decency, distribute their products to the public as Australian-made articles. That is not done by those engaged in manufacturing perfumery in Australia. I have been engaged in the retail trade for many years, and prior to the war there was a German Eau de Cologne for sale which had practical control of the Australian market. As a result of the war, that article disappeared from the market, and we had patriotic Australian manufacturers making substitutes for it. They sent their commercial travellers around to the storekeepers of Australia'and sold their perfume to them as an old French Eau de Cologne dating back to 1648. It was put up in bottles and packages with lettering upon them in the French language, although the article was manufactured in Sydney. There should be a condition attaching to the imposition of these duties that the Australian-made article protected by them should be sold as an Australian manufacture. practice were adopted, the result would be to foster trade in Australian goods. When perfumes made in Australia are sold in the names of the German and French importations, which had the run of our market for so long, the effect of the Tariff is merely to enable the local manufacturers to make money, whilst it does nothing to create amongst Australians a desire to use Australian-made goods. The man who will prostitute business principles merely in order to be withdrawn from him. A man engaged in business has not the time to make these minute inquiries to discover where the goods offered to him are made. In the case of perfumery, storekeepers were invited to give their orders months ahead for the Christmas trade. They were told that because the goods had to be imported from France their orders must be' sent in early. The goods were being made in Sydney and Melbourne all the time, and that is the sort of thing of which I complain, and which should be put an end to. are sold here as F i j i bananas. that there are some people who would try to sell apples as F i j i bananas if it suited them, and they thought they could mislead the public. Manufacturers who"" engage in these practices should, in my opinion, not only be refused the protection of the Tariff, but should not be allowed to trade in Australia at all. They should be given only the King's protection in the gaols of Australia. Goods made in Australia need not fear competition with similar goods made elsewhere, and if the local manufacturers labelled their goods ""Made in Australia,"" one result would be to create a general desire for Australian-made goods. We should in this way be doing much to protect Australian industries from foreign competition. I believe that the people of Australia are sufficiently patriotic to prefer to purchase goods made in Australia if they are at all equal to similar goods manufactured elsewhere. This is a difficult and complicated matter, If that and without attempting to elucidate a question upon which I am not myself too clear, I wish to impress upon the Minister that we should be careful to do nothing that might interfere with our friendly relations and trade with France. I agree that what we can do to encourage Australian industries should be done.

At present we are losing thousands of tons of fruit every year which might be profitably used if that industry were established. It could be worked in conjunction with the perfume industry. At present we are making a well-known perfume in Australia from the eucalyptus. I am not referring to eucalyptus oil, but to a recognised perfume that is made from the eucalyptus. There are many plants in Australia which might be turned to good account in this way. I have seen in Australia a number of imported plants, which it is not generally known are to be found here. The export of some of them from the countries in which they are indigenous is prohibited, yet I have seen them growing in Australia. This industry is in its infancy, but will doubtless become a very valuable, one, and, as I say, find ample employment for those who are unable to do hard work. ment for' thousands, once it is properly understood. amongst the gentler sex. ""When the men aTe doing the hard work of the orchard, the girls can do the lighter work of growing plants for perfume. Instead of the present waste, thousands of citrus trees will be turned to account. month I was in one of the great citrus districts of Australia, and I visited one orchard, the proprietor of which had been injured in the back country and rendered unfit for further station work. He pointed to some 6 acres of eight-year-old lemon trees, which were carrying a magnificent crop. When I asked him as to his returns from the land in this particusider Australians, and not the people of lar connection, he told me that he .could make a very comfortable living, but that that was about all he could say. added that there was not much real hard work, and what had to be done could be spread over his own time. As to the lemons on the trees, he told me that he was going to plough them all in, because the price' of lemons at present did not pay for the picking and sending, to market. If the particular industry under discussion can be established in Australia, every lemon will be picked and sent to the factory, In the citrus orchard and will, at least, realize enough to make their cultivation a paying proposition. Of course, when the price* of lemons is good for their usual purposes, still better returns will be obtained. the industry should not require protection. been showing, they do require some protection. The lemon peel is well worth handling, and then there is acid production, and quite a number of incidental developments. All that can be done with safety for this industry should be done, and in such a way as not to lessen the trade between here and France. In my opinion we can continue our trade with that country without a prohibitive Tariff; we can allow high-class perfumes to come in on a reasonable basis, and at the same time, under the Excise law, encourage local production in such a way as to establish the iudustry on a firm basis. Mr .MATHEWS (Melbourne Ports) [4.23] -It is Temarkable in an Australian House of Parliament to hear a member so careful of the interests of the French people. France, have you?

In the present case we are told that the industry is a mere mixing business, but we have to consider the many and varied interests connected with it, and' I may say that in France and Germany whole towns and districts are devoted to the manufacture of perfumes. We hear a great deal of talk from honourable members opposite about the ""poor farmer"" and the "" poor little children "" of Australia, and it is a wonder we have not had the ""poor old widow'' dragged in. Personally, I have never bought any scent in my life, even for my ""best g i r l "" ; the proper thing ""to do is to wash oneself and leave perfumes alone; at any rate, those who demand perfumes ought to be made to pay for them. I am sorry that the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) is not present, for I am sure he would, as usual, be very pathetic and sentimental about the "" poor farmer""; but I should say that .this is an industry in which the farmer is as much interested as anybody else. I do not suggest that' the farmer uses perfumes, or has any need to do so, but the fact that all the ingredients are"" produced from the land gives him an interest. I hope the Minister( Mr Greene) will be quite as explanatory on every item as he has been in regard to this. The honourable gentleman's explanation ought to be sumcient to settle the question at once. The honourable member is a Free Trader, who .does not believe in encouraging manufacturing in Australia, but would rather import cheap and nasty commodities. Minister in succeeding items will have more satisfactory results from hi3 explanations; at any rate, the explanation in regard to this item -was so clear and concise that it has raised the ire of those opposed to Australian manufactures. The farmer of Australia ought to be ashamed of the men who represent him, for they simply make him ridiculous. I hope that the Minister's proposal will be agreed «to. The industry is in its initial stage, and requires time for development. produced here were not all that might be desired, but the opportunities given by the war enabled those in the industry to make enormous progress in the quality and value of their product.

This is a somewhat similar amendment to the last, and arises out of a similar reason, namely, the difference between the amount of Excise duty which the Australian manufacturer has to pay and the amount of import duty. What is requested by the Senate is to strike out of the item medicines and toilet preparations, with a view to inserting them in items 2S5 and 290. If honourable members turn to requests number 60 and 62 they will see exactly what the effect of the requested amendment is. They will see that medicines and toilet preparations are brought under an ad, valorem rate instead of a fixed rate. I do not know me. that I need go into the matter fully at this moment. It was found on a comparison of the rate which the importer was paying under this item with the rate of spirit Excise which the Australian manufacturer had to pay on the spirit he used, the Customs were charging the Australian manufacturer more Excise so. than the amount of protection given him. The requested amendment makes no difference in the rate of duty, but merely has the effect I have indicated. Motion agreed to.

The industry is nourishing, but, at the same time, it is open to comextinction by the importation of blackpetition from the adjacent islands, where the banana is grown by black labour. In regard to the question asked a few moments ago by the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster) as to whether the higher duty had increased the price to the consumer, I have not the slightest doubt that, before this debate closes, particulars will be furnished the Committee to. prove that since the increased duty was imposed the price of bananas in the markets has ibeen less than for many years previously. will buy them. there has been an enormous increase in the number of bananas produced. substantial increase of production having occurred since this House imposed the duty of 8fe. 4d. per central. ber may not be aware that a large number of the banana plantations have come into bearing for the first time during the last nine months. come into .bearing if the duty had not been increased? the increase in the duty was responsible for the lower price at which the bananas were sold. that since the duty was increased the production had increased considerably. during the last few months a number of plantations have come into bearing for the first time. For instance, from Coolangatta Station, in Queensland, in the third week in August, six times as many bananas were sent away as were despatched during the corresponding week of the previous year, and that increase was entirely due to the fact that a large area that had been planted"" with bananas last year had come into bearing. not require encouragement through the Tariff? were not required to bring those plantations into bearing; but the fact that we have a flourishing and extending industry shows the necessity for preventing its grown bananas. laid out those plantations know that their product would be competing against black-grown bananas? But during the war, when 'the importation of bananas from F i j i was practically discontinued, prices rose higher than ever before, and banana cultivation in Australia received a tremendous impetus. Adelaide state that everybody wants bananas, but nobody will pay the price for them. munerative prices every banana they pro1 duced, and I cannot imagine fruiterers buying those bananas unless they were able to sell the fruit at a profit. Owing to the encouragement which the bananagrowing industry received during the war, a very large number of primary producers are growing bananas, and the market is fully supplied. The obstacle with which they have to contend is not the number of bananas imported in the course of a year, but the fact that large shipments come to Australia at a given time, temporarily destroying entirely the market for the local article. Australian growers who send their bananas to the market at such a period-and bananas must be marketed when they are readystrike an overloaded market, and get practically nothing for their fruit. If that were allowed to continue, it would not be long before the number of banana plantations would be reduced, and many men would be driven off the soil.

193,Mr Mackay (Lilley) [ 5 . 2 ],"The total quantities of bananas marketed by the company during the months May to August inclusive, 1920, and during .the corresponding period in the current year are as follow:1920. ' May June. . 2,455 „ July August .. 2,297 „ .. 9,421 „ Total .. 9,154 cases .. 30,586 cases These figures represent an increase in production in one year of 234 per cent. The relative market values of the entire quantity of fruit sold through the company for the period of six weeks both prior and subsequent to the imposition of the increased Tariff are as follow:-Six weeks prior to increase, 10,342 cases realized £11,829 10s -22s . lOd. per case average; six weeks subsequent to increase, 11,190 cases realized £11,903 4s. 6d -21s . 3d. .per case average. The difference in values for fruit sold during the calendar months prior and subsequent »to that in whioh the Tariff was imposed is still more marked, being 22s. 6d. per case for tlie month of April, and 19s. 4d. per case for the month of June. Since the Tariff was increased values have consistently declined, and the average value at time of writing is about 13s. per case. Had the Fiji fruit been arriving on the markets in the customary way, it would probably have been found impossible to dispose of large quantities of both the Australian and F i j i products at any price. With reference to the opinion expressed in quarters hostile to the Tariff that the Commonwealth is unable to produce sufficient bananas for her requirements, I may say that my directors, who can claim to have a sound practical knowledge of the various phases of the industry, consider that the question of over-production has to be faced in the very near future. This matter has been engaging their serious attention for some months' past, and practical steps, have already.been taken towards an endeavour to cope with the situation when it arises, if we are not entirely faced with it. (Sgd.) Honourable members will notice that for the four months mentioned there was an increase of 21,432 oases, and the writer of the communication points out that this may be taken as fairly representative of the general average increase in production in the two States during that period. desire now to refer to the quantity of bananas at present arriving in Melbourne. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr been for some time. Richard Foster) has said, by that there has been a shortage of this fruit in South Australia; but the figures I have before me showing the weekly consignments reaching the Melbourne disclose that for the first week of the pre-sent year 2,421 cases arrived bourne, and that the total number of Ur.

Now that the growers have the market to themselves they are despatching supplies with the greatest confidence, and any one who has been around Melbourne or Sydney streets must admit that the price of the f r u it is extremely moderate. nj ember admits that they have now the market to themselves, and that .there is an embargo on importations? the fact that bananas from Java are coming into Western Australia.

Many misleading statements have been made, particularly in another place, concerning the price at which the f r u it is being sold. The growers have no control over the price at which it is disposed of, because it is consigned to their representative in Melbourne, who distributes it to the various agents.

Tn the measure provision is made whereby any one who wishes to engage in the banana-growing business shall submit to a' dictation test. It is very evident that the Queensland Government are anxious to make this industry a white man's industry, and to do all they can to prevent foreigners engaging in it. The Queensland Minister saidThere was an additional reason why they should get this legislation on the statute book at the earliest possible date, in order to prove to the Federal Parliament-particularl y the Senate-tli e taxpayers, and consumer that they were determined to keep the industry white. He hoped that the House of Eepresentatives would not reduce* the Tariff as suggested by tha Senate, because a duty of 8s. 4(1. per central would encourage the growers to establish themselves in Queensland and in New South Wales.

As I said on a previous occasion, a great deal of the money advanced for the repatriation of soldiers has been spent in establishing men on banana plantations, and as the plants take only about eighteen months to develop', much of the land is now coming into production. There has been a remarkable increase in the area under cultivation, and thousands of acres are still available for banana-growing. I cannot imagine any returned man preferring to settle in F i j i instead of in Australia. The duty will stabilize the banana industry, and in the future there will be plenty of bananas available for local consumption; indeed, the production will be so great . that it will be necessary to export some of the fruit. prices in the Australian market. Even now we are sending bananas to New Zealand. It is not intended to penalize the banana-growers in F i j i ; it is the speculators there who dre hit by the duty. In the last issue of Nickos, a journal published in Brisbane in the interests of the fruit industry, a correspondent writes:When I was in Fiji recently I was surprised at the conditions prevailing there. I was told that all the banana exporters were only dealers urgent, steps be taken to deal with the matwho bought the fruit as cheaply as they could from the natives, paying from 7d. to 2s. a bunch, and 2s. 6d. to 3s. a case for the fruit on the river bank.

The duty has already had beneficial effects. Not only has it increased production in Queensland and New South Wales, but I learn on the authority of the Customs officials, and have heard from representatives of Western Australia, that banana plants have been sent to Western Australia, so that within a short time that State will be growing bananas for itself. The following is a resolution passed by the Country party in the Queensland Parliament; and I understand that a copy of it has been sent to the Leader of the Country party here. I quote it in the hope that members of the Commonwealth Country party may realize that it is just as important to protect the growers of bananas in Queensland and New South Wales as to protect those engaged ' in industries in Victoria and the other States:This will insure reasonable That the Federal Government bo approached with a view of getting the full protection in the banana industry, as moved in the House of Representatives. Further, in view of the legislation which is being passed by the Queensland Government, which practically makes the banana industry a white-man industry, and such policy is part of the Federal Constitution, we think that a full measure of protection should be granted to the banana industry. That the above motion be sent to the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Country party, the Leader of the Opposition, and the President of the Senate, asking them that, as the matter is ter at once.

He was asked whether such a federation would not tend further to sever Australia's connection with the islands. "" F i j i is not thinking of that aspect,"" he reties are brought in commencing about April, plied, ""and this is hardly to he wondered at m view of the very unfriendly policy of the Australian authorities towards Fiji and all other islands. We have so long had to put up with hostile Tariffs and irritating restrictions on ,our produce, not to speak of strikes that delay our steamers, that we have grown sick of Australia's treatment. It is not for me to question the wisdom of the Commonwealtli Parliament in imposing a tremendously heavy duty on our bananas, for instance, but do Australians realize that where our people sold their bananas they bought their goods? They sell their bananas in New Zealand now., and they are purchasing their requirements there. Our trade with Australia was worth, roughly, £1,000,000 a year, and with New Zealand about £250,000, but New Zealand's trade will show a great advance nest year. The feeling is growing in Fiji that we must strike out for ourselves, so we have established a direct service with England that cuts out Australia. Just before my departure from Suva, the first steamer under the new contract left with 5,000 tons of copra, and it will come back also vi& Panama full of goods from England. worth of machinery for our electric light plant in Suva. The last plant was purchased in Australia, but such is tlic resentment against Australia's treatment of us that this timewe decided to import direct from England."" The honourable member for Lilley( Mr experience, the importers in this State recogMackay) has stated that ""an attempt is nise that the importation of bananas from being made to grow bananas in Western position, owing to the fruit deteriorating in Australia. practically impossible to get Queensland to be a very real risk against which thc imbananas. Limited, two of the leading f r u it merchants there, sayWe have many times endeavoured to import Furthermore, there bananas from the eastern States, but without success. The distance is too far for the fruit Persons connected with to carry, and the cost too great to enable thc people to buy them. During the past few years we have interested ourselves in thc Java trade, and now have a considerable amount of capital invested in it. This has enabled us to provide a good outlet for Western Australian fresh fruit. Take grapes, for instance. Previously we havo exported a few hundred cases MrH . M . Scott, KC , who has each year. This year we have sent out about 3,000 cases, obtaining high prices for the Western Australian grower. We would »point out that it is only because we are reciprocating by taking their goods that we are able to do this. The new duty of ld. per lb. is too heavy to allow of the successful importation of bananas from Java, which is the only practical source of supply; consequently we fear the loss of It is as our investments. Wc would like to point out that during a considerable portion of the year bananas are the principal fruit of the people, and this impost is likely to rob them of this fruit. This is serious as regards young children. During the glut season of VVestern Australian fruit, when soft fruits are in, very few bananas are imported, but large quantiwhen the only local fruits available are apples and oranges, with .a few pears. The restriction of the importation of bananas will not in any way affect the price of these fruits, which is always high during this period, but it will have a bad effect on all fruit shops, as this is one of their principal lines. Wo would ask you to use every endeavour to obtain a reduction in this rate, or at least exempt Western Australia. A letter I have received from, anotber source statesWe learn from the Customs Department that a duty of ld. per lb. on all bananas grown overseas is now in operation throughout Australia. We wish to draw your attention to the serious position in which it places the whole of the residents of Western Australia. As you are no doubt aware, the following towns, viz.:-Derby, Broome, Port Hcdland, Point Samson, and Onslow, are for a great part of the year without any fruit at all, except that received from Java. These ports are supplied by the Joint Service boats, one about For example, it will bring £15,000 every two to three weeks, the bulk of fruit being bananas. Up to tiie present no one has been successful in growing bananas on a commercial basis in Western Australia, consequently tlie gold-fields and agricultural towns are supplied from Perth and Fremantle with fruit also grown, at Java. From many years* Queensland or Sydney is not a commercial proThat State has found -it transit. This, in actual practice, is proved Messrs. H . J. and. F. Simper porter has no redress. We feel that we'are on safe ground in saying that, sliould bananas be absolutely prohibited from entering Australia, Queensland growers cannot, now or at any future date, supply Western Australia with bananas. The reason is that the fruit is of a delicate nature, and the distance from the source of supply is too great to avoid heavy losses. This is accentuated by the many delays in transit, caused by ships calling at Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. You are aware that our company (consisting of all local shareholders) has been trading between Fremantle, Java, and Singapore for the last eight years, and during that time has been the means of shipping a very large portion of Westralian fresh fruit, flour, and other products to these markets., It has been said that man cannot live on bread alone, nor can he subsist merely on bananas. '""Western Australia, as well as Queensland, has big interests. producer? do that. If I were speaking selfishly, I would go for a high Tariff. That might be good on party lines, but I wish to get as far away from those lines as possible. The duty suggested by the Senate is quite high enough for the protection of this industry. According to the Minister's own statement, the industry developed to a huge extent in Queensland before this protection was offered it . Now there is to be almost a prohibitive Tariff directed against the f r u it of a friendly country which is a British Territory.' We are professing to have a fatherly interest in F i j i , the reduction in duty suggested by the and we are going to point out at the Washington Conference how careful White Australia is in looking after the interests of black Polynesia. We cannot live without trading with the people of the Pacific. We have £7,000,000 worth of trade with France, and' we buy from that country goods to the value of only £1,000,000, yet we are endeavouring to manufacture perfumes in Australia by the aid of a Tariff which w ill exclude the French product. It would be better to take advantage of the natural potentialities of our country, and extend a little reciprocity in connection with an industry which has been peculiar to France for centuries. We cannot be surprised if , in pursuing such a policy, we find other people building up walls of reprisal against us. It is natural for the people in the Pacific Islands 'to grow bananas, and yet there are members in this House who seem to suggest that those people should be starved. There is a huge principle involved in the question of the duty on bananas. I support the reduction suggested by the Senate, and think it ought to give reasonable protection. The Minister said the production of bananas had already increased rapidly in Australia, but it shows that the people who undertook the project without a Tariff knew what they were doing. The very costliness of some of the banana-growing lands, which have fetched up to £150 an acre, indicates that there is money in the industry. I do not favour excessive costs for anything. The attitude adopted by the House will shut out interests in a way that w ill simply make the Budget of the Federal Treasury the most difficult in Australia. It means killing our own goose that is laying the golden eggs. When I was living in Queensland twenty-one years ago the banana trade was thriving. then. The honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) has already told us that Queensland bananas are being sold in New Zealand. It seems to be a sin for Australia to get anything cheaply. Notwithstanding all the protection that seems to be necessary for Queensland traders, they are able to send their goods to New Zealand against all competitors, and they say they are doing very well. Senate. When the matter was before the House recently I opposed the duty of l d . per l b . , which works out at about 4d. per dozen for good-sized bananas, and if we bring the duty down to ^d. it amounts to 2d. a dozen. As I previously stated, from my experience of the retail f r u it trade, there is a fairly long period in South Australia, as there is in Western Australia, when for variety in f r u it the people depend largely on the banana. Many of the poorer people purchase a few oranges and bananas once a week for a salad'for the Sunday evening meal. Knowing that f r u it is one of the finest foods for mankind, I am opposed to any duty being put on which would keep it off the market. My .district is the principal fruit-growing area in South Australia, and if 1 spoke purely fro m a parochial view-point I would be advocating as high a duty as I could possibly obtain, so as to leave the market free for the f r u it grown in my own district.

The retailer gets a fair deal when he can deal direct with the growers, and the consumers also benefit; but the retailer who is compelled to buy from the packers finds himself very much at their mercy. When I heard the honourable member for Lilley( Mr used to be to the grocer. There is very Mackay) inform the Committee a little while ago that the price of prime bananas in Sydney quite recently was 17s. per crate, and that inferior bananas were at the time unsaleable, I went into the Library and had a glance at the Adelaide papers.

I cannot think that the agent in Adelaide who informed the honourable member that two months ago there was a glut of bananas on the Adelaide market, and that it could not do with another 2,000 cases, was telling the truth, because at that time there was room in the city for a big supply of bananas at anything like a reasonable price, particularly if they could be quoted at the rate of eighteen for 6d., at which, according to the photographs in possession of the honourable member for Lilley, they were being sold in Sydney the other day. In my experience, the price of this fruit has put not altered very much in Adelaide. Bananas were dear years ago; they are still dear. The only way out of the difficulty is to get growers to cut out the middleman. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse), evidently expressing the views of a middleman in Western Australia, said that bananas were one of the profitable lines of the retailer. His statement was contrary to facts. The banana to the greengrocer is like sugar little profit in selling it, but it is necessary to cai'ry stocks in order to meet customers' needs. in connection with bananas? than I made oub of them. If a man could get at a reasonable cost a line that had ripened loo speedily to' suit the packer's plan, he could sell as many as he could secure, and make a good profit on them, but no one could make a reasonable profit out of fruit kept closely under the control of packers. I shall vote against high duties on bananas. I shall be pleased to see evidence of the fact' that the Queensland growers are about to go into the business of meeting the retailer direct. If they do so in Adelaide, it will be a good business deal on their part. I think that I was the only Western Australian representative who supported the increased duty on bananas when the Tariff was before the Committee on a previous occasion, and I did so because, a few weeks previously, I had seen official reports concerning the prospects of growing bananas in the north-west of Western Australia.

That is to say, we were sending to F i j i quite double, if not more than double, the value of the products which we were receiving from that place. It is our duty as members of this National Parliament to do all we can to create a feeling of friendship with the peoples of the Pacific Islands, and to make them believe that Australia would be their futur e friend, as well as their chief market. In sending a delegate to the Washington Conference we are claiming a voice in matters pertain ing to the Pacific. The actions of the Government, so f a r as concerns our trade with F i j i , are proving injurious from the stand-point of statesmanship, and costly fro m the economic point of view. We are losing our trade associations with F i j i , and before long we shall be able to say the same, unfortunately, of our relations with Java. Java has been buying from Australia more than double the value of the goods which we have been purchasing from that country. It may be said, of course, that it pays Java to trade with us; but, even so, if Australia shows that she does not want to trade with Java, there are bound to be reprisals. AlreadyF i j i has informed us that she does not want to have anything more to do with"" us commercially. But we must find and keep markets for t h e export of our goods."" I had been hopeful of seeing the expansion of considerable trade, in the matter of flour, fruits, and cattle, between Western Australia and the islands and peoples generally of the north and east; but now we must look for reprisals, and is it all worthwhile ? The Minister( Mr Greene) has provided statistics indicating the considerable growth of the banana industry in Australia. All this added production occurred, however, during the years when the duty was lower than that which has now been enforced. nothing but the war, which led to the development of the Australian banana industry. our trade with F i j i during the war years, and since. In 1915-16 Australia imported 310,000 centals of bananas; in the following year, 386,000 centals; during the year afterwards, only 225,000 centals; and, in 1918-19, 122,000 centals. there was a still more considerable f a l l. importations' of bananas from F i j i were due to tornadoes, which devastated the banana plantations. F i j i had practically no bananas to export. that factor. that the Australian industry was built up. ber for Perth( Mr Fowler) ascribes the expansion of the Australian industry to the fact that tornadoes prevented the ex1 port of bananas from F i j i , whilst the r Minister advances, as the reason, "" t h e war, and nothing but the war."" reason than either of those. The Tariff was before this House for twelve months, and the Australian growers knew that they would be expected to afford proof that they could supply sufficient bananas to meet the demands of the Australian market. For that reason they planted largely, and those plants are now coming into bearing. the greatest surprise afforded throughout the whole period of the Consideration of the Tariff was when the Minister accepted the amendment of the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) in respect of the duty .on bananas. I am convinced that the increased duty was secured by the merest accident; and, as for the contention that the Australian banana-growers are now supplying Australia's requirements, I know that they are not fulfillin g the demands from Western Australia, and that they cannot do so. In 1919-20-the latest year in respect of which I have been able to secure statistics-the total number of centals received by Western Australia was only 619. months the Australian growers of bananas have been sending to Western Australia as many as 700 cases a week. secure reliable figures covering as recent a period as that., Sitting suspended from 6.29 to 8 p.m. the people of Western Australia to obtain bananas from Queensland except at high rates, and without suffering heavy losses.

276,Mr Gregory,"It is impossible f o rhear the statement made by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Burchell) in regard to the attitude taken up by certain business people in his constituency. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse), when this question was before us on a previous occasion, read letters dated 27th May of this year; in which certain f r u it and produce merchants carrying on business in Perth pointed out that at considerable expense they had built up a trade w i th the islands to the north and countries to the east in connection with the banana industry. In 'a letter to me, one of these firms, writing in May last, stated thatDuring the past few years we have interested ourselves in the Java trade, and now have a considerable amount of capital invested in it. This has enabled us to provide a. good outlet for Western Australian fresh fruit. Take grapes, for instance. Previously we have exported a few hundred cases each year; this year we have sent out about 3,000 cases, obtaining high prices for the Western Australian grower. We would point out that it is only because we are reciprocating hy taking their goods that we are able to do this. The new duty of ld. per lb. is too heavy to allow of the successful importation of bananas from Java, which is the only practical source of supply. Consequently we fear the loss of our investments. I wish to emphasize the point that this trade between Java and Western tralia has been built up only as the result of our taking bananas from that The trade that Western Australia is doing with the islands to the north is three times as great as that which they are doing with us. We have established in and around the southern portions of Western tralia a big fruit industry, and the Java market for that fruit will be destroyed unless we are able in return to import bananas from that country. the people along the north-west coast of Western Australia to get fresh fruit if this supply be cut off 1 Surely those who are trying to develop that part of the continent-the von, Roeburne, Bar, Broome, and many other places-are deserving of some consideration. telegram 'a little while ago to the then Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Wise), pointing out that he was able to allow tram rails to come in free of duty under the heading: of machine tools and appliances, and asking him whether bananas could not be classified as a medicine, and allowed as such to come in free Mr Gregory. of duty. He was not prepared, however, to entertain that proposal. If we could induce people to settle in the tropical parts of Western Australia, there is no doubt that bananas and other tropical fruits would ultimately be grown there. So far, however, we have not been able to do so. Mr Despeissis, a specialist who was apv pointed by bhe Western Australian Government to visit that part of the State, reported that it comprised big areas of very rich land w it h a splendid rainfall. In and around the Kimberleys there is some of the finest country in Australia; but the temperature is bad. and we shall have difficulty in settling that part of the country. Until we can induce people to produce bananas in^the tropical parts of Western Australia, the Parliament should not be prepared to impose a duty of l d . per lb. on this f r u it . In the far-distant parts people have very little in the way of good fresh fruits, and it is essential that they should obtain a supply of bananas. Are they to wait until the people of whom the honourable member for Fremantle has spoken have» their plantations going? I very much doubt the advisability of handing over Western Australia's banana supply to those who have been enr deavouring to build up this trade. They are wholesalers and retailers, and I do Ausnot know whether, if these plantations were developed, the people would be better island. 'supplied than they are at present. The development of the country should, of course, be encouraged, but this heavy duty is absolutely unjustifiable. The Minister knows that great losses are suffered in conAusnexion with the shipment of bananas from Java to Fremantle. The duty of 8s. 4d. per central has to be paid on a f u l l consignment, and it is quite possible that, having Where are regard to .the wastage that takes place, it may amount to 10s. or 15s. per central in respect of the marketable bananas actually delivered. I object to the duty as passed by the Committee, and hope that the repeople in and about Carnarquest made by another place will be Port Hedland, Marble agreed to. It offers a fair compromise. The duty accepted by this Committee abI sent a solutely astounded the people. It is preposterously high, and it has done us in finite harm. I hope that the good sense of the Committee w ill lead to the request for a reduction of that duty being agreed to, so that the people of Western Australia, by whom this f r u it is badly needed, will be able to obtain it at something like a moderate price. Customs Tariff be regretted that the majority of honourable members have gained .their knowledge of bananas and the banana-growing industry from f r u it shops and f r u it trucks. If they were to visit Queensland or the northern rivers of New South Wales, and see'the industry as it is carried on there, they would realize what a great asset it is, not only to the districts in which the f r u it is grown, b u t to the whole of the Commonwealth. Despite what the honourable member for Perth( Mr Fowler) has said, we have in Queensland vast areas suited to the production of bananas. It may not be known that bananas are grown as f a r north as Cooktown. It is true that few, if any, of the bananas grown, in the northern part of Queensland reach the southern markets, but that is due solely to shipping difficulties. The steamship Levuka, which was built specially for the banana trade between F i j i and Sydney, has during the last three or four months been on the No r t h Queensland run. has put her in commission there for the tourist traffic, and there is every hope that she w ill ultimately be used for the carriage of bananas from North Queensland ports as f a r South as Sydney. When that takes place, there w ill be no furthe r talk as to the impossibility of Queensland and the Northern Eiver districts of New South Wales supplying the whole of the Australian market in bananas. Western Australia. some difficulty in so f a r as that State is concerned. Thank Heaven, however, all the people of Western Australia are not pessimists. It was a positive joy to hear the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr will not be purchased by the average in Burchell) speak as he did. He gives us a ray of hope that the people of Western Australia w ill t r y to help themselves in regard to the banana industry. The honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) said that incalculable damage had been done Australia by the imposition of the duty of l d . per l b . If , however, the imposition of that duty has induced the two firms mentioned by the honourable member for Fremantle to embark on the industry in Western Australia, then it can only be said that it has done incalculable good. The objections raised to the duty as passed by this Committee some months ""jl'A OCTOBER, 1921.] BiU. 11965 It is to ago are based very largely on 'the fact that middlemen have been able to make large profits out of the industry. The honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay), when addressing himself to the question earlier this afternoon, mentioned that it is necessary to cut bananas while they are in a more or less green state in order that they may be placed on the southern market in sound condition, and that, because of this, the marketing of them could not be handled by the growers direct. The' green bananas are bought up *by men known in the trade as ""ripeners,"" who store them, and place them on the market when they become fit for consumption. The honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) was bitter in his denunciation of the middlemen and the profits which they take unto themselves. He expressed the hope that the time would soon come when the Queensland growers would co-operate and place their f r u it upcn the market by means of their own direct agencies. I should like honourable The company operating that vessel members to realize that a co-operative movement of that kind cannot be entered upon u n t i l the growers .are assured of a steady market. In the past they have not had that assurance. They knew that any day a shipment of bananas from F i j i might reach Sydney simultaneously with a large consignment from Queensland, with the result that the market would be glutted, and the return would not pay them for the cost of conveying the f r u it to that city. If the duty passed by this Committee be retained, however, the growers will be assured of a reasonable I admit that there is return for their labour. They are not unmindful of the fact that should the price of bananas go beyond a certain point the general public will cease to buy them. There is a price beyond which bananas dividual.. Rather than pay such a price, he would spend his money in buying some other f r u it , such as Tasmanian apples. We should not forget 'that the Tariff Board w ill have all these matters under supervision, and should it be proved to its satisfaction that the growers are unduly "" bulling "" the market, Parliament w ill be informed, and we shall have an -opportunity to prevent it . The honourable member for Swan dealt with F i j i as well as with Java, and lamented that our trade with F i j i has fallen off in a marked degree.

The made-up garments are to bear practically the same duty as is imposed on the material defined by pattern or design for manufacture into apparel. I was shown in Sydney material called Cooltex, of which many of these garments are made, and the manufacturers complained that the raw material is subject to almost the same duty as is imposed on the made-up garment. for Trade and Customs) [9.131 -The honourable member has been wrongly informed. The materials that are imported for manufacture into corsets are piece goods, and are not defined by pattern or design for manufacture into apparel. The articles to which the honourable member refers are nearly complete garments. The object of subjecting them to the full apparel duty was to insure'that as much of the work as possible would be done in this country, and that the garments -should be made up right from the piece goods. Corsets are made from piece goods, which are admitted free of duty. [9.14""] I remind the Committee that the representations regarding the' extent of the Australian manufacture of corsets are so much nonsense, and there is not likely bo be any material increase of local manufactures. The higher-grade corset is not made in the Commonwealth at all. The proposed duty is good for revenue purposes, and that is its only redeeming feature. It is not fair to lead the community to think that the new corset-making industry will supply the requirements of Australia straight away. I was not aware that corset3 were being manufactured in Australia in any quantity, because when I left the trade it was impossible to purchase an Australianntade article that could be sold over the counter to the average purchaser. I do not know what development has taken place in the last eighteen months or two years, but at the time of which I speak the wholesale houses were not handling any Australian-made corsets. If the article submitted by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), which is priced at 42s., is the Only type that can be produced, it cannot be expected to meet with a ready sale, because the wife or daughter of the average working man would not be in a position to purchase at what is practically a prohibitive price. Years ago retailers were selling Canadian corsets at 3s. l i d . and 4s. l i d . per pair; but they are not procurable to-day owing to the altered conditions. Speaking from memory, I believe the highest price ruling towards the end of the war was from 102s. to 108s. per dozen; but now it is possible to procure only three pairs for an amount which would previously purchase a dozen pairs. I do not feel disposed to oppose a duty if there is an industry in Australia which is iu a position to meet all our requirements;, but before givingthe Minister's proposal my support I would like to have some guarantee in that direction. Of course, there are some women in our community who would willingly pay 42s., and who would not care if a duty of 200 per cent, were imposed. If the Australian manufacturers can p""lace their corsets on the market at a price at which they can easily be purchased by all sections, I am in favour of an adequate protective duty being levied; but up to the present I have not seen any indication of that being done. If the manufacturers in Australia have made such rapid strides that they can meet the demands of the people of Australia when previously they could not supply anything, it is a wonder that their product is not more readily obtainable. I have been under the impression that the only Australian-made corsets available were tailored or hand-made articles, and if there are others being manufactured in any quantity I would be pleased to hear of it. I believe in adequate protection to all Australian industries; but I regard it as a misguided policy to protect one or two small industries and enable those conducting them to become wealthy at the expense of the purchasers. That is what would happen in this instance. Judging from my past experience I cannot, without proof, accept the statement that the Australian manufacturers can supply the requirements of the wives and daughters of working men at a reasonable price.",54,Maloney Banana S Are Now Benefit Of The Information Placed At My

I support this Australian industry. [9.42] -If the Minister( Mr Greene) will not make a more reasonable compromise, I must support the suggestion of the Senate. The proposed duty would impose an outrageous and unjustifiable burden on almost every home in Australia. Only a few countries excel in the manufacture of corsets. The trade is very different from what it was five or ten years ago. For hygienic purposes, there is a class of goods manufactured to-day that is enoi'monsly costly compared 'with those of pre-war days and the old style of corsets. duty ? time. opposed it unsuccessfully. even the lowest type of corset manufactured here, there is an insignificant supply of the locally-made article to meet the demands of Australia. We should not put on a duty of 40 per cent, or 50 per cent, when this country will not manufacture the higher class of corset, perhaps, for the next ten years. The duty is simply , a revenue-producing one, and the revenue thus raised often comes out of homes which can ill-afford to pay it. The Minister has provided for a'Tariff Board, and for machinery for the investigation of the operations of this Tariff. It is for the purpose of showing whether the people are unduly imposed upon, whether a growing industry is being strangled for want of generous treatment, or whether the protection already afforded is too high. As the Board will soon be in operation, I hope the Minister will be a little more considerate, at all events, to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom and America are the countries where the best corsets are manufactured. duty last time. under the impression that I did; but I did let a good many items go through because of the mad, unreasonable attitude of honourable members on the question of Protection. I certainly spoke in favour of making corsets in this country, because I want to see as many goods manufactured here as possible, but there is a limit to the price that the people can pay. [9.46] Like the Minister( Mr Greene) I was somewhat surprised to hear the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster) say that he opposed the duty, because I remember well that he voted for it. The Senate set out deliberately to assist the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) to injure this industry., HonotrabUe members in another place must have known that the proposed 15 per cent, duty against the United Kingdom might as well have been wiped oub altogether.

Australia ought to be able to manufacture corsets for itseK. We cannot, of course, supply the quantity of manufactured goods required in Australia, and it is simply because we have not given manufacturers the opportunity to produce sufficient. Does any honourable member think that people with money will put hundreds of thousands of pounds into an industry without any hope of getting it protected? I heard the debate on this item in another place. Many honourable senators are like the honourable member for Dampier. They have no use for Australian made goods.

335,Mr Mathews (Melbourne Ports),"has to be bolstered up by a high protective duty; but he must kuow that it is impossible for any Australian manufacturer to compete in the corset-making industry under a protective duty of 15 per cent. A t the end of any season in Great Britain the. British manufacturers could dump corsets into Australia to put half of the workers in the Australian industry out of employment. All articles of apparel are subject to changes of fashion. Manufacturers of goods so affected are only too glad to dump theirsurplus in other countries, where they may be able to place them with advantage, even at prices lower than those charged by them in their own countries. We would do the same in Australia if we were able to manufacture articles in sufficient quantities. For years in the State of Victoria the producers sold their wheat and other farm products at a cheaper rate for export than they charged for' them locally. member does not know what he is talking about. In 1908 flour was sold for export at 10s. per ton cheaper than the Melbourne price. If we want to build up a corset-making industry we must have higher duties than those requested by the Senate. I am surprised that the Minister( Mr Greene) should have caved in to the extent of suggesting a rate of only 30 per cent. British. under the Minister's proposal will be 45 per cent., because very few corsets come here from Great Britain. makers in Great Britain, and they would be only too pleased to send their articles here if it would pay them to do so. The margin proposed by the Minister against them is notsufficient. necessary to have a high duty on corsets ? Why will not a rate of 15 per cent, suffice? duty of 1,000 per'cent, on every article that could be manufactured here. The honourable member would not propose any duty. That is the difference between us. We are as far apart in our views on this subject as are the poles, but I am representing a section of the Australian people, whereas one would think the honourable member was representing foreigners. I [478 ] hope that the Minister will not be so weakkneed in regard to other requests. Mr MoWILLIAMS (Franklin) [9.59]. -The figures given by the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) should make the Committee pause. He has told us that corsets were purchased before the war at £ 5 5s. per dozen. as £ 3 3s. per dozen. turers are turning out one style of corsets at £3 per dozen. 9s. or 10s. as the price at which a good corset could be purchased at the time of which I am speaking. The articles exhibited to the Committee were quoted at 42s., and the honourable members for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) and Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster), who are experts, assured us that they were by no means high class. An expenditure of 42s. represents a very considerable portion of the weekly wage of a large number of workers in Australia. The prices before the war were 5s. l i d . , 9s. 6d., and 12s. 6d. I can quite understand the advocacy of high duties in the case of big industries, although I cannot agree with it , but in the case of an article of common use high duties are indefensible. If the price of such articles is made very much higher, the penalty upon the people of Australia becomes very great. Such articles as corsets are in almost universal use from one end of the country to the other. The Minister( Mr Greene) ought to have stated how many corsetswere imported into Australia, and how many were made in this country. Numbers of small industries are being coddled in the big cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and it would pay the people of Australia to give every employee in many of' them £5 per week to engage in some other business. The Committee has not been shown to what extent the Australian trade is being supplied by the Australian manufacturer. If , as I am informed, only an infinitesimal portion of the local requirements is manufactured in Australia, the people are being compelled to pay an enhanced price, not only on the small number made here, but also on the total number used.

Rich people do not care what they have to pay. The working people are the real sufferers. It is not a fair deal. I hope the Senate's requested amendment will be agreed to. honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) said he thought it would be an advantage if we had women membars of this House. I think that, for the consideration of many subjects, it might be advantageous were women privileged to help in the government of the country. They would enlighten certain honourable members. honourable member for Melbourne to the counsel of Mrs. Booth, head of the Women's National Council. The matter that we have before us is very serious. If Australian manufacturers could make corsets, or any other requirements of Australia, of a proper quality, and in sufficient quantity, it would be infinitely more reasonable to prohibit the importation of them entirely. WhatI object to is giving a fabulous 55 per cent, protection, such as was given to the corset industry. It only tends to aggravate the iniquitous system of centralization that has grown up in Australia. All our leading newspapers are lamenting the position that we now find ourselves in in this regard. honourable member for Melbourne Ports is supporting that little centralization section like a jumper in the "" cheese"" that he represents, while he thinks that he represents the whole of Australia. He is the representative only of centralization. If we think that we can advance Australia by taking in each other's washing, we are on the wrong track. A few women in this hall of government would be a distinct advantage. It seems that if certain honourable members can quote that in some hole or corner in Australia a thing can be manufactured, they think they have a Customs Tariff [REPRESENTATIVES.] BUI. good case for Protection. The sympathetic Minister, the capitalists, and the Labour representatives, cheek by jowl, will support him. Occasionally one of them will slip, like the honourable member of the electorate that I for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini), on the honourable member, for Hunter( Mr Charlton), on mining explosives. They bring up the arguments that we, on this side, consistently put forward, and they disclose where the shoe pinches. If the honourable members representing the cities think they can further aggregate the people in the cities, and, by force of numbers, exploit the other sections, they must be taught that there is a limit to that kind of thing. Otherwise Australia will be bled white. I have no objection to things being manufactured in Australia any more than 1 object to produce being grown in Australia. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports alleged that produce grown here had been sold in other parts of the world cheaper than in Australia. He may be able to cite certain instances where, possibly, contracts were I would refer the made at prices which subsequently were below the local prices. The primary producers are favorable to maintaining contracts. The honourable member referred to the price of bread, but that was in the case of a contract. If contracts of any kind are undertaken in connection with the Tariff they should, of course, be honoured. I do not desire to see foreign-made goods and products supplant Australian manufactures under reasonable competition, but T object to the erection of a high Tariff wall. The tendency to-day is not to give the public the advantage of inordinate protection; it is divided between the manufacturer and the few people who assist him in his The factory, and, together, they exploit the people. I repeat that the Tariff should not be expected to do more than afford reasonable protection. I had expected that when this Committee came to consider the requests of another place there would be little need either to go over the old ground or to advance fresh argument, since the Grovernment would naturally adhere to their original intentions except in cases where errors or omissions had to be rectified.",59,Maloney Banana S Are Now Benefit Of The Information Placed At My

346,Mr West (East Sydney) [10.11],"In connection with the duty upon corsets, consideration was given to the item in anment be made with modification-put . other place during an all-night sitting, and it is very evident that justice was not done to the subject. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) appears to be possessed of animosity against the dwellers in the big manufacturing cities -in fact, against almost all the people of Australia except those who live m his own electorate. Most of our city residents livo in the crowded areas because they have no option but to do so. Owners of land are so greedy and selfish that . they will not permit others to get away from thc congested areas in order to make a living in the wide spaces and the open air. W it h respect to the sample corsets which have been displayed in this Chamber, it seems to me that all the artistic work put into them is mere waste, and is intended solely to add to their cost. But Australian makers can produce good utility corsets which can compare and compete with the productions of any country. One would think when listening to the opinions of some honourable members that the item dealing with corsets manufactured in Australia represented something new. I point out that corsets were dealt with in the Tariff schedule of 1908 and of 1914, and that the duties to-day are lower than those imposed previously. nsed for the manufacture of corsets was much lower in 1908 than to-day, and wages were much lower. On the whole, the corset manufacturing industry is a credit to Australia, and should be reasonably encouraged. Every enlightened community realizes that it is essential to create and encourage secondary industries. seriousness of the requested amendment. I cannot think that honourable senators were in earnest when they framed their request. They failed to do themselves justice. I understand that before a vote was taken upon this item in the Senate there were not enough members of the Committee to carry on the business, and that others had to be awakened from their sleep to provide a quorum. Honourable senators were absolutely demented under the pressure of an all-night sitting I do not know the name of the architect They were not wide awake when the vote was taken and did not know what they were doing.

I find that in nine cases out of ten, honourable members who, after .visiting .tie latrines, used to resort to the lavatory to wash their hands, now fail to do so. In these days, when, so much, attention is paid to the health of the individual, I think that the lavatory should be in the most convenient position, and that, failing a retarn to the old order of things, a washbasin should be provided in tie latrine. son) -Owing to the shortage of accommodation in this building, it was found necessary to rent, at very considerable cost, outside offices for the use of one of the Parliamentary Committees. When the new rooms were being added to the north wing of this building, it was thought wise to remove the lavatory in .the main corridor to what was considered to be an equally convenient, though less conspicuous position. That change released a large room in the most prominent part of the building, which can now be made available for one of the Committees, so that a considerable saving in the annual Tentals now being paid for outside premises can be effected. With regard to the other suggestion made by the. honourable member, I shall be glad to submit it to the State architect for his consideration. I think it would be very convenient if what the honourable member has suggested could be done. Question resolved in the affirmative.
