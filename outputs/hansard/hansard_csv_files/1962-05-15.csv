Dr. Adenauer is reported to have said' I am fed up with the babble about the Commonwealth. Will the Minister ascertain whether the report is accurate? If it is accurate, will he seek to remind the German Chancellor that the Commonwealth played a modest part in reviving the political integrity of West Germany and that the people of the Commonwealth are reluctant to risk injury to an organization before making the most exhaustive inquiries, though some minds may regard the inquiries as mere babble? most certainly inquire whether the report is accurate.

17,Mr Davidson,"The honourable memhas been carefully considered by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, which could have a particular function to perform in any educational television programme, and by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. All these bodies have been taking part in discussions, not simply on the possible use of television in education, but on the best way in which the medium can be used. It is only recently that I received what might be called an interim report from the Australian Boadcasting Control Board, but it is much too early yet to give any firm programme. I am sure the honourable member realizes that this is a matter which must be carefully considered. All the interests involved must be taken into account, and a proper assessment must be made of all possible ways in which the medium could be used, so that when a scheme is finally evolved it will provide the greatest possible advantage. The honourable member asked whether a channel could be reserved for educational television. I point out that the Government, in its wisdom, decided that five channels would be reserved in each of the major cities of Australia. Of these, four have been allocated, and in each city one channel remains available. In other words, provision for such a development as the honourable member has suggested has already been made. to the Treasurer. I preface it by reminding him of the numerous representations macle to the Government by primary producers' organizations for exempting from tax any petrol used in primary production, and of the rejection of the various requests, mainly because of difficulty in policing any such provision. I now ask the right honourable gentleman whether, in preparing the next Budget, he will consider making an allowance of £30 a year to the users of petroldriven tractors, to recompense them for the payment of tax on petrol used in agricultural production? member shows by his question that he circle would be interested to have more realizes the complexity of this matter.

I ask you whether a decision has yet been reached along lines that I have frequently advocated regarding the installation of a clock or device in this chamber which will give honourable members clear warning when the time limit for their speeches is about to expire, in order to save you from the indignity of having to cry out, "" Time, gentlemen, please"", or words of like import, and to preserve honourable members from the reproach of seeming ambitious to orate beyond the last moment of the permitted time. It is hoped that the clock will be installed after the House rises. to the Treasurer, refers to the conference that is being organized by the Australian Productivity Council in Sydney from 23rd to 25th May, and which is to be opened by the Treasurer. Is it a fact that productivity specialists from West Germany and Japan will lecture at this conference? If so, will the Treasurer endeavour to have the full text of the speeches by these specialists on this most important subject made available to members of this House? able gentleman will appreciate, the Australian Productivity Council is not a Government organization. Jt is a fact that I have been invited to give one of the addresses which will form the piogramme of the conference, and I understand that there will be speakers at the conference from other countries.

The policy of the Government has never been to seek to establish a bilateral balance of trading with any one of its trading partners. The policy of the Government is to seek to have an overall satisfactory trading position for Australia and to argue vigorously, bilaterally or multilaterally, about our rights and opportunities to sell. Insofar as the United States of America is concerned, We have pointed out, time and time again, publicly and directly and in international negotiations, that there are some items of trade in respect of which we believe we should have fairer access to the United States markets.

Defence) [3.18] I move That the bill be now read a second time. The main object of this bill is to give the force of law within Australia to a convention, supplementary to the Warsaw Convention, for the unification of rules relating to international carriage by air. This convention was agreed to at a diplomatic conference held at Guadalajara in Mexico in September, 1961. To understand the effect of the present bill, it is desirable to refer to the provisions of the Warsaw Convention. This convention, which was signed in 1929, unifies the rules relating to international carriage by air. It has been ratified by some 56 countries, including Australia and all other countries which operate major international air services. Australia gives effect to the Warsaw Convention by the Carriage by Air Act 1935. The principal effects of that convention were, broadly, to provide persons injured or whose luggage or cargo had been lost or damaged in the course of international air travel with the right to recover damages, up to fixed limits, without proof of fault or negligence on the part of the carrier. The limit on the amount of damages did not apply if the passenger established wilful misconduct on the part of the carrier or his servants. In addition, the convention facilitated the recovery of damages by provisions enlarging and defining the jurisdictions within which actions for damages could be brought. In 1955, an international conference at The Hague agreed to a protocol to amend the Warsaw Convention in two main respects, firstly to double the limit of the amount of damages recoverable for death or tralia pursuant to the authority to do so the convention and it appears likely that the necessary number of ratifications to bring it into force will be received by the end of this year. The Warsaw Convention in terms applies the carriage of the passenger is performed by a number of carriers in succession, if",19,Trade

61,Mr Townley (Denison,"Minister for to "" successive carriers "", that is to say wherethe carriage has been regarded as a single operation by the parties. In these circumstances, each carrier is liable for damage occurring during the carriage which he performs. However, the convention makes no provision for any other case where the contract for the carriage is made by the passenger or consignor with one carrier, but the whole or part of the carriage is performed in fact by another carrier. It has always been a matter of great uncertainty as to whether in such circumstances the references in the Warsaw Convention to "" the carrier "" were to the contracting carrier, the actual carrier, or both carriers. Such cases of charter and hire of aircraft were rare in 1929, when the Warsaw Convention was drafted, but have become increasingly common in recent years. One example is the recent operation by the Italian airline, Alitalia, of services between Italy and Australia with aircraft owned by the French airline T.A.I, and flown by T.A.I, crews. The object of the diplomatic conference forms. The terms "" contracting carriers "" at Guadalajara was to arrive at a convenand "" actual carriers "" are used in the senses tion, to be supplementary to the Warsaw which I have already indicated, and are Convention, which would clarify this doubt defined in precise terms in ArticleI . of the as to the application of the Warsaw Convenconvention. tion to "" successive carriers "". The subject had been under consideration for some person who as a principal makes an agreeyears by the legal committee of the Interment for carriage governed by the Warsaw national Civil Aviation Organization, which Convention, either in its original form or prepared a draft convention which was the as amended by the Hague Protocol, with a basis for the discussions at the Guadalajara passenger or consignor.

Representatives of 40 counis defined as a person, other than the contries, including Australia, were present at the tracting carrier, who by virtue of authority conference as well as observers from the from the contracting carrier performs the International Air Transport Association, the whole or part of the carriage contemplated International Chamber of Commerce, the by the contract made by the contracting International Federation of Airline Pilots carrier, but is not a successive carrier within Associations and the International Law the meaning of the Warsaw Convention. Association. The conference succeeded in drawing up a convention to carry out the objects for which it met. This convention Article II . This article provides that where will no doubt be known generally as the an actual carrier performs the whole or part Guadalajara Convention and is referred to of such carriage, both the contracting carrier in those terms in this bill. The main object and the actual carrier are subject to the of the bill is to provide for the convention rules of the Warsaw Convention, the former to have the force of law in Australia as for the whole carriage contemplated in the soon as it comes into force. The general scheme of the bill is to insert in the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 a new Part IIIA. relating to the illustrated by an example. A person in Guadalajara Convention, and to set out Sydney books with Qantas to travel or to the terms of that convention in a schedule. ship cargo by that airline from Sydney to In this respect the bill follows the same pattern as the act in relation to the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol. The formal provisions of the bill are to come into force upon the bill receiving the Royal Assent. The provisions which give to the Guadalajara Convention the force of law in Australia will come into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation. This date will be subsequent to the convention coming into force after the deposit of five instruments of ratification, as provided for by Article XIII. of the convention. I turn now to the provisions of the convention as set out in the schedule to the bill. Broadly, the effect of these provisions is that, in the cases to which the convention applies, both the "" contracting carrier "" and the "" actual carrier "" are made subject to the rules of the Warsaw Convention-in the case of the contracting carrier, for the whole of the carriage contracted for, and in the case of the actual carrier, only for the part of the carriage which he actually per"" Contracting carrier"" is defined as a The key provision of the convention is agreement, the latter solely for the carriage which he performs. The effect of Article II . may best be London via San Francisco. Qantas finds itself unable to continue the carriage past San Francisco in its own aircraft and arranges for the passenger or cargo to be carried from there to London by a Pan American aircraft. In these circumstances, if the passengers were injured or the cargo damaged or lost during the flight from San Francisco to London, the passenger or consignor would have a right of action under the Guadalajara Convention against both Qantas and Pan American. His rights would be governed by the terms of the Warsaw Convention at the present time, but if the Hague Protocol were in force his rights would be governed by the Warsaw Convention as amended by the Hague Protocol. This is made clear by the definition in ArticleI . of "" the Warsaw Convention "". Articles III . to X. of the convention contain ancillary and consequential provisions arising from the key provisions in Article II . rules of the convention as to the applicable In relation to the carriage which the actual carrier performs, Article III . provides that the acts and omissions of the actual carrier and his servants and agents within the scope of their employment are deemed to be also those of the contracting carrier, and vice versa. Article IV. provides that complaints or orders required to be made or given under the Warsaw Convention may generally be given to either the contracting carrier or the actual carrier. Under Article V. a servant or agent of either carrier may avail himself of the limits of liability applicable to his employer, unless it is proved he acted in a manner which under the Warsaw Convention prevents the limits of liability from being invoked. This occurs if the passenger or consignor proves that the loss or damage was caused by the wilful misconduct of the servant or agent. Articles VII. and VIII. of the convention contain provisions as to the bringing of actions where damage has occurred during the carriage performed by the actual carrier. An action for such damages may be brought against either the actual carrier or the contracting carrier or both together or both separately. The jurisdictions in which such actions may be brought are dealt with by Article VIII. This provides that the person suing has an option as to where he brings his action. He may do so at the place where the actual carrier is ordinarily resident or has his principal place of business. Alternatively, he may sue in a court in any of the places where an action could be brought against the contracting carrier in accordance with Article 28 of the Warsaw Convention. These places are the place where that carrier is ordinarily resident or has his principal place of business or has an establishment by which the contract has been made, or the place of destination of the carriage in question. Thus the convention gives the plaintiff a very wide choice of venue for his action, which should enable him in all cases to bring bis case before a court in a country which is reasonably accessible and convenient in the circumstances. Any provision in the contract of carriage altering these rules as to jurisdiction is made null and void by Article IX. of the convention. That article also prohibits any contractual provision which would tend to infringe the law, to relieve either carrier from liability under the convention, or to fix a lower limit than those applicable under the convention. These limits are at present, in round figures, £A.3,750 for death of or injury to a passenger, £7 10s. per kilogramme for cargo or registered baggage, and £150 for hand baggage. When the Hague Protocol comes into force, the limit of liability for personal injury or death will be increased to £7,500 approximately. The other limits are not altered by the Hague Protocol. Article X. provides that the convention does not affect the rights and obligations of the carriers as between themselves except that if an action is brought against one only of the carriers, he has the right to have the other carrier joined in the proceedings in accordance with the law of the country hearing the case. While the new convention covers a relatively limited set of' circumstances, it is a useful and necessary supplement to the widely accepted rules of the Warsaw Convention. The United Kingdom Government has already introduced legislation to ratify the convention and to give it the force of law within Great Britain. It appears certain that the required number of ratifications will be lodged within the next few months, and that the convention will come into force in the remarkably short period of less than a year after its signature. Qantas Empire Airways Limited, as Australia's designated overseas airline, has been consulted, both before and after the Guadalajara Conference, as to the desirability of an international convention of this nature. That company has expressed the view that removal of the doubt as to the meaning of "" carrier "" in the Warsaw Convention is a very definite advantage to the company, as well as to passengers and shippers. Its pooling arrangements with other carriers involve its entering into charter arrangements from time to time, and the new convention will clarify the rights of interested parties. The company's considered view is that the convention should be ratified by Australia as soon as practicable. Clauses6 and 9 of the bill amend the section is applicable to actions against a Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act in carrier under Part IV. of the act. It will some minor respects not related to the be recalled that Part IV. of the act applies Guadalajara Convention. Section 16 of thc to certain types of carriage of passengers act deals with the situation where the carwithin Australia the general principles of rier who is sued for damages under the the Warsaw Convention of liability of the Warsaw Convention as amended by the carrier up to a specified maximum amount Hague Protocol proves that the damage was of damages-£7,50 0 for death or personal caused by or contributed to by the negliinjury-withou t proof of fault or negligence gence of the passenger or consignor. The on the part of the carrier. Section 39 prosection also applies to actions for damages vides for a reduction of damages in the during carriage to which the Warsaw Conevent of contributory negligence on the part vention, without the Hague Protocol, of the injured passenger, in similar terms applies, by virtue of section 24 of the act. to section 16. Clause9 of the bill adds a The effect of section 16 is that the court new sub-section to provide that where the hearing the casefirstdetermines the damages action is tried with a jury, the jury shall recoverable as if there were no contributory determine the damages and the amount of negligence and no limit on the amount of the reduction to be made because of the those damages. The court is then required to reduce those damages to such an extent the total damages recoverable to £7,500 are as it thinks just and equitable having regard applied. I commend the bill to the House. to the share of the passenger or consignor in the responsibility for the damage. If the damages as so reduced exceed the limit adjourned.

The object of the amendment set out in clause 6 of the bill is to add a new subsection which makes it clear that where the trial of the action for damages takes place before a jury, as will generally be the case in State courts, it is the jury and not the judge which determines the damages in the first place and the amount by which those damages should be reduced by reason of the contributory negligence of the person suing.

That suggestion has been made, of course, There are many arguments against such a proposal, but this is one case in which it could be useful. Like the honourable member for Lalor, I do not know the industry well. However, I understand that the various factories are efficient and well designed technically for the jobs they do. The basic cause of the troubles of the industry is that the market is not big enough. This is not helped by having high tariffs on the goods which merely switch the demand to other types of material. I suppose the real trouble is in the feminine mind. If only women were content to wear uniforms, then the industry would be really economic. The machines then could be employed to spin the same yarn and weave in the same pattern, material and design week after week. I would recommend this to the Minister for Supply( Mr Fairhall), who is at the table. If he really wants the industry to fit into our economic life, all he has to do is to persuade fashions and to the tastes of women in the women of Australia to wear the same kind of clothes. Those of us who are husbands or who hope to become husbands know the angry glittering glance with which our womenfolk greet another woman who has the temerity to wear even a somewhat similar dress. It will not be easy for the Minister to do end, they devised the twin-thread 9-denier as I have suggested, but perhaps he might nylon which gives 18-denier hosiery.

It is in the hope that the Minister will take kindly to that suggestion that I have much pleasure in supporting the bill. I seem to be in the position of following the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) in debates, generally on tariff matters, and I appreciate the extent of the knowledge he has acquired by devoting himself to various matters and, on this occasion, to the problems of the textile industry. What the honourable member has to say is well worth hearing. However, I think the House should know that even Japan, with the lowest cost structure in the world, has found it necessary to impose protective duties on acetate yarn. Such is the extent of the almost vicious competition resulting from the eternal war of the fibres between the manufacturing nations of the world. Although Japan has found it necessary to impose protective duties from time to time, apparently that country deems it necessary and advisable to have an acetate yarn industry, not only for the purposes of its export trade but also for internal consumption. I appreciate the reference by the honourable member for Wakefield to women's selecting the various fibres from which their more intimate garments are fashioned. IfI might digress for a moment, I recall that from time to time the manufacturers of nylon have endeavoured to satisfy the needs of the ladies by producing stockings fine enough to satisfy their wishes but also having some wearing qualities.

69,The Minister For Trade ( Mr Mcewen),"destinies of our manufacturing industries. 1 have learned to expect that if a fair and reasonable case is presented to him he is willing to lend a receptive ear. I think that in the interests of the 1,200 persons who are now employed at Courtaulds Tomago factory, something should be done. The 1,200 employees include 950 males and 250 females. Practically all these people have been directly or indirectly associated with the coal industry which has been adversely affected by mechanization. It is now in the interests of the Newcastle district in particular and of Australia in general that some means should be contrived to provide employment for persons in the coal-mining areas who are displaced. With admirable foresight, Courtaulds of England decided as far back as 1953 that they would try to establish an acetate spinning factory at Tomago and also a viscose spinning section for tire cord in the same plant. To-day they have an enormous building there. It would take a visitor a couple of hours to walk around it if he wanted to see what it contains. As I have said, the industry employs a large number of people. The average wage is about £21 a week and of this amount £4 10s. represents incentives. It is very important to remember that an incentives scheme is operating almost from end to end of that factory. An incentive scheme has been instituted wherever it has been humanly possible to establish it. Shift work is maintained round the clock, and in some cases it goes on for 365 days a year because, like a steelworks, once the plant starts to move and produce yarn it can be stopped only at very great expense. As a consequence, it is necessary-as it is in a steelworks-to work shifts round the clock seven days a week. The company has spent £7,000,000 on getting the plant into motion. When the plant was begun in 1953-and I was present at the opening-it was expected that by 1962, about 7,000 employees would be engaged, not perhaps only in the manufacture of acetate and viscose yarns but also in the ancillary industries which usually establish themselves around and about the acetate and viscose spinning industries in other parts of the world. But we find unfortunately that in 1962 practically no expansion has taken place and the industry is much the same as it was when it was first opened in 1953. It is important to remember that 70 per cent, of this company's capital is owned in Australia and only 30 per cent, is owned by the parent company. What a difference exists between the structure of this company and the structure of another company with whose operations we in this House are all too painfully familiar! I refer to General Motors-Holden's Proprietary Limited. The entire stock of that company is owned by American interests and the entire profits, if the company so desires, may be exported from Australia. Last year nearly one-half of its profits left this country. What a difference between the two companies! With the large percentage of the capital of Courtaulds owned in Australia it becomes obvious that even if the company does make a substantial profit-it never has-onl y a small fraction will leave this country. The original investors must be very sorely disappointed to find that despite the expense involved in getting this project started, the highest profit that the company has made on its operations is 5 per cent. I shall mention the profits made over the last few years to demonstrate that they have not been excessive. In 1954-55, the year after the company began producing, no profit was made on the ordinary stock. In 1955-56 a profit of 2 per cent, was earned; in 1956-57 it was 4 i per cent.; in 1957-58 it was again 4 i per cent.; in 1958-59 it was 5 per cent., the highest profit ever; in 1959-69, as a result of the credit squeeze, no profit was made, and in 1960-61 the profit was 2 i per cent. The prospects for the current financial year appear to be fairly bright. Let me point out that if the company does make a profit-as I have revealed, profits have been very low to date-com pany tax must be paid. If the profit were to reach 10 per cent., company tax would reduce it to 6 per cent, out of which dividends would have to be paid and reserves and funds for development and expansion provided. Obviously, there can be no development or expansion and no increase in employment with a profit of 6 per cent. As I indicated at the beginning of my remarks, it was confidently expected in 1953 that by this time there would have been 7,000 or 8,000 people employed in the ancillary industries established around the company. This company deserves to prosper, not only in the interests of employment in the Newcastle district, but also so that it can expand into the manufacture of other yarns. One such yarn is acetate which has a molecular texture something similar to tri-acetate. The yarn has qualities that will permit its ready adaptation to Australia's requirements if the opportunity to do so is given, but unless the company is able to expand, it scarcely can be expected to move into the production of tri-acetate and other fibres, as I believe it would like to do. If it is given the opportunity to expand, it will provide additional employment in a district which is crying out for employment. Wool interests should realize that acetate yarn is not necessarily the enemy of wool. It can be made to walk hand-in-hand with wool if there is true co-operation between the interests controlling the two fibres. Let me now mention some of the difficulties which the company has had to face. From the beginning of its operations, one of its principal difficulties has been the low duty on fine viscose yarnsa competitive fibre. There are three kinds of rayon. There is cupramonium yarn, acetate yarn and viscose yarn. The cost of producing acetate yarn and viscose yarn is very similar and to me it seems utterly futile to expect this company to prosper while a competitive yarn of about the same cost and with much the same qualities is admitted free under British preferential tariff and with a duty of As I have indicated, Courtaulds, unlike 12i per cent, under the most favoured nation tariff. While that continues the acetate yarn industry cannot receive what we in Australia choose to call a fair go. Let us suppose that the company had set out to manufacture fine viscose yarns instead of acetates. It would have been in exactly the same trouble unless some protective duties had been imposed on imported acetate fibres. I maintain, without fear of contradiction, despite anything that the Tariff Board may have said, that higher duties should have been imposed on fine viscose yarns which are responsible for the unfair competition. I can honestly say, as can any one who has studied the history of Courtaulds in Australia, that at no time can the charge of cooking its books be levelled against it. We all know of instances of companies earning little or nothing if they show a loss on their operations in Australia. The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) mentioned one last week, Nestle's. That company does not worry whether it shows a profit because a loss can usually be manipulated in such a way as to avoid taxation somewhere else. In fact, a company such as that might prefer to show a loss rather than a profit. Let me compare the behaviour of Courtaulds with the behaviour of General Motors-Holden's when government policy cut back car sales in 1960. General Motors-Holden's was very swift to act. It promptly dismissed several thousand employees and it used its actions as a kind of blackmail on the Government. Perhaps this was one of the reasons why sales tax on motor vehicles was reduced, so enabling the motor vehicle industry to recover its position. However, when Courtaulds was adversely affected some years ago by government policy it produced £1,000,000 worth of stock before it even contemplated sacking one man. 1 do not know whether the Minister for Trade realizes what it means to the textile industry when skilled employees have to be dismissed and are lost to the industry because they find work in some other more reliable occupation. The cost of training new employees is fantastic, and sometimes the damage done to processes or yarns by unskilled employees is very great. So it is a matter of great concern to Courtaulds if it becomes necessary to dismiss any staff. General Motors-Holden's, has exhibited always the utmost reluctance to dismiss any one. It is timely to point out to the House that it is a matter of great consequence to Australia that the acetate yarn industry should be established here and given the opportunity to prosper. It is true that before the industry was established in Australia, if we wanted yarn we could get it from anywhere in the world, but usually a wait of several months was necessary. Now it is possible to satisfy in Australia most of our requirements of fine deniers although I know that we do not produce a very wide range of deniers. Now, with the plant established at Tomago, it is merely a matter of placing orders and, within days, sometimes within hours, the demand is met. Not only is there prompt delivery of yarn, but there is less chance of damage being done to the yarn on its way to the consumer. I used a lot of this yarn at one time, and I can remember occasions when yarn which came from as far away as Great Britain was damaged in delivery and it was necessary to wait sometimes for months for replacements. The Tariff Board has recommended that the limitation of a net 10 per cent, of profit from that section of the plant devoted to the manufacture of acetate yarn be lifted. Hitherto, there has been a limitation of 10 per cent, net on the profit made by that section of the plant used for the manufacture of acetate yarns which have been sold locally. The fact that the Minister has stated in his speech that the Government does not agree with that recommendation by the Tariff Board would indicate to meI sincerely hope that I am wrong-that the Government does not wish this important industry to flourish. If it did desire the industry to flourish in Australia, it would agree with the Tariff Board's recommendation. I do not necessarily agree with all the recommendations of the Tariff Board. For instance, I know that it has been decided that for the next three years the bounty shall be £130,000an increase from £100,000-bu t this is only consequential because the bounty is being raised from 6d. to 9d. per lb. of manufactured yarn, but when I compare the value of 6d. to-day with its value at the time when that rate was fixed, I say unhesitatingly that the rate of bounty to-day should be not 9d. but ls. per lb. of manufactured yarn if the company is to be accorded the protection that it needs and richly deserves. Sometimes I ask myself: "" What does a because it, too, has a similar molecular company have to do in this country to get structure. a fair deal? Does high efficiency mean anything?"" After all, there is no more efficient company in Australia than all know that all humans can make mistakes, Courtaulds (Australia) Limited. Because of and I conclude by repeating that the bounty its policy of offering incentives, the comshould be ls. per lb., because only by liftpany's employees have become highly ing it to that figure can we make the bounty skilled. I have seen them at work, and I equal in value to what it was when it was know that every one of them does his first fixed at 6d. per lb. If it is restored to utmost to earn the fullest possible wage ls. the acetate spinning industry will have packet. By its policy of incentives, this restored to it the full amount to which it is company gives its own employees every entitled. Further, adequate protection must opportunity to prosper. Sometimes, too, I be accorded the production of fine viscose ask myself, ""Does common decency mean yarns. I am fully aware of the fact that the anything? "" I was prompted to ask that when I remember that at a time when General Motors-Holden's dismissed thousands of its employees, this company retained all its workers. When I looked at the prices of Courtaulds shares only a few days ago-the y have risen slightly in the meantimeI wondered why there had not been an attempt to take over the company. It was wide open for a take-over by somebody provided the necessary funds could be raised, and I suggest that this Government's attitude towards Courtaulds is the reason why no such take-over has been attempted. One of the things that I had hoped the company would do if it had been allowed to expand was to conduct further experiments into the extrusion of wool, and in referring to this subject. I speak to the members of the Australian Country Party in particular. This company is possessed of a tremendous amount of know-how, and it could be encouraged to carry out experiments in connection with the extrusion of wool. I do know that it has already conducted experiments in connection with the treatment of the Australian eucalypt. As a result of the experiments it carried out in South Africa, the company discovered that the Australian eucalypt could be used for the manufacture of cellulose acetates. At the moment, the spruce trees of the Scandinavian countries and Canada are used because their molecular structure makes them eminently suited to this purpose. Being springy and tough in their molecular structure, these trees give the same qualities to acetate yarns, and Courtaulds has discovered from its experiments that the Australian eucalypt could be used in lieu of imported spruce The Tariff Board is not infallible. We Tariff Board has said that Australian manufacturers cannot meet Australia's requirements of acetate yarns because their productive capacity is not great enough, but I believe that as Courtaulds have indicated that they are prepared to expand, if necessary, then it should be given the opportunity it so richly deserves. I firmly believe that the Government should implement the Tariff Board's recommendation that the limit of 10 per cent, be removed from the profit made by that part of the plant used for the making of acetate yarn. The company does offer incentives to its employees, and I think the time is rotten ripe for the Government to offer Courtaulds some incentives. knowing the background of the honourable member for St. George( Mr Clay) will appreciate the speech he has just made in connection with this particular matter. He has had great experience in this field, he has a vast knowledge of the subject and I am sure everybody who knows that will pay great attention to what he says. I believe that he has made a very strong case for the implementation of recommendation No. 4 of the Tariff Board's report. 1 have discussed this matter personally with the honourable member for St. George, because I know that he is a man of vast experience in this field, and because I know of his association with the industry in the past. When the industry submitted its case to the Tariff Board, it stressed the fact that a net profit of 10 per cent, on funds employed was quite inadequate for the maintenance of a progressive and modern industry. After all, 10 per cent, becomes only 6 per cent, after taxation, and this 6 per cent, is expected to cover the provision of essential reserves, the provision of funds for development and expansion, and the distribution of a certain amount to shareholders. In its report, the company saidThere is a range of newfibreswhich can be produced in Australia and Courtaulds (Australia) Ltd. has the ""know-how"" rights to many of them. But a company with such a restriction on its profits has no hope of interesting new capital after due and earnest consideration of a for such ventures, or indeed of finding funds for expansion. The fourth recommendation of the Tariff Board readsThe provisions in the Rayon Yarn Bounty Act 1954-1959 whereby the bounty payable is reduced if the net profit of a producer derived from the production and sale of rayon yarn during a period to which the Act applies exceeds profit at the rate of 10 per centum per annum on the capital used in the production and sale of rayon yarn be omitted from the Act. Sir, I say quite frankly that I think the Government and the Cabinet have made a grievous mistake in not accepting this recommendation by the Tariff Board. I sincerely ask that it be considered further and that, if necessary, this bill be amended in another place. I have had a long association with the company concerned. I have seen it operating, and I agree with the honourable member for St. George that it is one of the most efficient enterprises that I have seen. It has a particularly happy relationship between management and employees, and its staff, on the personal relations side, is doing a magnificent job. Here we have a company that was prepared to, shall I say, take the risk and establish itself in this area. Ever since the company began, it has faced tremendous difficulties. Indeed, I think it is a wonder that many of its shareholders remain faithful to it. Now, at a time when the company appears likely to be able to fight its way out of the difficulties that have confronted it throughout, I believe that the Government should give it all the encouragement that it can. The company can make a tremendous contribution, as it has already done, to the area in which it is situated. We talk in this place many times about the establishment of industries in rural areas. Here we have a company that was prepared to establish an industry in a country district. Because of the way in which the factory has been established and conducted, I believe that this company deserves all the encouragement that it can be given. It certainly needs encouragement. We say, perhaps, that members of the Tariff Board are not infallible. But surely there are good and justifiable reasons why the experienced members of the board made a recommendation such as they have made matter presented to them. As I have already said, I strongly urge the Government to consider the matter further and to amend the bill in another place. I wish to say one final thing, Sir. I know that it is said that the Minister for Customs",26,Rayon Yarn Bounty Bil L 1962

I think that is valuable, and I hope that, if there were no other way, the Minister would use his discretionary powers and enable the company not only to complete its present programme of development, but also to develop further in the future. However, I do not think that the matter should be left to the discretionary power of the Minister. Supply) [4.18] -in replyMr Deputy Speaker, the Government welcomes the support that the Opposition has given this bill. I am rather grateful to the honourable member for St. George( Mr Clay) for bringing forward the points that he made regarding the history of the company concerned. Like my friend, the honourable member for Lyne( Mr Lucock), I have had some association with this company, which is on the border of my electorate and which provides employment for quite a number of people, who, I hope, are faithful constituents of mine. I am also pleased that the honourable member for St. George raised the question of the joint ownership of the undertaking by Australian and British investors. I hope that the sort of ownership established in this industry will be a pattern think that I ought to remind my honourable which will be followed as new influxes of overseas capital come to Australia. Anything that I may say, Mr Deputy Board. As appears at page 10 of the Speaker, will, I know, not be interpreted as report, the board statedcriticism of the firm of Courtaulds (Australia) Limited.

But there comes a point at which merely said that, under the conditions the decision to establish an industry in which its own recommendations would Australia, involving, as it must always do, produce, the proposition that the company some risk, lays that risk on the entrepreneur. could earn more than 10 per cent, was As I have intimated, I do not want my almost unthinkable. Therefore, the board remarks to be interpreted as meaning that did not propose to write in the 10 per cent, the company took a risk and that, because limitation. But it had a clear undermatters did not come out quite as it hoped, standing, as is indicated by its decision, it must carry the baby. That is not the that the profit of the company should not point at all. The point that I am trying to exceed 10 per cent. The board therefore make is that there must always be some concluded that there is no need for profit limitation on the extent to which the public purse can be called on to support a comin an industry which the country needs. This, obviously, is the picture here: Courtaulds (Australia) Limited, in the situation that it faces, illustrates the enormous difficulties which confront not only this industry but also many others in Australia because of the size of our domestic market. This is a matter to which the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) has directed attention. But, as I recall it, the honourable gentleman had something to say a little while ago about quantitative restrictions on imports. Those restrictions were designed rather to secure to the Australian manufacturer a greater share of the home market. This, of course, lines up with what my honourable friend from St. George had to say about competing yarns. Only as we secure to the Australian manufacturer a greater share of the home market, during the formative years not only of the industry itself but also of Australia as a market, shall we be able to support these industries which appear, as somebody has said, to be always uneconomic. However, Sir, I come back to this question of the degree of assistance. I friend from Lyne that it is not quite true to say that the Government is not accepting the recommendation by the Tariff The Board does not consider that the level ot cent, per annum on funds employed in the production of acetate yarn.",30,Rayon Yarn Bounty Bil L 1962
71,Mr Fairhall (Paterson,"Minister forlimitation. The board's assessment may be right or it may be wrong. After all, its assessment was designed to provide for next year and 1964. I think that I should direct the attention of the House to the fact that it is quite normal to include a profit limitation in bounty legislation. The Government has consistently supported the view that there should be a limit on the profits which a company may make if it is being financially assisted from the public purse, and this is the important aspect of this matter. So the debate this afternoon has turned largely on the question of what is a reasonable level of support from the public purse for an industry of this kind, which is essential to the national economy so far and yet -which seems doomed' to be not always a good economic proposition because of a variety of difficulties such as competition by other yarns and the limited size of its domestic market. The Tariff Board has clearly said that the profit ought not to be more than 10 per cent., although it has refrained from suggesting that the Government write in such a limitation. Therefore, the Government is not departing from the spirit of the board's recommendation when it writes into this measure that which is written into almost every piece of bounty legislationa stipulation that there shall be a profit limitation of 10 per cent. This does not in any way impose a limit on the profits which Courtaulds (Australia) Limited may make. But it does impose a limit on the profit that the company may make while it receives bounty payments from the Government. ThereI think I may let the matter rest, it amounts to a great deal; probably it is not except to say that I wonder why the of any great significance. However, we courage of the honourable member for think it wrong that such refunds as have Wakefield expired so quickly and why he been made have not been confirmed by put on me the job of investigating women's direct statute but have relied on regulations fashions and their desires in relation to for validity.

Debate resumed from 29th March (vide That the bill be now read a second time. When introducing this bill, which is of a machinery kind, the Minister saidAt present the only authority to make refunds and remissions of excise duty is contained in the Excise Regulations. As an authority of this nature in the regulations only is of questionable validity, it is proposed by this bill to place the matter beyond doubt by incorporating the basic powers in the Excise Act. We on this side of the House support the amendment in the name of constitutional propriety. The only query one might raise is, how long have these payments been made in such an irregular fashion? It points to some neglect on the part of the House that such practices can continue. This House always claims with pride that it is responsible for the control of revenue, and thus as much control presumably is necessary over refunds of revenues improperly collected as should be maintained over the imposing of excise in the first place. From memory I should think that excise, which is principally collected on tobacco, beer, wine and spirits, raises about £200,000,000 a year. Inevitably there are occasions when, as is envisaged in this bill, breakages are returned to factories or faults are found in an article on which duty has been applied. When such goods are returned to the factory for replacement, instead of two lots of duty being paid, a refund is payable on the spoiled article.

When the Prime Minister introduced this costs of the teaching hospitals to enable measure last week he divided it into two parts, one relating to an old feature, the grants to the universities through the States, with which we have become familiar over the last few years, and the other, which is a new feature, the grants to the universities by way of grants to the teaching hospitals in respect of the teaching costs incurred in training medical students. Though the Opposition is supporting this measure, it is disappointed that one old feature of this disappointed also in one aspect of the new feature, the grants to the teaching hospitals. The old feature with which we are disappointed is the continuance of Commonwealth pressure on universities away from free universities. The House will recall that the Commonwealth grants £1 for every £1.85 that the universities receive from the States and through fees. Therefore, the universities have an incentive to charge fees. The more revenue they obtain in this way, the higher the grant they attract from the Commonwealth. This may not mean very much to most honourable members of this House, but to any one from Western Australia it has meant the disappearance of something that the State valued very highly a free university. Although the department administered by the Minister for Immigration, in its advertisements in Australia House, London, still speaks of a free university in Western Australia, there is, in fact, no free university in Western Australia now. The fees charged by the university of Western Australia are identical with the fees charged by universities in other States. Therefore, if you attach an increasing Commonwealth grant partly to the revenues which a university itself obtains from fees, quite clearly the nature of Commonwealth law constitutes some pressure on universities to charge fees. The Opposition believes in the restoration of free universities in Australia. We believe that if a university is free there is no impediment to abilitythat the field from which a university draws its students is likely to include the ablest students in the country. The measure before us does not tackle the problem of the recurrent costs of the teaching hospitals. It is quite generous in its grants-Commonwealt h and State-of something like £3,500,000 for the capital",32,Excise Bill 1962

76,Mr Beazley (Fremande) [4.33],"them to carry out medical teaching in hospitals in association with the various universities. The Prime Minister, in what was a very brief speech, did not fully explain the origin of this Committee on Teaching Costs of Medical Hospitals, whose report is partly embodied in this legislation. The report of the Australian Universities Commission for the year 1960, which was published in October, 1960, says at page 15OF MEDICAL HOSPITALS. The appointment of this Committee had its origin in a conference between the Prime Minister and representatives of the several State Health Ministers held in Canberra on 9th April, 1959. The State Ministers sought financial assistance from the Commonwealth Government for teaching hospitals on the grounds that the provision by a hospital of facilities for clinical teaching involves the hospital in expenditure additional to the salaries and fees of the teaching staff. Mention was made by the Prime Minister that the Murray Committee had singled out medical education as a problem which would require very careful consideration and discussion in the near future. He further expressed the view that medical instruction in hospitals was a subject which properly falls within the university concept and was not appropriate to Commonwealth/State hospital relations. In other words, the Prime Minister encouraged the universities to go ahead and examine this question of the costs that were being borne by the teaching hospitals. The report goes onThe Prime Minister referred the matter to the Commission in August, 1959, and in early December he appointed a Committee with the following terms of reference:(i) to inquire into the recurrent and nonrecurrent costs incurred by teaching hospitals, which are directly attributable the total numbers of clinical students enrolled in to the instruction of medical students; (ii) to submit for the consideration of the Commission recommendations on the magnitude and urgency of the assistance to such hospitals which would be appropriate to their special costs. In the course of his speech last week the Prime Minister referred to this body as a very powerful committee. If honourable members look at the membership of the Committee on Teaching Costs of Medical Hospitals, shown at page 76 in Appendix1 of the report of the Australian Universities Commission for 1960, they will see immediately that it is indeed a very powerful committee. That is what makes it rather disappointing that one very important aspect of the committee's recommendations has not yet been accepted by the Government. The committee consists of, as chairman, Sir Leslie Martin, who is also chairman of the Universities Commission; Dr. V. L . Collins, Professor D . P. Derham, Mr J. Griffith, Mr L. B. Hamilton, Mr P. J. Kenny, Mr A. Lendon, Dr. J. H . Lindell, Dr. G. A. Pennington, Sir Herbert Schlink and Professor S. Sunderland. These men are deeply versed in the accountancy and costs of the teaching hospitals, the administration of the teaching hospitals, or the teaching of many aspects of the practice of medicine, or are associated in other ways with the work of the Australian Universities Commission. They advocated in their report a complete departure from what has been the Commonwealth practice up to the present time as far as recurrent expenditure was concerned. They advocated what the Commonwealth has not so far accepted-unmatche d grants -and they did so for a special reason which I think they themselves make clear in their recommendations as at page 31 of their report. With regard to the matter of recurrent expenses which the Prime Minister referred to them they said thisBecause teaching hospitals differ in organization, size, and the number of students they take for varying periods, difficulties arise when an attempt is made to evaluate accurately running costs incurred in clinical teaching. However, the Committee's inquiries indicated that the costs incurred in sixteen items by each clinical student for each university's group of teaching hospitals were roughly comparable. They amount to approximately £625 per annum. For this reason the Committee decided to recommend a grant based on each faculty of medicine and an average cost of £625 per student per annum. Under the States Grants (Universities) Act 1960, the grants for recurrent purposes are shared on the basis of £1 from the Commonwealth for every £1.85 received by a university in fees and State grants. Similar machinery might be appropriate for the payment of grants to universties for recurrent expenses of teaching hospitals. However, because of the present machinery for financing hospitals the Committee foresees that unless special provision is made the grants recommended for recurrent costs might be used simply to reduce hospital deficits. This would be contrary to the Committee's intention. If the full amount recommended could be made available by way of an unattached Commonwealth grant, there can be no doubt that a real and valuable contribution would be made towards resolving the present difficulties associated with medical teaching. However, the recommendations that have been accepted by the Commonwealth Government are not those in relation to the recurrent grants. They are those in relation to the capital costs of building and equipment. The Opposition rejoices over the generosity of the scale of those grants for buildings and equipment, even though we await with interest the final decision with regard to the other aspect of these costs. The committee's investigations with regard to buildings and equipment, in the committee's own wordsled to the conclusion that many of the building and equipment items sought by universities on behalf of their teaching hospitals covered normal hospital needs as distinct from teaching needs. May I say here that this, of course, is the I do not think we have moved very far great difficulty that the Commonwealth is beyond a hand-to-mouth, day-to-day, or, if finding in regard to recurrent grants. It is you like, a triennium consideration of the very difficult to find out what pertains to urgent needs of universities. I do not know a hospital qua hospital, and what pertains what proportion of the national income to a hospital in relation to its function as a ought to be spent on universities. I think teaching institution. The committee went we have not yet made a determination on in its reportFrom a study of Table No. 8 it is clear that the Kingdom and have about one-third the Committee's recommendations are directed towards present number of students going to providing new buildings and supporting modifiuniversities and make the hurdles of entry cations of existing buildings with the specific object of improving the efficiency of clinical teaching into the universities very high, insisting on within the hospitals. Already, of course, the grants to certain hospitals which are associated with teaching are very large and will lead to very extensive building operations. The result is that other hospitals which are not teaching hospitals have some confusion in their minds that a favoured few hospitals have been singled out for special Commonwealth assistance. There have been some indications of resentment. That has been due to a misunderstanding of the position. The report goes onFor instance, many of the proposals concern that we will need to have a clear picture of the provision of clinical teaching buildings, the proportion of our resources that we are libraries, student ward laboratories, tutorial rooms, improvements to existing lecture theatres, and prepared to devote to university education student living-in and other amenities. The comand, I suppose, to other aspects of tertiary mittee recognized the rights of patients to privacy education as well. by recommending simple modifications to existing structures, especially out-patients' clinics, which would improve the conditions under which student from the Australian Universities Commisgroups could receive clinical instructions at the sion. I think we are still living, in a sense, bedside of patients. It is very clear, I think, that the comadvances are; and the Opposition will await mittee which has been appointed by the with interest anything that the Government Commonwealth to try to find its way may do at the moment to work out in its through the difficulties of determining the own mind what proportion of the nation's distinction between ordinary hospital funcresources it should devote to university tions and the functions of hospitals as teaching institutions associated with universities has done very fine work. It has set out very clear principles under very difficult circumstances. For that reason, we on the Opposition side hope that the committee's proposal concerning unmatched grants as far as current expenses are concerned will be looked at sympathetically by the Commonwealth. Leaving the aspect of the bill that deals with medical hospitals, I want to make a reference to another aspect of the matter. I do not believe that we are really yet getting a clear picture of what proportion of the national resources of this country ought to be spent on university education. whether we are to be like the United excellence, and on the basis of smaller student bodies making our grants to universities, or whether we should move towards the United States position of having a large number of universities, not necessarily at a high standard, in the belief that a wide section of the population having some advanced education is an asset to the nation. A t the moment, I think we are somewhere between the United Kingdom position and the United States position in our philosophy on this matter. But whatever position we are going to take up, I think That, I think, we are not so far getting from hand to mouth, however great these education and what decisions it is prepared to make to meet the recommendations of this committee on teaching costs in medical hospitals as far as recurrent expenses are concerned. The Opposition will also be interested to learn whether the Government has any views on the idea of free universities. Deputy Speaker, I was glad to hear from the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr go for the highest possible standard and go Beazley) that the Opposition is supporting this bill even with the reservations to which he referred. As he said, this bill deals with two entirely separate subjects. The first is the basic rate of professional remuneration. I do not propose to say anything on that question. I want to address my remarks to the second half of the bill which deals with grants to teaching hospitals. I believe that this is an extremely welcome move by the Government on an extremely difficult problem. I have been, for some time, concerned about the need for increasing grants to teaching hospitals. The honourable member for Fremantle talked about the attitude of some hospitals to the way in which a favoured few had been singled out for grant. I also have heard similar remarks. I think that the teaching hospitals, in many ways, have had financial difficulties very much greater than those of other hospitals. Certainly, that is true in Victoria. This has been particularly due to the fact that they have been trying to pay for their normal clinical services to patients and pay for the additional services for teaching students out of the same vote. It has not been possible to meet the costs of the two services out of the one vote. The Government's proposal represents an endeavour to sort out the position. I think that, above all things, the report of the committee on teaching costs in medical hospitals, enables us to realize what very high expenses are involved in training each medical student in Australia. It is quite obvious that the cost has risen a great deal in the last fifteen years and that it will rise a great deal more in the future. Dealing with the last part of the honourable member's remarks about our final goal with regard to universities, possibly there is play our part in training doctors from Southsome difference between the English system which tries to get the very best teaching for a favoured few and the American system which aims at a more general standard for a larger number of students. I think that there can be no doubt about what we want to do in teaching doctors. We want to make certain that every doctor is trained to the highest degree of medical knowledge possible. It is not possible to have two types of doctor-on e at the very highest when we speak of teaching doctors we must for the English system. This bill will take some of the load of teaching hospitals off the health services and place it on the universities where it belongs. Some people have asked: Why this larger need for recurrent capital and grants to teaching hospitals? As those who have read the report to which I have referred can see quite definitely, the conditions under which medical students have been working in the teaching hospitals have been pretty lamentable and the time is certainly overdue for better facilities to be provided. It was made clear to me by some members of the committee to whom I have spoken that we are making this move only just in time because although there has not been a tremendous shortage of doctors during the last few years, without any doubt, there will be an increasing shortage in the next few years. There has not been a shortage, because it has been possible for us to call on the services of doctors who have migrated to Australia. It has been fairly easy in the past to recruit doctors from the United Kingdom and, to a certain extent, from central Europe. Those sources now appear to be unable to meet our needs and it is pretty obvious that we will not be able to recruit as many doctors from overseas in the next ten years as we did in the last ten years. Further, new employment avenues aYe being followed by doctors. These are found in industry and in medical research. Although the demand for doctors will be growing, the sources from which we can get doctors will not be available to us. Therefore, it is urgent that the action recommended in the report should be taken. There is another aspect that we should consider. In the next few years, we must East Asia. Already, a number of students comes to us from India and other parts of",33,States Grants Universities

This trend is bound to present the numbers are extremely limited. increase, because I do not think that in the We are not able to train nearly as many next ten years we will be able to rely enstudents as we are asked to train. Over the tirely on the honorary medical service to next few years, we must aim to play a shoulder the full burden of teaching in our bigger part in training doctors for countries teaching hospitals. I wish it were possible where the needs for medical experts are even to ensure that this would happen, but in greater than they are in Australia. The recommendations in the report prowe must accept this. Let us face the fact vide only part of the story. As the honorthat we have had a great deal of the teachable member for Fremantle has pointed out, ing of our medical students over the past the bill deals with only capital costs for few years at a very small cost to the comcertain teaching hospitals and for undermunity, because this service has been given graduate training. Naturally, we welcome freely by the honoraries. This may not be these provisions. However, we must realize so in the next few years, and again the costs that the members of the committee would that must be met by the Commonwealth and have liked to have seen included in the rethe States will be increased. port many things that have not been included in it. First, there is no provision in the bill for recurring expenditure. As makes no mention of post-graduate training, the honourable member for Fremantle but the terms of reference did not include pointed out, the direct cost of training a such training. However, I do not think that medical student is at least £600 per annum. under-graduate training and post-graduate So far, the problem of meeting that cost training can be separated in teaching hoshas not been resolved and we welcome the pitals, because the two are tied togther. If assurance of the Prime Minister( Mr there are to be paid professors and the Menzies) that a bill dealing with this aspect number of students is to increase, I believe will be introduced early in the next sessional the professors must look not only at underperiod. The task of dividing the costs between accordingly. More post-graduate training in clinical work in the teaching hospitals and medicine is now being undertaken in Austeaching is difficult. The £600-o r more tralia than was undertaken before the war. exactly £625-that has been recommended Before the war, almost every post-graduate relates only to direct costs of which there student went overseas to obtain a fellowship can be no doubt incurred in teaching. Many of the Royal College of Surgeons. To-day, other costs in teaching hospitals are inflated the course can be undertaken in Australia because they undertake teaching as well as and nearly all post-graduate degrees, fellowclinical work. This is made clear in the ships and diplomas can be obtained in Ausreport and we need only to think of such tralia. That is at it should be. But again, matters as X-rays, pathology, clinical photofacilities on the post-graduate side are just graphy and medical records. All these secas lacking as they are on the under-graduate tions of a teaching hospital must be much side. larger than they need be for only clinical work. I am certain that the figure of £625 is very much smaller than the actual cost teaching is not available in Australia, many borne by a teaching hospital in respect of of our very best doctors have gone overseas each student. The next point that arises is that the Major-General Sir Kingsley Norris stressed honorary medical service provides much of the fact that at present 124 very experienced the teaching done in teaching hospitals. Australian doctors are serving in university Over the past ten years, the honorary mediposts in the United Kingdom. Australia cal service has found greater and greater needs these people here at this time, but difficulty in carrying out the tasks allotted because of the limited scope and inadequate to it. Part of the teaching work in many of salaries, the services of these men are not the universities is being done now by paid available to us. We should see to it that over view of what has happened in the past ten years, I believe there will be changes, and This leads me to the question of postgraduate training. I am sorry that the report graduate teaching but also at post-graduate teaching, and provision must be made Because sufficient scope for post-graduate to accept teaching posts. In a report to the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Downer), the next ten years we increase the sphere of activity available to doctors of this high calibre. Many doctors in the Colombo Plan area, in countries such as India, Pakistan and Malaya, wish to come here for post-graduate training, but we cannot meet the demands that are made on us. It is important that Australia should shoulder its responsibility and provide facilities for the training of these people. Many of these students now go to the United Kingdom, but it is right and fitting, I think, that they should be turning more and more to Australia as the place where they can obtain this advanced medical training. We should be able to meet their requests. At the same time, I believe that sometimes they would like to obtain degrees, or other qualifications, of a somewhat lower standard than those that are granted in this country. When one looks particularly at special diploma courses, one finds that the standards required for diplomas in South-East Asia and in the United Kingdom are not as high as diploma standards in this country. I hope that during the next few years, when we are considering post-graduate medical education, we will try to see how we can fit our diploma courses and fellowship courses to the demands of those coming from overseas. We should be able to provide the kind of training that these people desire. Finally, it is fairly obvious to all of us that medical teaching can reach a high standard only if it goes with research. Research and teaching must march together. One cannot divorce one from the other. We see in this report that the responsibility for medical research is that of the National Health and Medical Research Council, and yet the responsibility for teaching lies with the Prime Minister's Department and the universities. It seems to me that we are getting the two aspects widely separated, and that we should try to bring them together again. We cannot have good research without good teaching, and the statement applies with equal force in reverse. There is one other matter that I would like to mention. This report refers to certain teaching hospitals. These are what have been commonly regarded as the teaching hospitals. There is an interesting position developing in regard to teaching hospitals. The major hospitals, such as the Royal Melbourne Hospital, are so specialized, and provide such remarkably high standards of specialist services, that an ever-increasing proportion of the beds in those hospitals are taken up by patients suffering from special kinds of diseases and requiring special operations. The more common kinds of operations tend to be performed not at the major teaching hospitals, but at the outlying hospitals, such as Footscray and Box Hill, in Melbourne. However, the medical student needs to know much more about the common kinds of operation than about the specialized kinds of operations. I foresee that in the future many students who want to study the more common operations will have to get away from the specialized hospitals, which are the ones that are being assisted by this bill, and go to the suburban hospitals or other base hospitals to see the more common kinds of operations such as appendectomy. I suggest that in the next triennium we should try to arrange for grants not only to the major teaching hospitals but also to other hospitals which at present are not recognized as teaching hospitals but will be so recognized, I hope, in the future. . : New methods of teaching are recommended in this report, such as closed television circuits which would enable greater numbers of people to watch particularly interesting operations. It becomes obvious as we read the report that the costs of medicine and medical training are increasing constantly. The teaching of a doctor must become more complicated as the general health of the nation improves. The Parliament should realize that this is only the first of many such bills that it will have to consider during the next ten years. Having entered this field of teaching hospitals, we must realize that we have only just started to uncover the problem. The question of capital cost is an important one, but it is only part of the very big problem that will be uncovered as we go through the present triennium and the next one that is shortly to be considered. While we are considering this bill, therefore, we should also ask the Government to consider the wider tasks that have not been covered by this committee. I hope that the Government will give attention to these wider tasks when it comes to look at the lems in the past. After students have comnext triennium during the next few months. pleted their training they have drifted away Having expressed those remarks, I give my support to the bill. would like to tell the House a little about which was sponsored by the university the way in which the money provided under college.

However, at the beginning of this year, additional lecture rooms and laboratories have been provided so that second-year courses in arts, science and engineering are provided at the university college. At the present time, the possibilities of providing some third-year courses in arts, science and engineering are being investigated. It is hoped that, for the prestige of the new university college, finance will be available for at least some courses so that some young people of the north may graduate from the University College of Townsville at the end of 1963. The subjects provided in the Faculty of Arts include English, French, history, education, geography and mathematics. In the Faculty of Science, the subjects are physics, chemistry, botany, zoology and mathematics. In the Faculty of Engineering, all subjects for the first and second years of the engineering course are provided. The university college has been particularly fortunate in attracting a highly qualified academic staff. In many cases, the calibre of the applicants for Townsville posisupport for the establishment of the Univertions was higher than that of applicants for similar positions advertised at the same time in the capital city. One of the reasons was probably the challenge to young people to be associated with a new venture of this kind. There was also the fact that promotion would probably come more quickly in a new and growing university college. Most of the lecturers are very young and they are also well qualified. In the early planning, it was thought that the initial enrolment would probably be about 25. The fact is, however, that the first-year enrolment was 170, of whom 95 were full-time day students and 75 evening students. In 1962, there was an overall increase of 100 per cent, in total enrolments. The number of day students is 160, of whom 120 are first-year and 40 are second-year full-time day students. There are 154 evening students.

The provision of amenities at the university college began slowly, but there are plans to develop two football fields, a hockey field, tennis courts and basket-ball courts. Research facilities have been provided to enable the academic staff to proceed with its activities. This is essential because research is the life blood of any university and the work of lecturers at the frontier of knowledge is regarded as the best stimulus to effective and inspired teaching. An advisory council of 29 members representing the leaders of the civic, religious, commercial, industrial and educational aspects of the community has been established. This council works through a series of committees which deal with buildings, grounds and development, research, library and public relations and lectures. Already the council has made valuable recommendations to the Senate on the future development of the University College. Throughout the northern area, there is tremendous sity College and a scheme is being devised to ensure that full use will be made of the fact that this is the only university college in the tropics in Queensland serving an allEuropean community. There have been suggestions that the University College of Townsville should develop strong schools of marine biology, health engineering such as sanitation and water supply in a tropical area, wet tropical agriculture and studies particularly related to man's adaptation to life in the tropics. In conclusion, I would say that the college has had a good start and I hope that the Government will provide more money to help it along. This University College should have an important bearing on the development of northern Queensland, and I commend the Government for introducing the bill before the House.

It is a step that is long overdue and it is in the right direction.

From the remarks of one honourable member, I rather felt that there was a tendency to overlook the fact that the major hospitals in New South Wales, so far as my knowledge goes, have practically always been teaching hospitals in the sense that they were hospitals where newly registered doctors had to go through a certain course before they were set loose upon the public as private practitioners. They carried out that work under the supervision of top rank men in their own I was greatly impressed to read a stateWithout looking too closely at the details of the matter, it appears that under our assistance to mental hospitals. Although costs of hospital treatment and medical ser-that bad teeth are one of the main causes vices-the work of restoring people to health of disablement in people from childhood to and eliminating diseaseI have felt for a long time that we are not devoting, and have not devoted in the past, sufficient funds to research into means of preventing people becoming ill. There has not been enough research into the reasons why so many people require so much money to be spent on them while others go through their life without making practically any calls upon the services of doctors or hospitals. Many people have scarcely more than a very minor complaint in their lifetime although others are stricken almost from the beginning of life. I have mentioned on previous occasions an extraordinarily interesting experiment in Great Britain prior to the war. This experionly nine in the entire area. I have disment was conducted by a group of doctors who had no other purpose than to try to fulfil the main purpose of being a doctor, that is, to prevent people from becoming ill. before I start to make one penny "". That Young married couples and those about to be married came within the ambit of the experiment. No one else was included. There was a most spectacular result in a small way. If that so-called Peckham experiment had been publicized more and if the spirit in which those doctors applied themselves to considering the whole man in their treatment so that young couples and their children could avoid many diseases had spread through the medical profession generally, a great deal of the medical treatpeople, is the foundation of ill-health and ment that is sought to-day would not be necessary, the nation would be better and stronger, and ourfinanceswould be sounder. It often is most spectacular to discover some way to cure either a common complaint which is so bad that something must be done about it, or an obscure disease. Such a discovery may make a great reputation, but it is through preventive medicine that the most valuable contribution can be made to a nation's well-being and to the good health which is man's most priceless possession. This is the most important task to which a country can devote its scientific energy in the field of medicine. It is not my province to speak upon this matter at any great length. The main thing is to pass the measure, to get the work started and to find out how much more assistance may be necessary. I have a final note to strike. It is well the Commonwealth shall contribute approxiestablishedI need not emphasize the fact old age, through arthritis and other forms of rheumatism which poison the system. We are desperately short of dentists in New South Wales. Let me illustrate my point. In New South Wales is the City of Tamworth. I discussed there with a dentist, now retired, the matter of dental services. He said: "" We have nine dentists here for 20,000 people. When I commenced practice we had eight dentists and the population was between 5,000 and 6,000"". At that time there was at least one dentist in each of three adjacent minor towns, so there were no fewer than eleven dentists in the area. To-day there are no dentists in the minor townsa most grievous matter-and cussed this matter with another dentist whom I have known all my life. He said, "" It costs me £3,600 a year-£7 0 a weekman practises in a country town of about 2,000 people, with a fair surrounding district. He has to earn £3,600 a year to pay his staff and to obtain materials before he earns one penny for himself. It is not much wonder that we are having difficulty in keeping dentists in Australia. They seem to be flitting over to the United Kingdom and elsewhere to obtain more lucrative practices. This problem must be tackled because bad teeth, particularly in young much misery in later life. I have nothing further to say except that I commend the measure before the House. When I commenced my remarks I said that because the Prime Minister himself has taken an interest in the development of universities we have progressed steadily. As a counsellor of the University of New EnglandI pay my tribute to the tremendous assistance that has been given as a result of recommendations of successive committees and commissions which have dealt with the problems of development there and elsewhere. I commend tbe bill to the House, and I hope that it will receive the unanimous support of honourable members. is a very important bill. It provides that mately £1,700,000 towards the capital cost",40,Committee On The Teaching Costs
80,Mr Reynolds (Barton) [5.36],"Thisof teaching hospitals in Australia, subject to the condition that a similar amount shall be provided by the States. Under this measure, and concomitant legislation by the States, a total of approximately £3,500,000 is to be provided for teaching hospitals. This amount is approximately £167,000 less than that recommended by the Australian Universities Commission. But I shall not quibble on that small score. I am quite prepared to take the gift and to pay tribute to the far-sightedness of those responsible for this provision. I do not think that the full significance of the bill is to be gleaned solely from what it seeks to do. A little later I shall refer to what seems to me to be a principle that it establishes, a principle that millions of pounds. One can quite underI hope will be extended in the not too distant future. After making those complimentary remarks, I must say that, having perused the commission's report closely, I have a strong suspicion that financial limitations were placed upon the commission. It seems to me that at least five limitations were placed on it. First, only direct costs involved in connection with the provision of teaching hospitals were to be considered. I am prepared to concede that possibly the fact that the report was wanted within a limited time might have prevented the commission or its agents and the State committees from searching into what are called hidden costs, and it is possible that these costs could be considered later. Secondly, the inquiry seemed to concern itself almost solely with what has been described as urgently needed assistance. In one part of the report, it is stated that inquiries were not to be made into what could be construed as the ideal situation, but were to be confined to the basic fundamental necessities of teaching hospitals. Thirdly, there seemed to be a reminder to the commission that the States would have to match the contributions that the Commonwealth Government was going to make. Fourthly, the report stated that the inquiry was to be limited to a consideration of the present triennium, namely, 1961 to 1963. That provision had a practical consequence in at least one notable direction. That was, I tbink, the Royal Hospital for Women in Sydney, where it was expected that a whole new building would be wanted very early in the new triennium. That has been postponed. The fifth important limitation was that the commission was restricted to a consideration of undergraduate clinical teaching, and d'id not inquire into research or post-graduate studies. Within that compass, I notice that the Australian Universities Commission had to send questionnaires back to the various vicechancellors and their advisory committees three times to get their financial requirements scaled down to what could be regarded as a reasonable thing. In reply to the first broad questionnaire the chancellors and their advisers set out requirements which, as the report says, ran into many stand that in dealing with a new situation like this it is necessary to refine the instrument of inquiry as the inquiry progresses. That certainly seems to have been the case in this matter. It is also significant that the bill now being considered is only intended to deal with capital costs, and not with recurrent costs. We have been promised that, in the not too distant future, provision will be made for recurrent costs. The Universities Commission does recommend something like £625 per student as an equitable amount for recurrent costs, but the Prime Minister has said that this matter has been referred back to the Treasury and his own department, and I think back to the commission itself for consideration. I have just described some of the limitations of the bill, which is quite laudable in many respects. I am glad to have an intimation from the Prime Minister that the Australian Universities Commission was not told that there was a prescribed limit on the financial involvement of the Commonwealth Government, but it certainly seems quite clear that the commission went to some pains to scale down the cost. As to capital costs, I might mention that the commission recommended that 5 per cent, of the cost of new clinical buildings be put aside for the furnishing of those buildings. I have been unable to ascertain why the bill does not seek to implement that recommendation. I notice that no such provision is made in connection with the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital or the Sydney Hospital. I dare say that if I carefully studied the fifth schedule of the bill I would find no agreement anywhere with this recommendation of the commission. I hope the Prime Minister, or somebody on his behalf, will say why this provision has been omitted from the bill. The absence of any such provision relating to furnishings principally accounts for the sum of approximately £167,000 by which the commission's recommendations exceed the amount provided for in this bill. I shall be very interested to know why this recommendation is not being implemented. After carefully reading the bill, I cannot establish on what basis the prescribed limitations are made. Certainly the report does not indicate why they should be made. For instance, on page 7 of the report which was furnished to the Prime Minister, it is provided that, with regard to nurses, an arbitrary assessment of 1 per cent, of the total cost of their salary is to be ascribed to the teaching costs of the hospital. There is also to be an arbitrary assessment of 6 per cent, for anaesthetists, and for radiologists it is to be 5 per cent. I notice also that there is a limitation with respect to medical libraries within hospitals for the use of the teaching staff. In this bill the Commonwealth Government is committing itself to only 50 per cent, of the cost up to £1,000 per annum, but the report states that inadequate provision is made at the present time for hospital libraries. I believe it is also stated in the report that the cost of these libraries could be anything up to £6,000. In other words, although the provision to be made for libraries by the Commonwealth and the States between them will be approximately £2,000, the actual cost is more likely to be about £6,000. So it does seem to me that, despite the fact that there has been a commendable approach to some matters, this bill has its limitations. I am not in any way apologetic in saying countries such as Nigeria are making highly that I give this bill only qualified comcommendable efforts in relation to their mendation. After all, we in this Parliastate of development and the existing degree ment have been pretty generous and liberal of illiteracy. in our comments about the provision made for universities in Australia, but we have been confronted in the last few weeks by the public statements made by eminent people like Professor Roberts, ViceChancellor of the University of Sydney, who has gone on record as saying that his detract too greatly from the contribution university faces disaster in 1963 unless its that has been made in the provision for F.3365/62 -R -190 ] funds can be substantially increased. He has directed attention to the fact that only 3 per cent, of our graduates are going on to post-graduate study, compared with 16 per cent, in the United Kingdom. Professor Robert has directed attention to the fact, also, that we have such inadequate provision for post-graduate study in Australia. We have the further instance of the resignation of the chief librarian of the Fisher Library at the University of Sydney in recent weeks. He resigned in disgust at the grossly inadequate provision made for the library at that university. This sort of thing has been going on pretty continually for a fair while. I had practical and personal experience of it some years ago. Apparently, this situation has not been fully taken into account. I would be rather parsimonious if I did not say that I acclaim the great and noble new buildings that go up on the campus at the University of Sydney, and on that of the University of New South Wales, at Kensington. They are very commendable. WhatI am trying to say is that we should not be complacent about this. We should not feel too self-satisfied. I acclaim what has been done, but I remind the House that newly emerging nations in countries which are less well developed than is Australia are making tremendous efforts to develop their tertiary educational institutions, just the same as we are. Some of them are even surpassing our efforts. able member will acknowledge that the contribution to tertiary education made by a newly emerging nation like Indonesia is considerable in relation to its standard of living and its gross national product.

The Prime Ministers recognized, and explicitly stated, that the problem of disarmament was the most important question facing the world to-day.

They agreed that the aim should be to achieve to effective inspection and control, and that every effort should be made to secure rapid agreement to the permanent banning of nuclear weapons by all nations and to the likelihood that other nations would soon An agreement is urgent since otherwise further increase the danger of war and further complicate the problem of disarmament.

99,Mr Calwell (Melbourne,"Leade r of be in a position to build or obtain nuclearmay exist in the minds of honourable members would be, I should think, differences of expression rather than of principles. As an illustration of what I mean in this regard, let me quote from the Minister's speech as follows:The ultimate objective of disarmament negotiations is general and complete disarmament. This means the abolition of armed land, sea and air forces, weapons, armaments, military aircraft, nava] vessels, delivery vessels of all nations throughout the world, with of course the exception of forces and weapons needed for police purposes. I call this the ultimate objective because clearly it must be a very complex operation, which will take a long time to implement even after the terms and conditions have been agreed on-and experience has shown that that takes long enough. Because a completely disarmed world cannot, even in the most promising circumstances, be achieved in the immediate future, much thought has been given to partial measures of disarmament which could be rapidly agreed on and promptly carried out. These partial measures can be regarded as the first positive steps in the actual process of agreement among its signatory powers to disarmament. But they can also be seen as steps towards lowering tension and building up a climate of confidence which would make the next steps easier. They would also help in the process of disarmament by providing first-hand experience of what is involved in the operation. He continuedSuch partial measures can take many forms. Some of them merge into proposals which are not so much measures of disarmament as measures to prevent the further spread of armaments. An example is the Irish proposal adopted at the last session of the General Assembly to prevent the wider dissemination of nuclear weapons. Australia supported this proposal. The negotiations for a nuclear test ban treaty bring us to yet another category. A test ban treaty is not, strictly speaking, a disarmament measure at all: it would not necessarily reduce armaments or even keep them at their present levels or with their present distribution. But it could make a most valuable contribution to the achievement of disarmament. In the first place it could slow down the arms race by seriously impairing the ability of the nuclear powers to develop new and more powerful categories of weapons. It could also help prevent the emergence of new nuclear powers. In this way a test ban treaty could help contain the disarmament problem. It is also a field in which it should be possible for both sides to give evidence of sincerity and good faith in their efforts to reach agreement on disarmament. In entering into such an agreement neither side would be required to reduce or even to stop increasing its defensive capability; and the safeguards hearted approval of both sides of this involved should not interfere with the legitimate interests of any party. The successful conclusion of a test ban treaty would, therefore, help to produce a climate of confidence, something basic to progress towards disarmament. I further quote what the Minister saidI do not want to leave the House with the impression that Australia rejects out of hand all measures for partial disarmament; such an impression would be quite wrong. WhatI have tried to emphasize is that it is necessary, even when considering partial measures, to keep the overall picture in view and to ensure that the partial measures under consideration would not significantly disturb the overaU balance-leavee us and ours to the mercy of the Soviet Bloc's conventional strength. Provided this is done, there are a number of partial measures and first steps which can profitably be pursued. There is surely nobody who would disagree with those views. It seems quite obvious that we cannot expect to secure total disarmament except through partial disarmament. The statement lacks value in that it does not deal first with the Antarctic Treaty or with the possibility of negotiating an extend the nuclear-free zone, which the treaty guarantees from the South Pole to the 60th parallel of latitude, to the equator. I might mention in passing that Hobart is less than 1,000 miles north of the Antarctic nuclear-free zone. The preamble to this treaty recognizes that "" it is in the interest of all mankind that Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international discord"". ArticleI . of the treaty prohibits any measures of a military nature, such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military manoeuvres and the testing of any type of weapons. Article V. prohibits nuclear explosions and the disposal of radio-active waste in Antarctica. The contracting parties are permitted to appoint observers, with freedom of access to all areas, and they agree to a system of unrestricted aerial observation. It is, I think, not irrelevant to the general question of disarmament that the nations of the world should have reached an agreement which guarantees the peaceful development of a large, if isolated, portion of the globe. That treaty, which met with the wholeHouse, was a milestone along the road to peace and international goodwill. As my colleague, the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) remarked when he led for the Opposition in the debate on the Antarctic Treaty Bill in October, 1960Here at least is one place where the cold war is designed by the Soviet Union to terrorize the will not be warmed up.

No motion was ever submitted and so the House had no opportunity to express its collective opinion. I think this was unfortunate. I think it is equally unfortunate, too, that no notice was taken by anybody in the",47,Disarmament And Nuclear Tests
100,Mr Howson,Nam e them.,49,Disarmament And Nuclear Tests
101,Mr Calwell,"I will. One was the Parliament, on either side, of the fact that France exploded its first nuclear device on 13th February, 1960, and has followed that up with other explosions in the Sahara. This has added to the risk of a future nuclear war, but it may have had some bearing on Russia's attitude to resuming testing. The United States and the United Kingdom never wanted France to have the bomb, but Russian suspicions that it was otherwise could have never been allayed. That does not excuse the Russian breach, but it emphasizes the difficulties of the problem. The current American and combined AmericanBritish tests will be followed by more Russian tests. And who can say that China will not explode her own bomb in a year or two and that membership of ihe nuclear club will not continue to grow? It is the contemplation of this thought that is worrying and distressing humanity everywhere in the world. Therefore, our immediate aim must be to limit the spread of nuclear arms. In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on 25th September last year, President Kennedy laid particular stress on the need for preventing those nations not already possessing nuclear weapons from obtaining them. With a view to halting the arms race, the President proposed(1) An immediate ban on nuclear tests, signed by all nations. (2) A halt in the production of fissionable materials for weapons and in their transworld and the security of this nation at fer to any nation now lacking such weapons. (3) Prohibition of the transfer of control over the Minister for External Affairs himself nuclear weapons to nations not already possessing them. I think it is worthwhile bearing these proposals by President Kennedy in mind because they underline the importance the United States places on the need to limit the possession of nuclear arms to as few countries as possible The difficulties associated with control of testing, even when possession of nuclear weapons is limited to four powers, is demonstrated in the actions of France. France was not a party to the three-year moratorium agreement, and apparently felt that her national interests, as she saw them, entitled her to override the wishes of her Nato allies, not to mention public opinion in the world generally. As I have said, the Labour Party believes that the spirit of the Antarctic Treaty serves as a light to guide us along the road to fulfilling our aspirations of world peace. The signatory nations of the treaty include the four powers who already possess nuclear weapons, as well as Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, Japan, New Zealand, Norway and the Union of South Africa. The Labour Party believes that the Australian Government should call upon the treaty nations, together with China, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma, Malaya, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Viet Nam, the Philippines, Indonesia, and all countries in Africa and South America to meet together in conference with a view to extending the nuclear-free zone beyond the 60 degrees south latitude, the present limit of the Antarctic Treaty, so as to include the whole of the Southern Hemisphere. Can it be doubted that such a proposition is worth the serious attention of this Government and of the world powers? Can it be doubted that the people of Australia would support the Government if it took the initiative in bringing such a conferenceabout? Can it be doubted that such a conference, with such an objective in view, would of itself have a healthy effect in reducing international tensions and suspicions? In discussions about disarmament it is impossible, if we have the peace of the heart, to overlook the special importance of China. In his statement of 5th April, pointed out the dangers arising from the possibility of that nation obtaining nuclear arms. But the Minister failed to carry his argument to any conclusion. The conclusion seems to me to be crystal clear. It is that Communist China must be brought into the disarmament negotiations. This was certainly implied by the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference resolution, when they referred to the need for all nations to disarm, and by President Kennedy himself, when he referred to the need to prevent the transfer of nuclear arms to any nation not now possessing them. How can we have any hope of preventing China from becoming a nuclear power unless she becomes a party to international agreements and accepts the responsibilities imposed by such agreements? The phrase "" unilateral disarmament"" has been bandied about in discussions in Australia, usually by uninformed people, and sometimes without a very clear understanding of what it means or of its relevance to the Australian situation. In the United Kingdom, there is a considerable, and very vocal, body of opinion which favours the immediate abandonment of nuclear arms by Britain. This view is not shared by the British Government or by the British Labour Party. It should be emphasized that the British situation is very different from the Australian, if only because Britain has the bomb and Australia has not. I do not advocate or support "" unilateral disarmament "" and I know of no responsible citizen who does. The people of various callings and political faiths who have been holding public meetings in Australia in'recent times to discuss nuclear tests and disarmament are not "" unilateralists "" because the resolutions they have sponsored and approved contain the following words which are a paraphrase of the words used in the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference resolution"" to achieve total world-wide disarmament, subject to effective inspection and control"". If the term "" unilateral disarmament "" is taken in a wider sense to mean that thc Western alliance should renounce nuclear weapons, irrespective of what the other side might do, it is clearly a concept that takes no cognisance of the actual or possible behaviour of nations. Nobody on this side of the House has ever urged such a course upon the United States, although a certain Sydney newspaper, in its corrosive hatred of Labour, has tried to create just that impression. We recognize that the United States has a dual responsibility in the world to-d'ay. First, the United States must look to its own security and has a right to maintain that security in the way its elected leaders consider best. Secondly, her position as leader and protector of the Western alliance imposes upon the United States a heavy responsibility for the security of her allies and, indeed, the maintenance of the peace of the world. Recognizing this, the Labour Party has always supported the American view that any nuclear arms ban must be part of a general programme of total and complete disarmament, made through and backed by the authority of the United Nations and containing adequate safeguards. At the same time, we have always recognized that Australia has its part to play in the Western alliance; and that implies our right, or rather duty, to defend ouselves in the event of war by whatever means circumstances may dictate. The policy of the Labour Party on defence contains planks which reads as follows:Maintenance of Australia as an integral part of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Complete co-operation with other units of the British Commonwealth of Nations in order to ensure joint action against aggression. Co-operation within the British Commonwealth of Nations in support of the United Nations Organization for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security. The mobilisation of the entire resources of the nation in the event of attack. Equally, we say that as a member of an alliance we have a right to make our voice beard within the councils of the alliance and in the councils of the world generally. Australia has signed no treaty which commands our silent acquiescence on matters which we deem to affect the security of the nation or the welfare of its people. Nor have we, of the Labour Party, ever subscribed to the view that we must watch with uncritical approval every action of our friends, even those of our great and powerful friends with whose distinguished leaders the Prime Minister is, as he has so often told us, so utterly familiar. There is little in the voting record of Australia at the United Nations to indicate that this Government has ever recognized the difference between independence and neutralism, or sees more virtue in the one than in the other. Our policy speech for the 1961 elections contains certain declarations which are clear, forthright and unequivocal. With the concurrence of honourable members, I incorporate them in "" Hansard "". They are as follows:World War II. ended in 1945, but peace still eludes us. Since then mankind has lived under the threat of another and more terrible war. Mankind yearns for peace, and the Labor Party shares this hope. It believes that every effort must be made to resolve all the problems that divide peoples and nations through the United Nations Organization by negotiation, and in accordance with principle. The free world must be ever ready to negotiate, but can never surrender to threats or blackmail. My colleagues and I have expressed our abhorrence at Russia's action in conducting the recent series of ference of the Australian Labour Party held nuclear tests with a callous disregard of the effects at Brisbane on l l t h March, 1957:of fall-out in the atmosphere, and with a contempt for world opinion on the dangers to world peace that such a course might create. The condemnations of Mr Nehru, Tenku Abdul Rahman, Marshal Tito and the leaders of the neutralist powers at the Belgrade Conference of these wanton acts had our strong support. The Labor Party beheves in Summit meetings of a sense of "" desperation"". This desperation is the leaders of the most powerful nations to help partly due to the vacillation and delay in arranging in the solution of the immediate and compelling high level political talks aiming at the effective problems of disarmament and the banning of prevention of the use of atomic and hydrogen nuclear tests. The future of Germany and Berlin bombs by any nations, whether for purposes of are bound up and related to these questions, but, war or experimental purposes. important as they are, they are not as important as universal disarmament.

And then there are the terrible problems of housing, food, markets and unemployment, while the seemingly insoluble diseases and evils of cancer, blood diseases, malnutrition and neuroses rank as comparatively unimportant. Yet there is no suggestion or offer of any and physical and social ills can be cured. contribution comparable to that being spent on nuclear weapons by the nations involved and their allies so that the causes of these diseases and physical and social ills can be cured.

Mankind can live in peace if only agreement can be reached by all nations through the United Nations with proper safeguards to ban nuclear tests and promote world disarmament. The task is a heavy one and it will not be achieved quickly. Let us accept our moral responsibilities and do what we can where we can influence world thought to bring about world peace and international amity and understanding. We must not give way to despair, nor to fear, and no matter how often our efforts might be rebuffed or seem to fail, we must act as our consciences dictate and try to change the thinking of governments everywhere by invoking the ideals of all people everywhere. ter) [8.31] Mr Speaker, the Leader of matters upon which unanimous agreement the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) has read us, has been reached. That is something that very carefully, a long statement, and I must honourable members should note-nothin g say that throughout the first 90 per cent. is included in such a communique unless of it I wondered whether he had any point on which to criticize the statement that had been made by the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick). However, in the last bit, if I may so describe it, he went through the motions of warming up, and this produced suitable applause from his, until then, bemused followers. But one thing that he said-and I have had the advantage of reading this paper-wa s thisVet there is no suggestion or offer of any contribution comparable to that being spent on nuclear weapons by the nations involved and their allies so that the causes of these diseases That is, of course, what might be described as a distributive allegation. It is put forward as an allegation as much against the United States of America and the United Kingdom, the Western Powers, as against the Soviet Union. I fear, Sir, that the honourable gentleman has forgotten that if anybody cared to examine the contributions made in the field of health, in the great antibiotics in the positive combating of disease, he would find that the Western world has an unchallenged position in those fields. He would also find that there are millions of people who can gaze from time to time on the sputniks and other things that may be put into the sky by the Soviet Union, who would not be there to see them if it had not been for the devoted scientific and medical research of the free world. Therefore, the honourable gentleman falls into error, if I may be allowed to say so, in distributing these allegations as if they applied with equal force to both sides in this great and unhappy conflict. I want to try to direct the attention of the House to the real problems that we have to consider. The honourable gentleman has made, I am happy to say, several references to the communique of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers, issued at the time of the last conference in March of last year. I know something about this, because I was one of those Prime Ministers. I also know that no communique emerges from a Prime",49,Disarmament And Nuclear Tests
102,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Prime MinisMinisters' Conference unless it refers to it has been unanimously agreed that it should be included. Therefore, on the occasion in question all the Prime Ministers agreed to the statement made with regard to atomic tests. These are the precise words of it Every effort should be made to secure rapid agreement to the permanent banning of nuclear weapons tests by all nations and to arrangements The Soviet Unionfor verifying the observance of the agreement. Such an agreement is urgent, since otherwise other broke the moratorium on testing with a long and, countries may soon become nuclear powers, which obviously long prepared, series of tests.

I think those words are well worth quoting. of the S-oviet Union in any given year. We-and I speak as one of the partiesheartily supported that statement, and we House will recall that one of the pretences supported it for the simple sake of of the Soviet Union was that it could not humanity. The profound cause of humanity have inspection because this would involve required, in our mind, that a statement of espionage inside its borders. The statement this kind should be made. There were talks about disarmament. There were conferences about it. They were abortive. You can go on talking about disarmament, in general, for a long time. But here, in our view, was a specific matter on which we thought, or at any rate we hoped, that sensible people of all nations could agree. We hoped that they could all agree to stop further testing of nuclear weapons, and we said so, the Prime Minister of Great Britain amongst us. And what happened? It was not more than a few months thereafter when the Soviet Union, which had itself undertaken to conduct no further tests pending agreement on their abolition, and at the very time when the powers were meeting in Geneva to discuss not only the general principle of abolishing tests, but also the essential correlative of effecting inspection, so that we might not be misled, simply broke up the discussions, walked out, and within 48 hours began a series of at least 30 nuclear tests, preparations for which had obviously been made long before. That is the kind of problem that the world is dealing with. We need not live in a world of abstract phrases. We are living in a most terribly difficult world. We are living in a world of stark realities, and unless we admit the existence of these realities we will walk into danger. That was the position, and our distinguished visitor of the other nightI am not going to discuss any other matters in connection with his visit because honourable members are quite entitled to their views about everything that he said-mad e this statementWhile we were still negotiating, they have involved an international inspection team looking at less than l/2000th of the territories Honourable members on both sides of the went onBut as the Soviets were still unwilling to agree, President Kennedy felt obliged to resume our own testing and for the security of the free world. As you know, he reached that decision most reluctantly. And we stand prepared to stop testing at any moment that the Soviets agreed to a test ban treaty with essential international verification. That is a pretty plain statement by the man who, as second to the President of the United States, occupies one of the most responsible and powerful positions in the world. He went onBut the President of the United States will not accept the responsibility for allowing people who want their kind of world order to move ahead of the free world in this nuclear field. I wonder who disagrees with that? I wonder if there is anybody in this HouseI do not really believe there is-wh o believes that, after all, this series of tests by the Soviet Union which will add enormously to the Soviet Union's knowledge and technology in this field, the United States of America should have said, "" Well, you can have it; we will do nothing about it. We are prepared to stabilize the knowledge of the free world in this field while you go on year after year, month after month, so that you will have the power to impose on the world what is to us your rotten system of government."" Really, Mr Speaker, I would have thought it hardly admitted of debate. Now, there are practical issues here, and I think that unless they are resolved by unanimity in this House, they ought to be analysed frankly on both sides of the chamber. The first of them is involved in what I have just said: Should the Western nuclear powers cease testing whatever the Soviet does? When I say that, let me elaborate a little. I feel that there is a great relying upon the punic faith of the authoriassumption in many minds that all these tests are tests of weapons to be deposited on the enemy and to destroy or to blast his cities. But we have got to a stage when a great deal of testing in the world is of what are called the anti-missile missiles. These tests are devoted to discovering how to defend a country and how to defend hundreds of thousands of innocent people against an attack from the air. You cannot have one of these things done and forget about the other. You cannot have the Soviet Union perfecting its means of attack, and perhaps developing its means of resistance by special experiments in the nuclear field, and say to our own side-and do not let us forget that, alive or dead, it is our side"" You are not to do it. You stop where you are."" All these experimentations that go on have not only a relevance to attack but also a relevance to defence. Therefore, I propound my question and I would like to think that it reached the people of Australia: Should fhe Western nuclear powers cease testing nuclear devices whatever the Soviet Union does? The clear answer to that in the name of humanity is, "" No "". The second issue is this: Can there be any effective cessation of testing which could give to the world a feeling that there was a calm in the storm or a hope for ordinary humanity, unless we have inspection or verification-whateve r the word might be? Are we so naive in the free world-w e are not really, as we have a long history of practical wisdom and experiment -as to say to the prospective enemy-the country which is the great and only threat to the peace of the world: We will take your word for it. We do not want anybody to go near your country to see whether you are conducting tests or not. Can anybody imagine such a thing? The United States of America, the great western nuclear power, and the other western powers have gone to great lengths, as we were reminded the other night, to reduce their demands for verification to a mere minimum. Are they to abandon those demands? Would we sleep more comfortably if they did? Would the ban-the-bomb processionists sleep more comfortably if they knew that on our side tests had ceased and development had come to an end, and that we were ties in the Kremlin? I do not believe it. We say: No. I do not know what other people might say, but we say: No. In the third place there is an issue that perhaps scarcely emerged in what my honourable opponent had to say but it is clearly implicit in certain things that have happened. It is this: Should Australia, not a nuclear power herself-remembe r that in .ill these matters-permanentl y contract herself out of permitting nuclear weapons to be used in war or defence or in the grave arbitrament of war on her soil? BecauseI did hear suggestions that when the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick) said we were not prepared to give a permanent undertaking to that effect, he was under criticism. Under criticism! Have we reached the very ecstasy of suicide in Australia? Are we prepared to say that come war, come peace, come any circumstances, nobody shall bring a nuclear weapon on our soil or discharge a weapon of that kind there? Are we bent on selfdestruction, or are we prepared to sit up and wake up to the fact that those nuclear powers which are on our side in the contest of freedom, cannot protect us if we warn them off the premises in perpetuity. These are the three questions. All must have considerable difficulty in understanding how there could be more than the one clear answer to any of them. There is certainly nothing in what the honourable gentleman has said that, in form, cuts across what I have been saying in these matters; but if there is a feeling in this Parliament anywhere that this attitude is wrong, let us for the sake of our own self respect, for the sake of our standing in the world and for the sake of our capacity to talk to the other countries of the world, learn it now. Let them stand up and be counted. Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has made virtually a new statement on the subject of",53,Disarmament And Nuclear Tests
103,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [8.48],"Th edisarmament and nuclear tests. I do not think there is anybody in this place who would not condemn the Russian breach of the three years' moratorium six months ago. I do not think there is anybody in this place who would not believe that the United States of America would not have resumed testing if Russia had not resumed testing. The only difference would have emerged in what the Prime Minister called his third question. Therefore, I think it is essential to get clear a few basic facts. Russia has not imparted nuclear weapons never exploded, and does not seek to to any other country. The United States explode, any nuclear weapons or other has not imparted nuclear weapons to any devices in this hemisphere. So the balance other country. Neither Russia nor the of deterrents between America and the United States of America has ever exploded Soviet remains exactly as it is if the southern a nuclear weapon or tested a nuclear device hemisphere becomes a nuclear free zone, but in our hemisphere.

I should have thought that both sides when the House met two months ago. We of the House could have agreed with 90 are debating that statement now. It is a per cent, of what the Prime Minister said, long statement covering some sixteen pages. just as he said that he could have agreed It is headed, "" Disarmament and Nuclear with 90 per cent, of what the Leader of the Tests"". First, to use the Minister's own Opposition said. However, we believe on words, it gives "" only the barest outline of this side that Australia is not doing enough the problems raised by disarmament"". to ensure that nuclear weapons are confined There can be no cavil at the Minister's to those who already have them and to the areas in which they are already located. It has been asserted outside that Australia would be falling down in its job of defending itself and letting down its principal ally, America, and its secondary ally, Great Britain, if it were to join in an appeal to make the southern hemisphere a nuclear free zone. America has never offered nuclear weapons to Australia or to any other country. Congress has expressly forbidden it. America has no bases, and seeks no bases, in this hemisphere. America has The Prime Minister has asked rhetorically The Leader of the Opposition has stated ago. The Leader of the Opposition sought a further statement on the general subject analysis of the scope and complexity of the problems. Then, as the Minister saidNegotiations for a nuclear test ban treaty deserve lem was a test ban treaty. It is plain from particular attention. On this second aspect the Minister deals with the two specific matters which have come for decision to the Australian Government. The first is the reply which the Australian Prime Minister gave to the British Prime Minister who had asked the Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand to state their attitude on the use of the British Christmas Island by America to test weapons as a consequence of the Russian breach of the three-year moratorium. The second is the reply which the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick) gave to the Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations following the Swedish resolution asking what our attitude would be to the question of renouncing the manufacture, acquisition and reception of nuclear weapons. acknowledged, there is a difference between the reply which the New Zealand Prime Minister gave and the reply which the Australian Prime Minister gave to the question of the use of Christmas Island. Our Prime Minister was quite brief and blunt on it. His first statement in this House in reply to a question by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren) wasThe position is that before the Prime Ministet of the United Kingdom made his statement on this matter, he communicated with me and with the Australian Government, and we told him, as the fact is, that we had no objection to the course he proposed. That may be. Perhaps it was not our job to object to the course which Britain proposed, but the New Zealand Prime Minister took a more cautious attitude. He said that he did not welcome the decision. Later he said that there were only two final solutions to the balance of terror upon which America and Russia were embarking. One was catastrophe and the other was a binding international agreement on disarmament whether complete, covering all arms or, as a first step, banning further nuclear tests. He pointed out that this was the only real solution and that the quest for it must be pushed ahead with the utmost urgency. A couple of weeks after the Minister for External Affairs made his statement to this Parliament, the New Zealand Prime Minister again stated that his country had long and strenuously advocated in the United Nations that the only solution to this proba reading of the New Zealand Prime Minister's statements that he gave much more cautious approval to Mr Macmillan's request than did our Prime Minister. He regretted, but accepted, the inevitability of the tests. He understood the reasons why America had to resume them. However, our Prime Minister washed his hands of the matter. More importantly, there is the reply which the Minister for External Affairs sent to the Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations in which he claimed that in the last General Assembly Australia had supported the initiative of Ireland in seeking a ban on the extension of nuclear weapons. I want to trace the Government's attitude on this matter to show how little leadership it has given. In his reply the Minister for External As the Minister himself Affairs quoted the Prime Minister's statement in 1957 that Australia did not have, and for the time being did not seek, nuclear weapons. He went on to sayThe views expressed in the Australian Prime Minister's statement of 1957 which I have just quoted predate the initiative in the United Nations of the Government of the Republic of Ireland That is the term which Australia alone, among the members of the United Nations, uses to describe Ireland to prevent the wider dissemination of nuclear weapons. Australia's policy and the reasons for it remain as stated by the Prime Minister in 1957. This position has been reaffirmed in the speeches and votes of the Australian Delegations to successive Sessions of the United Nations General Assembly and most recently at thc Sixteenth Session of the General Assembly. Ireland first raised the subject at the United Nations in 1958 when it proposed to the First Committee that a committee should be set up to study the dangers inherent in the further dissemination of nuclear weapons. The resolution was carried in the First Committee by 37 votes to nil, but 44 countries abstained from voting. Australia was among them. In 1959 Ireland again sponsored a motion which suggested that the ten nations disarmament committee should consider means whereby the powers producing nuclear weapons would refrain from handing over the control of such weapons to any nation not possessing them, and whereby the powers not possessing such weapons would refrain from manufacturing them. Australia supported the resolution on that occasion. Contemporaneously, there was a resolution expressing the grave concern of the General Assembly over the intention of the Government of France to conduct nuclear tests, and requesting France to refrain from such tests. That resolution was overwhelmingly carried by many other countries, including New Zealand. Australia abstained from voting. The matter came up a third time in 1960, when again Ireland sponsored a resolution calling upon all governments to make every effort to achieve permanent agreement on the prevention of the wider dissemination of nuclear weapons, and calling upon the powers producing such weapons, to refrain as a temporary and voluntary measure pending negotiation of such a permanent agreement, from relinquishing control of such weapons to any nation not possessing them, and from transmitting to it the information necessary for their manufacture. Australia again abstained, but New Zealand supported it. to show how, on the first three occasions when these matters came up before the United Nations, our Government prevaricated and equivocated. The only time when our Government supported a proposal for limiting the nuclear nations was in the last session when the resolution was carried unanimously. The Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick) did not accurately state to U Thant the attitude of this Government in past times Mr Harold Holt -What is your attitude? House, and I thought you were following what was said. You gave every appearance of following it and absorbing it. We say that the number of nations which has nuclear weapons should be limited to the present number, and that the areas where nuclear tests have taken place should be left as they are. More specifically, we say that the initiative of all the nuclear nations in declaring the area from the South Pole to 60 degrees south a nuclear-free zone should be extended to cover the whole of this hemisphere. If any other country in this hemisphere manufactured or acquired or received nuclear weapons, admittedly Australia would have to consider its position; but Australia should not be the first country in the southern hemisphere to manufacture or acquire or receive nuclear weapons. Nobody suggests that we can manufacture nuclear weapons before China, say, gets them, or maybe some few other countries. But it would be possible for us to acquire nuclear weapons, as we did in the past. We know that Britain was carrying out tests between 1952 and 1957, but Britain no longer seeks to carry out tests at Maralinga, or Emu Field, or in the Monte Bellos. Britain is not asking us to do it now. We ought to take the initiative in expanding this nuclear-free zone to cover the rest of this hemisphere. The Minister for External Affairs said that to establish nuclear-free zones would give the Soviet an advantage since it is only the Western nuclear deterrent which holds in check the Soviet bloc's undoubted superiority in conventional forces. He went on to say that such proposals would weaken or neutralize the nuclear deterrent without reducing Communist strength in conventional weapons. I reiterate what I said earlier-if the whole of the southern hemisphere were a nuclear-free zone, it would in no way jeopardize American or Western defence. It would in no way promote or facilitate anti-Western aggression. Australia's defence would be promoted if other countries were to accept such a proposal, and declare the rest of this hemisphere nuclear-free. We are in the best position to take the initiative because we are the only country in the southern hemisphere which has set off nuclear bombs or which has tested nuclear devices. No other country in this hemisphere has tried to do so or is seeking to do so. The position as it is now, and as it will be in the foreseeable future, is that there are and will be no other countries with these weapons in the southern hemisphere and we, as the only country which has ever had them in the past-nobod y is asking us to have them now-ar e in the best position to give a lead. This is not a question of unilateral nuclear disarmament. You do not have disarmament unless you give up some arms which you already have; and you do not have unilateral disarmament",55,Disarmament And Nuclear Tests
104,Mr Kelly,S o what?,58,Disarmament And Nuclear Tests
105,Mr Whitlam,I just cite those cases,58,Disarmament And Nuclear Tests
106,Mr Whitlam,"You were in theunless you give up some arms which you have had and which other people would still have if you gave up yours. It is not a quesaction of our people to the terrible consetion of nuclear disarmament because nobody in this hemisphere has nuclear arms, and we are the only people who have ever had them. Our hands have not been clean in this matter up till now, because we are the only people who have tested nuclear weapons. America is not asking us to take these arms. Congressional laws would prevent her from giving these weapons to us, and America has never sought to explode a weapon or test a device in this hemisphere. The targets which America must keep in mind can be better reached from the northern hemisphere than from the southern hemisphere. If we were to accept those weapons now, we would be provoking our neighbours into taking the same measures which we would have to take if they accepted the weapons. We have not had clean hands in the past, and we cannot wash our hands of the future. We cannot divest ourselves of responsibility henceforth. We should take the initiative. Whereas in the past we have abstained twice from voting on, and only once supported, proposals for restricting the ownership and testing of nuclear weapons, every other country in the southern hemisphere has supported such proposals consistently. In the Antarctic Treaty every existing nuclear power has set an example which we should now take a lead in extending. member's time has expired. Treasurer) [9.8] -Nuclea r military capacity is a grim and awesome fact of our contemporary experience. Every one in this Parliament is unhappily conscious of its extent. to-night, one could never have imagined None of us can shut his mind to the problems it creates for us. No politician worthy of the trust placed in him by his election to the National Parliament can shirk the responsibility of facing the issues involved. which the Labour caucus in this Parliament In the time available to me I shall not be able to cover the very wide ground of all the issues raised in the statement presented by my colleague, the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick), but there is one aspect on which I do wish to concentrate. Before doing so, let me just say that we do abhor war, that we are all determined to do what we can to avert its horror. We can understand and share the emotional requences of nuclear war in our time. But governments and parliaments have a responsibility to face realistically and squarely the issues which affect so directly the national security and the continuance of world peace. Binding ourselves now, as I gather that many members of the Opposition would have us do, to a policy that at no time in the future, and no matter what new situations may arise, shall we ever obtain nuclear weapons would involve a gamble with the future security of this country which no responsible government could accept. Nuclear assistance by our allies, or, in the course of time, nuclear capability in our own hands, may be vital to our security. Australia, with its relatively small population and resources, cannot afford to discard the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons which might offset the man-power masses which could be directed against us or an invasion fleet which could not be resisted by other means. provided an opportunity for the Australian Labour Party to tell us just what it says. All that I can go on, Sir, is what has been published, and not contradicted in its detail, in the press of this country, and which, here to-night, the Opposition had an opportunity to re-state in authoritative form. But what has the Opposition done? We have had from the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) a windy smokescreen. They have tried to cover in a mass of verbiage the fact that they have no policy on these matters. Listening to this debate that here was an issue on which the executive of this Federal Parliamentary Labour Party was divided, as we understand, by seven votes to six-that here are issues on is so incapable of giving any decision as to feel bound to refer the matter of a decision to the federal conference of the Australian Labour Party. Where has any hint of that emerged from the speech which we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition this evening? As they went blandly on their",58,Disarmament And Nuclear Tests

110,Mr Harold Holt,"This debate hasway, one would have assumed that this was just a debating exercise-that one just makes bland statements and that is all there is to it. Sir, involved in the matter before this Parto have presented to the caucus-and , again, liament to-night are some of the most vital and most compelling issues that this Parliament will ever have to face in our time, and we shall do no credit to this Parliament if we allow it to adjourn without having the Labour Party tell us where it stands on the vital issues that are now before us. The Labour Party has failed to declare itself, not because of any lack of discussion on the one matter on which I am concentrating. On 90 per cent, of what stands in the statement made by my colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, we are in agreement. But we have a concrete test-the sort of thing that governments have to face, not only week by week, but almost day by day. There are difficult, unpopular and testing decisions to be made. Here, that kind of decision arises from the request which was put to us by U Thant, the Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations, pursuant to a resolution of that organization, asking us where we stood on the question of whether we would permit the use of nuclear weapons in our defence, and whether Australia would ever be permitted to become a base for the use of nuclear weapons in our defence. That was a straightforward request by the Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations. That was the sort of thing which we as a government have had to look at and face up to Honourable gentlemen opposite, knowing that we had declared ourselves on this issue, had to face up to it, too, because they were bound, when there was a resumption of this debate, to state where Labour stood on these matters. So they came to the issue in the executive of the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party, and there has been no lack of discussion on these matters. They were discussed there and the Opposition found that its members were hopelessly divided. It was only, apparentlyI await contradiction on this point if I am wrong -o n the casting vote of the Leader of the Opposition himself that the executive could resolve the matter within its own ranks by a vote of seven to six. Then these matters were taken to the caucus. The Opposition watered down the resolution and included a few comforting paragraphs. The resolution which the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), who leads for the Opposition in these matters, is alleged I invite contradiction from honourable gentlemen opposite in good faith-con tained a number of passages which can be quoted. However, I have not the time to do all that, and I take one particular passage which stands on its own. The resolution referred to the attitude of the Australian Labour Party and statedIt declares its opposition to nuclear tests at any time by any nation and believes that the Government: (B) Should assure the United Nations that Australia, in its desires to make the Southern Hemisphere a> nuclear-free zone, will renounce nuclear tests, stock-piling and bases on Australian soil. That is an understandable viewpoint, Sir. I do not for one moment lack respect for the depth of feeling and the sincerity of many gentlemen on the opposite side of the House, some of whom have given their service to this country in war. But, as a result of the abhorrence of war which they have thus developed, they have become pacifist in outlook and resistant to this kind of thing. I can respect that sincerity. If there is an honest difference of opinion held by members of this Parliament who are elected by the people to serve and give expression to their views, this is the place in which such a matter should be determined. If these matters go to the caucus and are fought out there, a resolution being either adopted or rejected, and that decision, in whatever form it finally emerges from caucus, comes to this Parliament, we and the people of Australia know where Labour stands. But what was the fate of the resolution in this instance, Sir? Here was a direct issue on which the executive of the parliamentary party had concentrated its attention. Finally, it took the matter to the Labour caucus in the form of a resolution of which it could approve. Here again, I invite contradiction if I have the facts wrong. We understand that by 50 votes to 27 the Parliamentary Labour Party decided not to decide a policy. It did not decide to refer the determination of a policy to a body of people freely elected by the Australian community and answerable to people in this country. Suppose a Labour the community-accountabl e by their votes government had been in office in this place to the Australian community. for decision to the federal conference of the Australian Labour Party"". Who are the members of the federal conference, Sir? They are not accountable to the electorate. They are not known to right thing then; you were not. the electorate. Are they to determine the policies which will guide the destinies of this of the Labour Party at that time was very nation and determine vital consequences for different from what it is to-day. the security of this country? That, I believe, Ls an even more important issue facing us to-night than what is inherent in the substance of what has been put before the -Order! I call the House to order and ask Parliament by the Minister for External Opposition members to extend to the Affairs. Here we have a great issue of Treasurer the same courtesy as has been national security. That, of course, is treextended to other honourable members. mendously important.

119,Mr Harold Holt,"I am right onperforce have taken that-becaus e that is the way the Labour Party works-to their caucus. How would the Labour caucus, which says to-day that it cannot decide this matter and must refer it to its federal conference, have faced up to this test of responsible government. Would caucus members have revealed themselves, as I sincerely believe they would, to be as hopelessly divided on this issue in government as they have shown themselves to be in Opposition. No one can argue that they have not the authority to make this kind of decision. The Leader of the Opposition had no hesitation in telling the Australian people that the Labour Party, if elected, would not give effect to the socialist programme in the ensuing three years. That seemed to him to be a desirable assurance to be given at election time. He told us subsequently, and his colleagues have emphasized it, that the Parliamentary Labour Party has the responsibility, in between federal conferences, of interpreting the policy of the party. The Opposition is in an even stronger position in this matter, because in 1955 the federal conference of the Labour Party, in effect, placed the responsibility upon the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party of deciding problems which arise out of nuclear war capacity. I shall quote from a conference decision made in Hobart on 14th March, 1955. It is in these termsConference directs the Federal Parliamentary it is not entitled to the confidence or the Labour Party to press for effective action directed support of the people. towards these great ends. This was the great end of deciding where the party should stand on problems associated with nuclear war. The Opposition talked earlier of vacillation and lack of courage. In the long history of this Parliament I have not seen a more abject or humiliating retreat from responsibility than that shown by the federal Parliamentary Labour Party upon these issues. What they are inviting the Australian people to support is government by remote control. I have nothing against Mr Chamberlain, Mr Colbourne or any one else associated with the federal conference. However, they have not been elected by the Australian people. Opposition members have been so elected and they have the responsibility of deciding issues affecting the security, the strength and the welfare of the Australian people. They cannot discharge that responsibility by handing it over to some remote body which will prop them up from behind. We have all heard the fable of the ostrich that buried its head in the sand. Here we find an Australian Labour Party which not only buries its head in the sand, but waits for the ostrich keeper to come along, shake its tail feathers, kick it from behind and tell it where it should go. The Australian people deserve something better than that. Government is a difficult business. It involves the problem of facing up to decisions that call for courage and resolution day by day, week by week, month by month, and it is no good honourable members opposite, just because these are uncomfortable, dangerous, difficult decisions, deciding that they can serve the Australian people best by shirking those decisions and handing them over to some remote body which is not answerable to the Australian people. We have not merely a great issue in the field of nuclear capacity before Parliament; we have before it the issue whether the Australian Labour Party, as at present constituted, can provide a body to governa body firm, resolute and courageous enough to meet the perilous problems which face the nation. On the evidence Labour has failed the country on this great issue and debate began in a calm atmosphere that befitted the occasion, for the House is discussing one of the most agonizing problems confronting civilization to-day. However, it did not take the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) five minutes to break it down to the level of a bar-room brawl. The reason is that he knows nothing about the subject. So, instead of saying something which might help prevent men, women and children from being banished from the face of the earth by the effects of nuclear tests or warfare, he launches a phony attack upon the Labour Party over what it has said and done. As he knows nothing about this subject and even less about the Australian Labour Party, he can be answered in a very few minutes. First, he asked why the Labour Party would brawl about this",61,Disarmament And Nuclear Tests
120,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [9.27],"Thismatter, why its members would argue about it. But is it not democratic to discuss these things? Is it not good that we have violent feelings in our party over this matter? This is not a trifling issue. It is a great issue; it is a monumental issue; it is the greatest moral issue we have faced in this House. The Treasurer said that federal executive voting on this issue was seven to six. What a tribute it is to the Labour Party that with some men strong enough to take one view, and others to hold another, the matter was taken peacefully, through a democratic process, to caucus! Not being able to get a decision there, the Opposition went to the conference, which is the top deliberative body of our party. We all know that, although the Minister does not understand it. The longer this subject is thrashed out, the keener it is fought, and the more people that are brought into it, the happier I shall Parliament. He did not bring it here until be, and so will the Australian Labour Party, for we have many things to prove against the Government. The Treasurer spoke about the Opposition having rows and having differences of opinion. Ever since this Government came to power, after it was drawn to the edge of the precipice and saved by one vote-and the Communist preferences did that it has done nothing but brawl. There is the war between the private members on the Government side and the Government itself over defence. That filled the newspapers for weeks. I will not bother the House by reading out the reports of that war, but we had the honourable member for Barker( Mr would not bring the letter to this House Forbes), the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) and others pressing the Government savagely and constantly on this matter. Yet you say to us, "" You should not argue about those things"". Then there is the question which has been raised time and time again by the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Now we come back to the big man. We Wentworth) and the honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes), who are on the outer in Tegard to government matters, and who have created a minor and very ineffective cave in the Government parties. Finally, what about the brawl going on between the Liberals and the members of the Australian Country Party over the European Common Market? The Liberals stood there and dropped the Union Jacks on the floor while they elevated "" Old Glory "", and the Country Party members looked as glum as all-get-out, as they say in the United States of America. There is a sharp division. There is division between the Prime Minister and his deputy, yet you people opposite talk to us about divisions in the Labour Party. This matter of division was brought up here, and it should not be argued in a debate of this nature, but some of the statements made have to be answered here. The Treasurer asked, "" What would happen if the Labour Party were in power and U Thant's letter came to it?"" Well, we would not do what the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick) did. He sat down and wrote his own reply to the letter and did not bring it into the Parliament until forced to do so-and that was one of the most important letters ever to come to this it was dragged in as a result of a speech made on the motion for the adjournment by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward). Then the Minister came rumbling in and put annexures, additions and everything else into "" Hansard"" to cover himself up. I would much prefer to go to the federal conference of my party than do what the Minister did, using the external affairs power and using his constitutional authority to write direct to U Thant, the Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations, on the most vital issue that we have had before us-non-nuclea r and nuclear clubs. He elected to do that-the little bantam dictator that he is-and until forced to do so. So when you ask for answers, we give them, and they are complete answers. The Treasurer himself, realizing that he had no case to argue, tried to make a fight of it-a n ordinary election fight. This is too big for that. have a look at the drooping prose of the old stuff year in and year out which says nothing at all about those problems which, as I said, are agonizing to the people outside. The real questions are: Where do we stand? Where is the moral issue brought into this? What do you do about nuclear testing on either side? It does not matter whether it is Khrushchev or Kennedy that is letting off the bombs. Surely you are",62,Disarmament And Nuclear Tests
121,Prime Minister ( Mr Menzies),"the samenot suggesting that the bomb let off by one side is full of death and disaster while the other side's bomb is full of oil shares and chewing gum. They are both the most horrible devices of all time, and if you have not the moral courage to stand up to-day in this matter you gentlemen opposite do not deserve your places in this Parliament. This moral issue that we are debating to-night would not have come to this House if the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr going to have an argument with a man you Calwell) had not forced the debate and if we had not, by our discussions during the last few days and last week, brought the matter to a head. That is so, because the Government sneaked away from the thing by issuing a statement. Who reads the weary handouts of the Department of External Affairs? Hidden in them are some vague conclusions. Had things been left at that we would not have had this matter brought into the House. A statement would have been read and a statement would have been tabled, and a desultory debate would have taken place. But we have made an issue of this matter, and we want to pin down the Prime Minister, with all his rhetorical flourishes and his utter lack of sincerity, and ask him: Can the world to-day live on the balance of terror? Can it live on the question of how much the Americans have got and how much the Russians have got? Are you going to ask the women and the kiddies of this country to live in an atmosphere of the balance of powerwhether our friends or our alleged enemies are greater? We have got to bring this moral issue to this place and ask, "" Do you or do you not believe in atomic tests? Do you or do you not believe that this is the greatest and most terrible tragedy to arise out of science and militarism in this world? "" outs from Formosa every week and churns If you are not game enough to fight this you should not be in this House. I say-and I say it with conviction-that I believe that the Government thinks the same as we do about the horror of atomic tests and the risk of atomic warfare. But the Government has completely abdicated its responsibility. It just says, "" Our friends are all right, so we are all right"". That is where we disagree with the Government. There are plenty on my own side who disagree with my views on this, but surely this whole thing is so important that we ought to fight, not in the atmosphere created by the Treasurer in his speech, but in the atmosphere of the splendid statement made by the Leader of the Opposition. There must be a moral issue. The Liberals run away from moral issues, and there must be another voice apart from those who support the bomb droppers. On this side of the House we say that both Khrushchev and Kennedy are wrong. They lost moral opportunities of tremendous value to world friendship between the nations. If you are have to listen to what he says before the argument is resolved. "" Ostrich-like "" the Treasurer said-and you could apply the term to his own colleague, who said in relation to this, "" We accepted. It was the only possible thing."" What a Uriah Heep attitude! What an extraordinary admission from a Minister! It could not be right. NowI want to argue about this protest all over the world. The socialists are divided, the Communists are divided, the Christians are divided and the Liberals are solid, as the Minister said, because they are solid from top to toe, and for that reason they have no case here. They burked the moral issue. They burked the question of what could be done about those things. Parliament cannot abdicate its responsibility in this matter, and I think that it is to the eternal credit of the Labour Party that it brought up this issue. We do not say that we are united. We have different points of view. But what we are united in is the desire to save the world for the peoples of the world, and we will go to any lengths that are consonant with our dignity and our desire for peace. The honourable member for Chisholm is interjecting. He is the old China hand who gets his handout the same old stuff. He should listen to what the people outside are saying. He should heed the thrust from the universities. You cannot say that the people who support the ban on atomic testing are reds or rat-bags. You cannot say that they are beatniks or bearded boys. They are people, and they are worried, and their concern will drift to this Parliament. Let me tell the House that if it were not for the Labour Party-soo n to be in office-thi s issue would never have come here except negatively, buried in the prosy speeches of the Minister for External Affairs. But we have brought this matter forward as a vital issue, and we will go through with it man by man if you extend our speaking time to-day, to-morrow and toAs the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has morrow and to-morrow, until you come to a decision about it. But what are they going to do, those brave heroes who say, "" Let us stand on one side and let us look at this objectively. We on this side will sit as long as you like to debate it."" But you are going to gag us before the midnight hour has struck. Tbe point is that you have not given any responsible lead. What has been said by the Prime Minister is just so much support of his own cause-and our cause, I suppose-bu t do we leave it at that? After all, he is the leader of the nation, and he should be responsible. There is a moral responsibility on us to work for the complete banning of bomb tests. If you say, "" Our side is correct and the other at Geneva. They are building a bamboo side is wrong"", you get nowhere, and you create nothing except hatred. There has to be a different attitude taken. The matter had to be brought to the House in the way that I said, because we cannot abdicate our responsibility. I am glad that there has been a debate on the bomb. Is the Australian political scene so dead, or so frightened that it cannot take a point of view on this most astounding horror in history? Is it so dead or so frightened that I will say quite distinctly again that any it is afraid to discuss the thing except on party lines? I think that the Prime Minister's speech was shocking, and the speech by the Treasurer was ill-informed and completely out of character in an argument such his name is Khrushchev or Kennedy. I will as this, which v/e must drive home with great force, but surely not with aggravated insults to either side. The case made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) is unassailable. We have the Antarctic Treaty, which provides that the whole of the Antarctic Territory-twic e the size of Australia-is to be free from atomic tests of all sorts. So immunity will be given to 5,000,000 square miles of frozen ice and the tundra of the Antarctic but it will not be extended to Tasmania or Macquarie Island, or Australia or the Indonesians or the people of the north. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said, we are asking for something for which we feel responsible. We are asking for the southern hemisphereour hemisphere-ou r world-to be declared free of atomic bombs. It is our responsibility. That is the point. said, we feel justified in calling in other countries whether they have a bias towards communism, or towards guided democracy if, perhaps, they are people who are struggling to become free. It is not a question of party politics but of survival. In each case we were careful to enumerate every country south of the equator to help us in the fight. It is necessary to have a different thought on atomic testing to help us do something. Is not that what the Asian nations are doing at Geneva? The Asians, and the Afro-Asians at Geneva and the neutralists are doing something that we should be doing. They are not atomic powers but eight of them are represented bridge across the hatred of Europe and Asia and against the hatred of Russia and the United States. If they pass a resolution in favour of banning the atomic bomb we shall have to thank these people who have thought in the same way as the Australian Labour Party has thought about this problem. It is no use saying that this party is wrong or that party is wrong. I said before and Government and any responsible leader who approves of testing bombs which are capable of wiping out humanity completely has missed the moral value of his office whether say further that if it had not been for de Gaulle who attempted through Nato to get bombs and who experimented in the Sahara we might not have lost the moratorium that we held. It is also to be said that when the balance was against Russia it had accepted this moratorium, but the U2 spy plane incident and other things accentuated the issue and resulted in trouble. Honourable members opposite know that as well as I do. We are not discussing that. What do we do when we come to this situation? The Government says, "" We are right. We would hate to think we would be wrong. We are going to stay with the strong whatever happens"". It proceeds to talk about defence. Quite validly, defence can be mentioned in this connection. It is asked, "" What would happen if we decided not to test bombs and the others did not? "" But how do we reach a conclusion to that intolerable situation and a new view? How do we get back to the time when we were able to have a moratorium? What has been done before can be done again. Government has made no case at all. Its foreign policy has been disastrous because it is a complete carbon copy of something that has been sent to it from Washington, London or Bonn. The Government takes what trickles over to us on this side of the world and it causes great anxiety that it has no thinking of its own. The honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Jess), who is interjecting, does not get past the question of unity tickets in Victoria when he wants to get on to a very high level of discussion on international affairs. The only hope in this matter is for the United Kingdom and Australia to have a new policy on bomb testing. The Labour Party has attempted to do something about this. We have been sneered at because we have had an agony of decision to make. I think we came out of it brilliantly, without any fights want to make is in regard to the validity between each other despite very sharp divisions of opinion. I have the honour to be the chairman of the Labour Party's committee on foreign affairs so the resolution adopted by the committee was not moved by me although I applauded it. It was a unanimous decision. If honourable members opposite try to solve the bomb situation by talking low grade politics they will get nowhere. It is quite obvious that the Government has no claim. The Prime Minister has followed a sort of rhetorical line but has some power other than our own country? given no complete answer to this problem.

On this matter, the Opposition has an infinitely better performance than the Government parties, because we have decided to do something about it. AH that honourable members opposite have given is the empty ha-ha-the bucolic laugh-righ t back to the dairy industry. I thought that we had dealt with that bill two days ago. It is necessary to make a sincere attempt to build bridges between the two great contestants in regard to atomic testing. It is necessary to keep an eye fixed on what is happening in Geneva and to hope and pray that better decisions will be made and better counsels will prevail.

The final point that I of the Australian Labour Party's attempt to reach a decision on the question of a neutral zone.

Where is the crime in that? Where is the bolshevism? Does that indicate an attitude which leans to I am not a moralist and I am no Horatius standing on the bridge talking or morality.

I believe that when the atomic bomb is banned for all time by the peoples of the world, the people will think much more of the courage of the Australian Labour Party and tbe agony of our decision in taking it to the top people our Western civilization. It is as old as of our party. What has happened to the Liberals? They have no policy and no desire to make any decision. honourable member's time has expired. Deputy Speaker, I considered it very unfortunate to hear the views of the Australian Labour Party-the alternative government -o n such a vital question as nuclear weapons. Obviously, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) was very unhappy in making his remarks. He realized that he had a party behind him which was completely divided on this issue. He endeavoured to placate members of his party, as my friend from Richmond( Mr Anthony) suggests, by proposing that we should ban the bomb in the southern hemisphere. In other words, he would placate those members of his party who are for banning the bomb. We heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr all boils down to whether it is better to be Whitlam), who did not do very much better. I feel that we have reached a very low ebb with the honourable member for Parkes( Mr these moral issues are vital. We look at this Haylen) because he showed that the Labour Party is not capable of taking a strong stand on this vital question. moment. I believe that the honourable member for Parkes is a spokesman for the ban-thebomb boys. One can imagine his J leading these peace processions and peace conferences. However, what is so very strange is that subterfuges are used to take the attention of the community from Labour's weak policy. The Leader of the Opposition mentioned Antarctica and said that overall world agreement was obtained to ban nuclear testing in the Antarctic. It would be just as easy and just as effective to who declares that survival at all costs is the end ban beer in the Simpson Desert, because obviously there is no requirement for it. The honourable member for Parkes has introduced an issue which I believe is vital to this subject, and that is the moral issue. However, my approach is different from his approach. It is the moral issue that is so very important, because it stems from the very basis of our Western philosophies and our classical civilization, and we must not lose sight of it. We are concerned with horrible nuclear weapons, and we wonder whether there will be anything worth having if there is a thermo-nuclear war. This concerns the individual who builds a fall-out shelter. Happily these shelters are not so prevalent in this hemisphere, but they phere. The individual wonders whether, if he does survive a nuclear war, anything worthwhile will be left. I suppose we justify war from the theological point of view, amongst other criteria, by saying that it is a just war if the means employed are commensurate with the result. But when we come to the moral issue, which is the very basis of our thinking, we find a great deal of confusion. The honourable member for Parkes mentioned prominent university people, and I think every member of this House has had circulars from them. But it red than dead or better to be dead than red. It is as simple as that. I hope to show that matter from the viewpoint of whether our Western civilization would survive a nuclear war. For us in the West, with our background and our philosophies, survival is not the main issue. But for communism, it is a vital issue, for the world of communism exists only in history. No spiritual values exist in communism. When the honourable member for Parkes was making his peroration, I recalled a quotation from Aristotle. At the risk of being condemned for being pedantic, I looked up the quotation. Aristotle's quotation of more than 2,000 years ago is as follows:It is not life as such, or under any conditions, that is of value, but the good life. The free man is one who in a certain situation refuses to accept life if it means spiritual degradation. The man of existence is morally dead.",66,Disarmament And Nuclear Tests

If we accept the suggestion of these very eminent, intellectual university people, and if we run away from these moral issues and become Russian reds, how do we know that the Chinese will not start a nuclear war and we will end up being both red and dead? I do not think we would win, anyway. All these moral issues are, I repeat, the basis of our Western philosophies. They have existed through all our history. In our early Christian period, men died for their beliefs. They died for moral issues in the early history of the Christian Church. In the history of the Reformation, they died for varying Christian beliefs, but they died for what they believed in. The sacrifice of those men made our world worth living in to-day. We probably lose sight of these facts. Our life to-day is very easy indeed. self. The people to whom I have referred forget the very basis of our civilization, and rejects the idea of the discontinuance of I am sorry to learn that the Labour Party does not understand this basis. The Leader of the Opposition suggested, amongst other things, that we might have partial bans on these weapons. How on earth can we have partial bans? I believe we will avoid nuclear war, but we will avoid it only if the Russians realize that we have a tremendous nuclear supremacy and that we are prepared to use"" these nuclear weapons in matters that we believe are vital. I believe we will avoid a nuclear war, but we will avoid it only on those terms. If we run away from this situation and give way to pacifist thinking-thi s misguided thinking of the Australian Labour Partywe will end up with the world dominated by communism and all the evils associated with it. If we run away from the situation I have mentioned, we will place a frightful blot on the history of the world, if there is any history afterwards. Some people suggest that nuclear weapons and the Soviet Republic. If those two should be banned. In other words, they great powers fail to reach agreement and say we must rely on conventional weapons. the arms race continues, then a nuclear What is the difference? In the last war, war is inevitable, with the consequent 40,000,000 people died as a result of the destruction of humanity itself. Honourable use of conventional weapons. Quite apart from the millions of people who died from starvation and as a result of political policies during the war, 40,000,000 people died as a direct result of the use of conventional weapons. What would be the difference if the weapons that killed them had been nuclear weapons? That even one man should die in war is indefensible, and we can avoid the possibility that millions will die only by being fully prepared for war and for the use of the latest nuclear weapons, and by having the world of darkness, the Communist world, firmly believe that we will use these weapons if we believe their use to be vital to our existence. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) is to be complimented on taking steps to initiate this debate. It has been a most revealing debate. I was interested to hear the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) say that every member on the Government side* approved wholeheartedly of the statement made by the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick). This means, in effect, that the Government unanimously bomb tests. As a matter of fact, it is against nuclear disarmament, and it is against general and total disarmament throughout the world, as I hope to prove before I finish my speech. In this debate we have witnessed the unique spectacle of three men leading the debate on the Government side who might be classified as chaps who would hope to God that they were twenty years younger, because none of them has served in any of the wars in which this country has been involved when they were young enough to serve and who now speak in this Parliament on this important subject as if the threat of nuclear war was not of very great concern to the Australian community. We should all realize that if we are to preserve world peace, and to bring about nuclear disarmament, there are only two great powers in the world who can achieve these aims, the United States of America",67,Disarmament And Nuclear Tests

132,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [10.1],"Th emembers opposite must surely realize that a nuclear war will be no question of victors and vanquished. It is a question of the survival of all humanity, and so it is of the utmost importance that Australia, not a great military power, but an independent nation, should be raising its voice wherever it can be heard in an effort to influence the powers that possess nuclear weapons to reach a peaceful settlement of the differences that now divide them. Let us examine for a moment some of the extraordinary statements made by the Minister for External Affairs, so that I may prove the assertions that I made at the beginning of my remarks. The honourable gentleman said he doubted the effectiveness of regional agreements. He said he did not think they were of any use at all. As has already been pointed out by earlier speakers on this side of the House, this country in 1959 was one of the signatories to a regional pact which guaranteed a demilitarized and de-nuclearized zone in the Antarctic. Then let us turn lo the question of the Russian attitude to these matters. The Minister for External Affairs saidThere is in the first place mutual distrust and the clash of interests. Of course there is. That is admitted. The honourable gentleman also saidThe Russians say they will accept controls such nation possessed these terrible weapons of as are suggested by the West once disarmament has been completed. But they will not agree to inspection and verification arrangements whilst disarmament is actually going on. That is a completely dishonest statement, because the Russians have already tabled for the consideration of the disarmament conference now being conducted in Geneva a proposal which suggests control and verification arrangements in the various stages as disarmament proceeds. Of course, the Russians are claiming in respect to a suggested agreement to ban bomb tests that what the Western powers require is a system of control and investigation which, in their opinion, would result in espionage within Russian territory. Strangely enough, the very person who uses an argument to support the Russian viewpoint is the Minister for External Affairs himself. Listen to this extract from his speechThe insulation of the Russian State from outside influences of course gives the Soviet Union a military advantage which the West, with its open society, cannot have to the same degree. It is this advantage which a refusal to permit inspection, at least in part, is designed to protect. This means that according to the Minister what the Soviet is aiming to protect is the advantage which it now possesses because of the secrecy of its arrangements, while those of the Western powers are open to the world's gaze. Taken at its face value, the Minister's statement amounts, in effect, to a justification for the attitude that has been adopted, in this instance, by the Russians on the matter of control and verification. The Minister further saidNuclear war could wipe out overnight all the industrial gains, all the achievements of the Russian revolution, as well as tens of millions of their people. Of course it could, and it is to be hoped that the Russians realize it. It is also to be hoped that the Government of the United States of America realizes that the cities and people of that country would be exposed to the same kind of destruction should a nuclear war eventuate. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) said on 19th September, 1957There is advantage for the world in having nuclear weapons in the hands of the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, and in no other . . . I share that view. I could wish that np destruction, but as things are at present it is far better to keep them restricted to a few world powers that to-day have them than to make them freely available to all, because the more nations that become possessed of these destructive weapons the greater will be the danger that they will be used and that humanity will be destroyed. Let us turn to what is happening in other parts of the world to-day. We now have a re-militarized West Germany. In that country the Federal Republic's Ministry of War and its general staff undertook a research project to find out whether West Germany was capable of producing its own nuclear bombs and the means of delivering them. The investigation showed that West Germany has the necessary financial, industrial, scientific and technical capacity to build a stock-pile of hydrogen bombs and other nuclear weapons within five years. Any reasonable or sensible person must see that we are approaching the time when other nations will not only be capable of producing these bombs but will be setting out to do so. Franz Joseph Strauss, the West German Minister for War, assured 200 of his generals called together at Mainz that the Bonn Government is determined to obtain a nuclear partnership for the federal republic in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, of which it is a member nation. 1 agree with one statement made by the Minister for External Affairs. He saidYet another problem is that of ensuring that all In my opinion, the Government was in important military powers are covered by a diserror in the decision it made. armament agreement. If this Government and the Minister really believe that, surely they must appreciate the fact that you cannot achieve world disarmament while you exclude any of the great military powers from discussions on this subject, and while you refuse to recognize them and to admit them to membership of the United Nations Organization. Let me turn briefly to the question of nuclear-free zones. The Minister for External Affairs said thisMost proposals for establishing nuclear-free zones or banning nuclear weapons would give the against humanity and a direct violation of the Soviet an advantage since it is only the Western United Nations Charter. nuclear deterrent which holds in check the Soviet Fifty-five nations voted in favour and bloc's undoubted superiority in conventional forces. So it is quite obvious that if the opportunity for total nuclear disarmament presented itself, the Minister for External Affairs would be opposed to it because he argues that the Soviet bloc has great superiority in conventional forces, and therefore unless the Western powers get total and complete disarmament in the world, they must retain their nuclear weapons. The Minister said that the question of adequate inspection was holding up agreement on the banning of bomb tests. Let me tell honourable members on the Government side what I read recently in an authoritative British journal. It stated that British scientists to-day contended that there was no need for teams of inspection to enter the territory of any country to detect these explosions, whether they took place in the atmosphere or underground, if they were of any size whatever. When the Swedish proposal was put to the United Nations asking those nations which did not manufacture oi did not posses nuclear weapons to join what was termed "" a non-nuclear club ""and according to the Prime Minister's earlier statement these terrible weapons should remain the monopoly of the three great powers, namely, Soviet Russia, the United States of America and Great Britain -thi s Government abstained from voting. It did not even have an opinion on this matter. When it replied to U Thant, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, this Government decided it would have nothing to do with the Swedish proposal. Let us have a look at some of the extraordinary actions of this Government before the United Nations. In November, 1961, some of the African nations put forward a proposal that Africa be declare a nuclearfree zone. On that occasion, Australia abstained from voting. In the same month of the same year, a proposal was put forward by a number of African and Asian nations who submitted this resolution for the decision of the United NationsThe use of nuclear weapons to be a crime twenty, including Australia, voted against it. This Government was not even prepared to declare that the use of nuclear weapons was a crime against humanity or to declare that the use of these weapons was a violation of the United Nations Charter. This is what the Australian representative had to say of the resolution in the debate. . . it did not take account of the realities of international life . . . It did not condemn equally horrifying and devastating weapons. So because the resolution did not include the whole field of weapons, the Government was not prepared to outlaw nuclear weapons. It said that what Australia sought was the elimination, not of a particular weapon, but of war itself. That is the objective of all of us-the elimination of war. But when you have the opportunity of making a declaration against the use of nuclear weapons, surely one would expect the Australian representative to support it. According to the Minister for External AffairsAH these propesals would weaken or neutralize the nuclear deterrent without reducing Communist strength in conventional weapons. Let us pass to another aspect of the speech made by the Minister. I turn to the question of bomb tests. According to some of the speakers on the Government side, one would imagine that if you oppose the continuance of bomb tests, it is an act of treachery-as the Prime Minister saidagainst our side, meaning the Western Powers. There are many scientists in the Western world who declare that bomb tests are unnecessary. If we are to take any notice of the declarations made by the Soviet leaders and by the leaders of the Western nations that they have already stockpiled sufficient weapons to destroy each other, what is the purpose of further tests? If you are able to annihilate your opponent completely-and both sides have declared that they have the capacity to do thatobviously a continuance of these tests is unnecessary and endangers the lives and health of many people who are obliged to live in areas in comparatively close proximity to where the tests are conducted. According to the Minister for External Affairs-and this answers the point as to whether the Soviet Union gained any advantage from the recent testsThe United States does not Soviet Union has a developed defence, and does not accept Soviet claims to superiority in nuclear power . . . Now, the question has arisen as to who broke the moratorium. I say that Russia is to be condemned for having resumed testing these dreadful weapons, but if one comes to the point of who was first to break the moratorium, the tests conducted by France in the Sahara Desert must be considered. It is perfectly true that France was not a signatory to the agreement, but France is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and in my opinion the Western partners of France in Nato were not strong enough in their actions to condemn or prevent France joining the powers who were testing these dreadful weapons. Let me turn to the Government's policy. I say that this Government is a war-minded government. It thinks only in terms of war because the Minister said in his speechand this shows that the Minister for External Affairs does not believe in total disarmament and according to the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) they all agree with the MinisterEven if these matters were resolved The Minister was referring to the difficulties in negotiating an agreement on total disarmamentWe cannot assume that general and complete disarmament would remove the basic problems and disputes between East and West or other sources of international friction. In a disarmed world there would still be economic and ideological pressures, political rivalries and the pressures of population. So it is quite obvious from the Minister's own speech that he does not want total disarmament because he does not regard that as a means of resolving the matters in dispute in the world to-day. He thinks-as do all members of the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party-that the only way to resolve these matters is by recourse to arms. I say that is a policy of despair and contains no hope for Australia or other world communities. According to the MinisterBoth sides agree that even in a disarmed world nations would need to retain armed forces for internal security. In the free democracies these forces might not need to be large. But some countries with more impressive regimes could be expected to demand security forces of considerable size, equipped with weapons which we would regard as more appropriate to military rather than police operations. In a "" disarmed "" world such consider that the forces would pose an obvious threat to small system of missile neighbouring states. So it is quite obvious that the Minister does not want total disarmament. He still believes that certain nations, by the use of forces retained for internal security, would still be able to dominate neighbouring countries. Every responsible statesman in the world recognizes that if we have total disarmament and are to outlaw war for aU time as the means of resolving international disputes, there must first be a police force to maintain internal order and security in every country. Secondly, there must be an international force powerful enough, and acting under the direction of all nations through the United Nations, to see that no nation is able to impose its will on another by recourse to force of arms. Finally, let me say that the Treasurer attempted to use this debate to show that there was disunity in the Labour Party and that therefore the people of Australia should not entrust it with government. I have been in this Parliament long enough to remember when an anti-Labour government, of which he was a member, absolutely collapsed in a period of national emergency and the only party in this country which proved itself capable of forming a stable government was the party to which 1 belong, the Australian Labour Party. -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. honourable member for East Sydney( Mr simply dupes-hav e tried to force the Ward) addressed himself exclusively to the Opposition benches. This is not surprising because there can be little doubt that the Opposition is completely divided on this issue. I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) upon making a statement which sought to patch over this enormous chasm which divides honourable members opposite. However, let us return to the central issue in this matter. The debate has wandered in various directions, and I want to come back in very simple terms to the real issue before us. The United States has found it necessary to resume nuclear tests. The simple issue for us to decide is whether we support that action or whether we do not. The matter is as simple as that, but it has to be put in its full context and that is what I propose to do before returning to the central point. What is the full context? Ever since the end of World War II . we have been engaged in a cold war, not of our seeking and not of our making, but a cold war forced upon us by the Soviet Union and its friends. This is cold history. It is perhaps worth recalling that at the end of the war when only the United States possessed the secret of manufacturing nuclear weapons and when Russia did not possess that secret, the United States offered to ban nuclear weapons. Russia refused to accept the offer. Nothing could have been more generous than that offer. Nothing could have better ensured some peaceful ending to World War II . But the Russians, as we know now, were seeking to acquire this secret through spies, and did in fact acquire it. The Soviets have to-day, and have had at all material times since the war, an enormous preponderance of power in conventional weapons, and therefore their object has been-the whole of their policy can be seen in the light of this-to try by some means or other to strike from the hands of the West that one weapon which the Americans and the West had, namely, the nuclear weapon. The Soviets could not do this by direct means but they have sought to do it by every indirect means conceivable. Above all, they have emphasized the horror of this new weapon. Their allies in all parts of the world-som e of them knowing what they were doing, others West to abandon what has been, in fact, its sole shield and buckler in the post-war world. This is the context in which a number of people on the other side of the House, no doubt with the best of intentions, are joining with the fifth column which is seeking to prevent the West from using the one weapon that protects it, namely, its nuclear equality or superiority, without which it would be helpless in the face of the enormous conventional power possessed by the Soviet Union and its friends. This is the situation. The balance of terror remains but it may be upset if one side gains technical superiority in the production of this weapon. This is what the Soviets have sought to do. It has been the object of their recent tests. If the West does not carry out its tests to keep up, technically, with its opponents, the balance of terror will be upset. This will be exploited by the Soviets, which, since the war, have pursued us unremittingly with their hostility. They have never made the slightest secret about it and they have at all times and in all ways fought against us. These are our enemies-ou r selfproclaimed enemies. These are the people whom the Opposition is inviting us to trust. It is not only a matter of history that the Soviets have been perfidious from first to last; it is a matter of philosophy as well. They proclaim that any weapon may be used, including deception and bad faith. What they have done is not something simple. It is a method that they proclaim. And these are the people whom we are invited to trust! If one seeks for some recent evidence of their perfidy-thoug h Heaven knows why there is any need to look for further evidence than we have had for the past fifteen years or so-w e will find it in the progress of the talks on nuclear disarmament which have been",68,Disarmament And Nuclear Tests

134,Mr Turner (Bradfield) [10.21],"Th egoing on in Geneva for something like two years. After many months and after Russia had undertaken not to be the first to resume nuclear tests, its representatives walked out of the meeting and tests were resumed. It is clear that to prepare these tests would have taken twelve or eighteen months, so the whole of the time that Russia's representatives were talking about miles. By comparison, the biggest United disarmament Russia was preparing for the tests which if later conducted. I do not know that there is any need to seek further the 1 megaton and 2 megaton range was evidence of Russia's perfidy than we have had over the past fifteen years, but it may the plentiful Russian intermediate range be found in the very circumstances relating missiles that now threaten Western Europe. to the matter which we are now discussing. America's record' is a particularly good weapons, the Russians approached the one. It made that very generous offer when it alone possessed the secret of the nuclear bomb. Before the United States resumed the recent tests, President Kennedy ahead of the United States in the antiagreed to cancel them in exchange for a treaty with the Soviets to ban such tests provided, of course, that an adequate proworkable system before the United States. tection system were agreed upon. That was a pretty fair offer. Although at that stage it was evident that the Russians had the technical lead in this field President support the tests which the Americans are Kennedy was prepared to forgo further tests if a treaty were concluded in which there were proper safeguards. the technical lead at any time. words about that, too, before I resume my seat. It is nice to know that the Russians have never had the technical lead. I understand that is what the honourable gentleman has said. Why have the Americans felt themselves compelled to resume testing? What have the Russians discovered which gives them the lead at this time? When tests are being This they hope to do by suggesting certain conducted it is possible for scientists to determine with some degree of accuracy from instruments and no doubt from intelligence sources what is going on. The Russians demonstrated spectacular improvesouthern hemisphere.

The Russians could easily refine the device into a 100ing to do with nuclear testing, and that we megaton warhead for one of their giant and crude intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are known to the United States intelligence men as the "" Beast "".

It could be hung on the ""Beast"" and sent for a full range ""of 6,000 States missile yield is less than 10 megatons for TitanI I.

Do we or do we not carrying out, having regard to the tests which the Russians carried out in breach of an agreement they had undertaken after talking for months and months about a treaty for nuclear disarmament? Can we trust people whose record of perfidy obviously makes it impossible for any people who have the welfare of their country at heart to place any reliance whatever on their word? The Opposition has put forward certain proposals which, I think, are designed to patch up the breach in its ranks on the question whether its members should agree to any sort of testing by the Americans. partial moves towards nuclear disarmament. In particular, the Opposition has proposed that Australia should take the lead in the creation of a nuclear-free zone in the hemisphere? The only countries in it are those in South America, besides South Africa and Australia. So apparently we would agree with the South Americans and the South Africans that we will have nothwill not develop any nuclear devices.",72,Disarmament And Nuclear Tests
135,Mr Cairns,The Soviets have never had,73,Disarmament And Nuclear Tests
136,Mr Turner,"I shall be saying a fewThe proposal looks fairly innocuous, but let us have a look at it. Suppose we were to give this great advantage of a nuclearfree zone in the southern hemisphere where it probably could not matter less, except in one respect, about which I shall say something in a moment. If this excellent example were followed in, say, Europe, or some other area where it might be necessary for our friends the Americans to station nuclear devices, it might be extremely damaging to the Western cause and to us. Is it, therefore, an example that we should set? Should we say, "" It is a splendid idea to have a nuclear-free zone "", at a time when perhaps the range of the Russian weapons is greater than that of ours and when, therefore, if our example were followed, we would find ourselves without an answer to the Russians? The question is not quite as simple as it appears to be at first sight. Again, if we were to take this step, what would our American friends think of it? Would they think of it as a friendly gesture that we should give an example of this kind that might be extremely damaging to the Western cause? After all, I suppose it is of some importance to Australia that we should continue to have the friendship of the Americans and the valuable help from them upon which we can rely. What does "" Nuclear-free zone "" mean? Does it mean that we should have no part in the testing of devices associated with nuclear weapons such as those at Woomera, for instance? At Woomera they might not actually be nuclear devices that are explosive, but would this nuclear-free zone preclude us from carrying out any research at Woomera in connection with nuclear devices? If it would, then surely that would weaken the Western world. If, at Woomera, we have the means with which to play our part, are we to abandon this power that we desire to have in order to do something in association with our allies for our own protection? Again, does it mean that we are opposed to testing in any part of the southern hemisphere? It may be that testing will be carried out in places in the northern hemisphere other than where it has been carried out in the past, but is it inconceivable that at some time, for some technical reason, it might be desirable to carry out some tests in the southern hemisphere? Are we to deprive our allies of that opportunity? It appears to me that the Opposition would have us say: ""We are abandoning our friends; we want to be free from all these things; we want to stay neutral in this conflict; we want to be right out"". The Opposition would have us say, "" We do not mind what happens to you, George, we are all right"". Anybody who recalls the circumstances of the last war will remember the futility of that attitude. For instance, the people in the Low Countries thought they could stay out. The Belgians did not want to allow British troops to go through Belgium. But no country can stay out of war. It is not for them to choose. They are involved, whatever happens, and we cannot adopt the attitude that we are staying out of this, that we are in a nuclearfree zone and will have nothing to do with it. Such an attitude is not only cowardly, but impossible into the bargain. I understood the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) to say that the Russians were justified in carrying out tests because the French had undertaken tests. whether it was really all the fault of the Russians that these tests were undertaken, and he referred to tests conducted by the French. In any case, the French tests appeared Jo be in a very rudimentary stage; but, apart from that, the French had the fear that any country might have that if they were attacked with nuclear weapons by the Soviet the United States might not be willing to risk a counter attack on their cities by coming to the aid of the French with American nuclear weapons. That is what lies behind what the French have done. I could not agree more that the spread of nuclear capabilities, whether to the French or any other country, represents a great danger to the free world, and I would think that if there is any possibility of agreement between the Russians and the West it would be because the Russians realize precisely these things As was rightly said by the honourable member for East Sydney, the Russians have much to lose by the destruction of their industrial strength",73,Disarmament And Nuclear Tests
137,Mr Bryant,He did not say that at all.,74,Disarmament And Nuclear Tests
138,Mr Turner,"He definitely doubtedand the standards that they have built up over the years. No doubt, too, the Soviet people themselves want peace. And those are the only bases on which any agreement can be contemplated. There is nothing whatever in the attitude of Russia that could give us any hope for peace; but the fact that the Russian people probably want peace, the fact that the Russians would have much to lose from a nuclear war, and the fact that millions of people in fhe world who dethey face the same dangers as we do from the spread of nuclear capabilities to other nations are the only real reasons why it is sensible to continue negotiations. But we cannot hope to prevent the spread of -nuclear capabilities except by all-round agreement by the Russians as well as ourselves. There are people in the Communist bloc who could carry out tests, people to whom this knowledge could spread, just the same as there are on the Western side, and this spread must be prevented all round. It is of no use whatever our preventing friends of ours from doing these things if the Russians do not prevent their friends from acquiring nuclear capabilities, or from armneed for the United States to take up testing ing their friends in the way that we are invited to prevent the Americans from arming their friends. This has to be a matter of all-round agreement, and it is worth pursuing these of nuclear bombs.

He, as, indeed, the Prime Minister missiles, but these are not what the ( Mr Menzies), the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Americans are testing at present. They are Holt) and the honourable member for testing nuclear bombs. It is this lack of McPherson( Mr Barnes), has completely logic, or this failure by Government supavoided the point. The discussion in which porters to apply themselves to the problem this House is engaged is not about whether which humanity faces, which puts the whole the United States of America ought not to of Australia and the whole of the world explode nuclear bombs or about whether in peril. This Government fails to face up Russia ought not to explode nuclear bombs. This discussion concerns the question: What can this country, led by this Government, do to stop the continuance of this nonsense? may be able to do nothing, but we on this side of the House speak in concert with the mand that something be done. The honourable member for Bradfield, again, seemed to labour under the happy delusion that we ought to have complete and absolute faith in the United States, but that France was reasonable in not having faith in the United States and in proceeding on this assumption that the Americans would not come to her aid. This is the kind of illogical statement which we find comes through all the speeches of honourable members opposite on this question. The honourable member for Bradfield, like other members opposite, in his questions about the techniques of nuclear weapons and the anew, ignored some of the facts of the case. All the evidence points to the fact that the United States of America is still miles ahead of Russia in the actual construction had implicitly conceded that the recent Soviet series still left the United States United States tests, he said, would be to restore the original margin of America's",74,Disarmament And Nuclear Tests

The very language which we speak > the most, the arithmetic of the situation is in this House has been influenced by the that the United States, up to the present Greeks, and the philosophy of the Greeks of series of tests, had conducted 171, plus the which the honourable member for McPherson two wartime explosions.

So, on the balance of system of government and the way of life terror and the balance of testing, there is of the British people have permeated this no need for us to feel that we are in any planet. great danger and that the balance of power and the balance of terror lie with the other side. The belief that the balance of those things the weight of battleships which will carry does lie with the other side, of course, is the day; the persuasive influence of a typical of the lack of logic in the views of people's attitude of mind and the trust and Government supporters. They are trying faith that are put in that people's integrity to put Australia in a position in which it will carry the day. We believe that this will give absolute and implicit support to Government, since 9th December, 1949, United States foreign policy. They are has done everything possible in the counattempting to make this a debate between cils of the world to prejudice Australia's Russia and the United States on foreign integrity in the eyes of the people of the policies.

You go now and do likewise."" In the matter of nuclear weapons, Mr Speaker, that is utter rubbish. The facts of life, of course, are that only four of the 100 nations which are members of the United Nations have nuclear weapons. A total of 96 of the members of that organization have not nuclear weapons. Our first objective ought to be to get those 96 nations together in co-operation to exercise whatever influence they may have on the other four nations, and especially on the two principal ones, to prevent them from coming to blows. The great mass of humanity is not repreto U Thant that Australia, so far as the sented by Russia or the United States.

In fact what he asked this Government to say was, "" Now please give earnest consideration to this question and say under what terms you think we should come to some kind of agreement"". What did the Minister for External Affairs reply? In a long and wordy description of what is the long cold war, he poured a great douche of cold water upon the aspirations of all humanity as expressed in the United Nations resolution. I believe he betrayed all of us. By replying in that way, he betrayed his duty to this country, for Australia should be one of tbe leading members of the United Nations. I suggest to Government supporters that they read ""Hansard"" of 5th April from page 1381.

Australia has no cise influence on the nations of the world, nuclear weapons, and the Government and we must do it with a sense of responsiadmits in its treatise that it has no proposal at the moment to use them. We do not contend that we should step forth and say, "" We renounce this for ever "". We say that in the present situation we would not use nuclear weapons and that we do not want Minister for External Affairs would issue other people to use them. The same applies, to his officers at the United Nations. If of course, to our relations with other nations. the Americans would stop hating the RusIndonesia, India and Malaya have no nuclear sians and the Russians would stop hating weapons; neither have the South American Americans, then we might start to get somenations. All we ask is that they shall say where. This is the challenge that faces the together, "" Unless the situation takes a turn world, but honourable members opposite do for the worse, we shall not use them and we not seem to be able to turn their attention shall undertake not to co-operate with anyto these great problems.

Has he studied the effect of the judgment of the High Court in the case known as Gilbert's Case? 2. What effect will the judgment have on the option to freehold of war service land settlers who have not yet received final valuations? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Since receipt of the High Court's judgment in the case of Gilbert v. The State of Western Australia and others I have been examining its effect on the war service land settlement scheme in Western Australia. 2. The High Court decision related to points of law in the determination of an option price for a farm consisting almost entirely of land carrying good productive pasture established for many years prior to its inclusion in the scheme. This type of farm is an exception in the general Scheme of war service land settlement in Western Australia. Commonwealth and State authorities are currently examining the practical effect of the High Court's decision on the determination of option prices for all types of war service land settlement holdings. Overseas Investments in Australian Oil Search. Mr Ward asked the Minister representbeen made to the State of Queensland for the ing the Minister for National Development, construction and improvement of the following upon notice1. What is the estimated amount of foreign capital which has been invested in Australian oil exploration? 2. What percentage of the total capital subscribed does this foreign capital represent? 3. What steps has the Government taken, or what steps does it propose to take, to ensure that this most important industry does not fall substantially into foreign hands? 4. What is the total amount of Commonwealth money made available to foreign interests, by subsidy in one form or another, to assist in oil exploration activities? 5. As a result of this expenditure of public moneys what direct interest will the Commonwealth have in any oil-field discovered? Development has supplied the following information:1. The estimated capital investment to the end of 1961 in oil exploration in Australia and Papua by foreign companies amounts to £51,500,000. Included in this amount is a component of funds provided from local profits by foreign oilmarketing companies. 2. This foreign company capital represents 70 per cent, of total private investment in oil exploration. 3. In relation to this question the honourable member's attention is drawn to a statement made by the Prime Minister in this House on lst May, 1962. 4. The total amount of Commonwealth money paid to foreign interests in the form of subsidy from 1957 to SOth April, 1962, is £3,178,560. In addition, a sum of £1,741,596 has been approved as subsidy but not yet paid. 5. None. Windorah to Yaraka Road. Mr Gray asked the Minister for Shipping and Transport, upon notice1. Is it a fact that the road from Windorah to Yaraka, in Queensland, was partly constructed some years ago by the expenditure of some £240,000 secured from the Federal Government? 2. Is this road in its present incomplete state useless for the purpose for which it was to be constructed, that is, the transport of cattle? 3. Will he, in view of the large amount ot Commonwealth money now being applied for the construction of roads for similar purposes, take steps to ensure that the Windorah to Yaraka road is completed as part of the road construction work presently being undertaken in that vicinity? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. In accordance with the provision of the States Grants (Encouragement of Meat Production) Act 1949-1954, payments amounting to £1,165,421 have roads:-(a ) Currawilla to Yaraka via Canterbury and Windorah; (b) Quilpie to Coonaberry Creek, and (c) Thargomindah to a point in the vicinity oi Barringun. It is understood that £249,892 was to the Windorah-Yaraka section of the road mentioned in (a) above. 2. All the roads mentioned above were constructed or improved by the Queensland road authorities in accordance with general standards approved by the Queensland and Commonwealth Governments. Upon their completion, the maintenance of these roads was a matter for the State. 3. Under the Queensland Grant (Beef Cattle Roads) Act 1961, the Commonwealth is to meet the cost of works on beef cattle roads, up to a maximum of £5,000,000 over the five years commencing lst July, 1961. The act provides for selection by the State, not the Commonwealth, of the roads to qualify for assistance. The Commonwealth's role is to approve the State's proposals if it is satisfied they meet certain criteria laid down in the act. The State has already selected and the Commonwealth has approved the roads on which the grant is to be spent. The Windorah to Yaraka road was not included in the State's proposals.",79,Adjournment

Nowhere in Australia has the search for oil reached the third or lease stage, and existing tenements only refer to the exploration phase. 1. The name of each company holding a petroleum tenement in Australia is given in the schedule accompanying the petroleum tenement map prepared by the Bureau of Mineral Resources from information supplied by States and Territories. This map is available on the table of the Library. 2. The area of each petroleum tenement is given in the schedule referred to in the answer to the first question. The formal documents covering the conditions of tenure of individual tenements in each State and Territory are confidential and are held by the respective Departments of Mines and are not available. However, the general conditions of tenure covering all types of petroleum tenements throughout the Commonwealth are presented in a tabulation prepared by the Bureau of Mineral Resources and available on the table of the Library. Taxation. Mr Hayden asked the Treasurer, upon Per cent. notice.. 2.0 1. Is it a fact that when workmen are supplied .. 2.8 with work dress by their emp]oyer, the employer .. 4.3 is permitted, within certain defined limits, to claim .. 4.8 upkeep of that clothing as an income tax deduction? ..3. 7 2. Is it a fact that no such deduction is allowed ..3. 5 to an employee for the upkeep of work clothing .. 3.6 supplied by himself? 3. Docs this system favour the employer, in .. 3.2 contrast to the employee, by providing special and .. 3.0 preferential treatment for the employer; if so, will he consider granting a similar taxation deduction .. 2.9 to an employee in respect of the upkeep of work .. 2.7 clothing which the employee himself has provided? ..2. 7 Mr Harold Holt -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The income tax law requires the allowance of deductions for expenses, not of a capital, private or domestic nature, that are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income. The provisions of the law also extend to those expenses if they are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of producing assessable income. Expenditure incurred by employers in relation to the supply and upkeep of work dress for their employees is allowed as a deduction to the extent that these tests are satisfied. 2. Where an employee is required by the terms of his employment to wear and maintain a uniform peculiar to his occupation or some other form of special clothing which assists him in performing the duties of his employment, the cost of replacing and maintaining the uniform or special clothing is deductible. If an employee receives from his employer an allowance towards the cost of a uniform or special clothing, the allowance is included in the employee's assessable income and he may claim a deduction of his expenditure on the uniform or special clothing against the amount of the allowance received. 3.

As will be seen from the replies to questions 2 and 3 there is obviously no set formula on which overseas freight rates are calculated. Thus any comparison between such rates can be of little value. Such things a: volume of trade and type of cargo offering would be taken into account when rates are determined. 5. National Line vessels are not engaged in the Australia-New Guinea trade. 6. Because of the relatively high cost of operatimplied, that employees in the banking industry ing Australian registered vessels, the Australian National Line could not engage in this trade without incurring heavy trading losses or alternatively charging higher freight rates. Commonwealtb Bank, Mr Harold Holt-On 10th April, the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Cross) asked me a question without notice on the daily time of commencement of duty of officers employed in banks controlled by the Commonwealth Banking Corporation in Queensland. I pointed out at the time that this was an administrative matter within the competence of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation Board, but nevertheless I undertook to see what information I could obtain for him. The managing director of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation has now supplied the following information on this matter:In trading conditions for banks which are now in force in the majority of the mainland States, business which was previously conducted over five and one-half days is concentrated into five days-o n one day of which the banks remain open to the public until 5 p.m. The effect of these changed conditions on working arrangements was closely examined by the corporation and it was clear that generally later finishing times for the staff would result. Unlike other organizations in which staffs observe a fixed finishing time, the daily ceasing times of bank employees vary considerably according to business pressures. As a matter of good staff organization, the corporation has encouraged the policy of staff leaving the office as early as practicable each day, and in order that a reasonable finishing time might continue to be observed in the shorter number of working days per week, the hours of duty of the staff -have been re-arranged so that work now commences at 8.45 a.m. daily in lieu of 9 a.m. This arrangement, which has been introduced in all States in which five-day banking applies, is a change which the corporation believes operates in the best interests of all concerned. For some time, the corporation has assessed the staffing organization in each branch and in each department on a basis which permits work completion within a working week approximating 38 hours on the average. The introduction of the 8.45 a.m. commencement time has not altered this arrangement and any suggestion that members of the corporation staff are now required to work an extra hour and a quarter each week is incorrect. In the legislation which has been passed in the various States and recently in the Australian Capital Territory to permit banks to close on Saturdays, there was no intention, expressed or would automatically achieve a shorter working week. Telephone Services. Mr Collard asked the Postmaster General, upon notice1. Is it a fact that in some country and goldfields areas of Western Australia telephone reception is far from good and as a result people making trunk line calls often exhaust practically all of the first three minutes attempting to make satisfactory contact with the party whom they are calling? 2. As people in these circumstances are charged the additional amount for extension beyond the first three minutes in the same manner as when satisfactory and immediate reception is obtained, will he give consideration to extending in outback areas the time for the first charge? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The standard of transmission on most of the trunk lines serving country areas in Western Australia, including the goldfields district, is satisfactory. In a few instances, particularly where settlement is sparse and there has been little or no development, trunk lines of sub-standard construction exist on which the quality of transmission is sometimes poor. However, the timing of calls made over these circuits does not begin until the parties are able to converse effectively. 2. Standing instructions issued to trunk operators already provide that allowance is to be made in thc timing of a call for any conversation time lost due to departmental causes. In an area where sub-standard lines exist, therefore, an operator allows extra time for each three minute charge when, upon connecting a call, she recognizes that some difficulties are likely to be experienced by the parties in carrying out their conversation.",83,Answers To Questions

Social Services. Mr Hansen asked the Ministerf o r Social Services, upon notice1. Is an unemployed man who has been drawing unemployment benefit of £7 2s. 6d. a week for himself and his wife obliged, on reaching 63 years of age, to apply for an age pension of £5 Ss. a week, and if the wife is not eligible for the pension is their joint income reduced by £1 17s. 6d. a week? 2. WiU he take steps to correct this apparent anomaly? honourable member's follows:1. If an unemployed man on reaching 65 years of age intends to resume work when it becomes available, he may receive a special benefit paid at unemployment benefit rates and under the same conditions while he is out of work. On transfer from benefit to pension the social service payments available to a married man with a wife ineligible for age or invalid pension or wife's allowance would be reduced to £5 15s. a week if eligible for supplementary assistance, or £5 5s. a week if not eligible for supplementary assistance, and means as assessed may reach £7 per week before the latter rate is affected. 2. There is no anomaly. An unemployment benefit is designed to meet a temporary set ol circumstances. An age pension is designed as a permanent payment. Government Cleaning Contracts.
