I promised that the information would be obtained, and now furnish the following replies:1. The following figures show the total number of subscribers outstanding at the beginning of each year for the three years named, the applications received during the year, and the number connected:Outstanding Applications at beginning of year. 192122 192223 192324 (to 29th February8 months) 2. A t present there arc approximately 12.S00 subscribers awaiting service. Since the Department has been in a -position to execute outstanding works it has been found that in many instances persons who had made application did not desire to proceed, and this fact accounts for the apparent discrepancy between the figures referred to under (1) and the number at present outstanding. For some months the Department has been engaged upon a large number of construction works, both internal and external, which w ill give relief in those areas where there is serious congestion a n d a t the same time provide for expansion. In those districts also where there is no serious plant congestion everything possible is being done to overtake the arrears. Over 5,000 temporary men have been engaged to assist the permanent staff, and the closest possible attention is being given to this matter by a l l responsible officers. The most serious obstacle the Department has been confronted with in its endeavours to meet the demand for service is that relating to the supply of material. wore placed with the utmost regard to early deliveries there have been many serious failures to supply by the stipulated dates. Tho great variety of material essential to afford telephone connection is obtained from many sources, and failure in a single instance frequently dislocates the whole co-ordinated construction effort. Subscribers are now being connected at the rate of about 4,000 per month, as against an average of 2,400 during 1922-23, and 1,800 during 1921-22. 3.

The question now before the House is that the words proposed by the Leader of the Opposition to be omitted standpart of the question. Downs Attorney-General) [3.25] I . propose to point out briefly the position in which we shall be placed if the amend-, ment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) is carried. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) submitted a motion asking the House toapprove of the printing of the reports of the Imperial Conference! and the Imperial Economic Conference, and to approve of certain conclusions arrived at by the Imperial Conference and the Imperial Economic Conference. When he concluded his speech the Leader of the Opposition moved the amendment to which I am asking honourable members to give their serious attention. By moving it honourable members opposite, in effect, declareports printed, but that all reference to certain definite conclusions of the Imperial Conference in regard to foreign relations, The Hcuse may then, if it so the negotiation, signature, and ratification of treaties, and defence be omitted from, tlie motion. These are matters upon which definite decisions have been come to by the representatives of all the King's Dominions sitting in London in conference with tlie Government of the United Kingdom, and the Prime Minister asks tlie House to approve o.f them, yet honourable members opposite decline to ratify these decisions. They ask the House to reject them, and to substitute in their place thefollowiug dcclara tion:r This House approves of the foreign policy of His Majesty's Government in Great Britain, as endorsed by a majority of the repiesentatcves of the British people in the Mouse of Commons; aiming, as such policy does, to bring about good-will between -nations and advance the peace of the world. The amendment is a direct challenge >ro those who support the conclusions of the Imperial Conference. If carried, it would be an indication that Australia .rejected the decisions of the Imperial Conference and the result of its six weeks' delibera^tions. The Leader of the Opposition did not direct the attention of the House, to what would be the actual position if his amendment were agreed to^ but there is no getting away from, the fact that it contains the challenge I have stated. First of all, the honourable member asks the House to reject the deliberations of the Imperial Conference in regard to foreign relations. It must be remembered that these are not the decisions of one individual. The Imperial .Conference was representative of all the Dominions constituting the British commonwealth of nations. They were fhe representatives of Dominions with am independent status, and after discussing in detail the whole of the foreign relations of the Empirethey came to certain definite conclusioiiSj which aire set out in the summary of proceedings . that has been placed in the hands of honourable members.

50,Sir Littleton Groom (Darling,".able to make a' detailed examination, not .only of the main features of the Empire's foreign policy in a l l its aspects, but also iof the situation as it presented itself fro m day to day. The Conference did not terminate its sittings u n t i l every subject had been carefully considered and a eornnion understanding reached upon the main heads of foreign policy which were -under consideration. As these have been already mentioned by the Prime Minister, it is not my intention to detain honourable members with further examination of them. the attitude of the Empire towards the League of Nations, the Conference had the benefit of the very f u l l and complete statement from the British official representative at the League of its work. The view taken by the Conference is stated in the official summary thusThere was M l accord that the League should bo given the iinabafced support of all the British ineawboxs of the League as a valuable instrument of international peace, and as the sole available organ for the harmonious regulation of many international affairs. Honourable members are now asked to reject this conclusion, which was reached after a careful examination of the League's work. challenge that is presented in the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), who has not, seen fit to enlighten honourable members about the reasons actuating him in submitting it . I find, hoAvever, that when speaking at Hobart recently he did give some explanation of his attitude towards the Imperia l Conference and foreign relations. He is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald to have saidOnce Australia attached her signature to participation in the Empire's foreign ipolicy, she would be in honour bound to take <hor due part in any war in wihieh the Empire might be engaged, whether she thought it just or not. If the time came when Australia were attacked, he was sure she would do her part in defending' her shores. Later, Avhen speaking about defence, he saidUhore is no longer any necessity for compulsory military training, which should be abolished. The last war had shown that 'the existing system was obsolete. The amendment also challenges those who support the resolutions of the Conference on the subject of the negotiation, signature and ratification of treaties. Dominions have undoubtedly attained to a very important status within the Empire, and have acquired the power to make treaties. One consequence of that status is a large measure of freedom in the negotiation of treaties. This is the first time that this very important power of the Dominions has been so clearly defined at any gathering of representatives of the British Empire. Obviously, it is a power that, exercised by each Dominion without regard to the rest of the Empire, might involve the Empire as a In considering what should be whole in a very serious position. The Conference, therefore, after careful consideration, and w it h the advice of Sir Cecil Hurst, legal adviser to the Foreign Office, laid down certain d-finite rules and safeguards for the exercise of the power. The Leader of the Opposition now asks .this House to ireject that resolution. What does he propose to substitute for it? orable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr. Mathe.ws), speaking as a member of his party, says that nothing is to be substituted. I say that one alternative is to allow the Government of the United This' is the first Kingdom to make our treaties for us, as it may think fit. But the old method has gone. The new pro-i posal contained in the resolutions of the Conference is such as one'would expect a commonwealth of nations to lay down for the guidance of its component parts. The only other course would be to claim complete independence on this subject; but, knowing the sentiments of the Leader of the Opposition towards the Empire, and on the question of loyalty generally, I do not want, by suggestion, to convey the impression that that is what he in tends by his amendment. But we have to face the position in which he has placed us. If this 'House accepts his amendment, where shall w.e stand in regard to this treaty power ? The alternative is one which no self-governing Dominion would care to adopt. If we reject the Conference .views we shall be expected to define our relations w it h the other parts of the Empire. They will require to know where we stand.

52,Sir Littleton Groom,"The honagreements between Governments. has been the established practice where only one part of the Empire is concerned , for the King to issue full power to his representatives in that part of the Empire -to make a treaty either alone or conjointly -with the representatives of the United -Kingdom. It does not matter what part -of the Dominions he may represent, his authority to enter intothe treaty is from the King. The resolutions of the Conference accept that practice, and lay down certain principles to guard against danger which might arise out of it. resolutions deal, in the first place, with the possibility that a treaty being negotiated by one Government may in some way affect another part of the Empire, or the Empire as a whole. They affirm., very distinctly, the desirableness that .no treaty shall be negotiated by any single Government of the Empire without due consideration having been given to its possible effects upon other parts of the Empire. that before a Government opens negotiations for such a treaty, steps shall be taken to insure that any of the other Governments of the likely to bo interested shall be _ informed, an opportunity of expressing their views; or, when their interests are intimately involved, of participating in the negotiations. the Conference realized the necessity of providing for the fullest exchange of views between the Governments of different parts of the Empire before any such treaty is concluded. The third paragraph of these resolutions provides that in all cases where more than one of the Governments of the Empire participates iu the negotiations, there shall be the fullest possible exchange of views between those Governments before and at every stage of ' the negotiations. tions make an interesting reference to tbe now established practice at International Conferences of having a British Empire delegation. This usage was first adopted at the Peace Conference in Paris. It is of the utmost importance that there shall be prior consultations between the Empire units to insure their co-operation in these International Conferences. The resolution of the Imperial Conference in this respect sets down the practice to be followed. Sir Littleton Oroom. It treaty is negotiated at an International Conference, when such a British Empire delegation exists, that delegation shall be utilized for the purposes of consultation. Respecting the signature of treaties, there is always a possibility, when a particular Dominion plenipotentiary signs a treaty intended to impose obligations on that Dominion only, that it may affect some other part of the Empire. He may incautiously put his signature to provisions capa'ble of a more extended interpretation than he knows of. The resolution The of the Conference safeguards the interests of other Governments of the Empire against this. It affirms that the f u l l power issued to such representative shall specify the part of the Empire to be bound by the treaty, thus limiting the authority of the jjlenipotentiary; and provides that both the preamble and. text of the treaty shall be so worded as to make its scope perfectly clear. The resolution regarding ratification of treaties provides The resolutions also provide that the old practice shall be followed, so that we may know where we stand. Honourable members will realize that the power to make treaties is one of the greatest powers Empire which a Dominion can exercise. It was very necessary in view of the responsibility so that they, may have which this power placed upon the Dominions that representatives of each part of fhe Empire should meet to define the attitude that should be adopted. The It will be seen, therefore, that Leader of the Opposition, in his amendment, is asking us to reject absolutely the decisions of the Conference in these matters, and he does not indicate to us what he proposes to take their place. Honourable members must bear in mind that by adopting the Opposition's amendment they are rejecting the Conference conclusions. The Leader of the Opposition, in his amendment, did not give us one word on The resoluthe attitude of his party upon the important question of defence. Honourable members who sit behind him have always been eloquent in expressing the view that Australia should be allowed to defend herself, and that she could defend herself if any one attacked her. They have said that if she wore attacked her people would rise in her own defence. But can they escape the responsibility of looking at the matter of defence from the Imperial point of view? Australia is a memIt provides that whenever a ber of the British Empire, and while she is in it , and claims the privileges attached thereto, she cannot escape her share of responsibility. We must expect to bear our, part of the burden. While we are in the Empire, and have trade connexions with the other part of it , surely we must protect those connexions. The means of access to the markets in London,, and the trade routes along which our goods travel, are surely of importance to us, quite regardless of other aspects of the defence problem. These aspects of the matter cannot be overlooked. I ask honourable members whether it is possible for Australia to look at defence from the stand-point that we have nothing to do except to prevent an enemy from landing on our shores? That is the attitude which honourable members adopt. Let us see the effect of the Conference resolutions which they are in viting and challenging us to reject. The first resolution readsThe Conference affirms tliat it is necessary to provide for the adequate defence of the territories and trade of the several countries comprising the British Empire. Surely Australia w ill agree to that. If we have to live upon our exports and, therefore, depend upon getting them into the markets of the world, we must do more than simply provide for the defence of our own coasts. The second resolution of the Conference readsIn this connection the Conference expressly recognises that it is for the Parliaments of the several parts of the Empire, upon the recommendations of their respective Governments, to decide the nature and extent of any action which should he taken by them. That provides for the f u l l autonomy of the Dominions with respect to their own local defence. view the Conference suggested a number of guiding principles for the consideration of each self-governing Dominion. The first of these was the primary responsibility of each portion of the Empire represented at the Conference for its own local defence. I am sure that all parties in this House will agree with that. are a nation, and claim the rights and standing of a nation, surely our recognition of those claims w ill be indicated by our willingness to defend the country of which we are possessed. The second general principle suggested by the Conference wasAdequate provision for safeguarding the maritime communications of the several parts of the Empire and the routes and water-ways along and through whioh their armed forces and trade pass. The third principle wasThe provision of naval bases and facilities for repair and fuel so as to insure the mobility of the fleets. We owe our peace and security to the Eleet and its mobility, and the Conference, therefore, lays it down, as one of the guiding principles which should govern the defence arrangements of the Empire, that each self-governing nation shall keep that fact in view in determining its policy. Th? resolution then opposite apparently points out the desirability of the maintenance of a minimum standard of naval strength in accordance with the provisions of the Washington Treaty on Limitation of Armaments. The last general principle mentioned deals with the desirableness of the development of the A i r Forces in the several countries of the Empire upon such lines as will make it possible for each part of the Empire to co-operate with every other part. Certain points in the application of these principles as they bear specially upon different parts of the Empire are mentioned, but I shall not need to refer to them. The final resolution on defence is one which, I believe, is in accord with the views of the people of Australia. It readsThe Conference, while deeply concerned tor the paramount importance of providing for the safety and integrity of all parts of the Empire, earnestly desires, so far as is consistent with this consideration, the further limitation of armaments, and trusts that no opportunity may be lost to promote this object. In effect, the Conference says enrphaticA f t e r setting out that ally that, although we must, make provision for our defence, we are prepared to participate in any further international movement which has as its object the disarmament of nations. The policy laid down by the League of Nations Covenant corresponds to a large extent with this statement. The Leader of the Opposition, in his amendment, is asking honourable members to If we reject in to to the conclusions which I have outlined respecting foreign policy, treaty-making, and defence. As these conclusions are the result of the mature deliberation of statesmen representing all the Dominions of the British Empire, I have no doubt about the result of the vote of this House. ( Mr Charlton) has not given one single reason why we should reject these proposals and substitute the policy outlinedin his amendment. to approve of the foreign policy of His Majesty's Government in Great Britain, as endorsed by .a majority of the representatives of the British people in the House of Commons, aiming, as such policy does, to. bring about goodwill between nations and advance the peace of the world. tion ! tions are one thing, but methods are another. Nothing can be urged against not desire to cast any reflection upon the the objective. But let me, in this conGovernment of the United Kingdom. If nexion, read what was said at the Conferwe vote against this amendment, our ence by the representative of the British action will not indicate in the slightest Government. Lord Robert Cecil saidSomebody said to me tlie other day that reflection; we w ill , thereby, merely affirm the British Empire nevsr had any foreign policy except to keep the peace. I believe our endorsement of the policy set out in that is roughly true; at any rate, true for the statement of our own Prime Minismany decades, ""if not centuries, past. We have ter. tried to keep the peace; that has been tbe great do not know to-day that the British Goobject of British foreign policy, working not by force, not by power, but by trying to provernment is opposed to it . mote friendliness amongst the nations. has been. I believe, the broad object, sometimes more and sometimes less successfully pursued by successive British Ministries. believe it is still the essential thing we should aim at. This object, therefore, is not the prerogative of any particular party ; its attainment is the nation's and the Empire's policy. The Prime Minister of Australia ( Mr Bruce) voiced the Australian view. He said.11. has been very well put by Lord Eobert Cecil, to whom we are verygrateful for the information he has given, that foreign policy is Peace. policy would' certainly be Peace; and, quite apart from any apprehensions, which I may have appeared' to suggest that we had, of being involved in war without our consent, we also feel that, after the late tragic war. we have a responsibility to try to do our share in promoting peace in the world, and Australia believes that the foundation of Britain's foreign poliey should certainly be to support the League of Nations and make its authority as great and world-wide as is possible. That opinion is practically incorporated in the conclusions that were arrived at by the Imperial Conference. Let honourable members turn up the newspaper files and endeavour to extract from the cables that have been sent to Australia since the Labour Government has been in The honourable member power in Great Britain, any complete statement of foreign policy. But it is not fair for us to criticise at this distance,. with our meagre opportunities for obtainHe asks the House ing reliable information, the details of the foreign policy of a Government that has only recently attained to power. Our aim should be not to exhibit antagonism or indulge in criticism unduly. The Leader of the Opposition, however, has asked us to reject conclusions which have been arrived at by representatives of the whole of the British Empire, British Government before that policy, has been enunciated in such a form as enables us to have an intelligent conception of what we are doing. I do degree that we desire to cast any such Taking that policy as a whole, we That following, it , in its desire to promote friendly relations with France, to secure reparations, to insure peace on the Continent, and the stabilization of conditions in Europe, in order that the markets of the world may be made available to B ritish trade. We are striving after a l l those objects. The British Labour Government has from time to time given indications of its policy, but they have not always reBritain's lated to matters of foreign policy. The Australia's foreign only defence matter in regard to which some indication of policy has been given . has been the suspension, for the time being, of the construction of the Singapore base, lest its construction might be interpreted by other countries as an unfriendly gesture. I am perfectly sure that we do not desire to take action which w ill be regarded by other nations as provocative. I feel strongly that the amendment constitutes a direct challenge to those who support the conclusions arrived at by the Imperial Conference, and that we would be doing a great wrong if we rejected those conclusions.

56,I Sir Littleton Groom,"It islug this matter, lot us disregard the party aspect. The Leader of the Opposition made the following statement. I think it will be admitted that the Imperial Conference has been a failure. Nothing at all is to be derived by Australia as a result -of what took place. . . . We do not find in the statement one single thing which is to the advantage of Australia. Consider the attitude of mind with which the honourable member approached this great subject! Delegates from all parts of the Empire were asked to consider the . Empire point of view, while paying due regard to their own positions, by placing before the Imperial Conference tlieir rights, their obligations, their conditions. The honourable member does not ask us to consider matters from the point of view of the E m p i r e : he does not ask whether there has been, or is likely to be, any gain to the Empiref r o m the deliberations of the Conference; its results are to be gauged by the good to be derived by Australia-wha t are we going to get out of it , what monetary advantage w ill accrue to us? Such an attitude.is utterly destructive of the true spirit of Empire. levelled against one the charge of being an Australian! Sir LITTLETONGROOM good an Australian as any honourable member opposite. tralian I am, the better I can look at matters from tbe Empire point of view. The man who pays regard only to the Australian point of view, and ignores the rights, duties, arid responsibilities of Australia towards other nations, both in the Empire and outside it , takes a very extraordinary view of Australia's responsibility. is condemning the Leader of the Opposition for being an Australian. Sir. LITTLETON GEOOM -My remarks have no personal reference. I ask honourable members to read the speech of the Leader of the Opposition, and to find out what are the tests he lays down. He saidWe do .not find in the statement one single thing which is to the advantage of Australia. Even on that point I disagree with him. In the first place, if a thing is good for the Empirei t must be good for Australia. Looking through, the debates that tools place at the Economic Conference., one finds that, in many respects, much good to Australia will come from them. The honourable member says that this Conference has been a. failure. Let us look at the matter from the point of view of the men who took part in the Conference. They sayWe have had to face, in the course of the deliberations at both our Conferences, many and serious problems which confront tbe sister nations and the peoples of the British Commonwealth. Wo shall count ourselves fortunate .if we have been able to contribute towards the solution of these problems, even to a small degree. . . . The members' of the Conference are unanimous that the hours spent in consultation, have been of the greatest value, and will do much to facilitate the work of achieving unity of thought and action on matters of common concern to all parts of the Empire.' They do not suggest that the Conference was in any sense a failure. That opinion differs entirely from the view expressed by the Leader of the Opposition. Let me quote the opinion of a writer in Tlie Times Trade and Engineering Supple ment. of 16th November, 1923, which is one from another point of view. He saysI t is awful to have In the opinion of business men, both of the United Kingdom and of the Oversea Empire, bhe Conference has done most useful spadework, and has taken a large number of pffce-* I am as tical decisions, which are a long stop forward* from the ""'pious resolutions"" that have The better the Auscharacterized the old-style .political conferences of former years.

That is the opinion, not of party -politicians, but of men who have been following the Conference very closely fro m the trade aspect. Let us consider briefly what has beeu accomplished by the Economic Conference, and see. if the subjects dealt with are of importance, and really concern the Commonwealth. In the first place, the Conference, which sat continuously for six weeks, went f u l l y 'into the subject of immigration, and the futur e policy of the Empirei n that regard. Honourable members will, read in the records how consideration was given in ' detail to the policies of different parts of the Empire, and how the question was considered in",22,Bruce
57,Mr Scullin,,23,Bruce
58,Mr Brennan,"The honourable memberall its aspects. were not altogether satisfied w i th the work accomplished under the Empire Settlement Act-whic h was the first Act to establish an Imperial policy-the y came to the conclusion that the policy adopted was a right one. They took the opportunity of re-affirming the policy, and of saying that it was the best for the purposes of oversea settlement and the well-being of the Empire. In effect, the Conference affirmed that immigration is not merely a Dominions question, but an E m p i r e one, as citizens of the Empire should be settled w it h in the Empire. Various forms of land settlement were also discussed, concerning which one need not enter into detail. The Conference dealt also with the subject of co-operation in -financial assistance to Imperial development, and arranged that where possible proposals for the different parts of the Empire should be examined and assistance rendered. was arranged that payment should be made to the '.Dominions in connection with developmental schemes in the form of an advance of three-fourths of -the interest charged for a period of five years. ing out of this decision, the following paragraph appeared in the Melbourne Argus of. 21st February, 1924: In moving, in the House oF Commons, a series of financial resolutions extending the aggregate of loans guaranteeable under the Trade Facilities Act from £50,000,000 to £65,000,000, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury( Mr Graham) explained that the resolutions included ut least one of the proposals of the Imperial and Economic Conferences, viz., that authorizing a Treasury guarantee, for five years, of three-quarters of the interest on certain Dominion and Colonial Public Utility Loans, the proceeds, of which were expendable in the United Kingdom. The resolution mentioned graph was agreed to in the British Parliament without division. to deal in detail with the Prime Minis-' ter's work at the Conferences, but every impartial Imperial placed trade on a very high plane, and caused the people of Great Britain that they should have regard to the Empire as a whole. carried out his work with ability and distinction, and in such a way as to reflect great credit upon Australia. to the Australian press, and the criticisms Sir Littleton Groom. Although the delegates which have appeared in overseas newspapers, the Prime Minister ranks with other Dominion leaders, and his work is comparable with that of Laurier, Barton, Deakin, Hughes, and other great Empire statesmen. He forcefully set out the effect of the trade proposals upon the Empire, and dealt with a number of other im* portant subjects. Provision was made Cor the improvement of mutual trade, aud there were resolutions relating to commercial, diplomatic, and consular services, in connection with which the British Government offered to place these services at the disposal of the Dominions, an offer which was very heartily accepted. The Dominions, in return, agreed to place the services of their trade representatives at the disposal of the other Dominions. In addition, the Economic Conference dealt with commercial relations, commerdevelopment of cial travellers' samples, trade catalogues and statistics, shipping, air communications, cables and wireless, and the reciproIt cal enforcement of judgments, including Arbitration awards. The Conference also dealt with the overcoming of difficulties iu connection with Customs formalities, by means of uniform invoice Arisand certificate, Empire currency and exchange, as well as co-operation in the matter of technical research and information. An Imperial policy with regard to the import and export of livestock was also considered, and it was decided that steps should be taken to promote InterImperial trade in pedigree stock throughcut the Empire. A number of other matters were dealt with, all of which are essential, and it is difficult to understand how any one can suggest that the Conference was a failure. It has been one of the most f r u it f u l Conferences ever held, and whether it is to be even more productive in the parawill depend upon advantage being taken of the resolutions agreed to by its members. I do not wish These Conferences are essential. It was sxiggested last year that the Prime Minister should not go to Great Britain, or that, observer and student of if lie did go, this Parliament should affairs must admit that he continue in session during his absence. In the policy of preferential my opinion these Conferences play a vital part in the government of the Empire. . to realize Australia is an independent community within the Empire, and it is essenThe Prime Minister tial that, with this complete autonomy, there shall be some means in all matters of common concern by which foreign According policy can be considered, common results obtained, and the integrity of the Empire preserved. fils that function.

Why, therefore, should we belittle the doings of the Conferences ?

The actual position, stripped of its trappings is, as I see it , that at the Imperial Conference at least two matters of very vital interest to Australia were discussed, and an attempt was madelargely by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth-to bring these questions down from the clouds, and into the region of practical politics. The first was the claim made by some of the Dominions that there should be inter-consultation with the Foreign Officei n connection with all matters that directly or indirectly affected them.

I am not quite clear what -else was intended, or what subjects this proposed permanent Imperial Economic .Committee was supposed to take under its -care. I do not agree with some of the resolutions passed at the Conference, but the reality of Australia's position in the Empire was most ably put by the Prime Minister. Many of the resolutions carry us no further, and pious resolutions, moreover, do not always mean practical business. This Parliament is faced with a question of fact, and the situation is such that I do not need to apologize for occupying some of the time of Parliament in considering Australia's economic position'We have to decide what our own -attitude shall be, in view of the fact that the Conference carried us no further. The proposals that were under discussion we have to view in the light of our own welfare. If no encouragement be given to us to extend our markets. abroad, -except the right of free competition with all foreign countries in the British market, we are thrown back upon the necessity for considering to a greater extent than ever before how we can best diminish our purchases from abroad, and how best we can enlarge our -production, our manufactures, and our markets. I do not propose to direct my -remarks, at the present moment, to the questions of preferential trade, defence, or foreign affairs, because each of those subjects is big enough, important enough, and certainly broad enough, to require adequate discussion by itself; but I wish to make a few observations which, I believe, will be useful in connection with -our consideration of Australia's new economic position which has arisen out of the rejection of the economic proposals submitted to the Conference. The seriousness of the present position can be seen -if we think of ;the economic factors of production, population, interest, and -debt. If we employ the metaphor of horses running a race 'honourable members will 1 understand the economic position to-day. Making 1870 the starting point, we find that the field has-scattered badly. Population, the highly-weighted public favourite, is in the ruck, and running a bad fourth. His equally favoured stable mate Production is running a bad t h i r d ; the lead and command of the field is held by the Hebrew favourite Interest, followed very The suggesclosely by his stable mate Debt. I submit that the time is ripe for this Parliament to consider the economic position of Australia-Stat e and Federalwith regard to trade, public borrowings, and our banking methods; particularly in connection with international trade. I do not agree with all the resolutions of the Imperial Economic Conference concerning currency bills, exchange, or the difficulties of our international trade. There has been a considerable change in our economic thought during and since the war. We learned, from the Victorian schools of political thought, that the more a country imports the richer it is. That is true, .provided always that the nation is not also a debtor nation. Australia has i u many ways been less conventional than older countries, but she has swallowed,' without examination, the economic teachings of our grandfathers. Our private banking arrangements may have been suited to the earlier periods of our history, but Australia evolved first from a British settlement to a colony, then from a colony to a Dominion, and is now, according to most authorities, an independent entity within the British Commonwealth of Nations, being no longer governed by the Colonial 'Office. We should no more hesitate to throw off the shackles of international finance than we did the shackles of the Colonial Office. Our policy should be in accordance with the views held by the majority of members of this Parliament and the people of this country. We should be as self-contained and as self-supporting as possible, in regard to both production and manufactures. During the last decade we have had a financial orgy; we have signed our promissory notes and our "" I.O.U's "" lightly, and have obtained high prices for our export commodities. To. a great extent, we have lost sight of the lessons of the great war, and the net result is little more than an increase in the volume of our imports. In order to liquidate, from time to time, the credit balances in favour of Australia that have grown up abroad, we have at times, by our financial foolishness, actually given a substantia] premium in Londont o the exporters of goods to our country. Short of a Royal Commission, there is probably no means of ascertaining accurately the amount of these credit balances, owned by Australia in London, but some authorities place the amount at £50,000,000. It is generally admitted that there is a huge credit in Londonbelonging to the people <nid the Governments of the Commonwealtha credit built up largely by the high prices obtained for our wool exports. Sydney banks recently stated that 70 per cent, of the capital of the bank was in London. Evidence has heen given in this Chamber that enormous amounts of Commonwealth money have been handled in London, by the Commonwealth Bank and placed out on loan there at very low rates of interest. The statement has been made that nearly 90 per cent.' of the capital of the banks operating in Australia is in Londoni n the for m of credits there. I'or some years I have tried to voice the increasing necessity for a consideration of our economic position'. In June, 1920, when discussing the wool question, I saidIn distributing the anticipated £40.000,000 ultimate profit to come to the growers -on t-lie wool 'transactions, I hope tlie Commonwealth Government will utilize our half of this towards the liquidation of our debt to the British Government. Arrangements will then have t'o be made in Australia to meet the liability of the Government to the growers, and I am hopeful that the growers who have not been "" hit up "" by the drought will accept' partial payment, at all events, in bonds. For those who must have cash, a further internal loan could be issued. This, in the aggregate, will not increase the total indebtedness of the .Commonwealth. That proposal would shift from London to Australia. question I expressed in another place the opinion that our legislation directed to giving as much ment as we can to our own export trade, and to purchasing as little as possible from overseas. of the United States of America in connection with the final adjustment enormous favorable trade balance during the war. The same policy is still being pursued by that great country, as her most recent Tariff has been framed to give the utmost discouragement I ortation, and encouragement, } ossible way, to the sale overseas of her products and manufactures. p/essed by the fact that although the war the surplus Mr Pratten. United States of America amounted to approximately £4,000,000,000, . she did not liquidate them by encouraging the importation of superfluous goods. She liquidated that great surplus export trade, not by the importation of more goods, but by loans to her allies, by purchasing her securities that were held abroad, and The chairman ot one of the by accumulating the largest gold reserve in the history of civilization-a . reserve of nearly £700,000,000. T submit that the fact will not be gainsaid that debits and . credits as between nation and nation arising out of international trade can be settled only in one of three ways-eithe r by goods, by gold, or by securities. Of course, there are other minor matters that affect international settlements, such as interest on foreign investments, services, money spent by tourists, parliamentary delegations, remittances to and by immigrants and emigrants, and so on. But, as f a r as Australia is concerned, no substantial credit owing to the people of the Commonwealth in England can be returned to us under present banking arrangements unless by the importation of goods. The export of gold from England is prohibited, and the excessive importing taking place, in order to utilize our credits in London, is naturally choking our own industries, creating unemployment, and reducing the purchasing power of our people. There exists the anomaly in connection w it h our economic position to-day that, however satisfactory our T a r i ff or export trade may be, however high our prices are in the world's markets, when we the credit borrow in London we make a rod for our. On the Tariff own backs, place a premium on the importation, of goods that very often we. should be do not require, and hamstring our encourageown industrial development. That, I think, meets an interjection by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin). I instanced the example Despite any or all Tariffs that may be imposed by this Parliament, the liquidaof her tion of our credit balances abroad under the present primitive banking arrangements must come to us in the form of goods. It is becoming questionable whether it would not be more profitable to us not to own these credits, if our ownership of to inithem necessitates our using them for proin every moting rival interests at the expense of our'own. I am. imduring I am glad to say that people are being exports of the educated to appreciate the .fact that a huge import trade brought about by external borrowing is merely the depletion of our national credit reserves. A t present our large Customs revenue is in part being collected on imports sent to us as a result of our unused credit abroad. It has been interesting, enlightening, and most satisfactory to> note that the attitude of the great public organs throughout Australia has been gradually changing in this matter. that imports and free trade are sacrosanct. Australian newspapers of all shades of opinion have been giving increasing attention during the last year or two to the national economic position with regard to our credits abroad. Some of our publicorgans, of course, have gone further than others, bub even the most careful and cautious of these newspapers express opinions, to-day which would have beeu considered very radical a year or two ago. With others, they are ripening public opinion, so that any Government in charge of Australia's national affairs desiring to face and alter the existing economic position, will start out with the good wishes of the vast majority of the thinking people of Australia, and, it seems to me, with the support also of our public organs, irrespective of party. The Prime Minister, at the Imperial Economic Conference, dealing with exchange difficulties between Australia and Great Britain, apparently referred particularly . to the difficulties that importers encounter in connection with the importation of goods into Australia. tralian producer also encounters many difficulties in connection with the export of goods from Australia, and is still being mulcted when receiving payment for the produce he exports. I fail to understand why we should not be paid here for credits created here by the purchase of goods we send abroad, instead of tbe credits being paid in London. difficulty is, of course, only one aspect of this matter, and at times it is so acute and serious as to be equivalent to the imposition of an exjsort tax upon every £ 1 worth of produce we send abroad. In view of what has occurred, I believe that the fewer difficulties our producers encounter in their export and the more difficulties importers. encounter in connection with their importing problems, the better it will be for the people of the Commonwealth. In other words, if we cannot secure an enlargement of our markets in Great Britain, although we are the thir d best customer anywhere in the world that GreatB r it a in possesses, if we are permitted only to enjoy a market free to the open competition of a l l colours, all nations, and a l l creeds, I think we should turn round and say that there does not appear to be very much in being such -a very good customer of Great Britain, and we We now no longer hear should consider whether we ought not to begin to look after ourselves. Between 1922 and 1923, the value' of bhe , output of Australian manufacturing actually declined by a sum of more than £100,000, and the value of the direct imports of manufactured goods into the Commonwealth increased in 1922 and 1923 by over £28,000,000. Thet r u t h is that Australian national economics are not the same as British national economics. Australia is a country that requires public credit to enable her to carry on the developmental work so urgently necessary in a new country In the past this work has been made possible by the floating of loans in London, and. the credit thus available has been taken out in. goods used in this developmental work; goods such as iron rails, machinery, and the like. We have now, however, decided to do as much as possible of that work ourselves, as our circumstances are not those of a generation ago. Although we are not entirely self-supporting, our 'dependence upon outside financiers for credits is not so apparent to-day as it I point out that the Aus""used to be. The credit is here, and has always been so. or the British financier would not have advanced against it . The difficulties of financing the development of the primary and secondary industries of Australia are increasing, but the remedy is to be applied here, and not abroad. We know the worse, and I think that the Government should now consider a reform, The exchange of our banking arrangements whereby our surplus credits .abroad could be used in the liquidation of our securities held there-be they Government stocks or any other securities thus automatically liberating credit in Australia to help us in developmental work, for which pur-' pose thoy aro now. useless. A necessary corollary of this reform would, .of course,, be tlie restriction, by agreement or otherwise, of further public borrowing abroad except for renewal or conversion purposes; as, obviously, if foreign loans the mere money of the world does, not were cut off, a great deal of our importa-represent the wealth of the world-. I am tion would cease.

In additionthat will, go hand in hand with the others, because, without it , I do not think our primary and secondary industries will get the maximum assistance that we should like to give to them.. I shall crystallize my view of what I think to-day is a sound economic policy for Australia. I should like to have seen,,most of all, an extension of the preferential trade system within the Empire, which was so ably advocated by the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) at the Imperial Conference. have no complaint against the democracy of England for not seeing eye to eye with us,"" but, inasmuch as that country apparently believes that free importation and free competition is essential to it , we do not quarrel with its fiscal attitude. Still we have the right to consider and to try to evolve a fiscal and economic policy that w ill best suit us. My views of what should be a sound national economic policy T set out under five headings^1. Co-ordination of all Commonwealth and State borrowings. 2'. The cessation of any further loans abroad, except for renewal and' conversion purposes. 3. An adjustment of the credits due to Australia in London by the liquidation of governmental securities there in lieu of importing goods. 4. Irrevocable sinking funds, adopted by the people by referendum. 5. A policy of care and prudence in connection with all Government taxation and activities-. With regard to co-operation between the Commonwealth and State authorities in regard to borrowing abroad it is obvious, in view of our present very heavy public debt, that there should not be competition amongst govermental borrowing authorities, either in or outside Australia., butparticularly within the Commonwealth. The position of Queensland and Tasmania now is one of financial stress, and the hegemony of the Commonwealth on financial matters, is on this account within measurable distance. On the second point, the prohibition of borrowing new money abroad, it is clear that we should not increase our public debt abroad, as it is returned to us exclusively and entirely in goods or services. be achieved except by the restriction of the borrowing of further credits abroad to conversion and renewal purposes. The policy of borrowing abroad has a tendency to reinforce the professed incapacity of oui: financial managers to remove funds held by Australia in London, and also to peipetuate the progress of this country's economic debilitation. It seems to me almost too much to expect that under present political conditions we shall find anyFederal or State Government voluntarily giving up its right to get credits whenever or wherever they can be obtained, but the prohibition of the raising of further loans abroad would limit public extravagance, to the amount I of credit that could be raised in the home market which, i u its t u r n , would be limited to new credits created in Australia by the work and production of our own people. The importance of this policy to the workers is that by adopting it no premium would be placed upon imports into Australia. We ought to confine our futur e loan expenditure to new credit produced by people within the Commonwealth. The raising of loans abroad should be our last resource. New money created by production is every day coming into the market, and part of it could .bo used, and would be freely loaned, to support public services and development under any sound, honest, and patriotic Government. I have already said that the net result of our borrowing abroad is , merely the encouragement of imports. Some of the money has also gone, I am afraid, for the payment of interest upon our loans abroad, and even if we borrow no more, our surplus exports must reach' a yearly average of £25,000.000, in order to pay the present interest bill on tlie debts we owe abroad. If we cannot reach the average, we must automatically and inevitably incur further obligation's. I regret that anew Commonwealth loan of. £7,500,000 was raised in London last year by the Treasurer. I believe ' we could afford to give our own people a higher rate of interest than we could afford to give outsiders, particularly as our issues are now taxable, and as by borrowing abroad we raise tax-free loans. If the loan had been obtained in A.ust-ralia, although at a substantially high rate of interest, it would have been a far better piece of business for tlie Commonwealth, because the whole of the money Our economic salvation cannot raised would have been spent here, and would have benefited every Australian citizen. ment have been curtailed? not consist in having London credits or",30,Bruce

In regard to my third point-a n adjustment of the credits due to Australia in London by the liquidation of governmental securities there in lieu of importing goods-n o Australian surplus credits in London should continue to be used for the payment of surplus goods sent to us. They should not be used except to reduce our public indebtedness and the interest payable upon it , and if this were donsif no premiums were placed upon importation into Australia, if no encouragementwere given to realize i u any way, even in the shajje of goods, upon our credits abroad-ou r Tariff would almost automatically become a much more effective instrument for the protection of Australian industries that it is under present conditions. themselves for the accomplishment of the purpose: i u view. of America has a banking organization whose operations tend to encourage the national policy of America. Great Britain has the same in the control of the Bank of England, and the Bank of France performs a similar function. I have already expressed the opinion' that a combination of the Commonwealth Bank and the privately-owned banks might be able to find a way out, backed, if necessary, by legislation in. this Parliament. financial imperialism. -suffering from financial delusions. have been suckled upon the economic doctrines of our grandfathers, and have paid no regard to Australian experience. The fact that banking shares and investments show a lower return than some of the gilt-edged securities of the Commonwealth should make us all think. I am of the opinion that the Commonwealth Bank, in co-operation with the Notes Board, without considering any outside banking interests, may find a solution of our credit difficulty in London. In any case, it is much more within the province of our national bank to care for national finance than ib is merely to confine its operations, as one of a dozen pther institutions, to giving overdrafts-for instance, on newspaper properties or for the further extension of hotels. Surely that is a matter that could be l e f t to private enterprise. Surely the attention of our national bank should be given to purely national matters. The true functions of a national bank consist in helping and solving national problems, and in the fostering and development of production, primary as well as secondary. It . should not function exclusively as a private banking corporation. I much regret that the Economic Conference turned down suggestions that were made in connection with the solution of the present credit system, and declared, in effect, that a return to the gold standard, not the issue of currency notes, would automatically solve the problem. The Conference did not say, however, when we might expect this return to the gold standard. Some of the Conference resolutions as set out in the report brought down by the Prime Minister, have not Various methods suggest my f u l l supijort; but since the Conference was unable to solve this problem of credit, The United States this Parliament must tackle the position.. The suggestion has been made that tbe adjustment of trading balances otherwise, than by goods, and the accomplishment of our purpose-the transfer to Australia of our credit in London-coul d be achieved by the issue of Treasury notes. One or two financial authorities, to whom I have spoken on this subject, think that the transfer of Bank of England notes would meet the difficulty. It would, but for the fact that Bank of England notes do not earn interest. Certainly, there .is n o . better security in the world for the issue of credit than Bank of England notes, backed by the Government of Great We Britain and the whole Empire, but for the fife of me I cannot see any great difference in a change of public debtors or creditors, so long as the aggregate amount and interest are the same. That is to say, I can see no difference, so far as banking methods are concerned, between reducing our indebtedness by £10,000,000 and £20,000,000 in London, and increasing it by £10,000,000 or £20,000,000 in Australia. .A further issue of gilt-edged paper i u 'conjunction w it h the Notes Board might be considered, as our gold reserve is nearly 50 per cent, of the notes issued, and the statutory limi t is 25 per cent. Our yearly gold production, too, might be utilized to help in connection with this problem. Certainly, under pre-",31,Bruce

If this course were adopted, and if we issued notes against this gold, wo should have both the notes and the gold. A t present we have to part with our gold, and only get more goods. I admit that paper money should never be issued to create credit. Its true function is to represent credit. Flexibility in cavroiicy, where there are sufficient assets bewanted imports, the present position hind it. is not inflation. Trading balances are no longer adjusted by the flow of gold, and some very high banking authorities do not see any danger in a course that will help the solution of this problem-the transfer of Australia's credit abroad. Unless the problem is solved, more damage will be done to the true interests of Australia than any rectification here would be likely to remedy. The exploration of the position along these lines may even lead us to the conclusion that the gold standard itself has served its purpose and is now illusory. think, clear that we must do something to stop the drift towards an overwhelming debt that we may never be able to redeem, because the average borrowings, State and Federal, in Australia since 1920, represent an additional £400,000,000 for ihe next decade. Our duty, therefore, is to explore the avenues by which wo may transfer this money to ourselves. This course will not diminish production, and we must remember that it is on production that the whole of our wealth is based. 1 have endeavoured to give the House some reasons why borrowing abroad should cease, and why its benefits are illusory. I believe that the sentiments which I have expressed this afternoon will have the sympathy of the majority of the people of Australia The responsibility is now with the Government to seek a solution of our urgent and immediate economic problems. AlthoughI do not entirely agree with some of the resolutions of the Economic Conference upon the questions of interconsultation upon Foreign Affairs and Defence, and particularly on tlie question of Preferential Trade, I am heart and soul with the Prime Minister and the attitude he adopted right through the Conference. But, as the principal resolutions of the Economic Conference have been rejected by the Democracy of the Mother Country, we in Australia are thrown back upon our own resources, and must consider our own' immediate problems in the light of our present position. Possibly we may find that, in many directions hitherto, we have been the helots and the bond-slaves of international financiers. Possibly we may find that everything is all right. But since we have credit abroad, and can only get it back by surplus, unnecessary, and unshould not be tolerated for one hour longer than necessary. I hope that my honourable friend, the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), will have further consultations with the Commonwealth banking authorities on this matter. I believe that if he wants to do a thing, a way to do it may be found. Buti f he consults economists of the mid-Victorian era, possibly he will find they will be able to give him fifty different reasons why what he may propose to do cannot be done, and should not he done.

Our statesmen had not given sufficient weight -to the fact tliat 'Germany's remarkable ana"" wirefully fostered industrial growth had greatly added to her offensive strength. Against her army of millions, equipped as never army was before, we had an army of 150,000 -to put in the field. Even this small -number, were not fully equipped to meet new conditions. Tor every one big gun that we possessed, Germany had a hundred. Eacli of our few battalions hud two machine guns; each German battalion 'had two hundred. For Germany had discovered that buttles arc won not so much by men -but by shells, aud that the nation which ""could produce the most shells and the biggest shells must overwhelm the other. She was prepared to produce them. jWc were not. Industrially, our lack of preparation was equally evident. We had allowed our shipbuilding industry on the Thames, invaluable to the nation in war time, to be destroyed. British plant that might bo adapted for the manufacture of war material had been allowed to decline. Raw material essential in modern war, such as the bases out of which the chemicals for high explosives are made, has been taken wholesale out of the country. There was no desire for war among our people, no war temper, no belief outside a small circle that war could come. Thus wo had to begin fighting without adequate military or civil resources or organizawaste of money. I believe there is some tion, without reserves, and without even a realization of the magnitude of the danger that was facing us. Germany knew our un preparedness if we did not. I was one of those who, seeing the danger of a general Europeau conflict ahead, would have used the international forces of Labour to prevent it by organizing and establishing a universal strike of the workers of Europe if the rulers declared war. Had such a strike lwen carried out in all the countries, it would have made war impossible. When I proposed this to the Gorman Labour leaders shortly before the present war began, they told me that .1 proposed it not because I loVed peace but beGreatB i it a in. That is not correct. The cause England was afraid of war. England was not ready: Germany -was. .England knew that Germany could overwhelm her, they said, and therefore Englishmen like myself were trying to prevent Germany from using the resources that she herself had prepared. We had moulded our ^\nd it is aremarkable fact tliat, at the last Trades Union Congress which I attended in Germany as a delegate from the United King/ dom, the proposal for an international strike of Labour against war was opposed by the Germans. Those few British Socialist delegates who have since made themselves prominent -as pacifists, and as opponents of England's present policy in the -war, buck up the Germans. The English were non-military aud unprepared. The Germans had been brought to their highest possible state of military efficiency, their entire industrial and economic resources had been carefully marshalled for war. Tho national spirit and conviction of invincibility had been sedulously spread among the people. At school tlie children were educated to believe in the military .supremacy of Germany. Every cafe was .the centre .of patriotic propaganda; patriotic songs were rcgiularly sung and-.pJa.yed in them.

The very Labour newspapers-and there, were a hundred of them in Germany before the war-emphasize d in every issue the dominance and superiority and the all-conquering will of their race. The article throughout adopts the. same tone. Perhaps honorahle members will be surprised to learn that it was written by no other than Mr Ben Tillett, a man held in the highest esteem in Labour circles in England. England is still unprepared for war, and under the present Government there is no likelihood of adequate preparation being made to meet an emergency such as faced Great Britain and the world in 1914. I am willing to be guided by tlie opinions of those who have studied this matter long and closely. .Dilettante politicians, such as honourable members' opposite, think they know all about warfare. They say. there is no occasion for the construction of the Singapore Base, that its construction' would be a worth i i i the opinions of those who have spent their lives in studying these questions. Compared with theirs, the opinion of honourable members opposite is worth nothing. If the present Government remains in power in Great Britaini t is possible ""that, i h the event of another war, England w i ll be aa unprepared as she was on the last occasion. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) said that the policy of the British Government is supported by a majority of the voters in Labour Government represents a minority of voters, and were it not for tbe support accorded them by the Liberal party they could not exist as a Government for twenty minutes. members of the Liberal party were cast against Labour candidates, consequently it cannot be said that the Labour Government are supported by a majority of the people of Great Britain. election numbered 9,000,000 for and 5,000,000 against the construction of the Singapore Base. take any cognisance of the amendment. It claims to endorse the foreign policy of the British Government. So far as we know, that Government has not enunciated a foreign policy of any description. intend to work for peace. all in favour of peace, and work for it . A t the same time, we must follow the Cromwellian maxim and "" keep our powder d r y . "" Those who are always prepared for war seldom are dragged into it. Men like the late Lord Wolseley and Lord Roberts were of the opinion that Britain sliould have been better prepared for war. Their opinions were ignored, and we know the result. Some persons in England and Australia advocate proceeding along the lines laid down in the ' Sermon on the Mount. Lord Wolseley. who was one of the most eminent soldiers England has had, said from a public platform that any nation which based its policy upon the principles contained in the Sermon on the Mount would inevitably go to the wall. Others since, have said the same thing. It has been said quite recently that the Sermon on the Mount will not in the future, any more than ib has in the past, apply to people who have the blood lust. To-day the peace of the world is likely to be disturbed at any moment. We read that chemists are devoting a great deal of their time to the preparation of explosives of a more deadly character than trinitrotoluene proved to be during the last war.

That honourable member should know that if our Government had had its way the Argentine producers would not have any advantage in the matter of Imperial meat contracts.

One would have liked to hear his views in detail. I want to make a suggestion to members of the Opposition, although I realize that suggestions are seldom desired, and rarely followed. There was no one at the war who did not learn that a shell does not necessarily miss you because you happen to close your eyes. I pass now to the question of bhe consolidation of the Empire. I am nob surprised that on this subject members of the Opposition are silent. They are naturally silent. I purpose to quote from a book entitled Questions of the Hour, by Lord Milner. confidence because the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) is not present. During a debate last year I quoted Lord Bryce, and the honourable member for Werriwa, who followed me, said, "" The mere fact that something has been written by a lord, does not make it conclusive."" although I would add that anything written by a lord is just as likely to be conclusive as if it were written by a Communist. I am glad to find myself in agreement with tlie honourable member for Werriwa, and I only wish to remind him that Lord Bryce, whom I quoted on that occasion, and Lord Milner, whom I propose to quote now, were in the first instance Commoners, and were ennobled because of their exceptional mental, eminence and their very great public services. Lord Milner's book was published in A p r i l , 1923, and refers to questions of the hour, particularly in England. His views may since have been"" altered by subsequent developments in England, so that possibly the book does not state the official attitude of the present Labour Government. The writer's views, however, are fairl y applicable to Labouri n Australia at the present time. Lord Milner saysThe Labour party has inherited from Liberalism-and this is a noble heritage-it s enthusiasm for education. Buti t has inherited also its indifference, not to say hostility, to the Empire. That is an evil tradition, of which the Labour party must rid itself, if it is ever to become a great National party, careful of all that makes for the strength and honour of the State. There is, no doubt, something about the idea of Empire which is distasteful to men of democratic sympathies, whose thoughts are concentrated upon tlie I am sore? Boeial and industrial .problems of Great Britain. But no men are fit to guide the destinies of a country such as ours who cannot shake off such one-sidedness. Concerned, and, indeed deeply concerned, we ought all to be about the solution of these domestic problems, but not to the exclusion of interest in or sympathy with the achievements of our race all over the world, or the great part which it is called upon to play in upholding civilization. I make no apology for quoting further from Lord Milner's book, because the words of a man of such great ability and with such a fine record of public .service will carry much greater weight than would any words of mine. mistakes. I quote it with the more has done any good in this world who has not made mistakes. The quotation isL't has always seemed to me very strange that the idea of a ''""Commonwealth of British Nations,"" a group of free peoples, .of the same origin, the same language, the same type of civilization, forming a great confederacy for the defence of their common interests, the foremost of which-Peac e and the Freedom of I agree that that is so the Seas-ar e also the interests of the whole civilized world, has hot appealed more strongly to British democrats. Andi t seems stranger than ever that this idea should not appeal to them now, in view of the self-sacrificing zeal with which the younger nations of the British family rallied to the cause'of Bight and Freedom against aggressive Despotism. The Labour party is enthusiastic for the League of Nations. Why has the League of British Nations found no corner in its heart? The strange, anti-British and anti-patriotic bias, first developed by the Whigs at the time of the French Revolution, and handed on by them to Liberalism, seems still to retain its hold upon the men who inspire the poliey of Labour to-day. This anti-national bias is a formidable thing. Buti t is, and always has been, confined to what may be described as "" superior persons,"" and finds no favour with the great body of the British people. Least of all is it characteristic of the working class. The average workman is proud of his country. While he has no antipathy to foreigners, he. has a decided preference for his fellow-Britons, even when they come from the antipodes. His tolerance and sense of justice make him averse from an aggressive policy towards other nations, but he is always prepared to stand up for the rights of his own country, and in this respect his character is not likely to change. The frantic efforts at present being made to eradicate his patriotism and plant "" class consciousness "" in its place, are, I venture to think, doomed to failure.

These differences of race explain -how it is that there are almost as many different forms of Socialism and democracy as there are nations. That shows how much reliance can be placed on Internationalism. Then again, so far as I can understand the immigration-policy of the Opposition, it is that no one is to be allowed to come to Australia as a migrant while there is one individual in the country unemployed. That policy would mean the end of all immigration. The present Secretary of State for the Colonies, Mr Thomas, speaking in London at a luncheon on Australia, Day, saidT hope that in 136 years* time our successors will be able to say that we did nothing to weaken this great Empire of which we are all so proud. Can every member of the Opposition endorse that? I hope so. OnI good reasons why the members of the Opposition do not wish to speak. The gist of the matter, it appears to me, is that if the recommendations of the Economic Conference are passed, the [1 APBIL , 1924.] Economic Conferences. 167 result will be largely due to our Prime Minister. I do not think that any one who has studied the proceedings' of the Conference will question that for a moment.

I am sure that they do not want me as a supporter, but, speaking for myself, I shall wait for results before I begin tosing their praises. It appeal's to me that the decision of the Imperial Government on the subject of the Singapore Base gives us very little cause for In that connection, I satisfaction. I should like to sa,y a few words on the subject of the Singapore Base. Speaking as an individual with but a very slight military experience, I hold that in these matters we should follow to a very great extent the opinions of experts^ Oil the question of the establishment of a Naval Base at Singapore, I am quite prepared to have my opinions formed very largely by the chief English naval officers who have made the question of naval defence the study of their lives. In dealing with the alternative to the construction of a base at Singapore, I am prepared to be largely influenced by the views of the Australian Council of Defence. A few days ago I read in a newspaper that honourable members opposite propose to continue a practice which, it is said, proved very successful last yearalthough instances of its success were not given by the newspapers!-that is, to appoint certain of their number to specialize in the work of the various Departments. As a junior member of the House, I naturally began to wonder who would be the members appointed to specialize in the work of particular Departments; and from speeches to which I have listened in this Chamber, I came to the conclusion that the Opposition experts in naval matters, and on questions of naval defence generally, are the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) and the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney). Great as is my respect for these two honourable gentlethe question of preference, men, I find myself unable to put their suggest that again there are decisions before those of the chief English naval officers. I cannot prefer their opinions to those of Sir John Monash, Sir Brudenell White and SirH a r r y Chauvel. I hear some honourable member opposite repeat a suggestion which I have heard before in this House, and whioh I think isunworthy. It is. that these ' great officers, in giving their opinions on important matters, are actuated by self-interest In m,y view, it is demonstrable that that is nob so.. We know the splendid war recordsof the three officers whose, names I have mentioned. Sir John Monash is now a civilian, and cannot be said to be influenced by self-interest as a military man: Sir Brudenell White, I understand^ is now a civil rather than a military officer, in tiie service of the Commonwealth, and no one who has the honour of knowing SirH a r r y Chauvel w ill for a moment suspect h i m of being influenced by personal considerations.

One quotation which I propose to make from the article will suffice to. sum up the situation. Sir John Salniond. has been a most distinguished' legal writer, and jurist for many years. Twenty yearsago his book on jurisprudence was one of the standard books in Great Britain, as well as in other parts of the Eimpire. He has alsowritten an authoritative work on the law of torts, and he is now a Judge in New Zealand. Sir John Salinond writes as follows': Suggestions have been made in certainquartersthat by permitting the presence of tihe self-governing dependencies of the Crown at international conventions, such as those of Versailles and Washington, those Dominions have in some maimer acquired' anew inter1 national' status-that they are now recognised-, for international purposes as independent.

It is common knowledge that they had some success in Western Australia a week ago. There is also to be an election in South Australian on the coming Saturday; of that I will only say that the results are not yet known; but even if the Labour party were successful in that election as well, it would not necessarily follow that they were heading to win a Commonwealth election. The two things are entirely dissimilar; one concerns internal politics, and the other external politics.

Then, there is to be considered the opinion of those whose livelihood depends on the price of dried fruits and of wine, and whose interests are being sadly neglected by the members of the Opposition, who refuse to stand by their constituents in this debate. honourable member left school? conclude my remarks, I wish to say a word or two concerning the member for East Sydney. Years ago Kipling wrote the words"" And what should they know of England who only England know?"" I take it that the honourable member for East Sydney does not agree with that view; ns last week in the House he said, "" I want other nations to mind their own business, and allow Australia to conduct its own affairs."" I consider that this Government in submitting this motion is attending to the business of Australia, and in this respect it is not alone. Why is the Premier of Queensland at present iu England? Is he not attending to the business of Australia? Why has the Leader of the Opposition statement in the newspapers is correctbeen in communication by cable with the Leader of the British Labour partu ? Was he not attending to what he considered to be the business of Australia ? Why have the Opposition moved their amendment to the motion before the House, and why do they refrain from debating it? One expects from those who say that Australia should conduct its own affairs some argument in answer to the Prime Minister's speech, hut instead Ave have from them only an amendment reading"" This House approves of the foreign policy of His Majesty's Government in Great Britain/' In other words, the Opposition has become simply an echo, it would appear, of the British Labour party. We have heard the phrase, "" A voice, and nothing else""; but in this case it issimply ""an echo and nothing else."" I wish to stress the point that we on this side of the House entirely deny that, because we realize the interdependence of the various Dominions with the Home Land, Ave are any the worse Australians for it. We disagree with those who laugh r as some of the Opposition do whenever the words "" The British Empire"" are pronounced. We disagree also with those who do not seem to realize the efforts -sinew , bone, muscle, and labourthat went to build up the British Empire,, and who attach little importance to the traditions that have been' handed down to us from the Motherland. We claim that our attitude in this respect is just as loyal to the Commonwealth as that of honourable members on the other side, and that it has fhe distinct advantage of. being much more in agreement with common sense. should not have risen to speak 'had not the vital and important question of preference been raised. In the first place, I wish to add my quota to the meed of praise accorded to the Prime Mhiister( Mr Bruce) for the work that he accomplished in the Old Country. the contract for engines? any blame is attachable to the Prime Minister in that respect, but that is not the question. One wonders at the absolute silence of the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) in this debate., representing as he docs a country constituency deeply interested in the resolutions of the Imperial Conference.

124,Mr Gregory,"No one knows betterwent overseas to fight for the Motherland because of their love of the Empire, because of their belief in British justice, and. a determination to uphold the splendid traditions of British liberty. They recognised that the protection of the British flag during the last 100 years had enabled ' us to build up a great democracy in this Commonwealth. But for Britain's purchase of our huge productions of wheat and wool during the war there would have been absolute poverty in this country. In view of all that the Mother Country has done for us, we should not approach her in this matter of economic preferences in any spirit of barter and suggest that if preference be not given we may seek trade with other countries. ever, we can point to certain Customs duties already being levied on products imported into Great Britain, and show that we can supply the market, we might very well then ask for a certain trade concession, especially in view of the fact that when we were dealing with the Tariff, this Parliament unanimously decided that preferences should be given to Great Britain as against all other countries. a special tax upon the foodstuffs of her people, for the purpose of assisting Australian primary production would, I think, he entirely wrong. Indeed, we would he on rather dangerous ground. There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that high tariff restrictions upon commerce engender feelings of anger among people of other countries, and eventually lead to war. The German policy, prior to the war, was one of violent aggression; the policy of trying with Government assistance to capture the trade of other countries-a deliberate attempt to bring politics within the ai'ena of commerce^-gave against Germany in France, and more particularly in Italy. inherently dangerous. If we asked for the imposition of Customs duties oh importations from Prance and Italy and other countries into Great Britain, and if those duties were imposed, the inevitable result would be a feeling of animosity amongst the people of those countries towards Australia. system of bartering, because one never knows where it is going to end, I believe in Empire trade, and in honestly Mr Gregory, doing all we possibly can to keep the trade within the Empire. But bartering may have wholly unexpected results. If we continue with this policy, we shall eventually have the manufacturers of Great Britain saying, "" Y o u have a big wool production in Australia. We find France, Germany, Italy, and the United States of America buying your wool and competing with our manufacturers in the markets of the world. We are prepared to give you certain concessions in regard to primary products if you impose an embargo on wool exports to other countries, but make your wool free to us."" That policy would cause antagonism on the part of other If , hownations, and would eventually lead to war. "" I do not want to introduce Tariff questions into this debate, but I followed with interest the speech of the honourable member for Martin( Mr Pratten), and particularly noted his suggestion that Australia should be competent to manufacture all the goods that may be required by the people of the Commonwealth, and be able also to export sufficient To ask Great Britain to levy manufactured goods to pay interest on the money owing to Great Britain. That is a very fine ideal, but every sound economist knows perfectly well that tlie only way in which the industries of any country can be developed is by a system of trading with other nations. No country in the world can remain absolutely self-contained, and at the same time progress. There would be no objection, so far as I am concerned, to Australia manufacturing all the articles that she requires. But when we find that manufacturers in other countries who are paying -their workmen more than emrise to intense feeling . ployees in the same industries here are paid, can, nevertheless, turn out articles Such a policy is at nearly one-half the cost of production in Australia, 'we are justified in asking our manufacturers to mend their ways, improve their machinery, and give our people something like a fair deal. Honourable members should recollect what we have done for the BrokenH ill Pro-* prietary Company since it started operaI do not like this tions at Newcastle. In September of last year a circular was sent to members of Parliament, showing what the output of the company had been, and assuming that the duty imposed in 1920 had been operative since they Btarted the works, the subsidy or grant given them would have amounted to over £5,000,000. circular also emphasized the wonderf u l character of the establishment and the remarkable value of the ore deposits at Iron Knob, South Australia, pointing out that for the production of steel 1 equal to 2 tons I shall not go further into the details, because I do not wish to raise the Tariff issue to-night. I shall say, however, that in the agricultural machinery industry the average wage paid in Australia is £170 a year, whereas the average wage in the United States of America is £'280 a year. Americans are turning out machinery at about half the p*ice for which we are manufacturing it . What is wrong ? If the American workers hail such advisers as the Australian workers have, who find fault, with a railway station-master because he makes a little garden around his station, they would be in the position in which we find ourselves. If we did not have this "" ca'canny "" process in our industries, the people of Australia would become moire satisfied. That, is what we want. I do not wish to raise the locomotive question specially, but there are some things which the honourable member for Martin( Mr Pratten) would do' well toremember. I will illustrate what I mean. A certain weaver in Scotland was in the habit of obtaining his yarn from linen-spinners in Ireland. He was offered some wonderfully fine linen yarn from Belgium at a lower price than he was paying for inferior yarn from the Irish spinners. He bought the Belgian article. He had to do so, otherwise German or French manufacturers might have got it and marketed a better article than he could produce. He was able to retain his trade. If that had occurred in Australia there would have been a rush to the Government with the request that a high duty should be placed on Belgian yarn. The Irish spinners were very much disappointed because they lost the trade, but they immediately sent a couple of their number across to Belgium to investigate. These men found that the Belgian spinnershad secured from England some' magnificent new machinery which enabled them to produce the superior yarn. The Irish spinners at once purchased similar machines, and it [8] was not long before they regained the trade of the Scottish weaver because Their they, also, were able to produce a better article at a cheaper price than formerly. I can give many more such instances; but, surely, this demonstrates the need of efficiency in Australia. Moreover, this House should demand that Parliaton of Iron Knob ore was ment shall be supreme in dealing with of British ore. duties. Neither a Board nor a Minister of the Crown should be able to. overrule a decision of this Parliament. Parliament, and Parliament alone, should determine the question. The honourable member for Martin referred to the mining industry. Has he realized, from an examination of the statistics, that in 1911 Notwithstanding this, the we had 105,000 miners at work, and in 1921 we had only 66,000, a f a l l of nearly 100 per cent, in ten years. What has caused that? I suppose, in the goldmining industry, it is because the richer pockets have been worked out; but we have rich copper, t in , and other magnificent mineral deposits which are not being exploited to-day simply because of the enormous cost of production. Yet the Minister for Trade and Customs is collecting an enormous and increasing Give us value. Customs revenue week by week, and the cost of living is going up day by day, thus making, life a little hell for most of our poorer people. We can hardly realize how many fine industries are being destroyed by the wretched policy that has been adopted. I hope Parliament will endorse the proposals made by the right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), and that we shall do all that we can to secure Empire defence and much closer Empire communications. I trust that the proposal respecting dried fruits will be agreed to by the British House of Commons, so that,, at least, we may do a little good. I cannot understand why one matter has> been suppressed. For a long time we have known perfectly well that the Canadian Government is prepared to allow us a preference-. It has told tta that it is prepared to give a preference to certain Australian products if we w ill give a preference to certain Canadian products. Why have not the papers and the proposals on this matter been laid upon the table of this House? We should know what concessions the Canadian Government is prepared to give us, and what it asks from' us. The proposals were made over two years ago, and the Government should have stated the facts to this Parwould be for us to be manufacturing maliament.

Australia may well ask what is the position to-day, in view of the silence of honourable members opposite, who prefer to utilize all their strength in the hopeless endeavour to win power for the Labour party rather than do their duty to Australia by providing reasonable measures of defence. The great Labour party has given itself to foreign "" importations "" who are a menace to Australia and its future. During the progress of the war an endeavour was made to have the Henderson Naval Base constructed at enormous expense. With all the power at my command I urged the stoppage of the greater part of the proposed expenditure on naval works in Australia at that time, because I considered that the experience gained in the war would lead to fresh conceptions as to the most useful methods to be adopted. Had those undertakings, which at that time were being feverishly pushed forward, been carried to completion, work costing millions of pounds would have been absolutely useless. We need to be very careful of the manner in which we proceed to-day. The proposal submitted by the Government now is to construct the Singapore Base. The arguments put forward iu. favour of that Base evidently made a very great impression on Mr Stanley Baldwin, and he very nearly secured the assent o.f the British nation to it when he made it a part of his programme. Unfortunately, for the moment, it has been turned down. I am not pessimistic about the matter. I quite appreciate the position of Mr Ramsay Macdonald, particularly in view of the fact that during the war he was one of the world's noted pacifists. The statement which he made in regard to the Singapore Base was not that of a pacifist. According to the published reports, he said there was no purpose in seeking to disarm in order to make the League of Nations a success. I believe with all my heart in the League of Nations, and I consider that nothing will affect its influence to a greater extent than the shocking exhibition of the Australian Labour party in maintaining silence during this debate. It is amazing to realize that such a statement should be greeted with laughter by honourable members opposite, many of whom were associated with a Labour Prime Minister who, at the outbreak of the Great War, pledged Australia to the last man and the last shilling. Tf their present attitude is an indication of the manner in which the Labour party of Australia views defence, all I can say is that they and those who support them are the greatest danger which Australia has to encounter. The decisions of the Washington Conference were, I think, responsible for creating a moral influence that has affected every part of the world. At that great gathering it was not decided that all battleships or weapons of war should be destroyed, but that the principal nations should show the world that they were prepared to disarm at the proper time, and were willing to immediately reduce armaments. Further, it was agreed that many of the existing weapons of war should be dispensed with, and that a limit should be placed upon naval construction for a definite period. In the interests of humanity, and without any intention of being hypocritical, the great nations agreed to the decisions of the Washington Conference, which have been the means of letting the principal nations, especially those engaged in the world war, know that such a conflict would not again be contemplated. Peace is not to be brought about by silence such as that displayed by honourable members opposite. What does the proposed Singapore Base mean to Australia? If honourable members opposite are consistent, they must vote against every item of defence expenditure when the Estimates are under consideration. According to the newspapers, the Minister for Defence( Mr Bowden) received a staggering blow when he learned that the proposal to construct a base at Singapore was likely to be dropped by the present British Government. The Minister-after ; I ' presume, conferring with the Council of Defence, the members of which seemed as optimistic as he was-suggeste d that, in place of a base at Singapore, a dock should be provided at Darwin in which the cruisers it is proposed to construct could be accommodated. In my opinion, the Government would be well advised if they refrained from doing anything of the kind suggested by the Minister, because I am as sure as I am that the sun will rise to-morrow that a base at Singapore will eventually be authorized by a British Government. I would not be surprised if the present British Government reversed its decision. It is quite possible that members of the Australian Labour party despatched communications, not to the British Prime Minister, but to other members of the British Labour party, particularly those who constitute the most unruly section, in order to start opposition to the proposal. They probably informed some members of the British Labour party that members of the Australian Labour party were opposed in any circumstances to the construction of a base. When one thinks of the immortal fame won by Australian soldiers, whose bravery thrilled the whole world, it is difficult to ence has gradually increased until it now conceive how such a decision would be received by the British people. What would be Australia's position if a base were not constructed at Singapore and provision were made at Port Darwin for the docking of battle-cruisers? Australia be in a position to keep an enemy at bay? The general opinion of naval experts is that, notwithstanding the possibilities of aerial and submarine defence, capital ships, as was proved during the war, are still paramount, and are always likely to be a dominant force. At the Washington Conference it was decided that the three great naval Powers should have capital ships in a 5:5:3 ratio. Buti f there was a possibility of Australia being invaded, and we had an efficient air force, a fleet of submarines, and naval docks at Port Darwin, capital ships such as the Hood and the Repulse would nob have a. base from which they could operate in the Pacific. These magnificent war-ships, which are intended, not as instruments of aggression, but of defence, stand with the Union Jack, as the greatest power on earth to bring .about universal peace and progress. If any mishap involving dock repairs, sliould befall one of these ships in the antipodes, to-day, it would be necessary for it to return to England. I hope that every man and woman in Australia will take the defence question to heart. Must all the treasure tliat the late war cost us go for nought? Have the lives of the very cream of the nation been sacrificed to no good purpose? In memory of the men who have fallen let us make effective provision for the defence of the Empire, until all nations have accepted universal peace. able member remain in Adelaide this week ? bigger things than the election in South Australia. about the result of the Prime Minister's visit to Great Britain, and the reply given to his request for preference for Australian products. Other Prime Ministers have made similar requests, and they have been refused; but the demand will be continued until success has been achieved. The Prime Minisber has asked for nothing bhab would increase bhe cost of living to the working man in the Old Country. The demand for prefercovers the whole gamut of Empire trade. Acceptance of bhe preference proposals of bhe Prime Minisber would result in bhe utmost benefit to the working people of Great Britain, who until recently have Would enjoyed anything but prosperous conditions. While these proposals would not immediately reduce the cost of living at Home, they would be the means of placing on the British market goods of a better quality than have been obtainable heretofore; and in the not far distant future cheaper goods than the people are enjoying to-day would be supplied. Australia is asking for treatment such as..it is already giving to Great Britain. We are now according the Old Country preference to the tune of from £68.000,000 to £75,000,000 worth of trade, per annum, in manufactured goods. This is no trivial preference, such as is suggested in regard to dried fruits and certain other perishable Australian products. We have obtained preference from Great Britain to the extent of only about £8,500,000 worbh of trade. We are Great Britain's best customers, and we are simply asking the people of the Old Land to reciprocate more freely than they have done in the past. If the workers of the United Kingdom and of every section of the Empire realized the true position they would readily agree to the preference sought by Australia, because it would be largely for their own benefit. Whether our request is complied with immediately or not, we should persevere until we get our surplus products into Great Britain. We inbend bo do so. Effective work on our parb is necessary. The Prime Minisber and Senabor Wilson did good service in bhis direction on the other side of the world.

Empire trade is all important to us, in face of the developments of the last few years, and it therefore behoves us to organize efficiently. In our primary industries, and iu our manufactures, we must be as up to date as human genius can make us. Let me give an illustration of the importance of careful work in commending Australian products to the markets of the United Kingdom. Shortly before last Christmas, Messrs. Crawford and Company, a large distributing firm in Adelaide, conceived the happiest idea I have ever heard of, for the purpose of advertising Australian goods. assorted Australian fruits. a magnificent show in their windows in King William-street. I had been thinking and dreaming of this sort of thing for many years, and I was never so surprised in my life as at this exhibition. The appearance was magnificent. Everything possible was done to catch the eye. The firm advertised that South Australians who had friends in the Old World, and who wanted to send them Christmas gifts, could purchase for 36s. or 38s. a package which would be delivered right to the home of the individual to whom it was consigned. Shortly after Christmas the two daily papers in Adelaide published several columns of letters from the recipients of the 500 cases. Those letters were enough to make the people of the River Murray and other fruit-growing districts dance with joy. equal to the contents of the packages had previously been seen in the Old Country. They had been accustomed to Californian products, but for attractive appearance and quality they considered that the Australian article was admirable. Most of them had not seen the Australian article before, and they wanted ""to know why it was not sent to Great Britain in large quantities. What Messrs. CrawBig transactions of this ford and Company did with 500 packages, Australia ought to be doing with 500 tons at a time. There is no reason why the 500 tons should not be just as good in quality and just as attractive in appearance as the 500 packages. If we work on those lines we shall capture the British market. The Gregory) has said something about Canada. I would like to say something, too, but it has been put to me that the Canadian proposals for a reciprocal treaty are with the Government, and that the less we say about them at present the better. However good the Canadian proposals may be, I would a thousand times rather get a footing in the British than in the Canadian market. Although the Canadian market would be satisfactory, we can get into the British market on better terms. This is not a question of fruit only. Along the River Murray, in South Australia, and in the other States as well, soldier settlements have They put up 500 packages of been promoted under what, if markets They had are provided, will prove to be the best possible conditions. The South Australian Government has spent £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 on these projects, and this year, a large number of the soldier settlers have their vines coming into bearing for the first time. It has been a wonderful season, and they have a splendid show of grapes. Unless some outlet is found for this produce the soldier settlers, who worked like Trojans during the war, and have worked night and day on their settlements since, will lose the results of their labours, and that just at a time when they thought they were reaching a state of independence. If a market was available their position would be quite different. They were advised to put in the doradilla grape for wine purposes, but the biggest distilleries now have their premises filled to the rcof with last year's Many of them said that nothing product. If they could profitably handle the present crop they would find room for it somewhere, but it is a question of price. Notwithstanding 'the enormous stocks held over -from previous seasons, they would employ capital to purchase the present crop and hold it , even though it had to be kept for two or three years, if they could be assured of a market. The obstacle is that tons of",50,Bruce

The local distilleries cannot compete with this inferior article, and have asked the Government to reduce the amount of Excise duty by 5s. if the Government will do this they will give a certain price for the doradilla and other grapes, so as to give the soldier settlers a good return, instead of starving them off their blocks. put to members of this House, and particularly to the country, a statement of the amount of revenue derived from this industry. Possibly even some members of this House do not know the amount of revenue derived from distilleries, and will be surprised to hear that for every ton of grapes that goes through a distillery the Government receives £128., I ask the Government to decide this question rapidly, and not to allow the soldiers to be driven off their blocks. It is a question relating not only to fresh and dried fruits, but also to many other products. We may as well call a halt to development at once if we cannot find markets for our products. What is the use of putting men on the land, buoying them up with hopes, and imbuing them with courage, if , when their first harvest comes, their hopes are dashed to the ground ? Even in the meat industry men who, a few years ago, were styled "" beef barons "" have had a deplorable time, and are now almost beef paupers. a far more difficult business than the marketing of fruit, because we have to meet in the United Kingdom competition from the Argentine, which can be broken down only by perfect organization in Australia and agencies in the United Kingdom to put Australian beef right at the door of the British When we consider the powerful combination of the distributing agencies of Great Britain, and the fact that they comprise men who own the greater part of the capital used to develop the Argentine, we can. form some opinion of the difficulties which confront Australia. mated that not less than £300,000,000 of British capital is involved directly and indirectly in the attempt to place the products of the Argentine upon the markets of the United Kingdom. of those capitalists have interests also in the American Beef Trust, which Mr Foster. is reciprocally interested in the development of the Argentine, and the ramifications of these forces are such that perfect organization, and combination, and quality equal to the best from America, are essential if we are to place our proThey have promised that ducts on the English working man's table -at half the present-day price. great friend of the Trusts. of the Trusts referred to, or of the Trusts and Oombines iu Australia, of which the honourable member is a representative. With the industrial chaos obtaining to-day, the strikes and rumours of strikes, and resolutions such as were passed at a recent Sunday meeting of the railway men, at which one of the speakers let the cat out of the bag and said, "" If we allow this efficiency to come, 25 per cent, pf us will not be wanted,"" where are we heading? In that remark we have the whole thing in a nutshell. It is tliat spirit which is crippling every industry in this country, and is putting the biggest embargo on the sale of our products to the people of the Old Country. No one will suffer more than the working men of Australia, who are misled by their leaders, if this kind of thing continues. I am confident, however, that we shall get our products to the people of the United Kingdom; and when we have once obtained a footing, we shall be able to go on expandThis is ing settlement and increasing production indefinitely without ever overtaking the demand.

135,Mr Hurry (Bendigo) [9.25],"(Senator Wilson) did not come back with all that we hoped for, they sowed good seed, from which we hope to reap a rich harvest in the future. I cannot see how there can be any difference of opinion regarding the resohitions place.I before the House by the Prime Minister. The right honorable gentleman invites us to say that we agree with what he has done in regard to foreign relations, negotiation, signature roughly support. I am riot a naval and ratification of treaties, Imperial preman, but I have had the honour of ference, and Defence. To no action of the Prime Minister in respect to any of these subjects can we take the slightest exthe world, and I can realize what the ception. I favour, also, the establishment of an Imperial Economic Committee, and I feel sure that, deep down in his heart, every member of this House is of the same opinion. The amendment of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) was submitted with such force and plenitude of words, that we were all greatly impressed. If the Opposition had let the motion go without comment, it would have been more effective, but they thought fit to propose this amendment, which was placed before us so forcefully, aud accompanied by such apt illustrations, that we can all make up our minds to vote agaiust it. Although honourable members of the Opposition have not expressed their opinions with regard to the proceedings of the Conferences, we have gathered something from their interjections. They commenced on the first day with the parrot-cry "" Bendigo."" That, I , as the representative of that constituency, took as a personal compliment: but I would like to know exactly what was meant. Then we heard the word ""Empire."" What did honourable members mean by that? Later, they evolved a phrase of two words, ""Pardon me!"" Evidently, they realized that they needed pardon. The honourable member for Ballarat( Mr to the duties of parties on great McGrath), in a speech made in his electorate since this motion was submitted, attempted to explain what the Opposition really meant. He said that he had no quarrel with the nations of the world, and tliat personally he would not spend one penny on defence, because Australia had no foe to fear. He stated, also, that the Labour party would show the sincerity of its desire for peace by proving to the world that it was prepared to trust the other nations. But the Labour party, which says it is prepared to trust the other nations of the world will not even trust this side of the House. The Singapore Base was also mentioned by the honourable member' for Ballarat. The protest raised against the abandonment of the construction of that base is one which we, concerned with the interests of Australia, thofighting the battles of Australia and of the British Empire on the other side of importance of such a base may be. I can imagine that a naval base is of even more importance than a military base, and I know that from a company or battalion point of view when men have. been fighting for two or three days they long very much to get back to a base at which to refit and have a re3t. The need for a base in connection with naval ojjerations must be even more urgent, and unless we have some base at which our ships can be refitted we might as well have no ships of war at all. We have been very much disappointed at the silence of the Labour party on all these important questions, and the members of that party will have only themselves to blame for any inferences disadvantageous to them which may be drawn from it. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [9.32] I do not think that any Parliament has ever witnessed such an extraordinary exhibition as has taken place in this Federal Parliament during the last few day3. Throughout the history of British institutions, and particularly of British Parliaments, a very high standard has prevailed with respect national questions. I do not think that in any Parliament in any part of the British Dominions there has previously heen a precedent for what is called "" His Majesty's Opposition"" sitting down and saying not one word upon questions affecting the whole future prosperity and even the safety of the country in which they live. It is almost impossible to conceive how such a state of things could have come about in this Parliament, which has always prided",52,Bruce
136,Mr Bruce (Elinders,"Prime Minisitself as a model of parliamentary government. The. thought which must occur to any one who considers the action of the Opposition is that it has been designed solely to secure a party advantage. The Opposition, and their Leader in particular, are afraid to permit honourable members of their party to express their opinions, because they know what the effect would be amongst their supporters outside this House. which has been taken by the Opposition has been dictated by what might be described as party tactics, presumably the basis of it is that the head of the Government having gone overseas to attend two important Conferences, and having returned, it is the duty of honourable members opposite, from a tactical point of view, to belittle his mission, irrespecLeader of the Opposition to say whether tive of what the effect upon the interests of the country may be. If that be the reason for the action of the Oppositiou, we are reaching a very tragic state of affaira Of what concern is it what may happen to the head of the Government, to any one individual, or even the interests of a party, as against the interests of the country? Nobody cares what happens to the Leader of the Government or any one else provided the best interests of the country are served. questions it seemed possible to secure what honourable members opposite imagined would be a triumph of party tactics, they have not hesitated to adopt this course, and let the interests of the country take their chance. can be found to adequately press the contempt with which such action must fill the minds of the whole of the people of Australia. Party tactics carried to such an extreme are indeed a tragedy. to the conclusion that by their silence the Opposition have attempted-and , incidentally, the attempt .has been a lamenthonorable members opposite have reable failure-to score a party advantage, even at the expense of the interests of the country as a whole. Another reason for the silence of but they have submitted an amendment. the Opposition on these fundamental The amendment, if it has any basis questions is that the Leader of the party at all, suggests that the party opposite was afraid to allow his followers desire to follow a policy respecting foreign to talk, because he knew that if they did relationsthat will tend towards the prothey would speak with different voices Mr Bruce. and would inevitably antagonize a great number of their followers outside. Honourable members opposite have presented a great example of party discipline. I understand that, when a vote was taken on the attitude which should be assumed by the Opposition, what they should do. was determined by a very narrow majority, but every honourable member opposite has remained dumb in this Chamber. FromI f the action the point .of view of the Leader of the Opposition there has been a tragic and lamentable exception in the person of his rather wild and rebellious follower from peared on a platform outside, and, although he is a member of a party with a very rigid discipline, has informed the people that for his part he would have no defence expenditure at all. I ask the that is the policy of his party. He has told us nothing on the subject in this House, but that is what has been said by the only honourable member of his party who has voiced any opinion on the subject. What we have to bear in mind is not what these gentlemen might have said, but the fact that, by some appalling turn of the political wheel, honourable members opposite may get into power and this country be ruled by a party whose members have not even the courage to get Yet upon these up and tell the people what they stand that are vital, because for. We must all be filled with the very deepest regret that a great party, such as the Labour party once was, has sunk so low to-day that its members have not the courage to do the duty which the people of Australia sent them No words into this House to perform. Without exlabouring the matter further, I would warn honourable members opposite that the country will not be satisfied with silence. The people will demand a statement as to what they really mean, and We are regretfully forced where they stand on the vital questions that have been under consideration on the motion now before the House. Whilst frained from speaking on the motion, they have taken a course the ineptitude of which almost makes one shudder. They have said nothing on the motion,",53,Bruce
137,"Ballarat ( Mr Mcgrath), Who Has Ap","motion of a world peace. I entirely agree with such an objective, but if they seriously take that view, what is their objection to confirming the action taken by the recent Imperial Conference? This is what I said last week when dealing with questions of foreign policy:As a result of our discussion, we were all agreed upon, tbe basic principle which should govern the Empire's foreign policy. That basic principle was the promotion and maintenance of the peace of the world. So far the Opposition are apparently in agreement with the Imperial Conference. When dealing with the methods to be adopted to bring about the world's peace I said: Tlie method by which the Conference believed Labour party's action. When I spoke this could best be accomplished was to maintain a united British Empire,.and the closest possible relations between, the great English speaking nations of the world and to give the greatest possible support to the League of Napolicy of the Empire, and I pointed tions, thus insuring its power and prestige in the world. Do honourable members opposite dissent from the view that one of the be3t methods of promoting the world's peace is lo insure the maintenance and integrity of the British Empire? If not. why have they not the courage to say so ? Not a sound is heard. May I ask if they dissent from the view that the peace of the world can be best promoted by the maintenance of the closest possible relations between the great English-speaking nations of the world'' imagine that they also would subscribe to that view. The third method was that we should give our full support to the League of Nations,' and try to promote its power and prestige in the world. Honourable members opposite apparently dissent from that proposition, because they have taken the amazing action of proposing an amendment which if carried, would strike out of the motion the resolutions and recommendations of the Imperial Conference,, and substitute words to the effect that this. House subscribes to the foreign policy of the British Government, a policy which has not yet 'been enunciated, and of which not even a suggestion has been made. Could charity reach a higher point ? these honourable members will not do, however unfortunate it may be for their country, provided that in the doing of it [9] they give support to a Government in another country which bears the same name as their own party? Because the word "" Labour"" is introduced, they say, ""Let us fling this country .aside, fling everything, including the resolutions of the representatives of all parts of the Empire, aside. Let us ignore the fact that these resolutions say exactly what we are saying in our amendment. Let us substitute something that will support the Labour Government in Britain."" If that is the reason that has actuated this step, then it is a very tragic one, and one for which the people of Australia will in due season call them to account. There is another point that we in Australia have to consider very closely concerning the last week I invited honourable members to say whether they desired that this Parliament should have a voice in theforeign out that so far as the Government was concerned, we were not prepared to be bound, hand and foot, to any Government in Britain, no matter from what party it might be drawn. Honourable members of the Opposition, however, have nothing to say on that subject. They have given no indication of where they stand. They have moved an amendment which really means that, as representatives of the people of Australia in this Parliament, they do not want to be consulted ; they leave themselves in the hands I should of their friends in Britain, who they say can do what they like. They do not worry or care. If that is the attitude that members of this Legislature are going to take up-that so far as Australia is concerned they are prepared to accept the dictates and endorse the actions of any British statesman-the n I warn them that their days in this Parliament are numbered. They will never again, be returned by the people of this country. We, in Australia, have achieved a position, for which we have long been striving. We have now the right and status of a self-governing Dominion, with a voice that is entitled.to be heard in regard to the Empire's, affairs, and I , for one, will not subscribe to this new and amazing Labour doctrine that if a Labour Government is in power in Britain we must blindly follow it, irreIs there any thing spective of whether we approve or disapprove of what it proposes. I ask honourable gentlemen opposite to remember that they have placed themselves iu au unfortunate position. They had every opportunity to tell the country where they stand, but for some reason they have not had the courage to do so. We are entitled, therefore, to enlighten the people as to some of their actions, for which the constituencies will require an adequate explanation. It is almost a waste of time to analyze the amendment. One has only to read it to realize that it is neither more nor less than an attempt to support the action of the British Labour Government. It sets aside everything that the Imperial Conference accomplished respecting foreign relations, and discards the whole of the resolutions that were passed advocating the world's peace and outlining a method by which it might be achieved. It casts aside the whole arrangements that for the first time defined a definite course them is a side issue-and all the resoluconcerning the negotiation, signature, and ratification of treaties. The Labour Party abandon all these things and say, "" We want to know nothing of foreign policy; we will do whatever the British Government tell us to do; we wish to know nothing about defence, and we do not subscribe to anything accomplished at the Conference. Let everything in the motion be struck out, and let us put Australia in the hands of a Labour Government that is ruling in Britain."" T shall certainly vote against the amendment. am sure that if I were a Labour supporter, enthusiastic in the desire to have my party returned to power, I should find myself in' a position of the most tragic embarrassment with regard to defence. When I discovered that my leader, the distinguished gentleman from Hunter, and the other distinguished gentlemen behind him, had nothing at all to say as to how our safety and security are to be accomplished, I , as an enthusiastic supporter of Labour, would feel very apprehensive and very nervous. I should want to know what they proposed to do. They have repudiated every suggestion made at the Imperial Conference, and put nothing in«their nlace. under the protection of Great Britain. Labour man my anxiety would be considerably heightened when I found the distinguished gentleman from Ballarat( Mr and most ample language, that the great McGrath) ""going over the top,"" and saying that we were to have no defeuce at all. As to the Opposition's defence policy, we have only the delightfully frank statement made outside by the honourable member for Ballarat. There has been nothing said by the. Labour party during this debate to indicate what is their policy on defence. They have cast aside the policy of defence whereby the whole of the Empire would co-operate unitedly, and they have repudiated the method by which that co-operation was to be brought about. They have cast aside the suggestion of a one-power naval standard for the British Empire. They have repudiated any suggestion that we should have bases or fuel depots scattered over the world to secure the mobility of the British Fleet. They have thrown aside the Singapore Base-that to tions of the Conference dealing with the vital necessity of providing for the security of our trade routes. They have nothing to say in regard to the recommendation of the Imperial Conference that it is essential to the whole of the Empire that the safety of the Suez Canal-that vital artery through which our trade flows from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea-mus t be preserved. All these things they have cast aside by their amendment, and in I their place they have put nothing. to the fact that the Prime Minister is guilty of tedious repetition. I have listened very attentively to the Prime Minister, and I think his remarks are neither repetitive nor tedious. for Ballarat appears to have been so adequately dealt with hy a higher authority that I can afford to ignore his interposition. There is something humorous in the ' attitude of honourable members opposite. We have heard a great deal of talk about the "" passionate desire for peace.""

They have even gone as far as to communicate that interesting piece of information-o n what authority I do not know-to Great Britain, and in the discussion upon the abandonment of the Singapore proposal which has recently taken place in the British House of Commons the Government of Great Britain found great support for their attitude in the fact that Mr Charlton, the Leader of the Opposition in Australia, had said that Australia did not want the Singapore Base. those who hold strong opinions, and although I may totally disagree with the reasoning of those who think that the abandonment of the Singapore proposal will promote the world's peace, they can flatter themselves that their attitude has had a very material effect in bringing about the abandonment of that work. But there are other great questions being considered in Great Britain to-day, and one of them is whether certain preferences in which' Australia is vitally interested are to be passed or rejected by the House of Commons. The matter is hanging in the balance. these preferences involves an increase in the duty. It merely means giving an increased preference to the Dominions under an existing duty, and it is vital to Australia that these increases sliould be made. The success of the River Murray scheme, upon which millions of pounds have been spent, depends upon them, and these preferences would certainly have been given if every honourable member opposite had got up in this debate and declared, "" We stand fast on the matter of preferences."" But honourable members opposite have not had a word to say on this matter.

We are a great people, and this is a great Parliament, but the British people who are very' interested in us do not follow our movements with an intense regard as to how our votes are cast in this Chamber. What counts with them is what the people here have to say, and what the representatives of the I have the greatest respect for people are saying. We should show them that the whole of the people of Australia are united on the subject of preferences; yet honourable members opposite have done nothing, and if the British House of Commons grants what Australia wants, it will be in spite of their action and not because of it. On the other hand, if the preferences are lost, it will be because of their lack of interest and sympathy at the critical moment. That is all I wish to say. I deeply regret that during the last few days we sliould have seen a great party so betray the trust of the people as to allow questions of paraNot one ofmount importance to Australia, involving great issues concerning us and our national life and safety, as well as the security of our territory, to be decided -while they remained silent, either to secure a tactical political advantage or because they were afraid to let any one of the party speak.

159,"Mr Charlton (Hunter) [10.26],","at by the Conferences. To my surprise, the right honourable gentleman combined the business of the two Conferences in the one motion. -The honourable member is forgetting for the moment that, even on a motion for the adjournment of the House, it is not in order to refer to a debate which has just closed. I regret that I cannot allow him to discuss that matter. that although -we on this side were absolutely opposed to the second paragraph of the motion, we.would have voted for the third, covering the question of preference, had it beeu submitted as a separate motion. I understand that the Prime Minister( Mr Bruoe) prior to leaving for Great Britain said he would endeavour to have altered the terms of the agreement drawn up between Australia and Great Britain in relation to the £92,000,000 owing by Australia to Great Britain, and the excessive interest that was charged. ""Will he now report to the House what action he took in the matter? ter and Minister for External Affairs) [10.29] -The question of the debt of £92,000,000, which was funded in 1921, was considered at very great length by Senator Wilson and myself when we were in Great Britain. I propose to make a full statement to the House on the matter when a financial question is under consideration. It would take too long to explain the negotiations at the present stage. gentleman sot deal with the matter in his report ? fine myself to the major issues which could not conveniently be dealt with at a later stage. The financial arrangement can conveniently be brought up later, and I shall give the House a full account of the action which I took whilst in Great Britain. Question resolved in the affirmative.
