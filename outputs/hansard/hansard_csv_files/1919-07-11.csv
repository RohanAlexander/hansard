I notice that during iny recent absence in Sydney the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) made some very grave reflections on Captain Glossop, and to be charitable theo n l y conclusion I can come to is that he was speaking without f u l l knowledge of the facts The honourable member criticised adversely Captain Glossop's handling of H . M . A . S . Sydneyi n the duel with the German light cruiser Emden. In the first place, I would point out that the loss of life on the Sydney was small. Out of a complement of 400, three men were killed wounded. The best Naval opinion is that the action against the Emden was ably and skilfully fought. The officer most exposed to the enemy's fire was Captain Glossop himself, as shown by the fact that the first casualty occurred beside him on the bridge. The Admiralty's' appreciation of his work was shown by the conferring on h i m of the Most Honourable Order of the Companion of the Bath. I trust that no more of these unwarranted attacks will be made upon a distinguished officer, who by his prompt and efficient action made the name of Australia ring throughout the civilized world by ridding the Empire of a raider which had done millions of pounds worth of damage. Isi t proposed that we the subject at the first opportunity. There should not have been any casualties on the Sydney. It will while the honourable member was speaking the honourable member for Wilmot ( Mr. Atkinson), by way of interjection, said that Captain Glossop had been disrated. In this instance also I feel sure that the In the pressure of busihonorable member spoke without f u l l knowledge of the facts; otherwise he would not have made such a statement. Captain Glossop has not been disrated on any occasion in connection w i th this matter. sonal explanation, I desire to say that in -using the word "" disrated,"" I was under the impression from statements that had been frequently made that Captain Glossop had been disrated, or had, at least, teen deprived of the command of the Sydney, because, in the engagement in question, he took his vessel too close ta the Emden. I was led to interject as I did, because I thought that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr. Mathews) in his references to Captain Glossop,was not treating the Government fairly. He appeared to me to be endeavouring to show that the Government had promoted Captain Glossop to a higher position, and that his treatment was different fro m that extended to men in the ranks. I am very glad to learn that Captain Glossop was not disrated. and fifteen make a personal explanation. The Acting Ministerf o r the Navy( Mr Poynton) has not explained the actual situation. On the occasion to which he has referred, I was trying to distinguish between the punishment meted out to the lower-paid men of the Australian Navy, and the treatment of those of the highly-paid ranks. The authorities whicli the Minister has quoted are not the only ones that might be cited with regard to Captain Glossop's handling of the Sydneyi n the encounter in question. It is well known that the Sydney, w it h its 'guns of longer range and greater calibre than those, of the Emden, should have been able to engage her without coming within her range of fire -",22,Peace Celebrations Sittings Of The House

Johnson) Order! member must withdraw that statement. the word ""untrue,"" Mr Speaker, and substitute "" annoying "" for it. The remarks made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh induced me yesterday to use language which was quite unparliamentary, and, at your request, I withdrew it. The honourable member yesterday, referring to my political life, said that I had never voted Labour until I had voted for myself. The statement, in a somewhat similar form, was ' made previously by tbe Acting Attorney-General( Mr Groom), 10655 and by the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser), but I took little notice of it because it came from my political opponents, and manifestly it was made for political purposes. I do object, however, when an honourable member who deserted his own party in its time of trouble and trial accuses me of being false politically; and I think I have a right to inform the House and my constituents, who obviously were meant to be impressed by the statement, of the facts concerning my political career. I entered this House in 1910 at the very urgent request of two parMr Hinchcliffe, M.L.C, of Queensland, and David Bowman, ex-Leader of the Labour party in that State. I have often told them since that the only grudge I have against them was that they inI think so. May I add, duced me to leave a comfortable position in private life for tlie political arena. time, and particularly during the 1906 Federal election, I took a very active part Culpin, and at a'bout the same time. I was urgently requested to submit myself as a Labour candidate for Warwick in the State Parliament; but I declined the invitation. Prior to that, and during the 1904 Federal election, I actively supported the candidature of Dr. Culpin against the two opposing Liberal candidates. Prior to that again, and while in Maryborough, as the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) is well aware, I identified myself with the The honourable Labour candidate, . Mr Norman, amd ford, in opposition to the Liberal tholomew. From the time of my arrival in Australia in 1887, I have always taken an active part in temperance work, and' whilst occupying an official position in that movement, I kept myself free from membership iu any political party, because I believe that the temperance question should not be the plaything of party politics.

The sending of officers to Western Australia appears to be an automatic, operation of the Commonwealth Public Service machine. But if I were a resident of the West, and saw a d r if t of officers from the eastern States to the disadvantage of Western men, whether returned soldiers or not, I should be inclined to voice the indignation of the Western State. Of course, the theory is generally held that the Commonwealth Servioe is one body throughout Australia, and many transfers to Defence Department positions and others have teen made that are of a thoroughly reciprocal nature. That is the only way in which promotion can be gained in certain branches of the Service. However, if the honourable member for Swan will be content with this answer for to-day, I shall inquire into the matter and furnishh i m , as earlv as possible next week, with a more definite reply. If he is not then satisfied, he will be able to take further action. Question resolved in the negative. PEAC E CONFERENCE AN D Minister, upon notice1.

The return of the greatcoat was considered necessary in order to maintain adequate supplies for A.I.F. requirements, including re-issues to troops overseas. The cessation of hostilities, and the rapidity with which our troops are returning has, however, enabled a stock to be accumulated in Australia, and it is no longer necessary to insist on the return of the articles in question; consequently, instructions have heen given that all returning members of the A.I.F. may retain, without payment, the greatcoats on issue to them. It is the intention that men already demobilized shall be re-issued with greatcoats in cases in which coats have been withdrawn on discharge. Action in this direction will be taken as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made to deal with applications. sistant Ministerf o r Defence, upon notice1.

This payment was reviewed in 1917; and, in view of the fact that the work had somewhat eased down, the payment of extra duty pay was superseded by the granting of a Saily allowance of 9d. to a l l Warrant and Noncommissioned Officers of the Instructional Staff, and was likewise extended to members of the Survey Corps and Provost Staff. It was never intended that any member of the Permanent Forces should be adversely affected, but that they should be placed on at least an equal footing 'to mobilized members of the A.G.A.

W ill he arrange for the members of the final Medical Board to, simultaneously w i th examination of the individual soldier, review the previous -medical history of each soldier ? M i -. WISE orable member's questions are as f o l low :1. The present system of medically examining members of the Australian Imperial Force on disembarkation is not cursory, and is considered more satisfactory than any alternative method. Men arriving from overseas are anxious to have their cases dealt with by a Medical Board as soon as possible, and this is achieved aftor scrutiny by a Board of experienced Medical Officers. Delay is not only unpopular with the men, but allows injuries and illnesses to become aggravated in the interval, while useless expense to the Commonwealth is caused. 2. Only a very few complaints areknown to this Department, and of these several were unjustifiable. 3. The previous medical history, if available, is invariably considered at the .time of examination. The instructions issued to thc Commandant, Australian Imperial Force, The increase in fares and freights Headquarters, London, provide that a ll medical history papers shall be placed on the same transport as the men embark on. A f u l l medical examination is also made of the -men while on the transports, and this is in the hands of the Examining Board. Any dissatisfied man can have his claim to 1.

"" Sixteen, not sixty, graduates from the Royal Military College, Duntroon, left Australia on 25th January, 1919, by the Marathon. 2. No information is available on this matter. 3.

When workers returning from service abroad exempt the Prinie Minister returns he w ill be' from taxation? orable member's question is:For Income Tax -'Returned soldiers are exempt from taxation in respect of all personal exertion income derived by them from sources within Australia from the date of their enlistment for service abroad until the date of their discharge from the Forces, or the termination of appointment in thc case of officers. From the latter date they become liable to taxation from personal exertion inoome like ordinary citizens. Soldiers' on active service have always been liable! to pay tax on any income from property derived from sources within Australia provided it amounted to £100 in the case of a single person without dependants, or to more than £156 in the case of persons with dependants. Munition workers have never been exempt from taxation on any part of their Australian income, because they were not on active service outside Australia with the'Naval or Military Forces of the Commonwealth, or any part of the King's Dominions, or of an Ally of G-reat Britain, as provided by section 13 of the Act. War-time Profits Tax -Returned soldiers who own businesses, or are partners in a firm, or shareholders in a company consisting of not more than twenty shareholders, are exempt' from this tax if they were in the danger zone while the assessable profits were being earned or when the tax thereon was assessed. Munition workers are liable as ordinary citizens of Australia who are temporarily absent from Australia for any reason. Land Tax -There is no exemption from this tax to either returned soldiers or munition workers who own land having an aggregate unimproved value of over £5,000. Prime Minister, upon notice1.

No. During March, A p r i l, and May, nine vessels were allotted to Victoria, and loaded 9,343 tons of meat. During the same period two vessels were allotted to New South Wales, and loaded 2,101 tons of meat. As far as can be ascertained, no shipments were made from either State during June. The provision of refrigerated space to meet requirements for the forthcoming season has had the attention of the Government, and urgent representations have heen made, through the Prime Minister, with a view to obtaining a further allotment of refrigerated space for Australian requirements, special attention being drawn to 'the position in the Southern States. 2.

The Acting Attorney-General( Mr Groom), in dealing w it h the dairy produce regulations, said, in reference to the dairy seasonThis season will terminate on the 31st August,' 1920, and the Bill provides for the extension of the regulations up to that date. If honourable members w i ll look at the regulationsdealing with dairy produce set out in the schedule they will find that they cover six or seven pages of the measure, though there is only one line dealing with the subject in tlie B ill itself. There are some amendments that I desire to move in the Dairy Produce Regulations when we reach the Committee stage. In reference to the Dairy Produce Control Committee, the Acting Attorney-General( Mr Groom), when introducing the B ill , saidI t was decided, therefore, to form a Pool to provide against this expected shortage. Committees chosen hy the dairying and commercial interests concerned were set up in the various States, with a central committee,, of which the Chief Prices Commissioner in Melbourne was the chairman. A conference was held in Melbourne, and another, later on, in Sydney, at which certain recommendations w«re made, add approved by the Government. The honourable gentleman then referred to the amount of butter dealt with, and went on to sayThe Committee consisted of the Ministerwho is chairmana deputy chairman appointed by the Minister, three nominees of the Commonwealth Government, the Commonwealth Dairy Expert, two representatives for each] of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland in respect of the butter factories in those States, one representative for each of the States of South Australia and Tasmania in respect of the butter factories in those States, and one representative for each of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland in respect of the cheese factories, in those States. The representatives of the producers in the various States were elected' by ballot held on 14th October, 1918. Immediately upon the ballot being taken the Comlmittee formerly inexistence voluntarily retired! and handed over to the newly-elected body It will be observed t h a t the CommonwealthDairy Expert is. to have no vote; If we have the power that is, the only employee of the Commonwealth ' Governmentwho is on the Committee is not allowed to vote^ although the employees of the State Governments are. As I pointed out the other evening, there are fifteen persons on this Committee, and, although the producers, the manufacturers' agents, and others are represented, there is no representative of the consumers. If I , when Minister of Customs, had appointed a committee consisting of fifteen consumers only, without any representation for producers or agents, what would bave been said? 1 trust that, in Committee, honourable members w ill see the advisability of providing for a t least some representation of the consumers, who are certainly as important and as much entitled to it as. are producers, and agents. The Acting Attorney-General w ill , I hope, agree that on all committees of the kind, not only employers, buyers amd sellers-the latter of whom produce nothing, being merely agents or brokers-bu t also consumers, shall be represented. Speaking of brokers, I remember ex-Senator Trenwith, at the time of the Kyabram movement, some yeara ago, saying that it was worked by "" sharebrokers, pawnbrokers, and stony-brokers ' ' ; and I certainly think the consumers will be the "" stony-brokers ' ' if they are not allowed to have some say in the fixing of prices. We require information in regard to some of the regulations, which are certainly the most important part of the B ill -indeed , one regulation is more important than the whole of the fourteen .clauses. No. 5 of the Dairy Produce Regulations is as follows: Members of the Committee;, other than the Minister, may be paid, from moneys, held by the Committee, such, sums' asremunerationor expenses as the Minister may from time to time authorize; The Government, of course, are a l l powerful,, and may appoint whom they like, and pay the-members of the Committee as they choose; and it is in regard to this, that information is necessary.

341,Mr Ttjdor,"Most people would saythe War Precautions Act and of the regulations framed under it , it is significant that the Government are anxious to abandon their power to . control prices. They have accordingly (handed this power over to the States, saying, "" We must iio longer deal iwitlh this matter."" Yet, according to the opinion which I have quoted, they 'possess the power to deal with it . eternally, so long as we pass the B ill before the "" exchange of ratificationis."" It is interesting to look back upon the .history of this sugar business. four or five weeks of the outbreak of war, the party which I have the honour to lead was returned by the electors of this country w i th a majority. W it h in a period of twenty-four hours after the Labour Ministry was sworn in , it prohibited the export of sugar, which had reached a very high price overseas. We thus saved the local con«umer many thousands of pounds. If we possess the power to fix the price of sugar u n t i l the 30th 'September, 1920, I unhesitatingly say that we possess the power to fix the price of any other commodity. To-day we are not sending a pound of sugar outside of Australia. The position which it occupies is quite! different from .that of wool or butter, which we are exporting. But why does not the B ill extend to shipping? When the War Precautions Act was before this Parliament, and many of us protested against its extension, we were assured fchat if shipping were re0 leased tlie ship-owners would immediately increase freights and fares. Acting Prime Minister( MrW a t t ) , stated that if shipping were released, and if we did not allow the ship-owners to increase freights and fares, they would withdraw their vessels from Australian waters. But I contend that if the Government can' control sugar they can also control shipping. We were' told not long ago that ship-owners would be able to sell tiheir ships for double the price at whioh they stood in their books at that time. During the first twelve months of the war \ustrailiian ship^ownjeirs were 'anxious to sell their vessels outside of the Commonwealth. [398] Henty( Mr Boyd) knows that perfectly well. A number of those ships were somewhat out of date, but nobody then imagined that the war would be such a protracted one. The ship-owners at that time were under the impression that -they would be able to replace their vessels w i th new and up-to-date ships at a less price than (fchJey would get for their own out-of-date vessels. In all probability, had they been as wise then as they are to-day, they would not have been anxious to dispose of them. Within We know that shipping is essential to Australia, since it is impossible to reach some parts of the Commonwealth except by steam. A t an early hour this morning the honourable member for Franklin the isolation of Tasmania, and I certainly think that if the Government have power to deal with sugar in this way they have power to deal with shipping. Since the Legal Committee, to whom this measure was referred, say that it is within the competence of the Parliament to pass it , it must be admitted that the Government have just as much power to deal with the shipping industry as they have to control sugar. W it h the exception of the sugar industry, none of the interests covered by this B ill w ill be likely to contest it , inasmuch as they w ill be better off under it than they would be without it . the shipping industry may contest it in the H i gh Court. I do not know what w ill be the position of the meat industry under this measure. In the early days of the war the Queensland Parliament passed a Sugar Acquisition B ill , under which the State Government have since dealt with many other commodities. Indeed, it may be said that the whole of the commercial activities of the Queensland State Government have been carried out under it . Meat was acquired under it to enable the contract which the Denham Government entered into with the Imperial authorities to be The honourable' member for carried out. Beef and mutton, under that contract, were to be supplied at fixed",53,Second Reading

344,The Mr Ttjdob,"That is very likely.-prices, which have been varied from time to time, and in all probability, notwithstanding that the war is over, that contract will continue to operate. The position is, therefore, tliat beef and mutton will continue to be controlled under the Queensland State legislation, and wool will be controlled under this Bill, whereas hides will not be dealt with. In to-day's Argus there appears the following telegraphic Teport from Adelaide :Adelaide -The Prices Commission sat on Thursday, when the leather industry was under consideration. J. M. Reid,' tanner, stated that under normal conditions Australian tanners readily obtained all the hides they required, and turned out a big quantity of leather, wbich gave an exportable surplus of 25 per cent. On the declaration of war, the Australian hide and leather markets were greatly upset, and hides fell considerably in value, as there was no opportunity to export. Subsequently, British tanners wanted Australian hides, and opportunities were afforded for shipments to Great Britain. The prices of hides then gradually rose, until, early in February last, light hides were up 60 per cent., medium hides from 43 per cent., and heavy hides from 54 per cent. Leather values advanced in a relative ratio. As stated by ithe honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton), in the course of the debate on the Ministerial statement, since February last the price of hides has increased to the extent of nearly 50 per cent., so that if there had been an increase of 54 per cent, up to February last, the increase to-day, as compared with the price before the embargo was imposed, is practically 100 per cent. According to some figures that I obtained from Mr .to go into thewholequestion of price fixing, Knibbs, the price of heavy hides before the imposition of the embargo was less than Is. per lb., whereas to-day it is over Is. Sd. per lb. tically double what they were before the embargo was imposed. bargo was imposed while I held office as Minister for Trade and Customs. A point that needs to be emphasized is that the advantage of this great increase in the price of hides has not beeu reaped by the producer. I make bold to say that hundreds of thousands of hides were held by the big mea t companies. They purchased their beef on the hoof at from 40s. to"" 60s. per cwt., and would estimate to receive about 55s. for a heavy hide, or, at 13d. per lb., about 60s. ' Since then, as I have said, the price of hides has gone up to Is. 8d. per lb., so that the meat companies are reaping the advantage of the enormous increase. Those who have leather stocks are also reaping the advantage of the increase in leather values. The .Government, however, say that they will leave the State Governments to deal with the price of meat, that they themselves will control the wool, but that the hides and pelts shall be free from governmental control. Every person in the community is being called upon to pay higher prices for his boots because of the failure of the Government to control the hides. The Acting Attorney-General( Mr Groom) should tell us at once w it h e r the Government have power to deal with hides and pelts. According to' a report of the InterState Commission, if a man goes to a timber merchant for building material he is told that he -must buy from that firm everything he wants for his building, otherwise he will not be supplied. The Government, in the same way, should say in respect of all these matters, "" All or none."" is aware that the Government has not attempted to control the price of boots. -although this Bill affords an opportunity I do not intend to deal with the question in detail to-day. I have not the slightest intention of going into the whole question of unrestricted price fixing when dealing with this Bill. Let me quote further from the evidence given before the Price Fixing CommissionThe Commonwealth Government then decided to regulate the prices of hides, leather, and boots. A conference was called, and a basis for increases on pre-war rates was determined, ranging from 33 per cent, on light hides to 38 per cent for heavy hides. Taking a leading line of sole leather between July, 'l914, and .July, 1919, there had been an increase of 87$ per cent, in the price, but an exceedingly dangerous period had been entered, which had filled up the tanneries with hides.",54,Second Reading

The legal gentlemen who have given an opinion say that the Commonwealth have the absolute power to control wool and wheat. If the Commonwealth can control two matters it ought to be able to control more than ""two. But possibly the whole thing is illegal.

On the question of the examination of the lighthouses of Australia, upon which the Commonwealth proposed to spend a considerable sum of money in order to bring them up to date, I called into consultation in my office the chairman of the Steam-ship Owners Federation and the secretary of the Merchant Service Guild, although they were having a controversy in the newspapers at the time, and, apparently, were not friendly. I asked for their assistance i h making a choice from among the persons who had tendered their services to do the work. Both gentlemen readily acceded to my request. I hold that if a Minister w ill not seek assistance he is not worthy of holding office. A man makes a big mistake who sets himself up to be an expert in everything. In fact, the person who knows a l l about everything is generally a "" mug."" ""When the . Fisher Government were in office a B ill was brought forward in which it was proposed to ask the H i g h Court to give a decision as to the constitutionality of any measure.

There is one matter in which the Government w ill have absolute power to f i x prices. We have committed ourselves to an expenditure of £50,000,000 on homes for soldiers, and I commend to the notice of the Assistant Ministerf o r Repatriation ( Mr Poynton) the report of the InterState Commission on Rents and Building Combines, dealing with the increase in the cost of building. If , according to the sworn evidence given before the Commission, we do not fix prices, those gentlemen who control the supply of materials for building purposes wiU do so. On page 21 the Commissioners comment upon the action of the New South Wales Government in establishing a State brickworks, and quote the report of the State Auditor General dealing with this matter. This is what the report saysThe manager of the State Brickworks gave evidence, and produced the Auditor-General's reports on the workings of this enterprise. The works sell common -bricks at 38s. 6d. per 1,000, as against the Combine price of 50s. per 1,000. They have since raised the price by 2s. 6d. per thousand. Operations began in 1911, and the financial results, according to the Auditor-General's report, 1918, have been remarkable. He states (pages 1-2-)-""Accumulate d profits-at 30th June, 1918, were £23,022 Ss. 9d., or 26.94 per cent.: reserve for renewals, £27,489 15s. 6d., or 31.36 per cent.; amounting in all to £51,112 4s. 3d., or 58.30 per cent, of the capital employed. In addition to the declared profits, direct savings to the extent of £68,470 18s. 2d., on account of Government services, must be taken into consideration. These savings were effected by Government services, but also the general public participated in these reduced prices, though necessarily such estimates are not included. It will thus be seen that the profits were £23,622 8s. 9d., plus the savings of £68,470 ISs. 2d., or, in all, £92,093 6s. l i d . , a sum in excess of the capital employed, viz., £87,669, by which amount the State has benefited."" member hear the answer I gave this morning with regard to bricks and 'timber for soldiers' houses ?",55,Second Reading

The cost of the ' material in 1918 was more than the cost of material and labour combined in 1914. ber know how much of that material was imported ? the cost of material goes up because the cost of production increases owing to advances in wages. various trade associations or combinations are dealing with building material, and exercising a rigid control in fixing prices as well as in regulating distribution. If the Government do not fix prices, outside organizations of employers will do so. It is better for the Government to take this course. TheB ill , in my judgment, does not go far enough with regard to them. Instead of asking the Legal Committee whether the Government ha? power to deal with these particular items, they should have asked whether power was not vested in the Government to deal with every item in regard to price-fixing. I believe we have the power, and now that the war is over any failure on the part of the Government to control these matters cannot be excused because we are in a state of war, as was urged in the Burvett v. Farey case, which came before Chief Justice Griffith. The Acting Attorney-General has stated that we have power to deal with the matters referred to in the B ill , but I think we have a I believe tbe honourable great deal more power under the Constitution than many of us have been led to believe I intend to speak for only a few minutes on one or two salient features of this B ill .

He sat at the table with nobody behind h i m, as all the members of his party were upstairs. They had gone through the B ill and l e f t it to the Minister. He sat at the table while I made a speech from the opposite side of the House, occupying about an hour and a half, in which I brought to bear all the knowledge I possessed, covering many years of experience of shipping and the law, and simply nodded his head at me very much like a Chinese toy. In -the end he did not make one single amendment. I am afraid he has been beating the wind this afternoon, and that the Minister w ill probably not make one alteration in the B ill as the result of the many suggestions he has made. I take an interest in this measure, because I think I was the leading spirit in opposing an indiscriminate extension for six months of the War Precautions Act last session. It was proposed then to extend the Act with regard to all the activities at that time controlled by the Government. I pointed out that as the war was practically over, we ought, as soon as possible, to return to government by Parliament. I consider that during the last three or four years I have been paid £600 a year for doing nothing because the whole power of Parliament has been vested in heads of Departments. We have been governed by heads of Departments.

I want to see a return to parliamentary government to-day. We are a democratic community, and whether we believe that the man in the street knows as much as we do about politics, we are quite satisfied to regard this House as representing the country and to criticise measures on their merits. that time tliat, because of the termina-. tion of the war, there was an obligation on the Government to demonstrate the necessity for an extension of any W a r Precautions Act powers, and that they ought to bring down a B ill at the end of three months indicating what activities it might be thought advisable to still f u r ther control. The Government have done that, and I am perfectly satisfied to leave the matter in their hands. In this measure the Government have enumerated dairy produce, wool, sugar, flax, and wheat, which it is desirable further to control. mentioned, and in connection with that matter I remind the Leader of the Opposition that when he is talking about shipping he always appears to be talking at me, and points his finger at me. One would think, from his general attitude, that I was fortunate enough to possess all the shipping of Australia. would be very much surprised to know that, although I had the honour to manage a very big company for three years, as a ship owner I now take no more interest in shipping except so f a r as it affects the dividends I receive. I know nothing of the details of purchase, freights, or arrangements, and therefore I would have the honourable member tounderstand that, he should shake his finger at some other member, remembering that I know no more about the subject than he 'does.

361,Perhaps He Mr Charlton,"I am surprisedthe legal authorities consulted by the Government. ' I .do not question that decision, but it appears to me, as a layman, that there is need for some further explanation of the legal decision, because, if , as the Minister stated, power under the Constitution to extend the control of some commodities t ill 1920, and others to an earlier date, there is no reason why. the control should not be extended in regard to all commodities. If that is so, why do the Government tell us that, peace having been restored, certain commodities, the price of which was formerly controlled by the Commonwealth, must now, in accord"" ance with the powers of the Constitution' revert to the control of the States? There must be something wrong in that con tradictory statement. . If the Government can continue to regulate the prices of sugar, butter, cheese, wheat, and other commodities, surely they can do the same in regard to every commodity; no line of demarcation can be drawn between one set of articles and another. legal in respect of one commodity must be legal in respect of others. I find the Minister's statement a little perplexing. Frequentlv legislation which has passed this Parliament has been found, when tested in the Courts, to be ultra vires, ind we ought, therefore, to be very caref u l not to pass legislation that is possibly beyond the province of the Commonwealth. I am not convinced by the legal decision which the Acting Attorney-General has quoted.' The honourable gentleman did not offer his own individual opinion.. with the others. gentleman did not state his views at length when speaking on the measure: he relied on the certificates of the other legal gentlemen whom the Government consulted. Their opinion may, or may not, be correct. ( Mr Tudor) stated that, with one exception, he did not think anybody would appeal to the H i g h Court against this B ill . I , on the contrary, think it is quite probable -that' every interest that finds itself adversely affected by this legislation in the near future w ill appeal against it . been publicly-made that the measure will be tested in regard to sus;ar. adverse to the Commonwealth is -given in ( Mr Groom) respect of sugar, it must have equal apthe Government must have plication to other controlled commoditiesButi f the sugar companies do not appeal, it is quite possible that other persons w ill . stated also that the Act will be tested in respect of wool. members imagine that, because-the primary producer is not so wealthy as some, of the corporations, he will not test a law which is prejudicial to his interests? The co-operative societies in the dairying industry have accumulated large sums of 7 money, and do honourable members think that they will not test this legislation? We ought to take the precaution of getting sound legal advice as to the position we occupy in regard to this measure. of the legal gentlemen who have been What is consulted give us the necessary security ? the nature of' the case that was stated to them. If 1, as a member of a Government, asked certain legal gentlemen if , under the War Precautions Act, I could legally extend the duration of the control of certain commodities, they might reply, "" Yes, as you have f u l l power under the War Precautions Act to do certain thingsin time of war."" But if I were to say, "" Now that Peace is restored, have we power to continue to regulate the prices of these commodities,"" .they might give quite a different answer.

373,The Leader Of The Opposition Mr Charlton,"I accept tlie honhave permitted to continue unchecked the profiteering in other commodities? We must be logical. Either we can control all commodities, or we can control none. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Bruce Smith) said that the Minister w ill have power to add from time to time to the commodities 'mentioned in the B ill . If that is so, the Parliament must have power to bring within the scope of the measure all the necessaries of life', and there can be no justification for permitting profiteering to continue one minute longer. How can we shelter ourselves behind the people by saying that before we can act we must have an amendment of the Constitution? opinion upon which the Minister is acting be sound, no amendment of the Constitution is necessary, I admit that when the Fisher Government were in power we were advised that an amendment of the Constitution was necessary before the Federal Parliament could legally dual with trade and commerce and monopolies. We appealed to the people, and they rejected our proposal. But in the light of the latest legal opinion, it appears as if there is no longer any necessity to take a referendum of the electors; we have the constitutional power to deal with trade if we only care to exercise it . If it be true t h a t we can legally do the things which this Bill seeks to do, I shall not go before the people and shelter myself and Parliament behind the plea that we have no constitutional power. That is a position which the Government will be obliged to face. During the recent debate, whenever any one on this side mentioned the cost of living and pointed out the necessity of this Parliament doing something to regulate it , there was a chorus from the other side to this effect: "" Oh, we cannot do anything; we have not the power. The war is over; it is now a matter for the States."" Even the Minister now sitting at the table said it was. Nowwe find it is a matter not for the States, but for this Parliament. shirking our responsibilities? seems to be no room for argument if that legal opinion is correct. I believe it w ill be found that this Parliament has not the power that it should have to deal w i th these matters, but I am not a legal man, and my opinion does not j u s t if y the Government, who believe they have the power, in permitting certain things to go from their control, and certain in d i v iduals to charge exorbitant prices. Rer cently the Leader of the Opposition and myself asked what justification there was for this Parliament permitting the price of boots to rise as it is doing.

We also have a . contract with the Queensland Government in the case of sugar. but the Government take control of the whole of the consumption of the people of Australia in regard to those very commodities, although there is no contract Why, then, are we between the people and the Government.

381,Mr Charlton,"S of a r so good;taking place every day. Those interested are not satisfied for one week. Directly they get an increase, up goes the price again, and we are allowing this io go on. The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr keep down the cost of living, 'and to do Atkinson) says the Constitution will not permit us to interfere, but the Constitution will permit the Government to regulate the price of butter, cheese, sugar, and wool to the people of Australia. If the Constitution permits the Government to do that up to the end of 1920 for certain specified articles, it will permit them to do it for everything that they care to specify in this Bill. This measure, therefore, will not give the satisfaction which the public expect. I question very much whether it will stand the test of an appeal to the High Court. The Government ought to be sure about the constitutionality of any measure that they bring forth, and get the best legal advibe to guide them. We should not be doing certain things, and setting up new Departments, in the dark. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr which produces in abundance, to pay Bruce Smith"") rightly pointed out that we have been governed by Departments for a long time past. I have said the same thing myself here, and many of those Departments have not given the satisfaction that the public expected. Having established that system of government, however, we cannot abandon it all at once. It must be a matter of gradual evolution, and during that evolution the people should be protected in regard to all commodities, and not only in relation to certain specified articles. The dairy farmer has no greater sympathizer in .this House than myself. I know how he and his family have to toil. He has a perfect right to get a fair price for his commodities, and I do not bhink he is getting more than a fair price now. But what happens between the man that produces and the man who retails the stuff to the consumer? That is where the leakage takes place, and 'we are making no endeavour to control it. We are allowing those interested a free hand. If , later on, we ask the people to give us gi'eater powers to control these things, Ave shall lay ourselves open to the charge of hypocrisy, because, when Ave had the poAver. we would not attempt to exercise it. HOAV is the public protected on Mr Charlton. > the Boards enumerated in the schedules? See Who are on those Boards, and you will find that the consumers have no representatives. If Ave seriously intend to try to what is right between man and man-OU T guiding principle in fixing prices should be to see that the man who produces gets a fair return to enable him to keep his family in decent comfort and provide for old age, and also that the consumer gets a fair deal-w e should give both sides representation on these controlling Boards. Whoever represents the general public on the Boards will be able,to put the point of Ariew of the consumer. Surely he will carry some Aveight, and he may be able to prevent exorbitant charges being made to the people of Australia. The Minister says we have contracts for certain things entered into by these Boards. The Boards seem always to take the ruling price abroad as the guiding principle, and then expect the people here, in a country exactly the same as they would have to pay in other parts of the world which depend on us for supplies; although so many miles of sea roll between us and them that the cost in freight alone to carry our commodities to them represents a good deal of money. Even then tremendous profits are made out of our produce. The Boards persist in regarding the needs c-f our OAvn people from the stand-point of the demands of the people abroad, and this is -due to the fact that only one class is represented on them-that is, those directly concerned in the commodities which are dealt Avith. That sort of thing should not continue. NOAV that the Minister proposes to prolong these controls until the f>nd of 1920, Avhy does he not invite the House to alter the composition of the Boards? Why does he not provide for representatives of the consumers to have seats on those bodies during the remainder of the term? The honourable member for .Grampians ( Mr Jowett) told us the other night that his Board did not charge the same for AVOOI here as they exported it for. That may be so, but it does not follow that they are not charging too much to the people of Australia even then. It is quite' possible, if there were representatives on that Board looking after tbe_ in terests of tbe consumers, that they mightfind it necessary to urge that even less should be charged here for wool, in order to enable the people of Australia to get their clothing much cheaper. lations should be made to fche manufacturers -If there is to be an extension until the those who have to pay for these commodities have no voice in the matter. We regulate the price of sugar, for instance, through/the Customs Department. A few months ago the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) and myself got a surprise. The co-operative people asked us to meet them at Newcastle, and pointed out what the wholesale merchants were doing. When I speak of the wholesale merchants, I invite honourable members to look at the Inter-State Commission's report on groceries, and see who they are. They are called the Co-operative Distribution Company, and certain wholesale firms are members. They fix the prices. Manufacturers have to supply them, and they distribute to the retailers. claimed that they are fixing exorbitant prices. This wholesale Co-operative Distribution Company evidently had sufficient influence to deal with the Government in regard to sugar. A certain rebate was given to all who bought sugar from that source. But it is strange tliat the various co-operative societies, which belong to the consumers themselves, and are not capitalistic concerns, did. not secure the rebate whioh was allowed to other storekeepers. societies in my district, where they are strongly established and have their own wholesale society, could not get sugar on th© same terms as otlier retailers, although it is a commodity which the Government are regulating. that that has now been remedied. until very recently. have occurred at a l l, when we had the sugar ourselves ? W h y did the Government, who had charge of the sugar and its distribution, permit those middlemen, who produce nothing, .to decide what re-, bate ought to be paid, and to whom it should be allowed ? member is mistaken. There is no such arrangement, so f a r as I know. direct with facts and figures some three or four monthsago. This all goes to show And that certain stiputhat the consumers ought to be represented on the Boards; that is all I urge. Q u it e so; but end of 1920, why is not provision made in the B ill for the representation of the consumers ? Prices have been going up, despite the control we have been exercising. There is a screw loose somewhere. We have a right to demaud an explanation of the mystery. We should insist that the interests of the consumer be protected. No one is against those concerned in business securing fair returns; t u t we want to prevent profiteering, which is rampant. Nothing is being done. This measure seeks to perpetuate what has been carried on for the past two or three years. I want to see the people getting a fai r deal. I am not much concerned about the Shipping Board, but I believe we would It is be no worse off if the Board were disbanded to-morrow. better off.

While we have taken over their ships and are paying them rental for their vessels, they have been practically permitted to r u n the boats to their own satisfaction. Wherever they have been concerned in a particular comThe co-operative modity they have not been hindered in using their craft to carry that commodity to their own choice of markets, to the exclusion of other people. Take the carriage of coal, for instance I cannot complain with regard to my own district, for the miners hate been kept going fairl y constantly. But the honourable member ' for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) cannot say the same, unfortunately. The shipping It had not been managers have worked their own W h y should it favoured propositions, and have carried coal in their ships quite independently of Commonwealth control; b u t a fair deal has not been given other districts.

Unless something is done in Tegard to the fixing of prices in the near future, and thus some relief given in connection with the cost of living, I see nothing but trouble ahead. People cannot be kept in submission all the time. It redounds to the credit of the people of this com: munity that, although they were hard pressed during the war, .and had to go short of many things, they felt that a patriotic duty devolved on them to make sacrifices. Many, owing to their age, were not able to go to the Pront, but fchey made what sacrifices lay within their power. Nowj however, they cannot continue to make those sacrifices; their stocks of clothing have worn out, and their purchasing power is not sufficient to secure more; and they anticipate that, now Peace has been signed, some effort will be made to quickly return to normal conditions. As I say, unless some relief is afforded, I see nothing before us but ohaos, leading we know not where. I am one who believes, and always have believed, that whatever we do should be done in a constitutional way, because with adult suffrage all the power is in our hands.. People are constantly being told that Parliament is what they make it, and they look to us to protect their interests, and, now that there is no necessity for further sacrifices, to bring about a state of society in which they can live in decent comfort. come this Bill, not, perhaps, for reasons I ask tbe Acting Attorneyadvanced by some honourable, members, but for the reason that it, at least, foreshadows the termination of Government functions under the War Precautions Act. I was one who urged as strongly as possible that, when the war ceased, the unconstitutional method of Government control under this Act should cease with it. Although we were unable when we last met, at the end of 1918, to get our own way in the matter, we got a promise from the Government that the operation of this Act would be curtailed as far as possible, and at the earliest possible moment; and this Bill, I take it , is the fulfilment of that promise. ""Whether, it will prove of any value lies in the wiomb of the future. A certificate has been given by some very eminent legal gentlemen regarding the constitutionality of the Bill, and, naturally, a layman ought to hold his breath 'before expressing an opinion adverse to theirs. But what was submitted to those gentlemen for decision? e member know exactly what was submitted, and the manner in which it was submitted ?

This is the ©pinion expressed by the legal gentlemen referred toWe have carefully considered this B ill , and are of opinion that it is within the competence of thc Commonwealth Parliament. AlthoughI am not a lawyer, I could have told the Government that, because the Bill is simply a continuation of functions under the ""War Precautions Act, which is still in force. Until that Act ceases to operate, it is quite clear that a Bill of this kind is within the competence of Parliament. not say that, but that Parliament is competent to pass the Bill up to 1920.

I am not one who submits his judgment to lawyers,.because I know that any opinion we want can be got from a lawyer. ment. other considerations. We may go to Ihe most eminent lawyer, who will advise us to take OUT case to the Supreme Court, but we find the decision against us. The lawyer, of course, is of opinion that the Supreme Court is wrong, and if we have plenty of money we take his advice and appeal to the Full Court, which decides in our favour. Then our opponents take the case to the High Court, which reverses the judgment' of the Supreme Court. Where are we then? This is too fanciful picture, for it represents a frequent experience. Sueh a case may be taken to the Privy Council, which reverses the decision of the Court below. In one case, a decision by a Police Magistrate was carried through the Courts right up to the Privy Council, which in the end decided that the Police Magistrate was right; so it can be seen bow much reliance can: be placed on the opinions of lawyers. I shall not mention names, because that might lead to the identification of the party concerned, but there was a case in which we had occasion to obtain a legal opinion oh' a certain matter. We obtained that opinion from a very prominent lawyer. Later on it was found that our opponents had secured from the same gentleman an opinion contrary to that which he had given us. When attention was drawn to this fact the solicitor withdrew the opinion which had been submitted to us in order to allow the other opinion of the barrister to stand. has not too high an opinion of the profession ! brains are concerned, I suppose that it contains some very able men exact science. much more inexact than is the science. The Acting Attorney-General( Mr Groom) has obtained from this Legal Committee a certificate that Parliament is competent to pass this Bill.

460,Mr Tudor ( Y A R R A ) [ 4 . 0 ],"I shouldvenience of honourable members generally, the intentions of the Government w i th regard to the sittings of the House next week in view of the fact that Peace Celebrations in the case of some of our schools w ill commence on Priday next. An announcement at this stage would be of value to those Inter-State representatives who propose to take part in the Peace Celebrations in their respective States. have been asked by the relatives of returning invalid soldiers to put this brief statement before the HouseThe hospital ship Karoola moored at -Woolloomooloo wharf at 0.30 a.m. on Saturday, 28th June. On board were twenty-three eot cases, some very bad indeed. Breakfast was served while in the stream at 7.30 a.m. Shortly after the vessel was moored, eight or ten' of the invalids were taken on deck, most of the invalids dressed in pyjamas only, yet the weather was cold, a sharp windblowing. Shortly after 11 a.m., cot cases were removed to the wharf, where they lay in the cold without sufficient covering. The Karoola then pulled out to the stream. Through an insufficiency of motor ambulances, it was 3 p.m. before the last of the invalids arrived at Bandwick Hospital. The invalids had no food or refreshments of any kind from 7.30 a.m. until 3 p.m., while the exposure to cold through want of sufficient clothing resulted in some of the invalids contracting severe colds. Notwithstanding this, we read in the evening newspapers that the Governor General met the hospital ship, addressed words of welcome to the returned men, that a plentiful supply of cars were in waiting, and that everything went without a hitch. view of the answers given by the Acting Prime Minister to questions 1 have asked with reference to Paul Freeman, and the refusal of the Government, either, to release h i m on bail or to submit h i m to trial, I desire to ask the honourable gentleman what course of action the Government intend to adopt w i th regard to the man When I brought the case of Paul Freeman before the authorities, I also drew attention to the case of a man named Abraham Marks, who was sentenced to six months' imprisonment in the New South Wales penitentiary, but was kept in gaol for seventeen months, and was deported, I gather, from the reply of the Defence Department, about the time that Freeman was sent away. I should like to know whether the Government intend to keep Paul Freemani n gaol? [ 4 . 5 ] -I desire to direct the attention of the Treasurer ( MrW a t t ) to certain phases of the administration of the entertainments tax in New South Wales. In connection w it h repatriation work, and the welcoming home of our returned I soldiers, we have, in many centres, associations and societies which, by means of concerts and other entertainments, raise funds to enable the returning men to be entertained. The officer administering the entertainments tax holds, that such entertainments are subject to the tax if ( the expenses of conducting them amount to 50 per cent, of the gross proceeds. As the number of returning men increases, with a consequent increase in the "" welcome home"" functions, more and more difficulty is being experienced in securing a f u l l attendance at these gatherings. A charge is -made for admission merely to recoup the societies the expense incurred. They very often find nowadays that, in stead of having a surplus, they have a deficit, and the taxing oflicer thereupon demands that the tax shall be paid on admission tickets. This is a rather serious matter for the people concerned, many of whom are not in affluent circumstances, and have to provide the tax out of their own pockets. It seems to me that if the officer were to "" turn a blind eye "" on such In cases, he would do more good to the community than he does by taking a strictly technical view of the wording of the Act. In another case, to which I shall referin detail later on, the power of the Department has been used in a most extraordinary way because of Ihe inexperience of the man concerned. This man, who is a miner, failed to secure the authority which he could have secured from the Department, exempting from the provisions of the Entertainments Tax Act the patriotic entertainment for which he was responsible. Notwithstanding that his mistake was due to inexperience, the Department put h i m to the expense of a t r i a l , sent counsel to the town where the tria l took place, and compelled h i m to pay tbe",67,House Hospita Lship Karoola Landing Of Invalids Case Of Pau L Freeman Taxation Of Patriotic

So far as I can see, there was not the slightest justification for the action of the Department, which refuses to grant any redress. I hope the Treasurer w ill look into these cases, and see whether the strict letter of the law should be enforced in respect of patriotic and charitable entertainments that are not a source of profit, but, on the contrary, an actual loss to the promoters. Minister and Treasurer) [4.7] -The honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Lamond) knows, as I do, that the case3 that worry honourable members most, and are often the most embarrassing to M in isters, are frequently those of which the. latter have no personal knowledge, but in respect of which the action complained of has been taken by officials. I am not able to say whether the cases cited by the honourable member are within or outside the Act, but my own view is that the law was never intended to burden gatherings of the kind described by him. an early opportunity of ascertaining exactly the purport of the law with respect to such entertainments, and, should it be necessary, in the judgment of the Government, to amend that law, 1 shall not hesitate to ask Parliament to alter it . The honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) has referred to the case, of Paul Ereeman. I say, with great respect to the honourable member, that that matter has been made the subject of a political agitation in another State, and that, in connection with it , a good deal of public excitement has been caused, largely, so f a r as the Government is aware, by a misrepresentation of the facts. In these circumstances, I am not prepared to answer any further questions, without notice, in regard to the case. The honourable member w ill recognise the necessity for, and the wisdom of, that course.' I was pained to hear the remarks made by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) regarding the arrival and treatment of invalid soldiers on the Karoola at Woolloomooloo Bay last And all this month. I assume that the 'hotnorable member knows the source of the information. cannot vouch for it . member does not vouch for it , such a statement demands, and w ill receive, the immediate investigation of the Acting Ministerf or Defence (Senator Russell).

I do not love punishment, but if the men who take responsibility for dealing w it h cases of this, kind are unable to do the job, they should relinquish it . If they undertake the work, they should deal w i th I shall take it in the spirit in which the Parliament hoped and intended that it should be carried out. On Wednesday next, either one or both of the Bills relating to the War Precautions Regulations w ill be advanced to the stage which the Commercial Activities B ill has reached. We shall then go on with the Commercial Activities B ill unti l it is passed. On Wednesday we shall meet at the usual hour and sit in the afternoon and evening. If it w ill suit the convenience of honourable members, we shall meet on Thursday at 11 o'clock in the morning, and if we make reasonable progress, Inter-State members who desire to do'so may catch the Inter-State expresses. This will enable them to reach their respective Statesi n order to take part in the Peace celebrations. If it can be arranged with the concurrence of honourable members on both sides, I hope it will be possible to have a similar sitting on Friday. However, we can settle that point on Wednesday next.
