That is not good enough, because commitments were given. In the election in 1996, we were crucified on our side of the House because of the operation of the parallel runways and the implications for the people of Sydney and, at the time, the current government promised that it would give air traffic noise relief to the people of Sydney.

239,Mr Speaker,"Order! It being 11 p.m.,The following answers to questions were circulated: Health: Federal and State Funding (Question No. 1906) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 31 August 2000: (1) What programs based on the principle of pooled Federal and State health funding is the Government trialing and what health services are involved. (2) In each case, how is the day-to-day administration of the funding pool being managed. Questions 1 and 2 All details may be found by going to the Department’s website at www.health.gov.au and searching for “coordinated care trials” and “multipurpose services”. Health: In-Vitro Fertilisation (Question No. 2001) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: (1) What is the average or standard cost of providing a woman with in-vitro fertilisation treatment. (2) How much of the cost is (a) covered by Medicare and (b) paid by the patient. Under the Medicare arrangements, there are a number of different components to in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment and the treatment can be provided where ovulation is unstimulated, or more commonly, may involve the use of drugs to stimulate ovulation. Based on data for the 12 months to June 2000, IVF treatment using unstimulated cycles accounted for approximately 6.1% of treatment cycles. The following statistics therefore assume that the treatment involves the use of stimulated cycles and also includes planning and management services, oocyte retrieval, preparation of semen and the transfer of the embryo or the ova and sperm. These services are covered under the following items in the Medicare Benefits Schedule. 13200 Assisted Reproductive Services (such as in-vitro fertilisation, gamete intrafallopian transfer or similar procedures) involving the use of drugs to induce superovulation, and including quantitative estimation of hormones, ultrasound examinations, all treatment counselling and embryology laboratory services – but excluding artificial insemination or transfer of frozen embryos or donated embryos or ova or a service to which item 13203, 13206 or 13218 applies – being services rendered during 1 treatment cycle, if the duration of the treatment cycle is at least 9 days. 13209 Planning and management of a referred patient by a specialist for the purpose of treatment by assisted reproductive technologies including in-vitro fertilisation, gamete intra-fallopian transfer and similar procedures, or for artificial insemination – payable once only during 1 treatment cycle. 13212 Oocyte retrieval by any means including laparoscopy of ultrasound-guided ova flushing, for the purposes of assisted reproductive technologies including in-vitro fertilisation, gamete intrafallopian transfer or similar procedures – only if rendered in conjunction with a service to which item 13200 or 13206 applies. 13215 Transfer of embryos or both ova and sperm to the female reproductive system, by any means but excluding artificial insemination or the transfer of frozen or donated embryos – only if rendered in conjunction with a service to which item 13200 or 13206 applies, being services rendered in 1 treatment cycle. 13221 Preparation of semen for the purposes of assisted reproductive technologies or for artificial insemination.",116,Adjournment Generally It Would Appear That The Program
240,Dr Wooldridge,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,117,Questions On Notice
241,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Based on data for the 12 months to June 2000, per treatment cycle, the average Medicare benefit was $1842.78 and the average out-of-pocket expense for items covered by Medicare was $564.77. If patients also require services not covered by Medicare, additional costs may be incurred. For the same period, the average cost per treatment cycle for the associated drug treatment is $1900, the total cost of which is covered under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The number of treatment cycles each woman would undergo varies, however, the average number of treatment cycles per woman is approximately 2.2. Therefore, the average cost for a woman for IVF treatment covered under the Medicare arrangements and the PBS is $9,476.70. Of this amount, $8,234.20 is covered by the Commonwealth Government. These figures do not include any hospitalisation costs associated with IVF treatment. This is because it is not possible to obtain a definitive correlation between the coding used to classify hospitalisation data with the codes used in the Medicare Benefits Schedule for IVF services. Private Health Insurance: Rebate Scheme (Question No. 2015) Ms Hoare asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 4 October 2000: (1) What is the cost, on an annual basis, of the Government’s 30 per cent private health insurance rebate scheme. (2) Are premium loadings for people who delay taking up private health insurance membership under the Lifetime Health Cover Scheme covered by the Government’s 30 per cent private health insurance premium rebate; if so, what is the projected effect on the total cost of the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate of the Lifetime Health Cover scheme premium loadings. (1) The total cost of the private health insurance 30 per cent rebate in 1999-2000 is reported in the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care 1999-2000 Annual Report on page 143. (2) Yes, age based premiums (base rate premium including Lifetime Health Cover loading) are covered by the 30 per cent rebate. The expectation is that the majority of people over 30 years old who were going to take out private health insurance have done so prior to the Lifetime Health Cover cut-off date. It is anticipated that only a small number of people will be paying the loading in future years, and the impact on the cost of the rebate will be too small to be taken into account separately in the preparation of the estimates. Health: National Child Nutrition Program (Question No. 2062) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 12 October 2000: (1) Did the Government, in negotiations with the Australian Democrats, promise to introduce a National Child Nutrition Program to compensate people on low incomes for the impact of the GST. (2) Have applications been called for under the program; if so, (a) when did applications for the program open and close and (b) what progress has been made in allocating funds and commencing projects. (1) The Government agreed to funding for a National Child Nutrition Program in negotiations with the Australian Democrats. (2) (a) Applications under the general funding round were called for in regional and national newspapers on 11 March 2000. Applications closed on 17 April 2000.

243,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Drugs: Aricept and Exelon (Question No. 2110) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 1 November 2000: Will he include the drugs Aricept and Exelon, used to treat Alzheimer’s Disease, on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule; if so, when; if not, why not. Aricept and Exelon have recently been approved for listing on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) following a recommendation from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). The PBS listings for these medicines were effective from 1 February 2001. Health: Private Hospitals (Question No. 2116) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 2 November 2000: For each Federal electorate, what are the names of the private hospitals located within its boundaries and how many beds does each hospital provide. The Department of Health and Aged Care prepares electorate profiles annually for each Federal electorate in Australia. These profiles include the names of all private hospitals in each electorate. They also include the total number of private hospital beds per thousand population for each electorate. Information on the number of beds for each private hospital are not published in the electorate profiles because of the variable nature of bed availability in individual private hospitals at different times of the year and because of different regulatory arrangements in respect of private hospital bed numbers across State/Territory jurisdictions. The June 2000 profiles were distributed to all Members in October 2000 and are also available in the Parliamentary Library. Private Health Insurance: Rebate (Question No. 2137) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 7 November 2000: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1924 (Hansard, 2 November 2000, page 19584), has his Department advised him of expected savings for public hospitals from the 30% private health insurance rebate; if so, what does the advice reveal. (2) What cost benefit outcome for public hospitals does the Government expect to achieve from the 30% rebate. (1) It has been the practice of successive governments not to reveal details of policy advice provided by the Department to the Minister. (2) The 30% rebate is intended to ensure the sustainability of the health financing system as a whole by restoring the balance between private and public sector funding. Medical Practioners: Provision of Non-Medical Services (Question No. 2169) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 27 November 2000: (1) Prior to being reimbursed by the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) for the provision of traditionally non-medical services such as acupuncture, naturopathy, homoeopathy or manipulation, are medical practitioners required to have attained formal distinct accreditation in those services; if not, will the Government close this loophole.",118,Questions On Notice

246,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Specifically regarding spinal manipulation, do medical undergraduate courses in Australia provide education and supervised clinical experience that equate with the qualifications required by State and Territory Governments of a chiropractor or an osteopath to gain registration; if not, do State medical registration boards know which medical registrants have completed post-graduate training that would equate with the qualifications required by State and Territory Governments of a chiropractor or an osteopath. (3) Do State medical registration boards provide the HIC with a record showing which registrants have, or do not have, that equivalent qualification to provide spinal manipulation. (4) What arrangements does the Federal Government have in place to permit the HIC to differentiate between those medical providers who have, and those medical providers who do not have, that equivalent qualification to provide spinal manipulation. (5) Does the HIC know which medical providers are, or are not, qualified to provide spinal manipulation. (6) Is it a fact that the HIC will reimburse a medical provider for the provision of manipulation without requiring that the provider has attained a separate and distinct qualification with regard to manipulation. (1-6) Medicare benefits are paid for medically necessary services. Accreditation of medical practitioners for the performance of specific services has never been part of Medicare, nor are there plans to make it so. If medical practitioners practice beyond their training, it is a matter for State and Territory medical boards to determine what action should be taken, not the Commonwealth Government. Health: Dental Services (Question No. 2179) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 28 November 2000: (1) Has the Commonwealth Government eliminated Commonwealth public funding for dental care. (2) Have Commonwealth Government cutbacks in dental funding had a crippling impact on NSW dental services. (3) Is the average waiting period for dental surgery at the Dental Clinic at Concord Hospital 18 months. (4) Are dental services a joint Commonwealth and State Government health responsibility. (5) Will the Commonwealth Government reinstate Commonwealth funding for public dental services. (6) Will the Commonwealth Government facilitate negotiations with the State Government to enter into a Commonwealth-State agreement on dental services that clearly outlines the responsibilities of each party. (1) No. The Program came to an end. (2) No. If NSW dental services are under-funded it is a matter for the NSW Government. (3) I am unable to comment on the situation at the Concord Hospital Dental Clinic. Questions concerning specific services in NSW should be directed to the NSW Minister for Health, the Hon. C.J.

248,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) For each broad type of service categorised in the Medicare statistics, what percentage of services is (a) direct billed and (b) billed at or below Medicare Schedule fees. (2) What do the figures referred to in part (1) indicate about the (a) supply of specialist services, (b) inflation of specialists’ incomes and (c) extent of competition among the various specialist groups. (1) Details of the percentage of services that were bulk billed, by broad type of service in 1999-00, are available on the Health Insurance Commission web site at www.hic.gov.au. Details of the percentage of services that were billed at or below Medicare Schedule fees, by broad type of service in 1999-00, are as follows: Broad Type of Service Group% Billed at or Below Schedule Fees Unreferred AttendancesGP/VR 81.9 Enhanced Primary Care 99.7 Other 87.8 Total 82.6 Specialist Attendances 53.5 Obstetrics 45.3 Anaesthetics 28.9 PathologyPatient Episode Initiation 91.6 Tests 93.0 Total 92.5 Diagnostic Imaging 74.9 Operations 64.4 Assistance at Operations 42.1 Optometry 99.2 Radiotherapy & Therapeutic Nuclear Medicine 79.7 Other 74.2 Total 81.2 (2) It is difficult to draw any conclusions about specialist supply; inflation of specialists’ incomes; and extent of specialist competition from the data in part (1). For example, while it is often claimed that a greater supply of doctors results in increased bulk billing, the ACT has a relatively high supply of GPs and a relatively low rate of bulk billing for GP services. Similarly, the data in part (1) prima facie suggest a difference in supply in doctors conducting operations and doctors assisting at operations that does not exist.

249,Dr Wooldridge,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,121,Questions On Notice
250,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Although the question refers to Item 34643, I assume the honourable member is referring to Item 35643. Medicare benefits are payable for clinically relevant services. In paying Medicare benefits, the Government assumes that the service was clinically relevant and preformed in accordance with professional standards and relevant State law, unless a medical board or court decision deems otherwise. Medicare does not record the reasons for a termination, the stage of pregnancy nor the method of abortion. Medicare statistics do not include information that would allow the calculation of the percentage of services provided under item 16525 and 35643 for termination of pregnancy. The matter of whether or not it is in the public interest to know what percentage of these services result in pregnancy termination, would be based on value judgements and would have to be considered in the context of competing public interests. (2) No. (3) No it is not possible to estimate the number of late term pregnancy abortions that occur in Australia each year. Medicare does not record the stage of pregnancy nor as stated previously, information on the number of services provided under Item 16525 and 35643 which result in termination of pregnancy. Private Health Insurance: Coverage (Question No. 2253) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 7 December 2000: (1) How many persons taking out private health care policies on or before the 1 July 2000 deadline, have taken out more than basic health care cover. (2) Are these new private health care policy holders still eligible for Medicare and public health cover for items not covered by their private health cover. (1) The Private Health Insurance Administration Council (PHIAC) collects data on private health insurance membership. However, PHIAC does not collect information by health insurance product (table). Therefore there is no information collected by PHIAC on the number of people who have a product equivalent to the old ‘basic table’ products. These products provide people with a level of cover suitable for private treatment in a public hospital. (2) There is no loss of entitlement under Medicare just because a person has private health insurance. For example, a person with private health insurance still has the right to choose whether they want to be a public or a private patient when they are admitted to a public hospital. Health and Aged Care Portfolio: Purchase of Paper Products (Question No. 2391) Mr Sidebottom asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 1 March 2001: (1) Is the Minister’s Department, or are agencies within the portfolio, large purchasers or consumers of office papers. (2) How are Commonwealth procurement guidelines being adhered to by the Minister’s Department and agencies within the portfolio. (3) What methodology or weighting criteria does the Minister’s Department and agencies use to determine the importance of the core principles which underpin the procurement guidelines, namely (a) value for money, (b) open and effective competition, (c) ethics and fair dealing, (d) accountability and reporting, (e) national competitiveness and industry development and (f) support for other Commonwealth policies. (4) What weighting criteria are used to implement the mandatory provisions in the guidelines which state that agencies must be able to demonstrate that Australia New Zealand (ANZ) suppliers have had a fair opportunity to compete.",121,Questions On Notice
251,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) In inviting suppliers to tender the provision of goods, are suppliers advised that they must offer ANZ goods. (6) If the Minister’s Department or agencies within the portfolio do not have weighting criteria for determining principles, will the Minister take steps to ensure that they provide an appropriate means to demonstrate their compliance with Commonwealth procurement policy. (1) The Department of Health and Aged Care and its portfolio agencies are large purchasers and consumers of office paper. (2) The Department of Health and Aged Care and its portfolio agencies that are governed by the Financial Management and Accountability (FMA) Act, all adhere to the principles set down by the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines (CPGs). This is achieved through the seeking of competitive quotes and tender processes whenever appropriate. Wherever possible standard documentation is used for tenders encompassing the CPG requirements. The Department’s Chief Executive Instructions and Procedural Rules provide direction on the application of the CPGs. In addition to the CPGs, consideration is also given to other related Commonwealth initiatives including consideration for small/medium enterprises and the introduction of e-procurement. The portfolio agencies that are governed by the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (CAC) Act, are not bound by the CPGs. However, these agencies voluntarily adhere to the Guidelines. (3) The Department provides comprehensive guidance on the importance of adhering to the CPG principles in its Procedural Rules. The Department has a standard template for all tenders, which encompasses the core principles listed above. There is no predetermined weighting criteria applied to tenders and it is up to the discretion of the individuals concerned to determine the weight for each criteria on a case by case basis. Value for money is the prime consideration for the majority of purchases by the Department and its portfolio agencies. (4) As mentioned above, there is no pre-defined weighting criteria applied to the ANZ supplier provision. All prospective suppliers must comply with the conditions stated in the tender documentation, with particular emphasis placed on the importance of ANZ supply wherever appropriate. It should be noted that the CPGs do not provide a specific definition as to what constitutes an ANZ supplier eg: ownership of the company, number of employees engaged in Australia etc. Consequently, this criterion is often difficult to evaluate. (5) Agencies under the FMA Act advise suppliers that they must offer ANZ goods if they are available. When alternative goods are offered, this must be clearly specified. Preference will usually be given to ANZ goods provided they also meet the criteria of overall value for money. CAC Act agencies encourage suppliers to offer ANZ goods. (6) The Department and its FMA Act agencies apply appropriate weighting to criteria on a case by case basis. The Department and its agencies currently adhere to the CPGs as demonstrated in tender documentation, and the evaluation methodology may be varied, depending on the particular requirements of each purchase. It is not intended to change this practice, as consideration is always given to the principles of the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines. Health: Corporatisation in General Practice (Question No. 2452) Ms Hoare asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 26 March 2001: (1) Has the Government provided $200 000 to the Hunter Urban Division of GPs (HUDGP) to fund a study into plans to establish a GPs’ cooperative in the region. (2) Has the Government funded a number of studies by GP groups to look at the increased corporatisation of medicine. (3) If so, (a) what funding was provided and to which groups, (b) under what program was the funding provided and (c) what were the guidelines determining the allocation of funding.",122,Questions On Notice

253,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Yes (2) The Minister has approved funding for seven projects over the next five to twelve months at a total cost of $1.17 million. The projects are feasibility studies into alternative models to corporatisation in general practice. (3) (a)Hunter Division of General Practice $200,000 ACT Division of General Practice Inc. $123,600 A consortium of five Victorian Divisions of General $114,480 Practice Adelaide Northern Division of General Practice $213,000 Whitehorse Division of General Practice Ltd $147,300 General Practice Divisions of Western Australia Ltd $300,000 Western Sydney Division of General Practice Inc. $70,000 Total $1,168,380 The consortium of five Victorian Divisions includes Western Melbourne, Melbourne, Northern Melbourne, North West Melbourne, and Border Divisions of General Practice. The project being conducted by the General Practice Divisions of Western Australia involves 14 Western Australian Divisions. (b) GP infrastructure, training and support. (c) All expressions of interest received were reviewed against an agreed set of criteria, by a selection panel consisting of representatives from Australian Divisions of General Practice, the General Practice Partnership Advisory Council/General Practice Financing Group Joint Working Group on Corporatisation, portfolio steering committee on corporatisation (Department of Health and Aged Care), and the General Practice Branch in the Department. The assessment criteria were developed against the requirements requested in the proposals, as advertised via an Australian Divisions of General Practice Newsflash: A feasibility plan for Division based corporate general practice, including: The concept, objectives and proposed outcomes; Methodology; Approaches to management and governance; The level of support from general practitioners within the Division; Timelines; An evaluation plan; and Budget, with justification. A business plan demonstrating the viability of the proposal alternative to corporatisation. The assessment panel then ranked the proposals and forwarded recommendations for funding to the Minister. Medicare: MRI Services (Question No. 2473) Ms Roxon asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 27 March 2001: (1) When will the Blandford MRI Services Implementation Committee release the tender guidelines for additional MRI services to be funded under Medicare. (2) How have the areas to be served by the 7 additional MRI scanners been selected. (3) Will the distribution of the scanners be directed to fill the gap in growth areas such as the western suburbs of Melbourne. (4) Will Footscray and Sunshine be included in the areas covered by the tender process; if not, what are the grounds for their exclusion. (5) Will the existing privately owned machines in Footscray and Sunshine be eligible to take part in the tender process; if not, what are the grounds on which they will be excluded and what impact will this have on the western suburbs of Melbourne. (6) What will be the impact of the Blandford recommendations on rural and regional Victoria. (7) Why was there a 10 month gap between the receipt of the original report by Professor Blandford and the establishment of the Implementation Committee. (8) Why has there been a further 4 month delay in the calling of tenders. (9) Will the process be completed for new scanners to be eligible for Medicare rebates by 1 July 2001. (1) The Request for Tender for additional MRI services was released in May 2001. (2) The areas have been selected having regard to the distribution of existing Medicare eligible MRI services relative to population, and in consultation with State and Territory Governments. (3) As the tendering process is still ongoing it would be inappropriate to comment at this time. (4) As the tendering process is still ongoing it would be inappropriate to comment at this time. (5) Any machines that meet the tender selection criteria will be eligible to take part in the process. (6) The Blandford recommendations seek to improve accessibility to MRI services for people living in both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. (7) Following the receipt of Professor Blandford’s report, the recommendations of the report were fully considered prior to the establishment of the Committee. The establishment of such a committee is a time consuming process. (8) The review did not recommend an immediate call for tenders. A considerable amount of work has been required to fully develop the tender documentation. (9) As the tendering process is still ongoing it would be inappropriate to comment at this time. Roads: Albury Bypass (Question No. 2554) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 22 May 2001: (1) With regard to the Albury/Wodonga Hume Highway route selection, process, did he undertake on 18 July 2000, in confirming the appointment of Flagstaff Consulting, that Flagstaff’s job included providing an independent audit of the Connell Wagner report into the project. (2) Did Flagstaff write to his Department on 22 March 2001, confirming that it was not able to endorse any of the project benefit cost ratios (BCRs) if so, why. (3) Is he required to release a Regional Impact Statement on his policy decision of 21 February 2001 to build a single lane external bypass; if so, when will it be released. (4) In his open letter of 22 May 2000 to the people of Albury Wodonga, did he state that he would proceed on the basis of the principles agreed with the Victorian and NSW Governments that all aspects of the project would be examined, and not just cost. (5) In making his decision of 21 February 2001, did he consult with the NSW and Victorian Governments before announcing his preferred position; if not, why not. (6) Did he reject Flagstaff’s accusation to his Department that his decision was based on draft unaudited costs and not on proper audited figures, as promised in his statement of 18 July 2000 in which he stated it would not be lawful or responsible to spend taxpayers money in an irresponsible manner. (7) Was his decision made upon fully audited evidence, including (a) the cost of the various road options, (b) traffic anlyses of the various road options, (c) the economic benefits of the various road options and (d) the BCR benefits of the various road options. (1) Yes. (2) No. However, Flagstaff did write to my Department on 27 March 2001 and it stated that it was not able to confirm any of the BCRs in the draft report of the review of the project. Flagstaff was not satisfied by the quality of the traffic analysis carried out by Connell Wagner. It could not endorse the economic analysis because this depended on the quality of the traffic analysis.",123,Questions On Notice
254,Dr Wooldridge,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,125,Questions On Notice
255,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) No. (4) The principles that I referred to in my open letter, are the requirements that State Governments must meet in relation to such matters as planning, design and environmental concerns when they put forward projects to the Federal Government for funding. The Federal Government fully funds this work. (5) In my open letter I proposed additional work by the end of September 2000 to enable me to make a decision on the Federal Government’s preference in relation to the route by the end of 2000. This timetable allowed time for consultation between Governments. However, the initial response to my request was so tardy, and of such a low standard, that there was no prospect of finalising it to an acceptable standard within a reasonable period. I was therefore obliged to cut short this process. I subsequently wrote to the NSW Minister for Roads, the Hon Carl Scully MP, and the Victorian Minister for Transport, the Hon Peter Batchelor MP, to inform them of my decision and to invite their cooperation. (6) No, Flagstaff did not make any comment on my decision. Flagstaff has generally endorsed the costs produced in the latest draft of the report of the review, although it considers there are opportunities for cost savings in the case of some options. (7) I made my decision on the route on the basis of audited project costs, and advice that further work on the bypass review was unlikely to show a compelling case for the internal route rather than the external route on the basis of benefit/cost analysis. Disability Support Services: Employment Assistance (Question No. 2596) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 24 May 2001: Are there plans to offer incentives for Disability Support pensioners who wish to establish their own businesses and work towards being self-employed and no longer requiring government assistance. to the honourable member’s question: FaCS Funded Disability Employment Assistance Disability employment assistance providers can help people with disabilities with their support needs while setting up in self-employment. This assistance will be boosted by the Australians Working Together package announced in the recent Budget, which includes $134m over four years in increased employment and rehabilitation assistance. Other features of Australians Working Together that will improve incentives for people with disabilities to take up employment include the introduction of a Literacy and Numeracy Training Supplement and a Working Credit, which will allow people to keep more of their income support payment while working. New Enterprise Incentive Scheme DSP recipients can access the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS), which is run by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business (DEWRSB). NEIS is specifically designed to help eligible working age income support recipients to achieve independence through establishing their own businesses. NEIS applicants are evaluated on personal and business criteria and are assessed on a competitive basis. NEIS participants are generally required to work towards the establishment of a full-time business. For DSP customers this full-time self-employment requirement has been relaxed to 20 hours per week. DEWRSB has advised that 236 people in receipt of DSP participated in the NEIS programme from the start of Job Network on 1 May 1998 up until 2 June 2001. Further questions about NEIS should be directed to the Minister for Employment Services.",125,Questions On Notice
256,Mr Anthony,"The Minister for Community Services has provided the following answerWork Place Modifications Scheme Since February 2001 people with disabilities who participate in NEIS may also be able to access the Workplace Modifications Scheme. This Department of Family and Community Services (FaCS) program assists with the cost of workplace modifications, or special or adaptive equipment for people with a disability, including those aiming to achieve self-employment through the NEIS program. There are no plans to offer further specific incentives for Disability Support Pension (DSP) recipients to achieve self-employment in addition to current programs that exist for this purpose. Small Business: Registered Automotive Workshop Scheme (Question No. 2604) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 4 June 2001: (1) Will small businesses importing only several vehicles each year to convert to right-hand drive have to close down their businesses due to the costs imposed by the Registered Automotive Workshop Scheme. (2) Will he put in place measures to assist small businesses to remain viable. (1) No. (2) The Registered Automotive Workshop Scheme is designed to facilitate the importation and supply of a number of specialist and enthusiast vehicles. The concessions currently in place to assist small businesses in the low volume scheme will also be applied to the Registered Automotive Workshop Scheme. These concessions are: exemption from the $12,000 per vehicle special duty applied to full volume used imported passenger cars exemption from the expensive destructive vehicle crash testing required to comply with vehicle standards at time the vehicle was built rather than at date of importation as for full volume suppliers. Airports: Environmental Management (Question No. 2613) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 4 June 2001: (1) Further to his answer to part (3) of question No. 2312 (Hansard, 22 May 2001, page 25772), what is his definition of the term ‘environmental capacity’ for Australian airports. (2) Further to his answer to part (4) of question No. 2312, will he, under his definition for environmental capacity, be capable of quantifying the environmental capacity for Sydney Airport; if not, what steps does he consider necessary for the calculation of environmental capacity for Australian airports.

Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Sale (Question No. 2621) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 4 June 2001: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 2320 (Hansard, 22 May 2001, page 26741) and Part2 of the Airports Act, is he able to say whether no provision in the Act has been made to accommodate the scenario where a person who is an airport-lessee and/or airport management company may be totally owned and/or controlled or be part thereof to a parent company or other person, with a controlling interest (defined as shareholdings therein of greater than fifteen per cent) in more than one Australian airport. (2) In light of the airport-lessees and airport management companies that already operate other Australian airports, is there a scenario where parent companies or other persons may have a controlling interest in more than one of Australia’s airport lessee companies and airport management companies. (3) In light of the corporate structure of other airport lessee and airport management companies already in place, what steps will he take to ensure that the current leasing regime of Australian airports does not become monopolistic in nature or an oligopoly of private interests. (4) Are Australian airports a strategic asset with military and other implications that must be controlled in both national and public interest. (5) Is he able to say whether the potential for monopolistic control of airport lessee and airport management companies by parent controlling interests constitutes a potential breach of Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act. (6) Is he also able to say whether the potential for monopolistic control of airport lessee and airport management companies by parent controlling interests does not constitute a potential breach of Part2 of the Airports Act and hence constitutes a policy conflict with Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act in that it permits parent control of airport lessee and airport management companies whilst exposing these companies to potential intervention by the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission for breach of Part IIIA. (1), (2), (3), (5) and (6) The Airports Act 1996 contains quantitative cross ownership restrictions that encompass an objective test of a 15% maximum stake in either of the respective paired airports (Sydney-Melbourne, Sydney-Brisbane and Sydney-Perth). This means the same parent entity can not hold a stake more than 15% in either of the paired airports. The policy underpinning this provision is the diversity of ownership and control of certain major airports, thereby ensuring that neither monopolistic control nor an ‘oligopoly of private interests’ arises at these airports after the Sydney Airport sale. (4) The Government recognises that many of the leased Federal airports are of strategic importance to Australia. Some are Australia’s aviation gateways to the world, while most of the others are the principal points of access to the regions they serve. The ownership and control provisions of the Airports Act, particularly those relating to crossownership with respect to the major four airports (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth), address the national and public interest. They do this by promoting the economic development of the leased airports in a way that is responsive to the interests of users and the region in which those airports are located These provisions also ensure that commercially-driven decisions are made about maintaining existing infrastructure and building new infrastructure.",127,Questions On Notice

A substantial number of applications due for rejection are withdrawn and therefore will not show in the rejected figures. (2) (a) and (b) The Ministerial “Guidelines for granting licences and permits to engage in Australia’s domestic shipping trade” states that the criteria for the issuing of permits are as follows: “Single and Continuing Voyage Permits Permits, either a single voyage permit (SVP) or a continuing voyage permit (CVP) may be issued to unlicensed vessels to engage in a trade between ports where: (a) no licensed ship is available for the service; or (b) that the service as carried out by the licensed ships is inadequate; and the Minister is satisfied that it is in the public interest to allow an unlicensed ship to engage in that trade.” (3) The Department contacts all relevant licensed vessel operators or trade managers to determine the availability of licensed vessels. The availability of licensed vessels is determined on a case by case basis and would include consideration of such factors as whether a licensed ship can meet the supply, production, or service obligations that necessitate the making of the application. Technical characteristics will also be relevant, such as, the vessel capacity, its adequacy in terms of cargo compatibility (eg contamination), its draft, and any port or loading restrictions. The public interest is assessed for each permit application on the merits of the case. In the case of tankers and dry bulk vessels satisfactory inspection reports are required to satisfy the public interest test. These inspection reports are forwarded to AMSA to verify that all documents are in order. (4) In each case the permit applications were refused because of the availability of licensed vessels. Applicants are generally well aware of the requirements for granting permits as detailed in the “Guidelines for granting licences and permits to engage in Australia’s domestic shipping trade”. Accordingly, we would not generally expect applicants to seek permits for vessels that do not meet these requirements.",128,Questions On Notice

(2) What was the average number of crew for Australian flagged vessels for each of the years referred to in part (1). (3) How many Australian seafarers were employed in the industry in each of those years. (4) How many Australian trained seafarers were employed on Australian flagged vessels in each of those years. (1) The Commonwealth Government collects information on major trading vessels, defined as vessels over 2,000 deadweight tonnes. This size of vessels performs the bulk of the coastal trade task. Information on smaller vessels, which are often intrastate traders and hence the responsibility of respective State or Territory jurisdictions, is not comprehensively collected by the Commonwealth. (a) As at 30 June 1996 there were 38 Australian registered vessels of over 2,000 deadweight tonnes that were classified as coastal trading vessels. (b) As at 30 June 1997 there were 38 Australian registered vessels of over 2,000 deadweight tonnes that were classified as coastal trading vessels. (c) The number of Australian registered vessels of over 2,000 deadweight tonnes that were classified as coastal trading vessels as at 30 June 1998 is not available due to change in the data collection regime. The change was effected to save costs. (d) As at 30 June 1999 there were 41 Australian registered vessels of over 2,000 deadweight tonnes that were classified as coastal trading vessels. (e) The number of Australian registered vessels of over 2,000 deadweight tonnes that were classified as coastal trading vessels as at 30 June 2000 is not yet available. (f) The number of Australian registered vessels of over 2,000 deadweight tonnes that were classified as coastal trading vessels as at 31 December 2000 is not yet available. (2) Crew numbers are not collected by the Commonwealth. Providing safety requirements are met, the size of a crew is a negotiable item between seafarers and ship operators. A typical large trading vessel would have a crew of 17. (3) Australian Bureau of Statistics’ employment data for the Water Transport industry (defined as international sea transport, coastal water transport and inland water transport) for the period is as follows: February 1995 9,900 persons February 1996 9,400 persons February 1997 12,700 persons February 1998 9,800 persons February 1999 11,600 persons February 2000 14,100 persons February 2001 13,900 persons (4) The Australian Maritime Safety Authority is responsible for ensuring that crew qualifications meet required standards.

262,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) What are the terms of reference of the Government’s study into military-like activities and access to firearm training for Defence Force Cadets. (2) Will the study include an expert assessment of the likely health and safety implications of any expansion of allowable cadet activities; if so, from what sources will this expert assessment be obtained. (3) What deadline has the Government set for the completion of the report. (4) What formal consultation, if any, is envisaged with (a) cadet units, (b) youth organisations, (c) school and parent organisations, (d) State and Territory governments and (e) other Commonwealth agencies. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The terms of reference are: As part of the training activities conducted in a military environment, Australian Defence Force (ADF) Cadets currently participate in military-like training exercises and undertake voluntary military firearms handling and firing under ADF supervision on Commonwealth facilities, particularly during annual camps. ADF Cadets also access innocuous versions of military firearms for use in drill training and for ceremonial occasions in public. Recommendation 12 of the Cadets: The Future Review report recommended that: a. The present policy and practices concerning weapons access and use, and cadet involvement in military-like activities be thoroughly reviewed in a liberal direction, in light of the findings and advice of this Review. b. Responsible and practicable ways be found to make available to cadets closely supervised access to military rifles and to firing them, and bearing innocuous versions of them in public ceremonial, involving more substantial preparation, qualification, and use of Cadets staff. c. A protocol be developed to enable cadet participation in simulated Service activities such as infantry minor tactics in the field at levels suited to individual Cadet units and to an extent acceptable to their communities of immediate interest. The Cadets: The Future Review report at paragraph 5.71 also indicated that, in addressing the recommendation, consideration should be given to exploring the use of local ranges and shooting clubs [for firearms firing and handling]. Defence has accepted the theme of this recommendation and associated guidance and has agreed that: cadet exposure to, and participation in, military-like activities be enhanced; military firearms firing and handling training under ADF supervision be extended to ensure as many cadets as possible voluntarily experience this training; sufficient numbers of innocuous firearms be made available for cadet training and ceremonial use; and the feasibility of delivering some types of voluntary cadet firearms training through registered rifle clubs be assessed. The Government has endorsed the Defence position and directed that a report be submitted for Government consideration by 31 Aug 01. Prior to submission to Government, the report will need to be considered by higher-level Defence Committee(s).

Aviation: Australian Standards Committee (Question No. 2660) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: (1) Does Airservices Australia Officer Mr Lee Kenna sit as chair of the Australian Standards Committee EV11. (2) Did Mr Mike Mrdak of his Department write, as Airport Operations and more recently as Assistant Secretary, to the EV11 Committee stating objection to the word unacceptable in the standard AS2021, indicating a preference for the replacement terminology developments not permitted; if so, (a) why and (b) did he instruct Mr Mrdak to take that action; if so, why. (3) Has Mr Kenna written and stated in the EV11 Committee of August 2000 that the word unacceptable as is used in the present Standard is emotional and should be changed; if so, (a) why was action taken to change the word, (b) did he instruct Mr Kenna to take that action; if so, why and (c) will such a change adversely affect the interest of public health and safety. (1) to (3) In March 2000 my Department released a discussion paper entitled ‘Expanding Ways to Describe and Assess Aircraft Noise’. On page 55 of the paper, under Section 7.3 ‘Review and revision of Australian Standard AS2021’, it is stated, amongst other things, that ‘In the first instance it is considered important that the wording ‘acceptable’ and ‘unacceptable’ in the Standard be replaced by more objective terms such as ‘no building restrictions’ or ‘building not permitted/recommended’. As discussed at a number of points in this paper, what is considered ‘acceptable’ by the Standard is not necessarily ‘acceptable’ to the individual.’ My Department has drawn this proposal to the attention of Standards Australia. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Costs (Question No. 2661) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: (1) Are the full social and environmental costs of the impacts of Sydney Airport operations met by Government or the aviation industry; if not, is any cost borne by Sydney residents. (2) In terms of annual aircraft movements and aircraft mix, what is the maximum possible operational capacity for Sydney Airports two parallel runways. (3) Is he able to say whether the two parallel runways at Minneapolis St Paul International Airport are (a) 8200ft and 10000ft, respectively, in length; if not, what are their lengths and (b) separated by 3380ft; if so, by how much do these measurements differ from the length and separation of the two parallel runways at Sydney Airport. (4) Have representatives directly or indirectly answerable to him visited Minneapolis St Paul airport; if so, (a) which representatives and (b) what were the (i) dates and (ii) purposes of the visits. (5) Is he able to say whether almost 500 000 aircraft movements were achieved during 1997 on the two parallel runways at Minneapolis St Paul International Airport with minimal use of the east west cross runway; if not, what was the number of movements on those two runways. (6) Is he able to say whether in June 1997 the published typical runway use percentages by runways at Minneapolis St Paul were, respectively, (a) over the north on north short parallel 16L/30R27.6% landings and 22.1% takeoffs, (b) over the south on north long parallel 16R/30L21.4% landings and 25.9% takeoffs, (c) over the east on east west cross runway 4/221.2% landings and 0.3% takeoffs and (d) over the west on east west cross runway 4/220.5% landings and 3.8% takeoffs; if not what are the correct percentages.",130,Questions On Notice
263,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(7) Is he able to say whether in peak hours, in both wet and fine weather, aircraft movements at Minneapolis St Paul International Airport and Lambert St Louis International Airport achieve levels of 120 movements per hour using two parallel runways which are virtually identical to those at Sydney Airport. (8) Is he able to say whether (a) the Precision Runway Monitor System (PRMS) is used at Minneapolis St Paul, (b) the PRMS was part of the 1993 capacity enhancement plan for that airport and (c) full implementation of the PRMS at operational airport capacity would increase Sydney Airports environmental impact on affected Sydney residents. (9) Is he able to say whether (a) the removal of small aircraft from Minneapolis St Paul International Airport was part of the 1993 capacity enhancement plan for that airport and (b) such removal of small planes is also proposed for Sydney Airport. (10) Is he also able to say whether (a) according to airport data published by the Federal Aviation Administration, new angled runway 17/35 at Minneapolis St Paul will lift the forecast capacity of that airport to 685 000 movements per year and (b) a fourth, angled, runway was proposed in December 2000 for Sydney Airport. (1) It would be appreciated if the Honourable Member could clarify his question. (2) The number of aircraft movements at Sydney Airport is constrained by the limitations imposed by the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997 and the Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995. (3) to (10) The Honourable Member may wish to view the Minneapolis St Paul International airport website at http://www.mspairport.com This site has details on the airport layout and operations. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Aircraft Movements (Question No. 2662) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: Is Sydney Airport capable, or can be technically made capable, of handling up to 500 000 aircraft movements per annum on the two existing parallel runways and would this increase be contingent upon any additional measures being implemented; if so, what are those contingencies. The number of aircraft movements at Sydney Airport is constrained by the limitations imposed by the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997 and the Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995. Sydney: Aviation Safety (Question No. 2664) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: What contingency plans are in place to respond to a jet aircraft crash in populated areas of the Sydney metropolitan area and will he table these details to the House. Emergency response, including to a major civil aviation disaster, is the prime responsibility of State and Territory Governments. The NSW State Government has plans to respond to major civil air accidents within the State. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Long Term Operating Plan (Question No. 2667) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: (1) Further to his response to question No. 2307 (Hansard, 23 May 2001, page 25926), was he incorrect when he stated that the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) will be fully implemented; if not, how will the advertised target of 17% movements (annually averaged) over the north be achieved and maintained in the long-term as annual aircraft movements are increasing and given that since",134,Report Timings

265,Mr Anderson,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,135,Report Timings
266,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:LTOP was introduced, 17% of movements (annually averaged) over the north has never been achieved at current aircraft movement rates. (2) Have LTOP targets not been achieved at 300 000 movements per annum and is meaningful noise sharing technically impossible to achieve at movement levels above 360 000 per annum on two parallel runways such as those at Sydney Airport. (3) Are only parallel runway operations used at rates of 80 aircraft movements an hour at Sydney Airport. (4) Did the LTOP road show video, as presented by the Hon Joe Hockey, MP and a representative of Airservices Australia, advertise that 40% of the aircraft using Sydney Airport will be propeller planes. (5) Will he table a copy of the LTOP road show video and the full text of that videos script as presented at each of the six LTOP road shows. (1) No. I refer the Honourable Member to my answer to part (2) of question No. 2307. (2) I am advised that it is expected that growth at the Airport will tend to be focussed on the peak hours. Therefore there will continue to be less busy periods at the Airport when the noise sharing modes involving the east-west runway can be used. (3) Movement rates of 80 per hour are only achievable using parallel runway modes. (4) Approximately 40% of the runway movements at the Airport during the year 2000 were in non-jet aircraft. (5) It has not been possible to readily locate the requested information. I am not prepared to devote significant resources to retrieve information when no need for that information has been justified. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Noise (Question No. 2670) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: (1) Further to his response to part (5) of question No. 2316 (Hansard, 23 May 2001, page 25928), were a proportion of the 1.5 million Sydney residents exposed to road traffic noise levels exceeding the World Health Organisations (WHO) community noise guidelines also exposed to aircraft noise levels in excess of the WHO community noise guidelines; if so, how many. (2) Further to the map of aircraft noise exposure shown on page 204 of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney, how many persons live (a) within the area bounded by the 10% moderately affected contour, (b) between the 10% and 20% moderately affected contours and (c) in the 20% and above moderately affected contour. (3) How many people are expected to be exposed to aircraft noise equal to or exceeding 30 Aircraft Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF) in 2010 and what arrangements have been made regarding the provision of adequate noise mitigation. (4) Was the decision not to provide noise amelioration for residences in the 25 ANEF to 30 ANEF contour made in the full knowledge of well-documented evidence, including the existence of the Cornell University’s Professor Gary Evans studies, that have identified potential health risks and learning problems for children living in residences subject to such noise levels. (5) Further to his response to part (7) of question 2316, (a) how many residences were occupied by the 100,000 persons who were exposed to noise equal to or in excess of 20 ANEF from 1 July to 30 September 2000 and (b) was every residence within the 20 ANEI contour for 1 July to 30 September 2000 occupied by at least one person. (1), (2), (3) and (5) The detailed information sought in these questions is not available. (4) The decision not to provide amelioration for residences in the 25 ANEF to 30 ANEF was made by a Labor Government in 1994 when the Sydney Airport Noise Amelioration Program was established.",135,Report Timings

268,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Roads: Western Sydney Orbital (Question No. 2685) Mr Price asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: (1) Has any agreement been reached about the toll associated with construction of the Western Sydney Orbital Road. (2) Will there be three tolls on this road; if so, what is the estimated amount of each toll. (1) Yes. (2) The level of tolls for various classes of vehicle and for use of the road over different distances will be addressed in the context of the contract to build and operate the road. Australian Defence Force: Reserves (Question No. 2700) Mr Murphy asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 19 June 2001: (1) Have approximately 1.1 million men and women served in the Australian Reserve Forces between 1948 and 1998. (2) Will he consider awarding a service or commemorative medal to these men and women; if not, why not. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The figure of 1.1 million is a cumulative figure over time based on an average strength of 22,000 people serving in the Australian Reserve Forces each year over the period. The number who actually served over the period was more in the order of about 500,000, most of who served in the Citizen Military Forces and later, the Army Reserve. To find the exact number who served over the period would require extensive research through the archives. Defence does not have the capacity to undertake such a task. (2) The issue of special recognition for service by way of new and unique medals was raised during the 1993/94 Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards (CIDA). CIDA noted that Reserve Force personnel were eligible for the same range of campaign, bravery and distinguished service awards as members of the regular services. It is Government policy that medals be reserved for the recognition of service in military operations and other activities clearly and markedly more demanding and hazardous than normal. Defence duty such as training and day-to-day unit tasks may at times be onerous, but is normal peacetime service and is not recognised by the award of a medal. Peacetime service in the Defence Force, except for meritorious service or the established 15 years for long service, does not warrant a service medal. Any such award would not be within the intent of the Australian Honours and Awards System. Additionally, normal service rendered outside operations is considered ordinary duty. Regular personnel performing the same duties do not qualify for any special award. Accordingly, the Government believes, and in line with the parameters outlined above, that the introduction of a service medal to recognise service solely for being in the Reserve Forces is not warranted. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Long Term Operating Plan (Question No. 2716) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 20 June 2001: (1) Further to part (4) of the answer to question No. 2509 (Hansard, 7 June 2001, page 27669) will the lessee of Sydney Airport be bound to the implementation of the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) for Sydney Airport. (2) Will Airservices Australia be contractually or commercially liable should the full implementation of LTOP conflict with profitability of airport operations in the hands of the lessee.",136,Report Timings
269,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) What foreseeable legal rights will the lessee have in order to prevent the full implementation of the LTOP. (4) Further to part (6) of the answer to question No. 2509, will he table in this House a copy of the findings of the Precision Runway Monitor Trial when the findings from the trial of the system are finalised; if so, when. (1) and (3) The implementation of LTOP will not be affected by the sale of Sydney Airport. I refer the Honourable Member to my answer to part (4) of question No. 2509. (2) The lease of the Airport will have no effect on the Direction given to Airservices Australia by the then Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon John Sharp MP, in July 1997 to implement LTOP. (4) The report on the Precision Runway Monitor Trial is a matter for the Environment Minister. Australian Defence Force: Suicide (Question No. 2722) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 21 June 2001: (1) How many serving Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel committed suicide in (a) 1996, (b) 1997, (c) 1998, (d) 1999 and (e) 2000. (2) Has Defence conducted any analysis of the suicide rate for (a) the ADF, (b) each Service and (c) individual Defence Units, compared to the general Australian population of a similar age; if so, what were the findings of the analysis. (3) Does the ADF maintain consistent data on (a) suicide attempts and gestures and (b) other forms of self-harm by serving personnel. (4) Does Defence provide any primary prevention programs to combat suicide and self harm amongst serving personnel; if so, what funding will be available for such programs in 2001-2002. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) (a)10 (b) 9 (c) 9 (d) 8 (e) 7 (2) (a)Yes (b) Yes (c) No Findings The ADF Health Status Report (2000) concluded that suicides were the third leading cause of death (behind natural causes and motor vehicle accidents) and accounted for 17% of deaths for permanent ADF members between 1994 and 1998. Per 10,000 personnel the rates of suicide were 1.1, 1.5, and 1.0 for Navy, Army and Air Force respectively. As a percentage of all deaths these rates transcribe to 19%, 15% and 18%. The 1998 Australian death rate for suicide in males aged 15-54 years was 31.5 per 100,000 and the average suicide death rate for ADF males (17-55 years) was 15.3 per 100,000 over the period 1994 to 1998. Although the ADF suicide death rate was lower than the Australian population rate, the smaller number of ADF suicides and the different socio-economic structure of the ADF make it difficult to draw any valid comparisons between the rates of the two populations. In 2000, Defence Health Service Branch staff analysed data on suicide and suicide related behaviour in the ADF between 1985 to 2000. The rate of suicide from 1985 to 2000 for the Navy and Army was 16.3 per 100,000 and Air Force was 10.9 per 100,000 personnel. This data was compared to the suicide rate for the Australian population, controlling for differences in population sizes. It was found that in the 15-24 year old age group the male ADF suicide rate is comparable",137,Report Timings
270,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:to the Australian population. For the 25-44 year old age group the overall ADF male suicide rate is significantly less than the Australian rate. The average rate of suicides for female ADF members over a five year period (1994-1999) was 8.1 per 100,000 females per year. It is not statistically valid to compare this rate to the wider Australian community female rate due to the very small numbers involved. Comparison between the Australian population suicide rates and Defence suicide rates was only conducted for all male suicides in the age ranges of 15-24 and 24-44. The relatively small numbers of suicides per individual Service makes it very difficult to conduct any valid statistical comparisons. (3) (a)Yes (b) YesA surveillance system is maintained in accordance with National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines. (4) Several primary prevention initiatives have been developed within the ADF to combat suicide and self-harm. Presently these initiatives are being developed and conducted within current resources. Australian Defence Force: Service Medals (Question No. 2723) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 21 June 2001: (1) In respect to his media release of 30 August 2000 headed “42,000 new medal entitlements for South East Asian Service 1955-75”, on what date did the Government submit the relevant instruments for the new awards to the Governor General and what was the cause of the delay in doing so. (2) How many applications has Defence received to date for the award of the (a) Imperial General Service Medal 1915-62 (Clasp Malaya), (b) Imperial General Service Medal (Clasp Borneo), (c) Australian Active Service Medal 1945-75 (Clasp Malaya), (d) Australian Active Service Medal 1945-75 (Clasp Malaysia) and (e) the Australian Service Medal 1945-75 (Clasp SE Asia). (3) How many applicants, if any, have actually been awarded each of the medals referred to in part (2). (4) Since the 1998 election, has the Government provided any additional resources to the Medals Section of each respective Service to cope with additional medal entitlements; if so, what are the details; if not, what action is the Government taking to improve the processing of medal applications. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The recommendations of the Review of Service Entitlement Anomalies in Respect of South-East Asian Service 1955-75 (SEA Review) resulted in numerous Medals Instruments requiring drafting or amendment during the implementation process. These Instruments required detailed legal assessment and clearance by both the Chief of the Defence Force and the Minister prior to final approval by the Governor General. The Government submitted these Instruments to the Governor General on 6 March 2001. (2) The Service Medals Sections do not keep a tally of the number of applications received for specific medals as most applicants do not necessarily know exactly which medals they are entitled to. Generally, applications consist of requests for medals entitlement to be reviewed in light of the SEA Review and are counted as such. Accordingly, the numbers of applications received to date by each Service Medals Section as a result of the SEA Review are as follows: Navy Medals Section: 3067 Army Medals Section: 2920 Air Force Medals Section: 2235 Total: 8222 (3) (a) Imperial General Service Medal 1915-62 (Clasp Malaya): 0 (b) Imperial General Service Medal (Clasp Borneo): 29 (c) Australian Active Service Medal 1945-75 (Clasp Malaya): 603 (d) Australian Active Service Medal 1945-75 (Clasp Malaysia) 404 (e) Australian Service Medal 1945-75 (Clasp SE Asia) 1693 (4) Yes. Since the 1998 election, the Service Medals Sections have been working overtime to reduce the backlog of applications. Overtime ceased on June 2000 and resumed on April 2001 after the Governor General’s approval of the medals Instruments was gained. To assist with the workload, the Army Medals Section has been provided with additional staff in the form of one APS4 and four APS2 level personnel. Arrangements are currently being made to provide the Navy Medals Section with two APS3s and two APS2s. One APS3 and two APS2s are being provided to the Air Force Medals Section. Additionally, to cope with the applications that will be generated from the introduction of the new Anniversary of National Service 1951-1972 Medal, arrangements are also being made to employ two additional ASPS3s and two APS2s. Health: Deep Vein Thrombosis (Question No. 2735) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 21 June 2001: Is his Department undertaking, arranging to be conducted, or participating in the preparation of, any studies or research into the prevention of Deep Vein Thrombosis; if so (a) what is the research or study, (b) who is doing the work, (c) how much is it costing, (d) how were they selected to do that work and (e) will it be released to the public; if so, when; if not, why not. Yes. (a) The study will quantify the risk of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) associated with air travel. (b) The Department of Health and Aged Care, in association with Professor C D’ArcyJ Holman, University of Western Australia. (c) $100,000. (d) I sought advice from the Minister for Health and Aged Care and he advised doing an interim study using Commonwealth data and resources to establish whether there is a connection between DVT and air travel. As the data is owned by the Commonwealth it was not feasible to call tenders. (e) Once the study is completed and refereed by suitable qualified scientists, it will be published in a scientific journal. Australian Electoral Commission: Enrolments (Question No. 2746) Mr Danby asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 25 June 2001: (1) How many voters registered in the 7 day period after the (a) 1998 federal election and (b) 1999 Constitutional Referendum were announced. (2) Is it the view of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) that most of these voters were 17 and 18 year olds and were first time voters. (3) Is it a fact that 40% of 18 year olds failed to register prior to the recent Queensland election. (4) What measures or programs does the Government or the AEC have to encourage young people to participate and register in Australia for elections. (5) At every federal election since 1983, how many new voters registered in the 5 working days grace that they were given after the announcement of the election. (6) How many voters were excluded at the 1983 federal election when the rolls were closed on the day the election was announced.",138,Report Timings
271,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(7) Is the Minister able to say whether the proposal to close the electoral role on the day an election is announced was contained in the Liberal Party submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters prior to its inquiry into the integrity of the electoral roll. (8) Is the AEC projecting that nearly 80 000 first time voters would use the 5 day period of grace when the next federal election is announced to register to vote. ourable member’s question: (1)(a) For the seven days from the issue of writs to the close of rolls for the 1998 federal election, 351,410 electoral enrolment forms were received and processed. (1)(b) For the seven days from the issue of writs to the close of rolls for the 1999 referendum, 302,696 electoral enrolment forms were received and processed. (2) No. Approximately 80% of the enrolment forms received were from electors already enrolled who were notifying a change of address or from electors re-enrolling following their removal from the roll by objection action. Approximately 20% of enrolment forms received were from new or first time enrollees, with a total of 64,219 at the 1998 election and 69,318 at the 1999 referendum. Of the first time enrollees, the AEC estimates that 75% were from electors aged between 18 and 25 (50% from 18 year olds, 10% from 19 year olds and 15% from electors aged 20–25 years of age). At the 1998 federal election there were 174,502 18 year old electors on the roll (an estimated participation rate of 70%) and 197,028 19 year olds (estimated 80% participation). (3) Yes. At the close of rolls for the 2001 Queensland State election there were 27 959 eighteen year old electors enrolled, an estimated 59% of the eligible population. Of these, 9,955 enrolled for the first time between the announcement of the election and the close of rolls. By polling day for the State election, an additional 1,200 provisionally enrolled electors had turned 18 years of age and were entitled to vote. A further 9,195 eighteen year old first time enrollees (from a total of 16,864 new enrollees) had lodged enrolment forms but were not entitled to vote, as they had missed the close of rolls. (As background, the AEC’s Queensland Head Office undertook a major Continuous Roll Update (CRU) mailing of enrolment reminder and roll review letters on Monday 22 January 2001. The Queensland State election was announced unexpectedly on the following day with rolls closing at 5pm Monday 29 January 2001. With the timing of the election announcement just before the Australia Day long weekend, a significant number of responses to the CRU mailout, or voluntary enrolments in response to State Election publicity, were not received in time for the close of rolls at 5.00pm on the Monday. As detailed above, many of the enrolment forms received too late were from young people.) (4) The AEC undertakes a range of youth communication activities and programs during federal elections and referendums and on an ongoing basis, with the objective of increasing public knowledge and awareness of 18–24 year olds in order to maximise effective participation in the electoral process. The AEC operates Electoral Education Centres in Canberra, Melbourne and Adelaide, undertaking educational tours and conducting mock elections for visiting school groups. Electoral Education trainers explain the importance and purpose of enrolment and voting to visiting school groups. The AEC conducts a number of Continuous Roll Update (CRU) programs which specifically target young people. At the national level, the AEC conducts monthly data matches with their roll management system and Centrelink data on 17 and 18 year olds. As a result of this CRU activity 17 and 18 year olds who are incorrectly enrolled, or who are not enrolled, are mailed an AEC enrolment card. As a component of the federal election advertising campaign, television and radio ‘youth’ advertisements are developed and placed heavily in the mass media during the close of rolls week to encourage young people to enrol. A range of public relations activities targeted at young people is also undertaken on an ongoing basis and during the election period. Public relations activities include placement of editorials in ‘youth’ publications, information displays at university enrolment days and careers markets, promotion of enrolment through FM and TripleJ radio, and heavy promotion of the AEC web site. (5) The number of first time voters who lodged enrolment forms in the seven days between issue of writs and close of rolls for the following elections is set out below. Statistics for first time voters are not available for prior elections.",140,Report Timings
272,Mr Fahey,"The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the hon1998 64,219 1996 77,545 1993 88,408 (6) The AEC advises that there are no statistics or estimates available as to the number of electors who were unable to enrol for the 1983 federal election due to the immediate close of rolls, that is prior to the introduction of the seven day enrolment period following the issue of the writs. (7) I understand that copies of submissions to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matter’s inquiries are available from the Committee and some submissions are available electronically through its website. I am advised that the Liberal Party submission is available electronically on the Committee’s website. (8) The AEC cannot predict accurately the close of rolls transactions which might occur at the forthcoming federal election. Based on experience at the close of rolls for the last 3 federal elections, it is likely that there will be 300,000–400,000 enrolment forms received during the seven days between issue of writs and close of rolls, including up to 80,000 first time enrolments. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Flight Paths (Question No. 2751) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 26 June 2001: (1) Further to part (1) of the answer to question No. 2442, (Hansard, 25 June 2001, page 28541) did the former Minister for Transport state during the second reading speech on the Airports Bill (Hansard, 29 May 1996, page 1658) that the Government would not sell the airports until such time as they had been able to satisfactorily resolve Sydneys aircraft noise problems. (2) Is the sale of Sydney Airport conditional upon satisfactory resolution of Sydney’s aircraft noise problems. (3) Further to part (3) of the answer to question No. 2442, is the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) for Sydney Airport a gazetted plan, including the gazetted LTOP target of 17% of all movements to the north of that airport. (4) Will he furnish reasons why the implementation of the LTOP has proved difficult to achieve; if so, what are those reasons. (1) During the debate on the Airports Bill a former Minister for Transport made a statement consistent with that contained in the question. (2) I refer the Honourable Member to my answer to part (1) of question No. 2307. (3) No. (4) The Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) has been substantially implemented with the exception of a small number of elements. For example, the restructuring of the arrival airspace has yet to be implemented. This includes implementation of the “trident” and “power-off” approaches. A number of complexities associated with safety and operational constraints have impinged on the implementation of this part of the Plan. Australian Electoral Commission: Enrolments (Question No. 2754) Mr Danby asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 26 June 2001: (1) Is it a fact that around 350 000 voters, including first time voters and those who have recently changed their addresses, registered or re-registered to vote in the five working days after the last federal election was called. (2) At every federal election since 1983, how many voters have registered or re-registered in the five working days grace that they were given after the announcement of the election. (3) How many voters were excluded or voted in the wrong electorate at the 1983 federal elections when the Fraser government closed the rolls on the day the election was announced.",141,Report Timings
273,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) Is the Australian Electoral Commission projecting that nearly 350 000 first time voters and voters who have recently changed their address would use this 5 day period of grace when the next election is announced to register to vote. ourable member’s question: The answers to the honourable Member’s question are contained in my response to Question No. 2746 of 25 June 2001. Australian Defence Force: Personnel Accommodation (Question No. 2779) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 28 June 2001: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1858 (Hansard, 4 October 2000, page 20855), did the Government announce in the Budget that it is now proposing to sell the Endeavour House Accommodation Complex at Coogee and Lady Gowrie House; if so, when is it proposed to sell these sites. (2) Is there a link between this decision and the review of below standard live-in accommodation for single defence personnel; if so, what is the nature of the link. (3) How many defence personnel were living at (a) Endeavour House and (b) Lady Gowrie House as at (i) 4 October 2000, (ii) 22 May 2001 and (iii) 28 June 2001. (4) In the event of these properties being sold, (a) what alternative housing arrangements will be made for the defence personnel who currently live there and (b) what proportion of the sale proceeds, if any, will be made available to improve the state of live-in accommodation for single personnel. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Subject to the outcome of the review of accommodation for single Australian Defence Force (ADF) members, the Government has identified Endeavour Hostel and Lady Gowrie house for sale in 2001/02. The properties will not be sold until any revised accommodation policy has been agreed and announced. (2) Yes. The review is investigating future options for providing accommodation assistance for single ADF members in all localities.
