This leads us to the inevitable which produced results inversely related to the question of what tax avoidance means. That is, in width of the provisions used. The Bill confines the a sense, at the very heart of this debate. It is a term concept of tax benefits to omission of assessable that takes on a different meaning according to income and the creation of allowable deductions. who is using it. It is a fundamental role of Part The Opposition's amendments would make it IVA to spell out objectively what schemes the new cover any saving of income tax, and thus bring regeneral measures will strike at.

That statement leave it to the courts to see for themselves the said: basic objective that the Government believes is apparent from the substantive terms of Part IVA. Our basic approach is different from the present Government's in that we believe that the most blatant schemes can The Opposition's amendments imply wider best be dealt with by specific retrospective legislation, leaving definitions of 'tax benefit', 'schemes', and 'tax more ambiguous arrangements to be picked up by broad discretionary provisions. avoidance purposes'. It is a matter of judgment, of course, as to the desirable width of these terms The Opposition has it in mind to use retrospection and as to how far parliament ought to go in defiagainst blatant schemes and Part IVA against arning them. This, of course, bears very much upon rangements of the tax planning type in which tax saving is a significant but, apparently, not a domiOne other comment I make on the Opposition's nant purpose. The Government takes issue on amendments is that I do not believe there is a need that point. We believe general anti-avoidance profor a scheme to be treated as being void in the revisions ought to be reserved for schemes of the construction process.

In other words, a general anti-avoidance the Government, to be enough.

I have An important element of the Opposition's stated now over a period of some two years that amendments seeks to strengthen the legislation by the purposes of the Government in this area are giving the Commissioner a discretion to decide twofold: Firstly, to get an effective anti-avoidance whether a tax benefit has been, or might in the provision and, secondly, to have an antifuture be, obtained, and whether the relevant tax avoidance provision that does not get in the way avoidance purpose is present.

In rejecting the Opposition's On the whole, the Government prefers to avoid amendments-I hope I do not do so in any arbidiscretions and to leave key questions for determitrary fashion, but rather in recognition of a comnation as a matter of application of the law to monality of approach and a desire to achieve the establish facts. Some people are concerned about same objective, certainly so far as general, antipenalty provisions in the Bill.

I becretion would, in our view, raise even more lieve the Government's proposal more likely will difficult issues and concerns, having regard to the achieve the twin objectives that I described earlier presence of the penalty provisions in the Bill. and, therefore, it, is warmly commended to the Committee. There has been some talk by Opposition Dr THEOPHANOUS (Burke) (4.56)-In the members-in support of the Opposition's last few years the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) has esamendments-that the amendments would more tablished himself as a man of good will on this effectively do away with the choice principle. I do question of trying to cut out tax avoidance.

It is for this reason directed. In fact, as already noted, the use of and in this spirit that I believe the Opposition's unduly wide definitions of 'tax benefits', 'scheme' amendments ought to be seriously considered. and 'tax avoidance purpose' could run the risk that the choice principle could get a new lease of In particular, I believe that the proposed Object life and would not be abolished. Indeed, it and interpretation of Part clause is a very importwas-as the Committee knows-through the use ant one. The Treasurer said that the amendment of wide and uncertain expressions in section 260 is unnecessary because amendments to the Acts that the choice principle emerged in the first Interpretation Act have been passed in another instance. place. He said that this Act will direct the courts to interpret the Bill in relation to its general antito avoid taxation even if the Commissioner were avoidance intention. But there is no guarantee satisfied that it was the dominant purpose. In that that the courts will be directed in the way in situation people would be able to avoid tax.

If he was trying to reflect encouraged. One has to accept that the intentions on the Opposition on this point let me say quite of the Treasurer have been frustrated from time clearly that the Opposition does not want to put to time by determinations of the High Court in in jeopardy ordinary business dealings and these matters. I am not as confident as the especially in small business. But at the same time Treasurer is.

The Treasurer said that the Australian people. the Opposition wants retrospectivity in respect of obvious schemes of tax avoidance and that the The Treasurer did not satisfy me with his reOpposition also wants retrospectivity in other sponse about the role of the Commissioner of shady areas which may not be so obvious and in Taxation.

That is completely correct. been tax avoidance in the first instance. Of course, We do want retrospectivity to apply to obvious we recognise that this discretionary power would schemes. The Treasurer has not given any reason not completely block appeals to the courts. But I why retrospectivity should not apply to obvious think there is a very significant difference in tax avoidance schemes. Why should it not apply? allowing the Commissioner rather than the courts I remind the Treasurer that an estimated $3,OOOm to make initial determinations. Again, unfortuin tax revenue was lost through tax avoidance in nately we must refer to the history of the present the last year. Under those circumstances surely High Court in these matters. There is absolutely we are facing a major question of the national no room for optimism that the court will, in fact, interest. Why should retrospectivity not apply to identify particular schemes as anti-avoidance obvious and blatant schemes'? There are schemes or that it will be inclined to do so. Surely precedents for retrospective anti tax avoidance the Commissioner is in a much better position to legislation in other countries. Let us get really determine that and to give his reasons, if those tough with these schemes and wipe out tax avoidreasons are challenged, to a tribunal or court. It is ance. I want to put on record that it is a matter of a very different position from allowing the courts regret that there are no retrospective provisions in to make the determination in the first instance.

He said: their health care is, in some way, being inequiWhen the United States and Canadian financing mechantable.
