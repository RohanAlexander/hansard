The second area I want to highlight to the House with respect to messages to young people is the campaign by a group called Enlighten Harm Reduction from Melbourne, from the Speaker’s own state, which seeks to test pills at so-called rave parties for young people. Many of these people are perhaps well-intentioned, but the message they are sending to young people in testing pills and giving them back to partygoers is: ‘This drug will not do you damage. We have tested it and it is safe.’ The message from the government, of course, is that none of these synthetic drugs is safe. You cannot be sure what is in a synthetic drug. No pill-testing kit can ascertain every aspect of a pill, because they are constantly changing. These pills have the capacity to do you tremendous damage. At a rave party on the weekend in South Australia called the Enchanted rave party, four of the patrons overdosed on synthetic drugs. The message should have been clear to them: if you take synthetic drugs, you do not know what is in them and you could do yourself dramatic damage. The group Enlighten Harm Reduction are sending the wrong message to young people that the pills they are taking can be safe and that they can test them to make sure that they are safe. It is dangerous. I would have thought that they have established a duty of care with a person they take a pill from and test and give back to that person. They are putting themselves in tremendous danger if that person suffers some adverse reaction or even dies.

House adjourned at 9.30 pm Monday, 5 December 2005 ----Hon. Peter Francis Salmon Cook Debate resumed. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (5.00 pm)-I would like to join with other members who, earlier today in the House of Representatives, have already expressed their sadness at the loss of Peter Cook. His death is a loss to politics, to the union movement, to the Labor Party and to this country. I particularly feel that loss today because it is in this environment-an environment in which the workers of Australia face an unprecedented threat-that we need Peter Cook. Had he not been so ill, I am sure Peter would have been in the vanguard with Australian workers as they take the fight up to this government. When you look at his background, his career and his ethics, it is easy to see why Peter Cook would have been itching to do everything he could to stop this legislation. Peter Cook worked in the union movement for unions as diverse as the Federated Clerks Union, the Building Workers Industrial Union and the Western Australian Trades and Labour Council. As others have mentioned today, he served in the Hawke and Keating governments as Minister for Industrial Relations, Minister for Trade and Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. The Labor Party owes a very significant debt of gratitude to Peter Cook for many other things, though, and I want to talk about a few of those. Australia’s strong commitment to freeing up international trade is a significant legacy. He was a genuine internationalist who rewrote Labor’s trade policy and vigorously promoted free trade. He had a particular affinity with people in our region, especially the Chinese. It was on a visit to China with him that I formed some of my strongest personal impressions of him. With the people he knew, with the connections he had formed over many years and with the important doors in the Chinese government that he was able to open, this is a man who took international trade reform very seriously indeed. He was, in turn, taken very seriously by so many foreign governments as a result. On a personal note, I remember giving him a poster at the end of our visit to China. It was a poster of Chairman Mao with students sitting at his feet, which to me really portrayed Peter’s role. This picture said a lot about the way Peter conceived of this visit to China, passing on to the next generation of Labor members what and whom they would need to know if they became ministers. Peter was not one to waste any opportunity. He wanted to get value and quality out of everything that he did. He was also someone whom you could call on for advice. While I was the shadow minister for health, the South African government called on us. They wanted to make medicines to treat AIDS patients and were having a lot of difficulty with the large international drug companies, who were making it impossible for them to go down this track. The South African government had come to us and I immediately called Peter Cook. He came over and was on the phone straight away to people in Geneva and South Africa, using his immense network of personal contacts. He knew exactly who to talk to, so we in the Labor Party in Australia were on top of the issue. Of course, we were then able to add our pressure to MAIN COMMITTEE",148,Adjournment
191,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Causley) Took The Chair At 5 Pm.,"make sure that poorer countries in the world, including South Africa, could both produce and get access to cheaper drugs. He was that sort of person-a person you could call on at any time to use his extraordinary network of personal contacts to deliver good around the world. Peter will also be remembered for his amazing contribution in opposition. He was at the forefront of the inquiries of the Senate Select Committee on A Certain Maritime Incident, the ‘children overboard’ affair, and the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America, and he was also the Chair of the Senate Select Committee on a New Tax System, the GST inquiry. There have already been a number of references to Peter’s chairing of a range of different Senate committee inquiries and to the skill and capacity that he displayed in those roles. In the case of his chairing of the committee considering the free trade agreement with the United States, his chairing and his understanding of the issues were very significant for the federal parliamentary Labor Party. Peter’s extensive experience was crucial to our party’s understanding of the detail of the free trade agreement with the US. His experience and determination really fashioned the final compromise position adopted by the Labor Party that ultimately led to the Howard government, I would have to say, reluctantly having to adopt a compromise position in order to secure passage of the bill. There has been significant mention made of Peter’s role in establishing the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into treatment alternatives for patients with cancer. On this issue I want to record my complete respect for the courage and dignity with which Peter pursued this committee reference, both within our own party and also in constructive negotiations with the government, at the time of his advanced illness. But I particularly want to mention here today Peter’s role in chairing the ‘children overboard’ inquiry, known as the Senate Select Committee on A Certain Maritime Incident. On the one hand, his role as chair of this committee highlights Peter’s finely honed skills in chairing committees of this parliament and his extensive knowledge of the powers, capacities and limitations of those committees. I have no doubt that Peter’s substantial experience in chairing trade negotiations and meetings of the Cairns Group equipped him well for chairing the sometimes fractious hearings of the ‘children overboard’ committee. Peter understood all too well that the committee’s main task was to elicit the relevant evidence and make sense of that evidence in order to produce an accurate and useful report. But, on the other hand, the committee was being presented with evidence about which I know Peter was very passionate-he was deeply touched by this evidence. Peter was in the invidious role of having to be the dispassionate chair of a committee being presented with deeply emotional evidence, and he was profoundly committed to getting the facts of the purported ‘children overboard’ incidents accurately on the record. Peter took his role as the chair of this committee very seriously indeedand rightly so. In tabling the report of the committee, Peter said: The values which we embrace as a nation and which define what it is to be Australian are not fulfilled by words. They are made real by deeds. This report seeks to uphold those values by telling the truth. That is what the Senate asked us to do and, within the limitations imposed by the government, that is what we have done. That is indeed what the committee did with great distinction, due in no small part to the skill and tenacity of Senator Peter Cook. The facts of those incidents reflect no credit at all on this government, and the government senators on the committee tried every trick in their barrisMAIN COMMITTEE ter’s book to stymie the pursuit of truth. While it was the case that Senators Faulkner and Collins had free rein to forensically take up their pursuit through all of the avenues available to them, Peter Cook was charged with fairly chairing the committee. But be in no doubt that Peter had a very strong and principled determination to address the issues of integrity and of truth in government while drafting the report of the ‘children overboard’ committee, principles which were informed by decades of public service. In concluding these remarks on Peter’s dedication in undertaking his duties as chair of the ‘children overboard’ committee, I want to quote Peter’s closing words when tabling the report. They are as follows: As a nation, we are keen to distinguish ourselves from those types of countries that are not democratic. They do not have our good human rights records, our free media or our non-partisan defence forces. They have government owned media with totalitarian control of public information, and the military is used as a political arm of the state. What distinguishes us is that we like to believe that this could not happen here. The only thing we need to do to for it to happen here by stealth is to pretend that somehow the truth of what happened in the children overboard affair is not really important. After all, they were only asylum seekers and, anyway, the government members say it is sour grapes by us. But the truth matters-of course it matters. We all know it matters. This report says it matters. And if we pretend it does not matter or that the children overboard lies were just some smart political game, we do that at our own peril and the peril of our democracy, our political processes, and good government, whichever party is in power. Peter was absolutely correct. Truth ought to matter, and truth did matter in the case of the ‘children overboard’ incidents. Truth did matter to Peter Cook, and his passion in pursuing the truth of these matters is but another part of the tremendous legacy he has left for the Labor Party and the Australian community. I will finish by referring to Peter Cook’s own comments about himself in his valedictory speech, because it says a great deal about this man. He said: IfI have a high point of my career ... I am proud of the industrial relations reforms, but I think the proudest is sitting behind the Australian flag, as I have said, in the closing stages of the Uruguay Round and, on behalf of Australia and the Cairns Group, negotiating a successful outcome. It is interesting that he also cited the establishment of the National Landcare Program as one of the achievements that he was proudest of. Of his political career, he said: Sometimes I think that I have led my career back to front. I came in with the drought-breaking Hawke avalanche in 1983. I served under the Hawke and Keating governments and as a minister for eight years. Those were the halcyon years of Labor. NowI leave with the coalition 10 years in power and my party in power in six states and two territories of Australia. ... In a way, I envy my colleagues who led their careers first in opposition and then retired on the high of government, because now I am leaving feeling that I am deserting the front at a time of some need. But I can tell you that that was something that Peter Cook never did. It is not a charge anyone, no matter which party they serve, could accuse him of. I am only sorry that cancer has robbed him of the chance of standing up once again for our working people. Finally, I return to Peter’s valedictory speech so I can use his words for his wife, Barbara, who survives him. As he prepared to begin his cancer treatment, he said of her: She is my harshest critic but my most steadfast friend. Without her, I could not go on, and there is nothing that I can say that would do justice to her. We are thinking of you, Barbara, at this time. MAIN COMMITTEE do we sum up the life of a man like Peter Cook? Whatever we say in this place about Peter will be incomplete because none of us in this place will understand the private loss that is felt by Peter’s family-his wife, Barbara, and those closest to him. Theirs is a far greater loss than we feel as a community, as a party and as a country at this time. When I think of Peter CookI think of an intellectual, an internationalist, a passionate social democrat and someone who had not the slightest interest in being here in this parliament for the sake of being here. Peter Cook was a person who wanted to be here in order to advance the project of social justice and a strong economy. Peter was an intellectual. He was at home in the world of ideas. He relished ideas. He saw ideas as the pathway to action. IfI look back on his contribution in the battle for ideas within the great Australian labour movement, the battle which he joined most decisively was the battle within our party about the right course of action in relation to free trade. Peter joined that battle at a time when it was not popular. His conclusion was that, if working people around the world were to have their living standards lifted, the way to do it was to free up markets and to do so in a way which enabled the economies where those people lived to grow at a faster rate than they would otherwise grow through growth in the overall trade component of the global economy and their national economy. Peter argued that on the basis of the intellectual merits of the argument. He argued that at a time it was politically difficult to argue it, and particularly politically difficult within the Australian labour movement. He exhibited in his argument other personal qualities of courage, tenacity and good humour in bringing his colleagues within the movement along with him. Peter Cook was an intellectual at home within the battle and the world of ideas. Peter was also an internationalist. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has just referred to the fact that Peter was a person who had friends, contacts and colleagues the world over. That was true. Wherever you went, you would run into people who would ask you this question: ‘How is Peter Cook?’ or, in some places, ‘How is Comrade Cook?’ He became quite justifiably, on the basis of that experience, the international secretary of our party. It was through that that I worked with Peter in developing further our relationships in China. When I was in China only a month or two ago and was being entertained by the international department of the Chinese Communist Party, their first question to me was, ‘How is Peter?’ I rang him in his hotel room in Sydney, in the place where he was at the hospital and where I had visited him not long before. One after another, I put various of our Chinese friends on the telephone to him. They all asked how he was and recommended various treatments for his condition, which he responded to knowledgeably, knowing the detail of some of them. I mention that simply for the fact that Peter did not just affect people politically as a person of substance and a person standing in our movement; Peter affected people personally. He affected people personally the world over, including in the halls of power in Beijing. He was an internationalist, a citizen of the world, the international secretary of our party and a person who had as one of his ambitions for his life ahead how to craft a new page in Australia’s relationship with China, the economy which he identified as being the economy that would become the largest in the world in the 21st century and therefore one which would be of great import to Australia’s future as well. MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Condolences
192,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (5.13 Pm),"How do we in this place sum up the life of a man? HowHe was an intellectual, an internationalist and also, as I said, a passionate social democrat. Peter Cook was a social democrat, a Labor man to his boots. Many have spoken of his background at a time when of course I did not know him. But, if you worked with him in this place, you always sensed that in him, through his veins, coursed the blood of the Australian labour movement. He had about him a passion as a Labor man, a Labor politician, the product of the labour movement, which you stood in awe of. Here was a man who, when it came to industrial relations reform, understood what it was like to get the balance right between bringing about flexibility in our labour market and at the same time not jeopardising the legitimate demands of working people for basic protections, both in the wages they earned and in the conditions they had in their workplace. Peter was always working his way through these challenges-but in a way which was rooted in his compassion and his deep orientation as a social democrat. He was an intellectual, an internationalist and a passionate social democrat. Peter was also a total professional, and it is here that I would like to make some remarks today about his achievement in the trade portfolio. In an interview soon after he took over the trade portfolio in March 1993, Peter described himself as ‘a trade junkie’. Developing a particular interest in trade as a backbencher, including during his time as chair of the committee on trade and resources, Peter took to the portfolio with great enthusiasm, saying in an interview at the time: For me coming to the portfolio is in many ways an ambition that I hold. I am excited at the challenges of this portfolio. It is one that I have had an interest in for a long time. Many of those speaking in this debate today have spoken about Peter Cook and his role in this portfolio. It was through that portfolio that he dealt with many of us. It may come as a surprise to many members participating in the debate, as it did to me, to actually look back at the relatively short time that Peter held the portfolio. He became Minister for Trade on 24 March 1993 and remained in that portfolio until 30 January 1994. However, in a little over 10 months, Peter had the good fortune, the good timing and, above everything else, the great capacity and intellect to deal with the trade matters which were then of great importance to our country. Within a short period, Peter had mastered the brief and skilfully prosecuted Australia’s interests in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, successfully assisting in drawing that round to a conclusion at the end of 1993. As part of that round, Peter also played the important role of chairing the Cairns Group of free trading agriculture-producing countries that was established by Labor earlier and was successful in getting agriculture onto the international trade agenda. At the time of its conclusion, the Uruguay Round was described by the GATT, the forerunner to the WTO, as the most complex round of multilateral trade negotiations in GATT history. The round entailed item by item and formula reductions, resulting in tariff reductions by industrialised countries by one-third on average. Agriculture, textiles and clothing were finally brought into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. There were new agreements on services known as GATS and on intellectual property known as trade related intellectual property, or TRIPS. This became an alphabet soup in which Peter was one of our party’s few exponents and capable of simultaneous bilingual interpretation. This was a challenge which Peter took further during his chairmanship of the Senate inquiry into the Australia-US FTA. This was a difficult task but one which, once again, Peter took to with his characteristic enthusiasm, drawing on his great trade knowledge and MAIN COMMITTEE ultimately steering a course for the Labor Party that included the development of Labor’s amendments on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and local content on television. The Uruguay Round also agreed to establish the World Trade Organisation, an institution which greatly respected Peter’s contribution and which he continued to visit and work for in different capacities, including authoring a manual on the workings of the WTO for developing countries. If ever there is evidence of someone’s commitment as an internationalist, it lies in Peter’s work on that score. The Uruguay Round was of major significance to Australia. In addition to reducing industrial tariffs and establishing new rules for trade in services, the Uruguay Round was particularly important for Australia’s rural industries as it finally managed to get agriculture onto the table. Notwithstanding significant resistance from protectionist forces, most notably the European Community, we nonetheless prevailed. The last few frenzied hours at Uruguay and the intransigence of the French-does anything ever change?-in particular are apparent from the following description contained in a Sydney Morning Herald article of 18 December 2003 which reflects back on that period: At the stage in the exhausting proceedings when the chief American negotiator, Mr Mickey Kantor, had lost his voice, when at least one senior figure had to be held up in public for fear that he would fall over and go to sleep, and when Australia’s Trade Minister, Senator Peter Cook, was shivering with a 24 hour virus, the French were still going strong in arguing their case. When we consider the current difficulties of the Doha Round in the lead-up to next week’s ministerial meeting in Hong Kong, it appears that very little has changed with regard to the EU’s attitude to liberalising trade. It is always a difficult and arduous process-step by step, clause by clause, tariff by tariff. Peter, however, took to all this with great energy, great commitment and, for Australia, great success. In Peter’s view, the EU was so caught up in the question of tradition, culture, special interests and internal wrangles that it was no more than seeking for itself to become a short-term winner at the expense of the rest of the international economy. The long-term winners would be those economies with the dynamism and the courage to seize the challenges and to restructure themselves to take full advantage of the liberalising world trade environment. In his Senate valedictory speech in June this year, Peter said that the trade achievement he revered the most was the opportunity to serve his country and negotiate in the endgame of the Uruguay Round. In doing so, he recognised the work of the preceding ministers, who had worked for more than eight years prior to that on those negotiations. Those remarks by Peter again reflect the man’s modesty in reflecting on the contributions of others. Again it is important to go back to the time of the conclusion of the round in December 1993. While Peter had been a part of a significant achievement, there remained a sense of frustration emanating from Peter’s great understanding of the contribution of trade liberalisation to economic growth and development. Peter told the final session of the round: It’s three years overdue. Had we got there sooner, the international recession might not have occurred or been as deep as it was. The truth is if we’d got there earlier many more people would have been in full employment, fewer businesses would have gone bankrupt and world growth would have been better. Thus spoke Australia’s Minister for Trade, Peter Cook, with characteristic Australian candour. As Minister for Trade in 1993, Peter also had the opportunity to represent Australia at the fifth MAIN COMMITTEE APEC ministerial meeting before the first APEC leaders meeting held in Seattle. Peter understood fully the complementary and supportive role APEC played in pursuing Australia’s multilateral trade and investment objectives at the regional level throughout the Asia-Pacific. Peter continued to be a great supporter of APEC, believing it had an essential role to play in developing a more prosperous and stable network for Australia. While he chaired the Senate inquiry into the Australia-US FTA and conjured a way forward for us, Peter always remained a multilateralist at heart. After all, that is where the biggest trade and economic gains were to be had for Australia, that is where the biggest trade and economic gains were to be had for the developing world and that is where the biggest trade and economic gains were to be had for the global economy overall. Peter cemented his beliefs in Labor’s trade policy platform-a platform which committed Australia to continuing Australia’s firm commitment to an open international economy, a commitment that recognises the importance of free trade as the means of generating the growth necessary for enhancing the living standards of every Australian. This was the intellectual battle in which Peter Cook engaged; this was the intellectual battle in which he prevailed. On trade, as the current occupant of the shadow portfolio, I have a great sense of coming after someone who has been very great indeed in the execution of their responsibilities within this portfolio. These are very big shoes to fill. On a personal level, I had the great privilege, as I mentioned before, to visit Peter in hospital in Sydney only several weeks ago. Visiting him in hospital, I could not but be impressed by Peter’s singular tenacity, his absolute belief in his ability to prevail despite this thing. We talked of little else but sailing. I gave him a book about sailing. I am pleased to report that he did not already have that book on sailing. Sailing was his passion, as so many have said in this debate. But, beyond sailing, you could not keep Peter down. There he was, sitting in his wheelchair, holding forth on how we should go forward in order to win. He provided me with at least three recommendations to place before the strategy group of our party when we next met. So much for Peter being burdened by the challenges he faced. His wife, Barbara, about whom the Deputy Leader of the Opposition spoke so eloquently, has been the complete living embodiment of a tower of strength-such extraordinary love, such extraordinary devotion, such extraordinary strength. So how do we sum up the man, Peter Cook? An intellectual, an internationalist, a passionate social democrat, a professional, a trade professional, a person whose motivation in politics was driven by his deep compassion for people who had grown up on the wrong side of the tracks and, beyond all that, a person gifted with great tenacity to see the job through. Peter Cook, we the party, the people and the parliament all salute you. Dr EMERSON (Rankin) (5.28 pm)-Peter Cook and I met on 10 January 1984 in Old Parliament House. On that day, I had started working for the then Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Peter Walsh. I was walking along the corridor with its creaky floorboards and a dank smell about the place. I suppose that is an apt description of the Senate at times. It certainly was then, but it is vastly improved now. As I walked past a fairly young bloke-I was quite a bit younger-someone said, ‘This is Cookie.’ I thought it was good to meet a new staff member. ThereI was just finding my feet and I had already met another staff member, Cookie. So fondly was he regarded around the place that he was not called Senator Cook or Peter, but Cookie. Everyone from the Labor people to Senator Messner and Senator Chaney MAIN COMMITTEE knew him as Cookie. Such people held Cookie in very high regard from those very early days onward-and he had been elected only a year earlier. The next big memory that I have of Peter was in the uranium debate within the ALP at the 1984 conference. It was a debate which, understandably, was full of emotion. Peter himself had to make a big decision on that. He was in the Centre Left grouping, and the Centre Left would ultimately determine the position of the party on the uranium issue. There were a lot of arguments coming from the Right and from the Left. Peter was being hammered from both sides really. I remember how he agonised about that. He ultimately supported the position of the Right, but only after going through a lot of soul searching, checking his conscience and seeing whether it was the right thing to do by the people of Australia. He made that judgment. Whether the judgment was right or wrong is not a matter for debate here today. I was very taken by how committed Peter was to getting what he believed to be a good decision. That took us to the end of 1984. Not long after-early in 1985-we began the great tax debate. We seem to have them every 20 years or so. We certainly had a big one back then. In the 1984 election campaign, Bob Hawke had decided to say that we would have a tax summit. A lot of people who were into heavy-handed control thought that that was a particularly stupid idea, but nevertheless Bob thought that it was a way of dealing with the tax issues without having to have every detail of every possible tax change in front of the Australian people at that time. We had the great tax debate of 1985. The GST was around then, and Treasury were very firm advocates of it. They thought it was beaut. In particular, it would have the value of being able to cut the top marginal rate of tax, a rate which many Treasury officials confronted. Along with many other ‘productive’ people in the community, they thought that that was a pretty good thing. They saw the broad based consumption tax as a way of doing that. I was a fresh economist on staff. From my training, I would ordinarily have been obliged to think that it was a good idea too, but I did not. And Peter Cook was a bit of a sceptic. I can reveal now that Cookie and I ‘cooked up’ more than one or two papers on what a dreadful thing this broad based consumption tax was. Peter bore a few scars by releasing those papers, arguing against the broad based consumption tax, on his own behalf and on behalf of others in the Centre Left. Nevertheless, the white paper was produced. The broad based consumption tax was option (c). There was an option (a), which was ultimately adopted. No-one ever really talks about option (b), which was our option. That shows what an inspired idea option (b) turned out to be. Peter believed that a GST would be very unfair-that low-income earners could not be compensated adequately for it, that it would rise over time and that it would not bring the great benefits claimed in terms of export competitiveness and improved incentives. I think that Peter was right then and that his view is right now. Nevertheless, we have the GST. It is a $38 billion tax and no-one is seriously arguing that we should get rid of it. Peter applied the same standards to the debate on the GST: what would this particular policy proposal do for the Australian people and, most particularly, what impact would it have on the most vulnerable in our community? On the basis of believing that a broad based consumption tax would have an adverse impact on the most vulnerable in our community, Peter opposed it. MAIN COMMITTEE Our next engagement was in relation to Tasmanian forests. Peter had a really hard brief here. Graham Richardson was advocating-as was I, I must say-a very expansive policy in protecting the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests of Tasmania. We held the Helsham inquiry and ended up adopting the minority position against the majority position. The minority position was to put on the World Heritage List a very large tract of land-I think 282,000 hectares give or take an inch. Peter’s job was to run the contrary case within the cabinet. He had developed a much smaller set of proposals. We were despatched by Bob Hawke to go to Tasmania and see if we could get some support for this much more modest proposal. Someone who did have a view on forest policy in Tasmania was Lloyd Rees, a rather well known painter. Through his son we visited Lloyd. Peter eloquently, I must say, put the strongest possible case as to why this was a responsible forest policy. It took about three hours of having cups of tea and then, at the end of it, after Lloyd had taken in all of the arguments, Peter said, ‘What do you think, Lloyd?’ Lloyd said, ‘Yes, but why do you want to cut down the trees?’ I thought that said it all. So we reported back to Bob Hawke that Lloyd had a fairly clear view that the trees should not be cut down, and probably the proposal that ultimately got up would have been unsatisfactory to Lloyd too because it did involve cutting down some trees. But it was certainly a memorable experience for all of us. Peter was promoted to cabinet by Paul Keating when Paul became Prime Minister. The fundamental reason why Peter was promoted to cabinet was that he always ran the arguments, he ran the case. What Paul used to say about Cookie was that he would run the brief of his department. They did not necessarily have to agree with every aspect, but Paul fundamentally believed that the various portfolio ministers should come together and represent the views of their departments. They could depart from them but they should put that view into the policy debate in the cabinet room. Peter was fantastic at that. He worked tirelessly to get across those briefs and always put the best possible argument in the cabinet process. That is why Peter was promoted permanently to cabinet by Paul Keating. I then dropped out of the scene for a fair while but, on coming back in 1998, there we were again: fighting the GST. I was again delighted to work with Peter as he chaired the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee inquiry into the GST and a new tax system. I am sure that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would agree that Peter worked tirelessly on that, day in, day out and all around the country, again bringing forward all the arguments but with that fundamental criterion in mind: what does this proposal do to the most vulnerable people in our country? On that basis Peter was again able to say that he did not support the GST. We then moved on to a Economics References Committee inquiry into the Fair Prices and Better Access for All (Petroleum) Bill 1999-petrol prices are in the news again-and Peter again applied that rigour. We produced what I think was a very responsible report. It was not just opportunistic, saying, ‘Oh, petrol prices are high; they ought to do something about it.’ Specific proposals came out of that report. Those proposals are still relevant today, and again there was the rigour and energy that Peter applied to it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to a trip to China, which I think was a real highlight of all our careers, not only for the great work and the level at which we were engaged but the camaraderie that we enjoyed as we got to know each other. It was just a fantastic time. Peter was the great helmsman. He got us around China and into all of these meetings, and he did it with great distinction, the sort of MAIN COMMITTEE distinction that he had gained in the negotiations in which he was so deeply involved towards the end of the Uruguay Round. It was, as others have said, a highlight of his career to be able to sign off on that Uruguay Round. I will speak a bit more about trade in a moment, but the other great achievement of Peter Cook, Cookie, was the introduction of enterprise bargaining. It seems to me that that is the fundamental reform that has led to so much productivity growth, together with the other economic reforms. In the labour market that is the reform that created genuine productivity growth, not what the government is going on with now. That is not reform; that is just brutality. Enterprise bargaining was not an easy transition. In convincing the union movement and employers that this was a good thing, but particularly the union movement, Peter had to apply all his skills, good graces and goodwill. He did that with distinction. It made me think that if you had a career and you wanted to say, ‘I did two great things. I had two great achievements in my career, which spanned the 1980s and 1990s,’ it would be hard to go past signing off on the Uruguay Round and introducing enterprise bargaining. Although it is not immediately obvious, both of those reforms did fundamentally help the poorest people in our community by creating jobs, both through enterprise bargaining and through trade liberalisation. Peter had that conviction about him and he knew that was what both of those major policy reforms could do, and they have done. Peter Cook was a compassionate human being. He taught us all compassion. He had enormous integrity. He knew that there were many causes that he was championing that were unpopular. He was coming up against people whom he respected and liked who could not understand why Cookie was doing these things. But he did not flinch. He did not say, ‘I’d better rethink this; I am making myself unpopular.’ He was always pleasant but always determined to achieve the outcome. In politics, honesty is a precious commodity, and Peter Cook had a very large amount of that. He was just such an honest man. If he disagreed with you, you knew absolutely. There is a lesson for all of us in that. Peter was a man of principle. I think he paid a high price for being so principled-but, in the end, he probably would not have minded. If when you are dying and you look back on your years and can say yes to the questions ‘WasI honest? DidI have compassion? WasI a person of principle? DidI have integrity?’ you have led a pretty good life. Peter Cook led a very good life. When Peter was diagnosed with cancer and he was leaving this place, I went around to see him and I gave him a hug because I knew that things were very bad. Cookie always said, ‘I’ll keep fighting, I can beat this,’ but I knew the prognosis was bad. Even as things worsened and through all the operations that he had in Sydney, he just kept fighting-always thinking, ‘Maybe there’s some hope; even if things are gloomy I’ll do the very best I can.’ He never flinched under pressure on the policy front and he never flinched under pressure when he was dying. Peter Cook was a great man and a great friend and I miss him very much. The strength and love that Barbara displayed for her husband right through their lives but most particularly in that last terrible 12 months is almost indescribable. Barbara, we are thinking of you today. You have done a fantastic job. debate on Peter Cook, and I thank the member for Fraser for allowing me to slot in at this particular time. I probably come from a different perspective-a perspective of minister to minisMAIN COMMITTEE",153,Condolences
193,Mr Causley (Page) (5.42 Pm),"I would like to make a contribution to this condolenceter. When I was Minister for Natural Resources in the Greiner government in New South Wales, which I took over in 1988, Peter Cook was the Minister for Resources in the Hawke government here in Canberra. Of course, one of the great debates at that time was the forestry debate in New South Wales. I suppose it continues, but it was a great debate at that time. In fact, it was the debate that brought me into politics in 1984, because I believed that the whole debate was distorted and dishonest and we had to get the truth across as to what was really going on in the management of forests in New South Wales. I suppose I would have to admit defeat on that issue. One of the issues I had to deal with at the time was the management of the south-east forests, which was to do particularly with the chip-milling at the Harris-Daishowa mill at Eden. In that instance, the Commonwealth had to give licences for the export of chips, so Peter Cook and I became entwined in that issue. To his great credit, Peter rang me up and said, ‘We have to deal with this issue. Would you mind if I came across and had a talk to you?’ I said, ‘Fine, come across.’ Peter flew to Sydney and we sat down with his staff and my staff and we decided that we should spend some time trying to come to an agreement on what areas would be needed for the timber industry-not only the chip industry but also the tablelands sawmills and the sawmill down at Nowra. It was an extended process. Peter flew to Sydney almost weekly for nearly three months to go through the issues. Peter had to take into consideration the environmental position of the Hawke government and I had to take into consideration not only the environmental issues but also the issue of jobs. To his credit, Peter Cook acknowledged that and, not surprisingly, with his background of looking after the interests of workers, he was very much aware of the situation and uppermost in his mind were the jobs of the workers in the forest industries of New South Wales-the greatest decentralised industry we had in rural New South Wales. It was a very serious issue that we courteously went through. We tried very hard to set aside areas that we believed were important to the environment. We also tried to set aside areas where we would have a long-term, sustainable forestry industry in New South Wales. My youth was spent in the forest industries on the North Coast of New South Wales, so I understand clearly the management that is necessary. I understand how you can maintain the resource on a very sustainable basis. From that perspective, I was able to make a contribution, with Peter Cook, on this issue. We reached an agreement on how the area should be set aside for the environment and for the industry. The agreement was signed by Prime Minister Hawke and by Premier Greiner. To my great sadness, I have to say that, in the name of the Australian Conservation Foundation, the now member for Kingsford Smith managed to get Nick Greiner’s ear to get the agreement changed. It was not the Labor government in Canberra; it was our government in New South Wales that reneged on the agreement that Peter Cook and I had reached. I think there is a certificate to this day on the wall down at Harris Daishowa saying, ‘That’s how much you can depend on Australian governments,’ which is rather sad because the agreement was very good . It took all areas into consideration. It was a template that could have been used in forest industries across Australia. It is rather sad that it fell by the wayside. When Peter Cook was diagnosed with melanoma, I was a bit of a kindred spirit because I had been diagnosed with secondary melanoma some time before and I knew what he would be going through. I do not think you can explain the feeling you have when your doctor says, MAIN COMMITTEE ‘You have secondary melanoma.’ You just go cold because you know very well what you are dealing with. Specialists are not the people who will give you a lot of hope; they tell you exactly how it is. They say, ‘You’re dealing with a monster,’ and it is a monster that is very hard to contain. I rang Peter Cook-having had all that time with him-and gave him my assurance that I would certainly pray for him and would like to speak to him and help him along the way. We did from time to time have a discussion about these matters. I dare say he realised what he was up against; he realised the odds. Even when I had a clearance, after an operation, to say that they could find no more cancer in my body I was rather relieved and said to my specialist, ‘That’s good news, doctor.’ He looked at me and said, ‘Yes, that gives you a 50 per cent chance.’ They are very serious odds to deal with. Peter Cook and I both knew that we were fighting a big battle and the consequences were unknown. They say only the good die young. I have been very lucky because I am three years down the track and there is still no sign of any secondaries. Peter did not have that luckunfortunately, secondaries showed up fairly quickly. In fact, my specialist said to me, ‘If I’m still talking to you in 12 months time, then we are part way down the track.’ That is how quickly it moves. As I was driving home from a function on Saturday-we are sending out Christmas cards at the present time. I said to my wife, ‘Remind me to send Peter Cook a Christmas card and I’ll drop him a note.’ It must have been about the time he lost the battle. I did not realise he was so low at the time. I did not know his family but I know what they would be going through. It is a terrible tragedy to lose someone and it is a terrible tragedy to suffer with them. I have seen that type of suffering in my own family. It is very hard to deal with. I can only just imagine what his wife has gone through. She must have been stoic to go through it the way she did, from what I hear from others. My sympathies certainly go to the family. I will always remember Peter Cook. He was a very decent man to deal with and I believe that through a lot of hard work and perseverance we came to an agreement that was a very good agreement. It is just a pity that it did not stick. did not need to be his friend to appreciate the significance of his contribution. For example, it is highly likely that the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations would not have finished as well as it did or as early as it did without Peter Cook’s robust, skilful and intelligent leadership of the Cairns Group. There are serious, senior figures in international trade discussions who have said there probably would not have been a satisfactory outcome of the Uruguay Round at all without Peter Cook’s role. I had the privilege of succeeding him as Minister for Trade and, while I do not think any individual can be responsible for anything as substantial as the conclusion of a major round of international trade negotiations, there was nobody I met who did not conclude that the result was earlier, better and better received as a result of some extraordinary initiatives that Peter took as chair of the Cairns Group. He left a few bruised egos behind because he set up a subgroup in the Cairns Group, he took them to Europe, he negotiated with the Europeans, he negotiated with the Americans and he hammered out a deal. When you set up a subgroup, by definition someone gets left behind. They all felt that this was a bit presumptuous and I had to smooth some ruffled feathers afterwards. It was a very small task compared to the task of getting that agreement. The world is a MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Condolences
194,Mr Mcmullan (Fraser) (5.50 Pm),"Peter Cook was my friend for 35 years. But youbetter place for that agreement and Peter’s contribution was extraordinary. This is an achievement which would satisfy a lifetime’s activity. If at the end of 30 years of activity you could say that is what you achieved then you could feel very proud. But it is a mere staging post in a long and brilliant career. I have chosen to highlight it at the beginning of these remarks not just because it is so significant but because the combination of commitment, will and intellect which it displayed was the outstanding feature of his public career. I started off by saying he had been my friend for 35 years. I read in an obituary in the Australian today that Peter came to Perth in 1970, and I met him within a few days of his arrival. I thought: ‘No, that’s wrong. It can’t possibly have been 1970-that’s 35 years ago.’ But sadly I remembered that it was right. That means I am 35 years older than I was then. Sometimes it feels like twice as much and sometimes only half. But it must have been so because I remember in 1971 he and I were campaigning in the streets about the South African rugby tour. I am not sure that all the obituaries have referred to this and nor do I think, of those that have, that they have all been totally accurate about it. They say Peter was not an activist outside the official political realm. I remember seeing him put in the back of a paddy wagon as a result of activities during that protest against those South African rugby tours. He was most put out because I was there with the megaphone calling out and he was in the crowd, and they picked him up and not me. He was always put out about that. I cannot say that I ever minded. He was very actively engaged in a wide range of activities. The ones that come to mind in hindsight-there were many others as well-were those South African rugby tour campaigns and the war in Vietnam. I heard in the Senate debate on the condolence motion Senator George Campbell talking very eloquently about Peter’s very powerful role against certain laws introduced by the Court government-the government of Sir Charles Court, not the subsequent government of Richard Court-which restricted freedom of association and led to various trade union officials being charged for holding public meetings. Incidentally, they led to me being charged on one occasion for holding a public meeting. Peter fought against those in a manner that was effective and successful. Over those 35 years he went from-when I first met him-being a junior, organising with the Miscellaneous Workers Union, to working for the building workers union and becoming assistant secretary of the labour council and then secretary of the labour council. I was very pleased to play a role in creating the opportunity for Peter to become secretary of the labour council. His predecessor had done a fine job. It was time for him to move on and we found a decent way in which he could make a contribution elsewhere, which he did very substantially, and Peter took his place. Subsequently, I was pleased to have a role in getting a preselection for him in those tumultuous days of the double dissolution of 1983 which led him to come to the Senate. In all those things and in the role he played in the trade union movement, as vice-president of the ACTU-he was originally involved in negotiating what became the accord from the trade union side, although he finished up implementing it from the government side, when the Labor Party was in government-he was a very distinguished figure and a very significant minister in a range of portfolios. I was very pleased to hear the remarks made by the member for Page. I thought he made a very cogent argument in a simpler way than those of us who were close to Peter in other ways could have about the quality and integrity of his negotiation and commitment. I was grateful for the remarks that he made. MAIN COMMITTEE Peter was Minister for Resources, Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, but he was always proudest and made his most significant contribution as Minister for Trade. It is hard to believe that, in a long career of more than 35 years, he was trade minister for only 10 months. But there was a fortuitous combination of capacity and opportunity-the skills that he had developed. Somebody described Peter in an article in a newspaper today as possibly the best negotiator they had ever met. I know at least one other person who would be a competitor for that title. But he was certainly an outstanding negotiator who had the capacity to bring people together, to come to agreement, to go to the essence of the argument that you need to find agreement and to enable people to move away from the side issues that they are finding difficult to overcome and focus on the central issue. He made an ongoing contribution to trade policy, and I want to come back to that when I comment on what he did after he left parliament. When I became trade minister, I found there were a substantial number of people all around Asia whose attitude to Australia, to Australians and to Australian government policy was the better for the relationship they had developed with Peter. I want to briefly mention two, and they are both very significant figures in an ongoing way. One was a very controversial figure, and was very difficult for Australian ministers, including yours truly, to deal with-the incredible Malaysian trade minister, Rafidah. I know that you, Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop, know Rafidah Aziz, as I do. She has been a very powerful, forceful and controversial advocate for the policies of her government for a very long time but has not been easy on Australia. She gave us a hard time. Peter discovered that he and Rafidah had the same birthday. They used to joke about this and he broke the ice with it. That did not mean that either of them made agreements other than by forcefully arguing the interests of their country. But he broke through the difficulties we had in building a decent working relationship with a government that at that stage we had difficulties with-the government of Dr Mahathir. When they were at their low point, one of the intermediaries was always Peter because of his relationship with Rafidah. The other relationship-and in some ways an easier one because it was with a person much more amenable to the sorts of issues we were pushing-and one of great long-term significance, was with Dr Supachai. Dr Supachai was at the time the Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, responsible for trade policy. He went on-and he has just concluded a term, I think-to be the Director-General of the WTO, a very important figure in that organisation. As far as I understand, he is now the head of UNCTAD. He is a distinguished international citizen, a significant player in the trade policy debates in ASEAN when we were trying to negotiate the first steps of the relationship between Australia and New Zealand through CER and ASEAN. It was Dr Supachai who was a significant factor, and his friendship with Australia was substantially built on his relationship with Peter. I would like to move on to Peter’s role after we left government. A number of people have commented on his chairmanship of various committees, and I will mention three of them only quickly because they had been mentioned at great length by others-the GST inquiry, the ‘children overboard’ inquiry, and of course the final report he brought down on the issue of cancer. All of those were very significant, but the report that is underestimated, I think, is the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, which he chaired, on the MAIN COMMITTEE idea of a Pacific community. The committee brought down a unanimous report-and that sort of thing happens often on that Senate committee but it was something that Peter was very good at achieving-and made some far-reaching recommendations about the nature of our relationship with other countries in the Pacific. I think that in 10 or 20 years time the report will be looked back on as more significant than all of the others which are of contemporary political significance. I would like to think that the cancer report will be similar, that it will make a change in public policy, but I am not so optimistic. But I think that the report from that committee which Peter chaired on the idea of a Pacific community-and many other people on the committee also made a good contribution to the report-will be looked back on as another significant achievement. Very briefly, I want to say something about how and why Peter left the parliament. In hindsight he would have left pretty soon afterwards anyway because of his health. Peter should have been endorsed for the last election. I am not commenting on the person who took his place and who was the beneficiary of issues that surrounded Peter’s preselection and who now has the opportunity to prove himself as a worthwhile successor. I certainly do not know him well enough to comment on whether he will do that or not, and I make no comment on him. I do not hold him at all responsible. He was offered the opportunity to make a contribution in the Senate, and why would he not seize it. Peter had given me a lot of support over many years politically and I tried to return the favour. I found intransigence from a group of people-and there was a roomful of them-who, if they had all combined their will, their commitment and their intellect, would not have been the equal of Peter. They conspired to pull him down to avenge years of dissatisfaction with the positive role he played in stopping them doing the things they wanted to do. He was right to stop them; they were wrong to pull him down. I do not know what they are thinking today, but I know what I am thinking. His reputation will be unsullied by their activities, but I do not think that theirs will be. After he left he was always amused by the idea of being an adjunct professor. He had been introduced at a function on one occasion as Professor Cook and he thought this was wonderful, having been Senator Cook for so long. He expected everyone to call him Peter or Cookie really, but to be Professor Cook was a source of great amusement and pleasure to him. Through the Curtin University and the WTO-other people have referred to his significant contributions and I will not repeat them-he produced a book to assist developing countries in taking advantage of opportunities that the WTO offered. What has not been commented on is the significant role he played through the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in going to parliaments in developing countries and advising parliamentarians on the role they could play in assisting in trade liberalisation in those countries. He was an advocate for trade liberalisation but also an adviser on how to go about it as a parliamentarian, to be effective, to have scrutiny and to do all those things that we would take for granted. It was just another part of his long-term commitment to trade liberalisation. He played a significant role in our party in the formation of the Centre Left. He played a significant role in creating it-it is not fair to say that he created it, but for many years he carried it on his back. History will probably judge that the Centre Left was a flawed concept, but his will, his intellect and his ability made it succeed and made it contribute for 20 years. He played a positive role through that and for the party in government and in opposition. MAIN COMMITTEE I want to conclude by saying something about Barbara. A lot of people have spoken correctly about the very significant role Barbara played in her wonderful support for Peter during his illness. Robyn and I drove down to Sydney on a few occasions to offer Barbara and Peter and bit of support and comfort, and she was always wonderfully strong. She was unbelievable in how she was able to sustain her support and good humour. She should not be underestimated as a strong and independent woman who has made a very substantial career of her own and a very substantial public policy contribution across a range of areas in Western Australia. Barbara sustained that right up until Peter’s retirement. They were going to enjoy a wonderful retirement, but it has been cruelly cut short. She rang me on Saturday, as strong as ever, to ask me to ring mutual friends overseas who did not know how ill Peter was and how imminent his death was. It was only a couple of hours before he died. That she had the thought to ring me and to be concerned about those people was, I thought, a great tribute to her. I know that, after the mourning and the grief, she will return to make a contribution of her choosing, because she is a woman of talent and strength. Peter Cook’s death on Saturday marks the premature end of an outstanding Australian life, but Peter goes in the knowledge that he lived his life in accordance with his values. He made a substantial contribution to Australia and achieved the only real accolade any of us can hope to achieve. He can leave us knowing that the world and the nation are the better for his contribution. condolence motion for former senator Peter Cook, or Cookie as he was known to all of us. I must say how pleased I am to follow on from the member for Fraser, because he and I, like Senator Cook, cut our teeth in the Western Australian branch of the ALP. The member for Fraser, first as a senator and then as a member of the House, and I subsequently joined Peter in the parliament. I want to start by recording my sympathy to Barbara and to Peter’s family. I have known Peter for a long time as a Western Australian colleague-although not for quite as long as the member for Fraser. My first contact with Peter was in the midto late-1970s. He was about to become secretary of the TLC and I was a delegate to the state executive of the Western Australian branch of the party from the Perth Electorate Council-the seat that I now have the great fortune to represent. My real contact with Peter came when I became State Secretary of the Western Australian branch of the ALP in the late 1980s-by then he was a senator and was soon to become a minister-and subsequently I joined him as a colleague. I think the highlight of Peter’s public contribution-his contribution to public service, to public life-was as a minister in the Hawke and Keating governments as Minister for Resources, Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Trade. I will not go through all the details of those achievements. I have always thought his most significant contribution was in the trade portfolio where, on any measure, he can lay claim to have been one of the best trade ministers that our nation has had the benefit of having. I also think his contribution in opposition to the parliament and to the Labor Party, following our fall from office in 1996, is underappreciated. When we fell into opposition in 1996, I think it is true to say that Peter was initially very disappointed at no longer being in governMAIN COMMITTEE",161,Condolences
195,Mr Stephen Smith (Perth) (6.07 Pm),"I rise tonight to associate myself with thement and at the role that he had in opposition. But after a very brief time he showed what I thought was very much the true application of his personal characteristics. In Labor’s period in opposition, Peter was Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. He showed his true colours as a parliamentarian when, no longer on our executive or frontbench, he chaired a number of Senate inquiries, including the Senate Select Committee on A New Tax System, the Senate Select Committee on A Certain Maritime Incident-the ‘children overboard’ inquiry-and, most recently, the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into services and treatment options for persons with cancer. All of these inquiries showed Peter’s personal characteristics. It has struck me for a long time that in many respects the best of Peter’s characteristics was his great integrity. You always knew where he stood, and he certainly let you know what he thought of where you stood. If you entered into a conversation with Peter and subsequently came to an agreement about policy or politics, it was always honoured. There was no honouring in breach, it was always honoured. I think it is true to say that, whilst Peter had an avid interest in politics, his real passion was the politics of public policy. He was in politics not for the game of politics but for what politics could achieve-public policy outcomes and public policy contributions. Whilst, I think, far and away his most significant public policy contribution was as Minister for Trade during the Uruguay Round, his contribution as Minister for Industrial Relations, forging enterprise bargaining, was also by any measure a most significant achievement. There are two personal anecdotes I am always left with when I think of Peter. The first is one I always threatened to tell about him when he was out of public office. I never went into the full details with Peter, and I think that from time to time he was worried about what I might say. Underappreciated in Peter’s ministerial career was his time as Minister for Resources. In our first term in opposition in 1996, I was shadow minister for resources and energy. Peter searched me out for a lunch meeting he had organised with representatives of the Western Australian minerals and petroleum resources industry. He started the lunch by saying: ‘I may or may not be in the next Labor cabinet, but Stephen Smith will be. I want him to have a complete understanding of the mineral and petroleum resources industry and I want you to show him every convenience and every support.’ He did that for three reasons: (1) his ongoing commitment to trying to ensure that the Labor Party was in government, not opposition; (2) his selfless devotion, in his own right, to advancing good public policy; and (3) wanting to advance the interests, in the national good and in the public interest, of an important industry. I think it is true to say that, just as Peter was underappreciated as Minister for Resources, the resources industry itself has for a very long time been underappreciated; it has only been in more recent times that it has come to the fore. It has always struck me that there was no reason for Peter to do that for me personally and no personal reason for him to do that for himself. He did it because he thought it would advance the interests of a great industry and advance the interests of the Australian Labor Party. The second anecdote is the one that I will go to my own grave remembering Peter for. It is not known by many-but known by Peter and Barbara-that Peter and Barbara have been constituents of mine. At the local level in my electorate, one of the great achievements of the Hawke and Keating governments was a Building Better Cities project known as the East Perth project, which saw the establishment of Claisebrook Cove and the revitalisation of East Perth as a thriving, modern community. MAIN COMMITTEE It was a week or so before it became public knowledge that Peter was suffering from the cancer and, given his and Barbara’s demeanour, I am sure it was before Peter and Barbara were aware of the advice and the diagnosis. But, as is common with me on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, I was on my own walk from my house, with Jane, along our oft-trod path to Trinity and the WACA via Claisebrook Cove. In Claisebrook Cove there are a number of restaurants and coffee shops, and one that Peter and Barbara often frequented was Lamont’s. And, as we were walking past, there were Peter and Barbara on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. It was a beautiful Perth day. Peter was close to the water. The sun was shining. So we stopped our walk, went onto the balcony and just had a quick chat. It was typical Peter. We had a chat about public life and politics. We were of course going through tough times and, once we analysed our tough times, he saw hope and optimism for the future. This was always Peter’s way. There were things that we could and should do to advance our cause. So we had a conversation about politics, a conversation about life, a conversation about family, and there was Peter in his element: with Barbara, chatting about politics, policy and life, and close to the water-on this occasion, the Swan, not the ocean, but nonetheless close to the water. As we walked away, I remarked to Jane just how happy he and Barbara were and how carefree and casual he seemed about life and our political predicament. And that is how I will always remember Peter and how I will always remember Peter with Barbara. I express my deepest sympathy and condolences to her and Peter’s family, and I mark my admiration for Peter Cook’s contribution to Australia’s national interest and to our public life. Ms CORCORAN (Isaacs) (6.17 pm)-I join many people here today in wanting to pay my respects to Senator Peter Cook. We have heard a lot from other people about Peter’s career-people who are far more qualified than I am to talk about that-and it has been interesting and instructive to listen to the last few speakers. I did not know Peter personally at all until I arrived here in this parliament about five years ago, but I have had a number of opportunities in the last few years to get to know him. Peter always struck me right from the beginning as a man who never gave up. He always seemed to know what he was fighting for, and he took every opportunity to advance the cause. I came to know Peter after what I guess many people would regard as the peak of his parliamentary career, but it seemed to me that he did not regard his work as anywhere near finished, and I admired him for that. His work, as far as I could work out, was the Labor Party and what it could do for Australia and for Australians. He was not interested in the machinations inside, only as much as it meant better things for our country. I admired Peter’s energy and his unflagging interest and personal commitment in continuing the fight for the things that he regarded as important. He always seemed to stay very focused on the real game and was often several jumps ahead of everybody else. This unflagging interest and commitment to the real game was evident in how he dealt with his illness. I think the last of the many Senate inquiries that Peter chaired-many of them of great national importance-on cancer, was typical of Peter and his focus. I note his very practical response to the difficulty many people find when they are diagnosed, with a bewildering range of advice and options that people have to work their way through. I know from personal experience with members of my own family of that very bewilderment that people have to go through. MAIN COMMITTEE I want to put on record my thanks to Peter for his support for my own parliamentary career and for his role in its beginning. I regard my start here as a direct result of Peter’s and others’ interest in the health of the Labor Party. Peter cared very much about the Labor Party, as I said before, because he saw it as the best way of looking after the interests of Australia. I want to pass on to Barbara, Peter’s wife, my heartfelt sympathies and to wish her well as she comes to terms with Peter’s death and her loss. mentary Labor Party, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this condolence motion for Senator Peter Cook. But I also speak as a friend and as one who will mourn the loss of Peter-as a friend, as a colleague, as a senator whom I admired and as a senator who made a great contribution to his adopted state of Western Australia. He made a great contribution to his nation and to the party of which he was a dedicated and conscientious member and servant for so long. I do not want to speak of Peter’s enviable record since he came to this parliament back in 1983, as others have done that already. But in paying my respects to PeterI say that he will be sadly missed, as men of his ilk, dedication, professionalism, intellect, compassion and loyalty are always missed for they are men of rare character, particularly in politics. I want to pay tribute to Peter’s wife, Barbara, who stood resolutely beside Peter as his partner, his mentor, his critic and indeed his closest friend. Barbara and Peter had a wonderful relationship. As hard as these last few months were on Peter, they were also indescribably hard on Barbara. But she never flinched or weakened in her love for him or in her resolve to stand by Peter and to fight beside him, with him and for him to the end. I just want to say to Barbara that you have our admiration, appreciation and thanks for the loving and caring way in which you looked after and nurtured Peter, our friend and colleague, during these difficult times. On behalf of myself, my wife, Noelene, and the WA parliamentary Labor Party, I wish Peter fair winds, calm seas and above all a peaceful voyage. feel about someone who has had a real impact on your life here in federal parliament. I first met Peter when I started working for Senator Michael Tate back in 1988. I was just an electorate officer and occasionally I would wander up to Old Parliament House and be involved in what was then called the Centre Left faction. I remember going to a meeting in Melbourne and, as an electorate officer, listening to the wisdom of the so-called wise men who made up the Centre Left-and there were quite a few of them in those days. I remember then coming up and sitting in some of the committee rooms when we moved up to this place and once again seeing the men and women at the table discussing issues of national importance, taking in those gems of wisdom, thinking about them and perhaps changing my idea about what contribution I might make if I ever got up here. I well remember coming up here in 1993 as a raw backbencher and moving from the advisers’ seats up to the main desk and thinking to myself, ‘How can I contribute pearls of wisdom to these people?’ One of those people was Peter. I know when we write the next chapter of the history of our party Peter will feature greatly because he has made a magnificent contribution to the Australian Labor Party, not just in Western Australia but nationally. He was the sort of bloke who would listen to all the various points of view put around the table and then had that wonderful capacity to sum up, point out the deficiencies in the nicest way of some of the arguments that had been put forward and then come up with what in most cases we agreed was the position we should take.

197,Mr Quick (Franklin) (6.22 Pm),"It is really hard to encapsulate in a few words what you‘Cookie’, as he was lovingly called, was a wonderful bloke. He was one of those mentors, one of those role models whom you meet only once or twice in your life. I consider him to be one of my mentors in the 13 years that I have been in this place. He would not dogmatically tell you what to do, how to do it and why you should do it; he was just there, as I said before, with pearls of wisdom, channelling, directing, and challenging you to think about issues. Much has been mentioned about his wonderful wife, Barbara. There are many examples in history of two people working together in such a way that it has a dramatic impact not only on their family and their state but also on their nation and on so many other people. I have had the pleasure of enjoying their hospitality in Mandurah at that lovely house down on the beach. One of the regrets for me is that Peter never made it back to Mandurah. Rod Sawford, the member for Port Adelaide and I, with the permission of the whip, ventured up to the Mater Hospital recently to see Peter and spend a day with him in Sydney. Despite the fact that there were tubes coming out of a whole lot of orifices and there were bags hanging off him in two or three different positions, he was determined to get out of there, to feel the sun on his face and to feel the breeze. He was confident that he would get back to WA to see the sea that he loved. He was happy knowing that he had sailed his boat part of the way from Western Australia up to the Northern Territory. It is really hard, as I said at the outset, to say what is in your heart about someone who you really loved, who had an enormous impact on your life. He will always be there even though he has gone. We will send him off next week-most of our party and the former Prime Ministers who had the pleasure of serving with him in the Hawke and Keating governments. People have spoken today about the fact that he is taking the next journey. I know where he has gone. He will be happy. We are always going to be there for Barbara. It is going to be tough. I say to his family that you have known a wonderful person whom you can remember for the rest of your lives. He has made a wonderful contribution to Western Australia and Australia and on the world stage he is held in great admiration and respect. Barb and his family have my sincere condolences for the loss of a wonderful man. Sixty-two years is far too short a lifetime but he has contributed more in those 62 years than most of us could ever contribute in several lifetimes. mate. I, along with many others in this place, am going to sorely miss him. My wife Carmen and I offer our condolences to Barbara and his family. On a number of occasions over recent years we thoroughly enjoyed the hospitality of the Cooks both in Perth and Mandurah, which the member for Franklin referred to. It is a delightful place where Peter was very much at home and full of vigour and life. Peter and Barbara were and are amazing people. Peter’s superb political and policy skills were very much complemented by this very great zest for life. He was a man who loved the outdoors and had a particular passion for the sea and sailing. It was my privilege over recent years to have shared in a number of aspects of both his professional life here as a politician and also some of his outdoor sea based pursuits. Others have referred to Peter’s achievements both as a minister and as a parliamentarian. In a number of crucial areas, particularly in committee work in this parliament, Peter made a very considerable mark. Others have referred to the role he played on the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee on the GST and a new tax system inquiry, on the Senate Select Committee on A Certain Maritime Incident, the MAIN COMMITTEE",168,Condolences
198,Mr Sercombe (Maribyrnong) (6.28 Pm),"Peter Cook was a great friend, indeed a‘children overboard’ inquiry, and so on. From my point of view, given my role as a shadow minister with a particular interest in Pacific affairs, Peter made a very substantial contribution. In 2003, Peter chaired the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into Australia’s relations with Papua New Guinea and the island states of the South Pacific. The committee report A Pacific engaged: Australia’s relationship with Papua New Guinea and the island states of the south-west Pacific, very much underpinned Peter Cook’s leadership, direction and chairmanship of that committee and made some extraordinarily powerful recommendations about taking forward Australia’s relationships within the South Pacific region. A key aspect of the report was the proposal for a Pacific political and economic community. It is an absolutely seminal idea which, in my capacity as a shadow minister and always noting Peter’s role as the author, I have taken forward, producing an ALP discussion paper on Pacific islands policy. It picks up this concept, which originated very much with Peter Cook. In the course of preparing that report, Peter travelled extensively through the Pacific. I know from my subsequent travel there that he has an unsurpassed reputation in that region among leaders-political, social and economic-for the creative ideas that he drove very much through that Senate report. I was always intrigued after the production of that report to have accompanied Peter to a number of seminars at places like the ANU where his ideas were developed and reinforced. He certainly had a very substantial impact on thinking within Australia, both in the policy and academic areas and among Pacific islands leaders. Peter never shied away from the tough ideas or the crucial issues. For example, one of the very interesting ideas that Peter pushed through the report A Pacific engaged, on a bipartisan basis, was the notion of trialling temporary short-term access for limited numbers of Pacific islanders to work in Australia, typically in seasonal employment. Given Peter’s own background, this was a tough area for him to address, but he understood the crucial and unavoidable nature of the proposal, emanating from Pacific communities. He was prepared to give very strong credibility to that proposal in the context of his thinking about the development of a Pacific community, so crucial to Australia, given our geographic proximity to that region. Tough ideas like that need considerable selling in the Australian community. He was never one to shy away from taking tough decisions when they were needed. Peter was a role model for many people in this place, including me, and a role model for people elsewhere. His life was far too short but it was a wonderful life. He has left his mark on many of us forever. was deeply saddened when I heard of the death of my friend and colleague Peter Cook on Saturday. I extend to his wife, Barbara, and his family my deepest sympathy on his passing. He will be sorely missed among friends and members of this great parliament. It is fitting that this parliament pay such a tribute to Peter Cook because he was a parliamentarian of great intellectual substance and public stature, and had consummate political skill-personal and professional attributes that have been acknowledged by both sides of the House in this condolence motion. Much has been said already about Peter Cook’s industrial and political career-a career that spanned decades and brought him to great service on behalf of all Australians in this parliament. In government he served in many ministerial capacities: as Minister for Resources, Minister for Industrial Relations, Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Minister for MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Condolences
199,Mr Gavan O’connor (Corio) (6.33 Pm),"I rise to support the condolence motion. ITrade, Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters. He had an enormous range of portfolios and he equipped himself very well in everything that he tackled. He was a great contributor to the life of the Senate in various capacities, both in debate and on committees, and was widely regarded for his capacity for political detail and his strategic political thinking, be that in the Labor Party itself or for Australia generally. He grew up in the industrial movement, a tough operator who, down through the years, made many friends as well as many enemies-as we all do in this place. But there was one thing both friend and foe shared in their view of Peter Cook: they respected his knowledge and his skill in not only handling people but managing the wider political task. I entered the parliament in 1993 and I had three years in government when I was able to observe Peter Cook in his role as a government minister and as a senior member of the federal parliamentary Labor caucus. My first impressions of Peter were of a serious and very credible minister who was, as many have termed it, a workhorse for the government. I came to know him more intimately in opposition when the internal realignments of groups within the Labor caucus brought us into close orbit and personal contact. Peter Cook possessed political skills that were honed in many years of active service in the industrial wing of the Labor movement and later in the political wing. He possessed an encyclopaedic knowledge of the history and personalities of the Labor movement. He was a gifted strategic thinker, borne of hard years of policy development and the execution of it in government. He was a very practical man, always dealing with the art of the possible. He was a brilliant negotiator-another skill honed on the way through his political life, and which was eventually brought to bear with consummate effect for the benefit of all Australians in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. He was a true Australian patriot, never surrendering the independence of this nation as a minister or as a senator in those negotiations that he conducted on Australia’s behalf. He was politically tough but very patient with rookies like me when we entered this parliament. When we look at his party and union involvements, once again we can understand the stature that Peter had within the Labor movement. He rose to become Secretary of the Western Australian Trades and Labour Council and Vice-President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The party positions? Well, he occupied almost all of them: Convenor, State Industrial Relations Committee; Delegate, ALP Federal Conference; Member, ALP National Executive; and Member, ALP National Executive Committee. He was also a member of the Western Australian state executive. It was an extraordinary breadth of experience and he really brought to bear a unique insight into the political process because he was master of the machinations that took place in the union movement. There were very few politicians within the Labor Party who understood the various machinations of the senior executive levels of the party. It was in that role that he became a force for moderation, balance and strategic thinking when others were going about pursuing their own political ambitions at the expense of the party. Here in the parliament, he was a great strategic planner and thinker for Labor both in government and in opposition. I believe it was that unique combination that made Peter Cook one of the most outstanding parliamentary contributors and performers over the past two decades in this place. It was only in the later years that I came to know him in a personal sense. MAIN COMMITTEE For those who understand the machinations of the Labor Party, we have two rather large groupings. In the middle of those two large groupings are some independents and other people from various groups that have existed historically in the party. Those groups came together to form an independent group, a balancing group, within the Labor Party’s caucus. It was in this role that Peter played an extraordinary part in counselling and guiding members such as me in the art of staying alive in the ALP. He also brought these great skills to bear for the benefit of the caucus in moderating the excesses that sometimes occur with the concentrations of power and the massive egos that often dominate the political stage. He recognised the importance of a centre balancing group within the caucus and the party structure. He gave great guidance and wise counsel. He was a mentor to us all. I never got to sail on his ocean yacht. I happen to have an interest in yachting. When Peter found that out, he issued an invitation to visit him in Perth once he had left the parliament, to spend a weekend there and to take me sailing. I looked forward to that because it was an opportunity to get to know a man whom I had not got to know completely in the years that I had spent with him here in the parliament. My eternal regret is that I never got to Western Australia to join him on the yacht, to drink a few reds out on the ocean and to chew the fat on what was going on in the Labor Party and the nation. He was a person whom I think everybody around this House respected for his wise counsel. It will be in that capacity politically that he will be sorely missed. He knew the realities of political life. When the challenge came to his preselection he fought hard, but he knew the realities of the Labor Party and it was to our crowning disappointment in the Centre group that Peter was defeated. We knew in that defeat that the caucus had lost a very valuable contributor to political debate and to the management of egos and other matters in the caucus. It was the same tenacity that he brought to his struggle against cancer. Indeed, I think his struggle for preselection became a metaphor for his later struggle against cancer. I had the good fortune to speak with Peter about his illness and, like many others, I preferred to him a person who I believe might have been able to help him on that journey. It was a very difficult journey, but I know from people who were closely associated with his struggle that he brought all the magnificent qualities to bear on it and gave great dignity and indeed great hope to those around him. As Peter Cook could only do, his latter days were spent in the service of other Australians-that is, politically bringing a focus to the issue of cancer and the impact it has on families and bringing a focus to possible treatments that people might be able to avail themselves of in facing this terrible disease. Most of all, he joined this struggle with Barbara. What a wonderful person we have all come to know in the Labor movement. This was a couple who were loved dearly by their fellow parliamentarians and associates. That love now extends to Barbara in Peter’s spirit to support her through a most difficult time. In concluding my comments, the Labor Party has lost a great friend and a great warrior for the cause. To Barbara let me simply say this: as sure as night turns into day, as the sun has set on Peter’s life the sadness of this moment will gradually be replaced by warm memories of a great political life and a great life together. MAIN COMMITTEE Ms GILLARD (Lalor) (6.46 pm)-I rise to speak on this condolence motion in respect of the Hon. Peter Cook. I first met Peter Cook when I came to this parliament as a backbencher in 1998. I first worked with him on the GST inquiry, which was referred to in the condolence speeches by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Hotham today. It was an opportunity to get to know Peter and to see his formidable political skills in operation. I also had the opportunity to work with him in that period, as I was deputy chair of our caucus committee on national security and trade and he, as shadow minister at that time, held the trade portfolio. As people may recall, one of the biggest political debates we had at that national conference in that period of opposition was the debate about free trade versus fair trade, as it was stylised. I got to see once again Peter’s great political skills at work in resolving that issue for the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party. But it was in the last parliament-not my first parliament but my second parliament-that Peter and I became friends. I believe that we became friends because of a common understanding about the kind of values that one should bring to one’s life in politics. Peter understood the value of loyalty, the need for originality and the need to have the courage of your convictions. It is because of our shared belief in those things-the value of loyalty, the need for originality and the need to have the courage of your convictions-that we came to be personal friends in the last parliament. I also had the opportunity to meet his family. I met not only his wife Barbara, about which much has rightfully been said-she is a truly amazing woman and every attribute of her strength and her character has been displayed in the way in which she has cared for Peter in this most tragic period-but also other members of his family, and it was my very great honour to launch the painting and drawing exhibition of Peter’s brother. Bill Cook is an artist and he had created an exhibition called The Presence of Absence-a Greek Odyssey. It was a painting and drawing exhibition in honour of his wife and his wife’s family, who were Greek migrants to this nation. So in the last parliament I had the opportunity not only to get to know Peter but to share events like that with Peter, his brother Bill and his extended family who were all gathered together. That will always be a very special memory for me. In the period since Peter was diagnosed with the illness which tragically has taken his life, I have had the opportunity to meet and deal with him on a number of occasions. I have had the opportunity to dine with him in Canberra and to visit him in hospital. I have had the opportunity to share some social time with Barb, who was in Sydney caring for him for such an extended period. But, beyond this, I had the opportunity to work with him on the cancer policy, about which so much has been said in this condolence debate. I think it says something very special about Peter Cook that, having been given the worse possible news about the state of his health, he did not withdraw and turn inwards but dedicated much of his remaining strength to publicly raising the issue of cancer care on behalf of all cancer patients. He did this within this parliament before his term as senator expired, but he also did it beyond this parliament. Once again, a very special memory for me is the launch of Labor’s cancer prevention policy, which I devised with Peter Cook in Perth in my capacity as shadow minister for health during the last election campaign. At that stage Peter was very unwell, but he was prepared to take part in a public discussion of his health, partly because he wanted to do what he could within the confines of his strength at that time to support Labor’s election to government. Obviously, the cause of Labor was something in which he passionately believed. MAIN COMMITTEE He also wanted to use some of his strength to raise clearly with Australians the cancer prevention message. Peter’s illness started off as a melanoma. He was exposed to the harsh WA sun for long periods as a young man, particularly because of his love of water sports and yachting at a time when it was not clear to us and certainly not understood in a public health way that the sun was so dangerous. We have seen a revolution in community understanding and community attitudes to sun exposure in the last 10 or 15 years. But when Peter Cook was a young man, out there on the yacht and undertaking a variety of sports in the harsh and unforgiving sun of South Australia and Western Australia, where he grew up and where he spent most of his life, that was not someone not heeding health messages; at that stage the health messages were not known. He has paid such a terrible price for that. He wanted, in the course of advocating a cancer prevention message in the last campaign, to make sure it was clearly understood by young Australians, who can often feel bulletproof-particularly young men, who never think anything is ever going to happen to them-that there is a terrible price to be paid for not understanding how dangerous sun exposure can be. He not only undertook that activity but, as has been said by others, he spent much of his remaining time post diagnosis, when he was still in this parliament, raising the issue of cancer care through a bipartisan inquiry conducted by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee. When the report of the Senate inquiry was released, Peter said this, and I think it stands as a testament to what he was trying to achieve through that inquiry: … in my experience people diagnosed with cancer often have to make life affecting decisions at short notice, in a traumatised state of mind with very little information about the range of options available to them. Specialist health care in Australia is among the best in the world but there is a bewildering number of adjuvant therapies and less conventional approaches which offer varying degrees of help, some over stated some not, which can be significant, if not decisive in aiding the healing process. Patients often need assistance in assessing how these stack up and which of them might provide help. … … … The health debate is understandably dominated by Doctors, health care professionals, health bureaucrats and academics all with the apparent needs of the patients at heart but with transparent self interests of their own. If this Inquiry can stand in the shoes of patients, and unambiguously take their point of view it will be a breath of fresh air. The report, entitled The cancer journey: informing choice, was filed on 23 June 2005, just before Peter left the Senate. It received 105 submissions and conducted seven hearings. The report makes a number of very sensible recommendations and it is my hope that we can work together in a bipartisan fashion to make sure that these are implemented as Peter’s lasting legacy. I raised this matter with the Minister for Health and Ageing personally on Friday and through text messaging during the weekend. I believe that the minister is seriously looking at this matter and is considering adopting some or all of the recommendations of the report in memory of Peter. I would particularly stress the need to adopt a Medicare item to ensure multidisciplinary case conferencing, because it was Peter’s experience that when a patient is trying to coordinate the vast array of advice into a treatment plan it is the patient who ends up navigating between the doctors. It is really the doctors who should get together and navigate a pathway for MAIN COMMITTEE the patient, and if doctors could be paid to do that it could revolutionise the way in which cancer care is provided so that people find out all of their options far more easily, without having to struggle through it the way Peter struggled through it. As Peter would so often say, he is a man who brought to that task every advantage. He was an intelligent man, an experienced man, a man who had been in public policy all his life and a man who had contacts all around the country. And if he found it difficult to navigate that pathway, then clearly this is almost impossible for someone who comes without those advantages. We will miss Peter Cook. We will miss him dreadfully. If we can, in his memory, initiate that kind of change for cancer care, then that will be a lasting testament to his life’s journey. spoke about the values of Peter Cook. That is where I am going to start: where those values actually came from. We were both children of waterside workers in Port Adelaide and we were such stunning individuals as young 10and 11-year-olds we did not recognise each other at the wharfies’ picnics that were held at Largs Bay beach each year. We both embellished the stories about who won the sprint races. I won them; he swore he won them. But I do remember one year when a girl beat both of us. She was not allowed to be in the race, so she raced outside the lanes and beat both of us. The context of the 1950s established Peter’s values, and for us in Port Adelaide they were times of strikes and poverty. People have talked about Peter’s stoicism. Let me tell a story about what happened at that time. Some of the strikes lasted for three and four months. There was no income. I remember my father sitting in a rocking chair, reading a book and smoking a roll-your-own cigarette. I said to him, ‘There’s no food in the house,’ and he looked down over his glasses at me and said, ‘It won’t kill you,’ and continued reading. A couple of days later we walked the five miles to Port Adelaide from where we lived in Largs North to collect our rations-sugar, flour, bread, a pound of meat and some butter, soup vegetables and maybe a few apples. That lasted our family of three for a week. Peter’s family would have been the same. Poverty was part of the life that we lived. But stoicism was part of that Midlands and Scottish heritage that we shared, and I will come back to that stoicism a little later. This was also a period of great change. Peter was a great advocate of trying to deal with change. As kids we would not have understood it at the time, but Port Adelaide was going through a tremendous change. There were 3,000 wharf labourers and 1,000 casual labourers. I can remember my father saying to me that within a short period of time-he did not call it containerisation; he did not use the term-there will only be 300 wharfies in Port Adelaide. In fact it turned out to be 100. It was a time of dramatic change. I remember the debates within our families-they were always about politics. There were strong arguments, and in our family we talked about religion. We had very strong religious views-Protestant, Catholic and nonaligned. I remember on one occasion when I was about 12 years old saying to my grandfather, sick of the arguments about politics and religion, ‘How come we never have any sensible conversations about sex?’ I remember the backhander coming very quickly and I never mentioned that again. Peter’s family was similar. Politics was always spoken about, argued about and valued. The commitment that Peter always had to change, and that change can benefit people, came from when we were young men. We played football together-not on the same side. Although he MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Condolences
200,Mr Sawford (Port Adelaide) (6.56 Pm),"It is interesting that the member for Lalorwas the son of a Port Adelaide wharfie, he actually played senior Colts for North Adelaidewe always used to regard them as a B-grade Labor club but, nevertheless, a Labor club. I suppose the next time. I met Peter was in the context of factional politics within the Australian Labor Party and the formation of the Centre Left. I was not a founding member of the Centre Left; I was Mick Young’s campaign director at the time. I thought the Centre Left was just as silly as the other two factions, to be quite honest, and I was not a member. But eventually I did join that group and watched Peter’s contribution. He was a heavy hitter, and he was an original thinker. From 1996 I actually shared accommodation with Peter at Kingston. In the first couple of years, we shared with David Beddall, the former member for Rankin, and then with Harry Quick, the member for Franklin. Later, Peter and I shifted out of Kingston and moved to Palmerston, that terrible place out there on the highway-it would take us about an hour to get in in the morning. We argued about the formation of the independents and, with Michael Duffy of the non-aligned group, we actually formed the independents in 1996-97. Gavan O’Connor, the member for Corio, and I were the first co-chairs of that. When we lived together, there were not many people in the Senate other than from your own state that you developed a close relationship with. We seemed to operate at different hours. We both had a couple of agenda items: I was trying to give up smoking in 1996; he was trying to give up eating. We all talked about the ‘push away’ technique, which of course is the only technique to stop smoking or eating too much. You can see I gave up smoking for eight years, but I have not managed the ‘give up eating’ part. We used to have nightly briefings at the end, at 11 or 12 o’clock at night, and we ate toast and tea and fruit loaf and tea-far too much. We talked personally, politically, professionally and procedurally. We would talk about our beginnings. We talked about the waterfront in Port Adelaide and how things had changed. We talked about change, strikes, football, sailing, horseracing, religion, poverty, race and gender. We talked about our heritage in terms of a special humour that we enjoyed coming from port cities, a Midlands humour in which you juxtapose one given against another and you just drive in a punchline. They tell stories of your childhood, your first job, falling in love, getting married, difficulties in marriage and death. MaybeI should give a couple of examples of these sorts of silly folksy stories, because they epitomise that stoic sort of view that we both enjoyed and both had imbued in us. There is a little kid crying on the corner of Dale Street in Port Adelaide in the middle of the Depression. The vicar comes past and he says, ‘Why are you crying?’ The kid says, ‘My parents are fighting.’ The vicar says, ‘Who’s your father?’ He says, ‘That’s what they’re fightin’ about.’ There are stories about death as well: there is a death in the family and no-one has dealt with a funeral before. Mum calls in all the family and she says to everybody, ‘Well, Mum’s left no instructions as to whether Grandma is to be embalmed, cremated, buried or whatever.’ And the husband pipes up, ‘Take no chances: do all three.’ That was the humour. Some people do not understand it; others do. He had a great thrill also in learning and knowledge. It is interesting that the debates on education in this country often focus on a knowledge economy and knowledge in education, which, for someone from my background, is a load of nonsense in many ways. Knowledge is a lowly intellectual skill. Peter came to a much more pragmatic view about what education MAIN COMMITTEE could do and how it could change. He understood it was a lowly intellectual skill. His skills were in being able to expose a point, to translate, to interpret, to predict, to summarise, to identify the attributes in an issue and to categorise. He had insight, intuition and analysis skills. He was very methodical; he was innovative; he was original. He could find a way through a problem. That is why he was so successful in negotiation and so hard-nosed, so determined and so strong an advocate of the issues that he stood for. But, as Julia Gillard mentioned, those skills were softened also, because he had a particular courage, loyalty, integrity and honesty, and he respected other people who had those skills and reciprocated them. He was not averse to publicity though-he loved a bit of publicity. I remember the competitive efforts put in by his staff, in particular a tall, gangly New Zealander called Don McKay who was a press secretary to Peter. The competition was with Gareth Evans’s office as to who would get the serious stories in the serious press-not the tabloid nonsense, the real stories. It was funny to watch and funny to listen to him retelling those stories, particularly late at night, when he could be self-deprecating in a way that other people perhaps did not see. But I also enjoyed bringing him back to earth in those nightly meetings. He would always start off resolutely defending the position that he took. It did not last too long before he burst out laughing and came back to earth. Since Peter and I lived together for a number of years from 1996, our wives got to know each other very well. We shared a lot of family stories. Barbara-what an amazing woman. She connected with Peter intellectually, emotionally, physically and spiritually. That latter element in particular will never die. That goes on eternally, ethereally. It is in the ether; it remains; it continues on with all the people that he has affected and mentored and appointed and befriended. When things were not going too well-and there were times before his illness when things were not going too well for our group and we were getting dudded all the timewe used to console each and say, ‘We weren’t too bad for sons of Port Adelaide wharfies, after all. When it is all said and done, it isn’t too bad.’ Well, Peter, it was not too bad at all. As I said, Peter Cook was a heavy hitter, but that does not mean he could not be wounded. All of us can be wounded in this game, and wounded he was-by treachery and betrayal that so dominated his last attempt at securing a further term in the Senate. It should not have been that way, but it was. We do terrible things to each other in this game of politics, and terrible things were done to Peter’s reputation at that time. We shall never know its true impact on his health. It may have been considerable; it may not have been. But if it was considerable, we should take his passing and that of other people in this place as some cause for reflection and regret. Peter had dreams like all of us-the Mandurah house on the ocean where we shared accommodation, meals, a few drinks and a few laughs with other colleagues, such as Harry Quick, Bob Sercombe, the late Jane Gerick and many others. And there was the yacht. They no longer will carry any earthly domain, but they will carry Peter’s spirit forever. I suppose that, when is all said and done, the pawn and the king finish up in the same box. But Peter Cook, I think, was a giant of the labour movement. Even that is reduced to other things. When all is said and done, in this place, on this earth, it is the friendships and the quality of the relationships that you develop throughout your life that continue to mark your life far more than anything else. The friendships that Barbara and Peter developed, maintained and cherished throughout their life will remain. Hopefully, they will sustain Barbara in this difficult time of grief. MAIN COMMITTEE Peter Cook’s was a life cut short but a life well lived and a life to celebrate in the quiet pride that his heritage will determine. Vale Peter Cook. Bye. See you some time later. Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (7.11 pm)-I join in the debate on the condolence motion commenced earlier today with the contribution made by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives. I mourn the passing of Peter Cook, as do many people across this nation. He was a good man, a man of deep conviction and principle, a man of integrity, a man of formidable intellect and a charismatic personality. Cookie was a friend of many years, dating back to our days together in the union movement and more recently when our paths crossed as colleagues in parliament. He was always a person of good sense-a person of good sense but also one with a great sense of humour. He was generous in spirit and optimistic by nature. This morning he was described by our leader, Kim Beazley, as a man of ‘ordered passion’. I have certainly seen the passion in Peter, but it is true to say that he never just wore his heart on his sleeve: as committed as he was to a range of social justice causes, he was a great strategic thinker, a good negotiator and a man, as I say, who always had integrity in his dealings with people. It was his optimism that gave him the strength and the courage to face the battle against the cancer which took his life all too soon, at the age of 62. Glancing at many of the obituaries written this morning, I was struck by a particular headline which read ‘Political life a labour of love’. It is true. Peter Cook loved the labour movement and served it with great distinction in both its industrial and political wings. He never lost sight of his roots and was always a staunch defender of working people and their families. It is not surprising that his working class background helped to shape the nature of the man and his convictions. His grandfather was a Broken Hill miner blacklisted for his union activities who died from consumption at the age of 26. His father-as Rod Sawford, the member for Port Adelaide, has commented-was a waterside worker. The Sawford family and the Cook family shared many attributes. Peter left school at a very young age-15. But that was never a barrier to the immense contribution he made throughout his working life. His union involvement began in the clerks union in South Australia, working then as a clerk in an abattoir. He moved to Western Australia with his young family in 1970. By force of personality and hard work, by 1975 he had risen through the ranks to become Secretary of the Western Australia Trades and Labour Council. It was during this period that I came to know him well as a friend and colleague. I well remember the election in 1981 in Sydney at the town hall when he was elected as Vice President of the ACTU. I hope in some small way I assisted in that outcome, which saw his rightful elevation to a position of prominence in the national union movement. Peter and I had cause to reflect on that experience in 1981 when, as a relatively young woman in the union movement, I ended up on a ticket with Peter Cook and John Halfpenny and I was in the third spot. I spent a whole day going around telling my colleagues from the teachers union that it was very important that they did not put me as No. 1 on that ticket and that, in order for Peter to be elected, it was vital that I had no first preferences in the ballot. The teachers were somewhat perplexed about this, never having been part of a broader union movement or understanding the importance of tickets, but, as it was, they did the right thing: they voted for Peter and Peter was elected to the position of Vice-President of the ACTU. MAIN COMMITTEE In total, he served the trade union movement with distinction for some 17 years before he decided to move to the federal political arena. In 1983 he was elected to the Senate and gave 22 years of dedicated public service in that chamber until his retirement in 2005. Peter was always an effective team player. He was never one to just sing about his own contribution. As others have commented, he served the Hawke and Keating governments in a range of portfolios, including industrial relations and trade and as Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. He was a cabinet minister for six of those years and also served with distinction as Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. In his departing speech in the Senate, Peter Cook had this to say about his career: IfI have a high point of my career, I am proud of … the industrial relations reforms, but I think the proudest is sitting behind the Australian flag … in the closing stages of the Uruguay Round and, on behalf of Australia and the Cairns Group, negotiating a successful outcome. I remember very well Peter’s position as minister in the IR portfolio. By that time. I had also advanced in my career in the union movement and I had cause to deal with Peter on a range of industrial relations issues. He held the portfolio of industrial relations longer than any other portfolio and was rightly proud of his achievements. I again quote from his Senate speech. He said: Industrial relations was a portfolio that I held longer than any other. In that, we wrote a new industrial relations act-the first new industrial relations act since 1904. We took the first steps towards a decentralised wage-fixing system. We introduced the best practice program in which we went to workplaces and encouraged cooperation rather than conflict. Under the guidance of John Prescott, then the general manager of BHP, we created reform in the workplace by having an emphasis on skill and training and by managers flattening the hierarchy down to one or two and relying on the workers’ knowledge of how best to run their plant. That program succeeded in increasing productivity quite dramatically. The brains of the work force was harnessed rather than alienated in the exercise of the push by particular companies to achieve success. I think that was a great scheme. I concur with those comments. I think one of Peter’s lasting legacies will be his key role in moving to a more deregulated industrial relations system, one which nevertheless protected all working people, as was his commitment, by enshrining the award system as the industrial safety net. He always cared about those with the least bargaining capacity. This morning I read Cookie’s first speech in the Senate, a speech he made on 4 May 1983. That speech covered some of Peter’s long-held commitments and principles. In that speech, as a newly elected member of the Senate, he reflected on the national economic summit that tried to bring people together rather than on the conflict and the division that we had seen in the lead-up to the summit. He talked about the positive aspects of the prices and incomes policy approach that, as we know, underpinned the historic accord agreement between Labor and the union movement. He talked about the issue of taxes and, with a classic quote that is so much Peter, he said: The essential problem is not to make the rich pay higher rates of tax than the poor. It is to make the rich pay any income tax at all. Those comments were prophetic and still as true today as they were when he said them in 1983. He talked in his first speech about the importance of the union movement and its importance particularly to maintaining the living standards of all Australians. He talked with some MAIN COMMITTEE conviction about the issue of job security, an issue that is still very much with us today. He ended his speech with his pledge to work hard to ensure world peace and nuclear disarmament-issues that he carried with him throughout his life. The last thing that I did pick up in his speech-and I had not been aware of the comments he made then, but it says something about the man back in 1983 when the promotion of women in public life was not so much a mainstream issue as it is today-was his comments on the then recent state election that had been held in Western Australia and the federal election. He was really proud of the fact that a number of women had won seats with huge swings-seats that had never been held by Labor before. He commented also on the achievements of his colleague Wendy Fatin, in the federal seat of Canning, who came to the House with a 13 per cent swing. I would just like to read some extracts from that speech. About the increased representation of women, Peter said: Some observations can be made about those figures. Firstly, the figures indicate that the affirmative action program of the Australian Labor Party in selecting women candidates is successful. Secondly, the result removes completely and, I believe, for all time any suggestion that women candidates cannot succeed in being elected to office. Thirdly, it may even open the question that women candidates are a positive advantage to the political party they represent. As I say, those comments were made at a time when the issue of women’s representation in political life was not part of the mainstream agenda and were certainly made before Labor instituted constitutional changes to ensure that this parliament better reflected the community that we are here to represent. When Peter was diagnosed with cancer he explained then that his dominant emotion was one of shock and numbing disbelief. He said: Most of my time in politics, I’d been in economic portfolios. I’d spent virtually zero time worrying about health issues. I found myself naked and alone at the bottom of a very steep learning curve, wondering: how do I deal with a problem that I know very little about? As we all know, Peter, in his formidable manner, tenaciously turned adversity to advantage. They were the words used by the member for Hotham in his contribution this morning in the House, and I thought those comments ‘adversity to advantage’ were so true. In his last months as a senator, as we know, he was instrumental in setting up an inquiry which looked at the myriad treatment options for cancer patients and encouraged politicians to work to help people find more effective ways of fighting the disease-a disease that ultimately claimed his life. As Peter presented the report of the inquiry on his final day in the Senate, he said: When I was diagnosed I knew nothing about the disease. Initially it was a frightening and frustrating experience. With little or no knowledge I had to make life-critical decisions in an urgent time frame. Faced with that immense task it is very easy to despair and give up. And so it would be, but not for Peter Cook. He said: I have learnt that there is no such thing as a silver bullet here-no single, one solution-and that the answer, if there is one, lies in integrating a number of treatments. He commented in that speech that he had sat on numerous inquiries-very important inquiries dealing with the GST and the issue of the ‘children overboard’-but that this inquiry may ‘well be the most important inquiry I have sat on.’ I trust the government will respond promptly and comprehensively to the recommendations of the report and, in doing so, provide MAIN COMMITTEE a lasting legacy to the years of devoted public service given to the people of this nation by Senator Peter Cook. In concluding, I join with all earlier speakers in paying tribute to Peter’s wife, Barbara. She was his tower of strength, and I know from my personal conversations with Peter how indebted he was to her, not just in their dreadful struggle with his cancer and through those dark, black days but in their loving and productive personal and political relationship that helped ensure that Senator Peter Cook was able to make a very significant contribution to public life in this country. bution of the honourable member for Throsby. I wish I could stand before you and say that I knew Peter Cook very well. AlthoughI had served in the caucus for many years with him, I cannot make that claim, but there are a number of claims I can make. The late Senator Peter Cook was very much a product of the labour movement and the trade union arena, where he served in the highest positions-as the Secretary of the Western Australia Trades and Labour Council and as Vice-President of the ACTU. Never once did Peter deny his involvement with the trade union movement. On the contrary, he was always proud of it. He started off life as a fitter and turner-in crude working class language, we would say a ‘titter and feeler’-but he added to that by undertaking a university course. He served in the parliament for so long. It was only on 1 July this year that he retired. He had such a short retirement. The member for Throsby mentioned his period as the Minister for Industrial Relations. It was a period of great change. It was not one where we tried to divide the bosses from the workers; in fact, it was quite the reverse. We got rid of so many demarcation disputes. The one statistic that I would like to quote is that in the automotive industry there were 304 separate awards that impacted on it. In Peter’s time, we reduced them to nine. In fact, I am fond of quoting the words of a union delegate in Tasmania. When trying to describe the breadth of the changes that Peter had initiated in industrial relations he said, ‘Prior to these changes when I clocked on at work, I was expected to leave my brains behind; but with these changes, when I clocked on at work, I was expected to bring my brains with me.’ Peter worked so hard at collapsing that traditional divide between management and the work force and at involving the work force. I have always thought that involving the work force in key decisions was the most sensible management practice. IfI think of Peter, the changes he wrought in the industrial relations system will always stay with me. It is such a contrast with what is being done today where there is almost zealotry to separate workers from management, to re-introduce the gulf, to not make workers part of the productive process. Peter was an outstanding Minister for Trade. People have talked about all he did with the Uruguay Round and establishing the Cairns Group and what a force for change that was. Indeed, it was significant. In a number of areas, the Hawke-Keating years gave to Australia a sense that we are a country capable of punching above our weight and, in trade, Peter was no exception. Of all Peter’s contributions, the thing that should stay with us is that he was prepared to so publicly share what was a tragedy. Notwithstanding all his contributions-as a relatively young man he had given long service to the trade union movement and then to the parliament as a very senior minister and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate-we should remember that he so generously shared with us the calamity of his own disease and diagnosis. MAIN COMMITTEE",175,Condolences
201,Mr Price (Chifley) (7.25 Pm),"I feel somewhat humbled following the excellent contriWhat courage he showed. WouldI have the same courage? I am not sure. I do not want to reflect on you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, but would you have the courage? I am not sure. But the thing I can say about Peter Cook is that he did have the courage. Like the member for Hotham and the Leader of the Opposition, I commend Peter’s wife, Barbara, for the services she performed. The term ‘in sickness and in health’ now has a new meaning for what Barbara did over the weeks and months of Peter’s illness. It is, I think, a renewal of the inspiration of the relationship between a man and a woman. I express my condolences to Barbara and to Peter’s four children. I think Australia is the better for the life of Senator Peter Cook. I mourn his passing. Dr LAWRENCE (Fremantle) (7.31 pm)-As I recall it, I first met Peter Cook in the early eighties when I became active in the organisation of the Australian Labor Party. He was someone on the move and subsequently became a senator for my state of Western Australia. He was very impressive and persuasive even then. I joined the group to which he belonged in the Western Australian Labor Party. If people look at Peter’s career, they will see a ministerial and parliamentary career of great substance-indeed, a career which many of us envy and seek to emulate. With his selfless service, Peter has provided a great role model for future parliamentarians. He diligently discharged his duties as a minister and a senator. He was always a flexible thinker as well-curious and well informed. Peter always had a book in his bag and was willing to ask people their opinion. He read extremely widely. Perhaps because his own education was initially curtailed, he informed himself and continued his education every day of his life. Peter Cook was intelligent and articulate-sometimes to a fault-and always a great advocate for the causes he embraced. He had a great respect for evidence; he would always test ideas against the facts. He was not doctrinaire, although he held his values strongly. He was always able to argue from first principles and make a very persuasive case. One of the things that always struck me about Peter was his unflagging energy. You have to have that to be a senator from Western Australia. The travel alone would defeat most people, but I do not think I ever heard Peter complain about that. In fact, I think he was most distressed not to continue as a senator. But, as he had always done, he made the necessary adjustments and got on with the rest of his life. Sadly, the rest of his life was not to be much longer. A lot of people have already spoken eloquently and in detail about the areas of public service for which Peter was best known-his contribution to the economic life of this nation and, in particular, industrial relations, resources and trade. He was responsible for very significant reforms, working with other ministers in the Hawke and Keating governments to transform the nation’s economy and industrial relations. But these are matters that have been well canvassed by others. I simply want to say that the contribution he has made is peerless, and I hope his family will be comforted by the fact that so many people recognise that contribution. But something that has perhaps not been made much of is the fact that Peter was always very alert to the social consequences of these reforms. He was not hard-nosed or careless about it. He understood the need to compensate those people who might have lost from the reforms and the need to support those in the community who are without power. The other thing that perhaps has not been much remarked on is the fact that he was a true internationalist, whether in relation to trade or to disarmament. He understood the need to spread the globe’s wealth. He was acutely aware of poverty and the suffering of others. I reMAIN COMMITTEE member having a discussion with him about HIV, retrovirals and the fact that a lot of the big pharmaceutical companies were very reluctant to allow their intellectual property to be diminished by providing such drugs to the Third World. He argued very strongly in favour of that move. As we have heard, he was also a strong supporter of international disarmament. Something that I discovered in making some inquiries today, as I was not aware of it, is that he understood the problems of resource depletion. As Minister for Resources he really did come to terms with the fact that there are limited resources. He also understood the problems of environmental degradation. The initiatives on salinity that he was responsible for and the attempt to reverse the damage to the Murray-Darling Basin are the basis for the work being done today; indeed, I think he was impatient with the fact that not nearly enough progress was being made. He made an unparalleled contribution to the ‘children overboard’ inquiry, as it has become known, conducted by the Senate Select Committee on A Certain Maritime Incident. We have also heard about his recent contribution to cancer support in the inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee that was to mark the end of his parliamentary career. I do hope that those responsible take up many of the recommendations of that committee. I for one have seen far too many people struggle with cancer. I simply want to say, rather than going through the details of his career, that Peter was always a man of unfailing good humour and considerable wit. He was someone with whom you would always enjoy having a conversation. He was a generous, unassuming man. He never measured his friendship. He was not the sort of person to look over your shoulder to see who in the room might be more important. He was generous to a fault, and I certainly had reason to notice that when I had difficulties of my own. I want to pass on my sincere condolences to Barbara, to his children and to their extended family. I know how difficult this period has been for them with Peter’s extended and very painful illness. I know that they will miss him in ways that we cannot imagine, but I hope that they will be somewhat comforted by the fact that so many people had so much regard for him and his work. long, long time by any measure and in anyone’s language, but for those who travel from the west and back again on a regular basis I think it is an enormous period of time. The pressure it puts on the physical well-being and on the family unit is something that can only really be contemplated by those who have endured that trek backwards and forwards. So Peter Cook’s commitment to public life in Canberra was very much a physical one but, more important than that, it was an intellectual one. As so many speakers before me have said, few people could match the intellectual contribution in this place of one former senator: Peter Cook. Peter and I probably had more in common than he realised, and I regret in a sense that I had not ever at any time discussed that with him. You think of these things too late. Like Peter, I was a tradesman, someone who left school at a relatively young age, keen to do a trade and to work with my hands. Like Peter, I know that it is an experience that I would never relinquish. I remain proud of my time in my trade and the real life experiences it delivered to me and the way in which that contributed to the development of my being and personality. I know that Peter would say the same thing of his own experiences. Peter was a rebel in a sense, and I consider myself a nonconformist from time to time. Peter always stood up for what he believed in, which were always those things that conformed with Labor principles, and I like to MAIN COMMITTEE",181,Condolences
202,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (7.37 Pm),"Serving 22 years in the national parliament is athink that I do the same thing. At the same time, like me, he understood that times change and that the way in which Labor ceased to successfully implement its principles changed, as the world changes. I am sure that Peter would agree that he saw it that way as well. His strict adherence to Labor tradition and Labor Party policy and principles will, of course, go unchallenged. I would like tonight to briefly speak for a few people who are not here that I know would like to make a contribution to this condolence debate-all of them colleagues of Peter Cook and two of them former cabinet colleagues. The first is Paul Keating, who I know had a very high regard for Peter Cook and considered him a valued part of his government. The second is Laurie Brereton, who of course also shared a time in the cabinet with Peter Cook and who I know valued his friendship very strongly. I know they have their own opportunities to express their sympathies to Peter’s family, but I know that they would appreciate being acknowledged as people who were very close to Peter Cook over those many years. The third is Mark Latham, the former Leader of the Opposition, who again, I know, like me and so many in this place, developed a very high regard and respect for Peter Cook in the period in which he was in this place. I know the feelings were mutual, and I know that Peter Cook saw in Mark Latham great potential and that he was very supportive of Mark’s work in this place. I know that Mark would want to acknowledge Peter Cook’s wise counsel, advice and guidance in the period when Mark Latham was leader of the party in this place. Peter Cook spent most of his life working in the interests of others not only in this place but, prior to that, as an active member of the trade union movement. Ironic is not the right word, but it is typical of Peter Cook that he spent his last months with us working for those who would follow him, working in support of those who will face the challenges posed by that terrible disease we have not really come to terms with and which, in a generic form, we describe as cancer. Like so many other people in this place, I feel very pleased to have known Peter Cook, to have been a colleague of Peter Cook and to have been a friend of Peter Cook. I was speaking at a local ALP branch meeting just yesterday when I moved a motion asking the branch to acknowledge the great contribution of Peter Cook and to express its sympathy on the occasion of his passing. I made the point there that you meet many people in politics, many and varied in their personalities and many and varied in their depth of contribution to public debate, but that those that really stand out are those who demand silence when they speak. Everyone knew that when Peter Cook wanted to say something he indeed had something to say and all would quickly listen very carefully. I think that is a very important measure of the regard in which he was held in this place and in wider circles, and we will miss him very dearly. I regret the way in which he departed this place. I thought it was unfortunate, given the contribution he had made. In many senses I know that that was retribution for certain actions he took out of a determination to achieve the wider good of the Australian Labor Party. In many senses, that will stand for a long time as a dark mark against my own party, but we move on from that. He will be much more remembered for the wonderful things he did for the party and the wonderful things he did for his wider community, and we will miss him dearly. bers to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places.
